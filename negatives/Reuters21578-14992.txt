Foreign investment in Malaysia in
1986 rose to 524.5 mln ringgit, the highest since 1971, from
324.9 mln in 1985, the Malaysian Industrial Development
Authority, MIDA, said.
    MIDA director-general N. Sadasivan said the increase was
due to large investment from the Netherlands in a 180.3 mln
ringgit petrochemical project in Bintulu, national news agency
Bernama reported.
