President Reagan is expected to tell
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the U.S. May be
able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June,
the New York Times said.
    The newspaper, quoting administration officials, said that
under such a scenario the President would announce just before
the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped
to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of
the month. Japan, for its part, would have to show that it had
stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in
Japan for U.S. Chip producers.
    The U.S. Administration imposed 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln
dlrs worth of Japanese color television sets, motorised tools
and personal computers on April 17.
    Japanese officials have said Nakasone's main demand when he
arrives for talks with Reagan on Wednesday would be the
immediate lifting of the tariffs.
    But with Congress planning further trade reprisals against
Japanese trade policies, the end-of-June timeframe is seen as
the best Reagan can offer, the Times said. It said some verbal
formulation was expected to be found in a communique that would
allow Nakasone to claim at least a modest victory.
