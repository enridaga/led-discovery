Ford Motor Co said it is
recalling about 33,600 of its 1987-model year Ford Crown
Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car vehicles
equipped with 5.0 -liter engines.
    It said the vehicles may have been produced with some
improperly manufactured sterring linkage components that could
fracture, causing reduced steering control.
    Ford said it was unaware of any accidents or injuries
caused by the conditions prompting the recall.
    It said of the affected vehicles, about 32,000 are in the
United States, 1,200 in Canada and 400 in export locations.
