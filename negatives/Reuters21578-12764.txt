Live Hog futures ran up for sharp gains
after midsession before slipping late to close 0.82 cent higher
to 0.02 lower. Only February posted a loss while April and June
paced the gain and April ended at 50.65 cents.
    Futures ran up early as demand prompted by strong live
markets, light hog runs and the discount of futures to cash
sparked technical buying. April ran up as much as 1.42 cents
above its previous level before profit-taking developed,
traders said.
    Gains in cash hogs reflected reduced farmer marketings as 
they took to the fields for the start of spring activities. The
strength in live also offset a sharp break in cash ham prices.
The break in hams was expected as Easter buying came to an end,
they added.
