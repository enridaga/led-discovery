The New Zealand government's sale of
a 25 pct stake in Air New Zealand would release the airline
from the shackles of burdensome government processes, managing
director Norman Geary told reporters.
    Civil Aviation minister Richard Prebble said today the
government would sell 25 pct of the airline to the public.
    Geary said the company had proposed the sale in 1984.
    "With our company we believe there will be considerable New
Zealand interest (in the shares) and we would hope for a strong
private interest," he said.
    Geary said he was keen to see a large staff shareholding.
