Taiwan's target for sugar production in
the 1987/88 season (November/May) has been set at 600,000
tonnes, up from the 479,200 tonnes harvested in 1986/87, a
spokesman for the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp told Reuters.
    He said the increase was to meet rising local consumption,
estimated at about 500,000 tonnes in calendar 1988 against
470,000 tonnes in 1987. Taiwan would have a surplus for export
of about 100,000 tonnes in 1988, he said.
    In 1987 Taiwan would have no exportable sugar for the first
time in 40 years because of typhoon damage to more than 6,000
hectares of canefield in 1986, he said.
