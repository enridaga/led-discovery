Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken
said it will set up a joint venture in London with U.S.
brokerage firm Equitable Securities Corp of Nashville, Tenn.,
for the sale of U.S. equities in Europe.
    S-E Bank's managing director Jacob Palmstierna told a press
briefing that the joint venture, called Equitable Enskilda
Securities Ltd, will be established next month.
    S-E Bank bought a 4.9 pct stake in Equitable Securities
about two weeks ago. Equitable's role in the joint venture will
include provision of research on firms in the south-east United
States.
