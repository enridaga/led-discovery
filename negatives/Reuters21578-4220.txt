Motorola Inc expects continued
steady improvement in semiconductor orders for the rest of the
year, Executive Vice President and Chief Corporate Staff
Officer Gary Tooker told security analysts.
    He said the company's semiconductor products sector showed
a nine pct increase in sales last year to 1.88 billion dlrs and
expects growth this year to range between 11 and 13 pct.
    Semiconductor products accounted for 31 pct of Motorola's
1986 net sales of 5.89 billion dlrs.
    Tooker said Motorola has shipped about 300,000 of its
32-bit 68020 microprocessor to 200 customers. Apple Computer
Inc recently announced it is using the 68020 in its new Mac II
personal computer.
