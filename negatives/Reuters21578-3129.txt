The need to eliminate "inefficiencies
and redundancies" was behind the decision to dismiss more than
200 employees at CBS News, according to a memo from Laurence
Tisch, chief executive officer of CBS Inc.
    CBS made public the memo to employes in which Tisch sought
to re-assure news employes that news divison will have the
resources to "serve the needs of the public" in the future.
    Tisch said he accepted recommendations of the management of
CBS News that 10 pct of the work force be trimmmed. "It was not
an assignment that anyone relished or that I enjoyed giving
them," he said.
