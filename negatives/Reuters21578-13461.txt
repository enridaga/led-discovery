President Reagan has agreed to let
the House and Senate select committees investigating the Iran
arms sale review his personal diary notes on the affair,
committee members said today.
    The notes will cover the period from January 1, 1984 to 
December 19, 1986 when the Iran arms deal was planned and
carried out and will include notes on Iran, Nicaragua and
related subjects, House committee chairman Lee Hamilton said.
    The notes will be selected by the White House counsel and
reviewed by Reagan before they are made available to committee
members within a few weeks.
    Under terms of the agreement, committee members will be
allowed to review the notes at the White House, but will not be
permitted to make copies of the information.
