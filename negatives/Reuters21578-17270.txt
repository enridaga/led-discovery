Former U.S. Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger said the U.S. Government is disregarding the
future of its economy and could within three to five years "find
itself on a situation similar to those of indebted Latin
American countries."
    "The United States will not be able to service its debt
without austerity," he told a news conference.
    The former secretary also criticised his country's foreign
policy.
    "We have so many problems of our own at home that we should
not be sending people like me and many others around the world
to tell other countries how to handle their problems."
    Kissinger came to Brazil on a private visit to make the
opening speech at the Sixth World Congress of the International
Federation of Purchasing and Materials Management, to be held
here June 24 through 26.
    During his visit he is to call on President Jose Sarney,
Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu Sodre, Finance Minister Luiz
Carlos Bresser Pereira and Chamber of Deputies chairman Ulysses
Guimaraes, Monday in Brasilia.
    Asked to comment on the economic measures imposed by the
Brazilian government last week, which included a new price
freeze up to 90 days, Kissinger said: "I have only read a
summary of the plan. In principle, it seems like a reasonable
plan which could succeed and lead to an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund."
