Borrowing on the international capital
markets contracted significantly in March with 23.1 billion
dlrs of medium and long-term funds raised, down 3.4 billion
from February and about nine billion dlrs less than in March
1986, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
said in its latest monthly report.
    Borrowing on external bond markets totalled 19.7 billion
dlrs, some 1.1 billion below the February figure.
    The market for floating rate notes saw further setbacks and
the volume of new offerings fell to only 800 mln dlrs from 1.4
billion in February.
