Chase Manhattan Corp said it
introduced the Market Index Investment, a new deposit account
that allows investors to take advantage of stock market gains
without risk of principal loss.
    Chase said the account offers the option of guaranteed
interest rate, carries no commissions or fees, and is fully
insured to 100,000 dlrs by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
    Interest earned on the Market Index Investment is based on
any percentage increase in the Standard and Poor's index from
the day the account begins to the day it matures, Chase said.
    Customers can select terms of three, six, nine of 12
months. The minimum deposit is 1,000 dlrs, it added.
