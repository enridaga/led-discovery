Tennessee Senator Albert Gore,
seeking to become the youngest president in U.S. history,
entered the 1988 presidential race today with a pledge to
return respect for the law and common sense to the White House.
    Gore, a four-term member of the House of Representatives
and a Senator since 1985, became the sixth official entrant in
the race for the Democratic nomination.
    Public opinion polls show him running near the bottom
against the other declared candidates.
