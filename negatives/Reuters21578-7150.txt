U.K. Minister for Aviation Michael
Spicer said transatlantic traffic should increase at least five
pct this year, after dropping nearly six pct last year.
    "We expect at least a five pct increase and it may exceed
that, reaching at least the peak levels of 1985," Spicer said
at a press conference.
    The figures refer to air traffic between North America and
Europe.
    Spicer also said transport ministers of the European
Community meeting next week are expected to agree on
liberalizing air traffic regulations in Europe.
    Spicer said fears of terrorism dissuaded Americans from
traveling to Europe last year, resulting in pent up demand that
will be released this year.
    He said the ministers, scheduled to meet in Brussels Monday
and Tuesday, should agree on allowing more than one airline to
fly particular routes between European cities, removing some
fare restrictions and easing capacity restrictions.
    Spicer also said he has asked U.S. officials to consider
allowing investment in U.S. carriers, particularly in smaller
commuter airlines, by foreign companies. He also wants U.S.
officials to allow British carriers to fly more freely between
U.S. destinations.
