Rowntree Mackintosh Plc is seeking a 200
mln stg, five year multiple option facility, of which 150 mln
stg will be committed, and a 200 mln stg commercial paper
program, County Natwest Capital Markets Ltd said as arranger.
    The facility includes options for sterling acceptances,
multi-currency advances, sterling and dollar notes via tender
panels and there is also a sterling swingline.
    The committed portion carries a facility fee of five basis
points and a margin of ten.  A 2-1/2 basis point utilisation
fee is payable on drawings of more than half the committed
portion.
    The 200 mln stg commercial paper program will include a
dollar option, County Natwest said.
    A County Natwest official said the facility, launched
earlier this week, seemed to be progressing well in
syndication.
