Communist rebels killed 18 soldiers on
Mindanao island in the southern Philippines, the army said.
    Military officials said about 70 soldiers on foot patrol
were attacked by guerrillas on the border area around Misamis
Occidental and Davao del Sur provinces.
    The state-run Philippine News Agency said at least 18
rebels died in the clash, but the military officials could not
confirm the report.
    On Tuesday, 19 soldiers were killed in Quezon province in
the northern island of Luzon after land mines blew up an
armoured vehicle and a troop-carrying truck.
