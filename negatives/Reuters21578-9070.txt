Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> said it
had reached agreement with the London-based International Stock
Exchange on the distribution of two-way British domestic share
quotations from the Stock Exchange Automated Quotation System
(SEAQ) via the Reuter worldwide information network.
    The company said in a statement the agreement covered SEAQ
Level-2, which provides buy and sell price quotations from 31
individual market makers in domestic U.K. Equities.
    Reuters said it will begin carrying the quotes for all 101
Alpha stocks, leading U.K. Shares, within the next few weeks.
    The SEAQ investor service, which displays indications of
market prices for U.K. Shares without identifying market
makers, has been available on the Reuter network since the "Big
Bang" deregulation of the London stock market last October.
    The SEAQ level-2 service will be available on one-month
trial to subscribers to the Reuter International Equities
Service and to the Reuter U.K. Investment Service, prior to the
imposition of Stock Exchange fees, the company said.
