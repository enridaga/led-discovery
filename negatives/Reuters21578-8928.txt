Austria is making a two billion
schilling issue of floating rate treasury notes carrying
interest of 1/8th of a point over the three-month Vienna
Interbank Offered Rate (VIBOR), lead manager Oesterreichische
Laenderbank AG [OLBV.VI] said.
    The issue, to be made at par, carries a placing fee of 20
basis points and will be listed in Vienna, a Laenderbank
official told Reuters.
    The issue will have an initial three-year life and the
issuer has the right to make two three-year extensions and a
further one-year extension to 1997.
    Payment and closing date is April 23 and redemption will be
on the same date at the end of each of the periods.
    The notes, in one mln schilling denominations, may not be
offered in Austria, Britain or the United States.
