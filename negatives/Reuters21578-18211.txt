McDonnell Douglas said
it signed a technical assistance agreement with the China Great
Wall Industries Co for possible use of its Payload Assist
Module on the Chinese Long March series of rockets.
    The company said the pact will serve as the basis for all
future proposals involving the use of the Payload Assist Module
in China.
    "This agreement opens the door for us to proceed with
proposals to the Chinese government or with spacecraft
customers planning to use the Long March," said Daniel Green,
the company's vice president of marketing.
