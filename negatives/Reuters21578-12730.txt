House Democratic leader Thomas Foley
said he thought the House would approve a budget resolution
calling for 22 billion dlrs of new revenues including 18
billion dlrs of new taxes.
    "I think we will have enough votes to pass the budget
resolution and implement it," Foley told reporters.
    Asked why he thought a majority of the House was willing to
support higher taxes, Foley said, "The deficit problem has
become more apparent." President Reagan has said he will veto
any legislation raising taxes. The House is expected to act on
the budget resolution this week.
