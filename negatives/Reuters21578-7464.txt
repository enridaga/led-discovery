A moderate earthquake measuring 5.5 on
the Richter scale shook southwestern Japan but caused no
injuries or damage, police said.
    The tremor, recorded at 1358 local time (0458), had its
epicentre about 50 km offshore from the city of Miyazaki on the
western Japanese island of Kyushu, they said.
    It affected almost the same area as last Wednesday's strong
earthquake which killed two people and injured at least three,
they said.
