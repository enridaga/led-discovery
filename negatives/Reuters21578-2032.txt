Tokheim Corp said its advanced
products and electronics division has reached a four-year
manufacturing and marketing agreement with &lt;TechVend>, a New
Jersey-based corporation which had developed a credit card
activated video cassette rental machine.
    Tokheim said the agreement gives it exclusive manufacturing
and servicing rights for all TechVend machines, as well as
exclusive marketing rights for convenience stores and other
petroleum market-related installations.
    The company said the vending machines are a springboard
into the video cassette rental industry.
