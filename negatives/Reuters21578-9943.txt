Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
may downgrade 2.2 billion crowns of debt of &lt;Gotabanken> and
its unit, Gotabanken Inc.
    The rating agency cited concerns over the company's asset
quality. Gotabanken was Sweden's fourth-largest commercial bank
in 1985 based on consolidated assets of 45.4 billion crowns.
    Under review for possible downgrade are Gotabanken's
Prime-1 short-term deposits and the unit's same-rated
commercial paper.
