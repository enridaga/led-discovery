Rapitech Systems Inc said it has
entered into an agreement under which its FORTRIX-C software is
available to Hewlett-Packard Co's salesforce for assisting
customers the migration of applications software from one
operating environment to another.
    The company also said FORTRIX-C has been selected by
American Telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;T> for use in its Vendor
Involvement Program.  It said it cannot forecast the impact on
its profits because neither agreement contains purchase
requirements.
    It said it expects continued losses through the rest of
fiscal 1987 ending July 31.
    The company lost 548,000 dlrs last year. Today it reported
a nine month loss of 810,000 dlrs compared with a 394,000 dlr
loss a year earlier and attributed the poorer performance to
substantially increased marketing, sales and research
expenditures partly resulting from the hiring of additional
staff.
    Rapitech further said it has signed agreements for Computer
Systems and Consultants BV of the Netherlands and Sages Group
of France to represent the Rapitech Conversionware product line
in the Benelux countries, in France and in French-speaking
cantons of Switzerland.
