Rorer Group Inc's Armour
Pharmaceutical Co said it received Food and Drug Administration
approval for a blood clotting drug for hemophiliacs.
    The company said the drug, monoclate antihemophilic factor,
will treat hemophilia A, the most common form of hereditary
blood clotting disorder.
    Monoclate is 99 pct free of unwanted contaminants, compared
to other blood products which are less than one pct pure,
Armour said.
