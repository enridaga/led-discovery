Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HK>
has won a two-year license from the Hong Kong government to
operate scheduled flights to Toronto, a Cathay spokesman said.
    He told Reuters the airline had sought a five-year right to
add Toronto to its existing license to serve the United States
and Canada.
    "We're pleased," the spokesman said. "It's important because
Toronto has a large ethnic Chinese commmunity and there's a
growing amount of travel."
    Canadian and British authorities must agree on air service
rights before Cathay can begin service to toronto.
    Cathay Pacific is controlled by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.

    Hongkong Dragon Airlines Ltd, a fledgling locally  based
airline, had opposed the move, saying that Cathay should wait
until its license for its U.S. And Canadian routes expires in
February next year.
    A hearing started today and continues tomorrow. An
application by Dragonair is to start flights to Malaysian
cities including Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu. Cathay is
opposing Dragonair's request.
