Cabot Medical Corp said it has
introduced a new high flow insufflator for laparoscopy, a
minimally invasive form of adominal surgey.
    The company said the KLI high-Flow Insufflator has features
and capabilities which were previously available only in
insuffulators costing three to four times as much. Labaroscopy
procedures, especially involving lasers, have grown in
popularity, it pointed out.
