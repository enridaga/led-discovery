American Telephone and
Telegraph Co said it will offer a special team of
representatives to help hearing-impaired persons use
telecommunications services.
    The team will work through the company's National Special
Needs Center, which offers various products that enable
hearing-, motion-, speech- and vision-impaired persons to use
telecommunications devices such as a keyboard to talk and paper
or video printouts to listen.
