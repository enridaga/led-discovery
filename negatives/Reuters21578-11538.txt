Denmark's net official reserves rose
to 49.49 billion crowns in March from 36.34 billion in
February, against 43.13 billion in March 1986, the central bank
said in its monthly balance sheet report.
    Total net reserves, including reserves held by commercial
and major savings banks and corrected for exchange rate
adjustments, rose to 45.263 billion crowns from 37.26 billion
in February, compared with 35.31 billion in March 1986.
    "The increase must be seen against the background of a
considerable inflow of foreign exchange after the outflow up to
the EMS realignment in January," the bank said in a statement.
