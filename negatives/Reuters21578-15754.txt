The French Treasury will issue between
eight and 10 billion francs worth of tap stock, depending on
market conditions, at its next monthly tender on Thursday, the
French bond issuing committee said.
    The planned issue will be of two fixed-rate tranches of the
8.50 pct May 1994 and the 8.50 pct December 2012 stock and one
tranche of the 12-year variable rate 1999 stock.
    At its last tender on May 7, the Bank of France sold 8.2
billion francs of tap stock.
