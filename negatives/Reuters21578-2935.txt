Disposable income available to people
employed in European Community agriculture rose 0.9 pct in 1986
after an 8.8 pct fall the previous year, the EC statistics
agency Eurostat said in a report.
    It said income available to farm holders and members of
their family working on the holding rose 2.5 pct after a 13.9
pct fall in 1985.
    Eurostat said the reason for the increases was higher
production, with a 1.6 pct increase in crop output and a 0.7
pct rise in animal products compared with 1985.
    However, Eurostat added a 1.6 pct fall in prices for animal
products was more than offset by a 3.1 pct increase in those
for crops.
    It said income changes varied widely across the EC in 1986.
Disposable income of all those employed in agriculture rose
12.9 pct in West Germany but fell 7.8 pct in Denmark, while
income available to holders and their families rose 17.0 pct in
Britain but fell 9.7 pct in Ireland.
