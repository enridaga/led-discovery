Stewart Information Services Inc said a
Riverside, Calif., jury has awarded 2,295,000 dlrs in punitive
damages against its Stewart Title Guaranty Co subsidiary in
connection with a 37,000 dlr title insurance policy.
    The company said it has filed a motion with the trail court
judge to reduce the amount of damages, eliminate the punitive
damage award or grant a new trial, and it intends to appeal if
the motion is denied.  It said it expects a substantial
reduction in the award.
