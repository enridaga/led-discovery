Economy Undersecretary Yannos Papantoniou
said the Greek economy was responding well to a two-year
government austerity program.
    He told reporters the evidence for this was in last year's
figures, which showed a drop in inflation from 25 pct to 16.9
and a reduction in the current account deficit from 3.3 billion
dlrs to 1.7 billion.
    Papantoniou said indications were encouraging that a target
of 1O pct inflation and a deficit of 1.25 billion dlrs would be
reached by the end of 1987.
