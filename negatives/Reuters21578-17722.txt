Negotiations resumed in the 14-day-old
strike by Canada's letter carriers and picket line violence
subsided after the federal government changed its mind and
appointed a mediator.
    The talks between the 20,000-member Letter Carriers Union
of Canada and government-owned Canada Post were the first since
Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux announced the appointment of a
mediator yesterday.
   
    There had been little progress between the parties last
week and both sides requested a mediator for the second time.
Cadieux originally said the two sides were too far apart to
warrant the help on an independent third party.
    Although the postal union said it would maintain its
strategy of selected rotating strikes across the country, only
the Montreal area was affected today and service was normal
elsewhere in Canada.
   
    Canada Post stuck by its promise to halt the use of
replacement workers for at least seven days if a mediator was
appointed and there were no reports of picket line violence.
    Canada Post, under government orders to eliminate a $160
million (U.S.) deficit by next year, has taken a tough stand in
the talks and the two sides remain far apart on wages and
working conditions.
