Mobil Corp said its plans to erect a
72-story office building in downtown Chicago at the site once
occupied by a Montgomery Ward department store have been
postponed.
    A spokesman for Dearborn Land Co, a unit of Mobil Land
Development Corp, said the current office market in the area is
overbuilt.
