Sterling Drug Inc said it submitted a
new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration for
permission to market an oral form of Corotrope (milrinone), a
drug for treating chronic congestive heart failure.
    Sterling said the application includes a series of studies
of 952 patients and results of three multicenter studies
involving another 571 patients, to demonstrate the efficacy and
safety of the drug as an alternative to digitalis.
