Ashford Financial Group said it will
create its first master limited partnership in the third
quarter.
    The company said the move will allow small investors to
participate in the early-stage financing of its new client
companies.
    The company said investors will also find they have more
liquidity than in traditional limited partnership investments.
    Ashford Financial specializes in providing financial
backing to small companies with the potential for high earnings
growth and to go public in less than three years.
