Taiwan announced plans for another round
of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
help balance trade with the United States.
    Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
Customs Administration Department, on Saturday told reporters
the list of products included 60 items asked by Washington.
    He said the ministry sent a proposal to the cabinet that
the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles, apples,
radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut by
between five and 50 pct.
    The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
on April 20, he added.
