Lotus Development Corp said it
reduced the suggested retail price of its 1-2-3 Report Writer
software package to 95 dlrs from 150 dlrs.
    The company said it also removed copy protection from the
program, which is used to generate customized reports and forms
from data base files.
    Lotus said the steps bring 1-2-3 Report Writer in line with
other programs based on the 1-2-3 package.
