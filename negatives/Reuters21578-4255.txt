The U.S. Has given further details
of an action program announced yesterday aimed at helping
sub-Saharan Africa overcome hunger and economic problems,
senior U.S. Offficials said.
    Under the new program, a 500-mln dlr Development Fund for
Africa will be set up to consolidate most of the aid money
going to the continent to replace the large number of bilateral
accounts currently in existence.
    Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for Africa,
said he believed Congress will favour the program, which stems
from a U.N. Conference on Africa's economic problems.
    The 500-mln dlr fund, coupled with an additional 100 mln
dlrs in food aid, would surpass Congress' 1986 vote of 483 mln
dlrs for equivalent programs, officials said.
    Washington is also increasing its funding to the
International Development Agency (IDA), the World Bank's soft
loan affiliate, and is seeking a greater share of a bigger fund
for Africa, they said.
    Officials said under the last IDA replenishment Africa got
37 pct of 8.7 billion dlrs, but the Reagan administration wants
this increased to 45-50 pct of 12.8 billion dlrs in new funds.
