Prime Computer Inc said it
introduced an interactive three dimensional graphics
workstation.
    Prime said it is its first offering in a new
engineering/scientific product line and employs Prime's
implementation of ATT's &lt;T> UNIX System V.3 operating system, a
program that controls the computer.
    Prime said the new product delivers up to twice the
performance of the IRIS 3120 series, considered the industry's
leading 3-D graphics workstation, and is driven by five times
the performances of a VAX 11/780 system.
    Shipment is scheduled for June, 1987, and the product's
standard configuration is priced at 74,900 dls with a monthly
maintenance fee of 492 dlrs, Prime said.
