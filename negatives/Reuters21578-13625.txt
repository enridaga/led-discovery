Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc said
sales for the five weeks ended April Four were up 7.8 pct to
314.0 mln dlrs from 291.3 mln dlrs a year earlier, with
same-store sales up 5.5 pct.
    The company said sales for the first two months of its
fiscal year were up 7.7 pct to 554.7 mln dlrs from 515.1 mln
dlrs a year earlier, with same-store sales up 5.6 pct.
    Carter Hawley said sales were helped by shifting some
promotions to March from April to compensate for the later
Easter this year.
