Dominion Resources Inc said it
has reahced an understanding under which the National Coal
Association would withdraw its opposition to the company's
petition for exemptions from the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel
Use Act of 1978.
    The company needs the exemptions from the U.S. Department
of Energy to allow it to build the combined cycle generating
units Chesterfield 7 and 8.  Chesterfield 7, a 210 megawatt
unit planned for service in June 1990 at a cost of about 130
mln dlrs, would initially burn natural gas. Companion unit
Chesterfield 8 would be built by June 1992.
    Dominion said the coal group withdrew its opposition to the
plants after Dominion said it would be willing to pursue
installation of a coal gasifier for Chesterfield under proper
economic conditions, so that the units could burn coal gas.
