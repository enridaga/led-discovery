BankAmerica Corp said it named
Richard Rosenberg as vice chairman and head of a newly
designated California Banking Group.
    Rosenberg had been president and chief operating officer of
BankAmerica's Seafirst Corp. Seafirst Chairman Richard Cooley
will resume the additional duties of president.
    Rosenberg will report directly to BankAmerica Chairman A.W.
Clausen. He will be responsible for BankAmerica's California
banking activities and will serve on the bank's Managing
Committee and on its Money and Loan Policy Committee.
    BankAmerica said the creation of the California Banking
Group is a refinement of what had been called the Retail Bank
and is intended to improve the development and delivery of
services and products in California.
    BankAmerica President and Chief Operating Officer Thomas
Cooper had been acting as head of California Operations
previously.
    BankAmerica said Cooper will continue to lead its
aggressive cost reduction and operating improvements program.
    Before joining Seafirst, Rosenberg had been vice chairman
of Crocker National bank and before that of Wells Fargo Bank.
