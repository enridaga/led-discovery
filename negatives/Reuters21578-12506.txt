Unisys Corp said it is offering eight
new models of its A15 large-scale mainframe computer.
    The new models improve the overall system performance by an
average 20 pct, the computer maker said.
    Memory capacity on four of the models is doubled, and is
increased by 50 pct on the A12 mainframe.
    Unisys said prices for the new models range from 2.9 mln
dlrs for the single processor A-15FX to 8.4 mln dlrs for an
A-15NX, which has four processors.
    The new computer systems, which encorporate the "Master
Control Program/Advanced Systems" operating system, will
compete with other large mainframes, including International
Business Machines Corp's &lt;IBM> IBM 3090, Unisys said.
    Unisys' A-12 computer is a less powerful, smaller version
of the A-15.
    The A-12 is a "lower-end model, almost an entry-level
machine," said a Unisys spokesman.
    The price of the machine starts at 1.4 mln dlrs.
