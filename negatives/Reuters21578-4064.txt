British Telecommunications PLC's
Dialcom unit said it will begin next month to sell a software
package that allows computers made by different manufacturers
to send and receive electronic-mail messages.
    The software, which is based on the X.400 international
standard recommendation, will be marketed internationally,
Dialcom said.
    In addition, the company said Data General Corp &lt;DGN>
agreed to conduct engineering tests of the software in the
United States. Data General is a strong proponent of the X.400
standard.
