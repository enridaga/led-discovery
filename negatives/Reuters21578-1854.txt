Sterivet Laboratories Ltd said it is
proceeding with development of a new drug to treat navicular
disease in horses.
    The company said it received an unspecified financial
contribution from the National Research Council of Canada to
help develop the drug for treating navicular disease, which
affects horses' feet.
    Sterivet said the drug has produced promising results in
limited clinical trials conducted over the past 18 months in
Ontario.
