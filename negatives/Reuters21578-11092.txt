General Hydrocarbons Inc said
claims aggregating over one mln dlrs related to liens and
alleging title deficiencies have been made against the escrow
fund holding its assets for distribution.
    It said the record date for the distribution will be
delayed until the claims are resolved.
    The company said it believes many of the claims are
overstated or without merit. It said the resolution may not
occur before April 30.
    General Hydrocarbons' assets now consist of cash and
Montana Power Co &lt;MTP> shares.
