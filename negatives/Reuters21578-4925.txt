Hanns Christian Schroeder-Hohenwarth,
President of the West German Federation of Banks, said that as
far as he knew no member bank of the Federation was involved in
activities which led to currency losses of some 480 mln marks
for Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW.

to the losses.
    The Federation of Banks includes all the major West German
commercial banks. Schroeder-Hohenwarth was speaking at a news
