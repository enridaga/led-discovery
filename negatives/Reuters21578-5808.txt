Bristol-Myers Co said scientists at
its Genetic Systems unit, which markets a blood screening test
for AIDS, have created an AIDS vaccine which produced
antibodies to the AIDS virus in mice and monkeys.
    The report said the vaccine will be tested in humans, but
company officials were not immediately available to comment on
when the tests would begin.
    The report said the vaccine consists of smallpox virus
remodeled to carry a key gene found on the AIDS virus, creating
a hybrid virus that simultaneously immunizes against smallpox
and the AIDS virus proteins.
