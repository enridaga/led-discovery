Holiday Corp said the New Jersey
Casino Control Commission will rule April One on the company's
request for approval to proceed with its plan of
recapitalization.
    The Commission ruling is the final regulatory approval
needed.  The company said talks are proceeding smoothly with
its banks, and it plans to finalize the financing for the
recapitalization shortly.  It said assuming Commission
approval, it plans to pay the 65 dlr per share dividend
associated with the plan in April, with the exact timing
depending on the closing of the financing.
