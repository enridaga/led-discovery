Belgrade trade union leaders have
joined attacks on a controversial wage freeze in Yugoslavia.
    Miodrag Lazarevic, president of the Belgrade trade unions
council, said last night the government would be responsible
for the effects of the law imposing the wage freeze. The law,
enacted February 27 and remaining in force until July 1,
reimposed wage levels of the last quarter of 1986. Future pay
raises were pegged to productivity. The move triggered
resentment and widespread industrial unrest.
    Another Belgrade trade union council leader, Predrag
Petrovic, was quoted as saying hundreds of workers had been on
strike in Belgrade. The government has officially reported 70
strikes throughout the country, although Yugoslav newspapers
have hinted at more.
