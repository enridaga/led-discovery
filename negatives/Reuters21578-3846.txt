Britain's ruling Conservatives have
moved into a six-point lead over the main opposition Labour
Party, a Marplan poll published in today's Guardian newspaper
reports.
    The Conservatives are shown with a 38 pct share of the vote
against 32 pct for Labour and 27 pct for the centrist
Social-Democratic/Liberal Alliance.
    Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has until June, 1988 to
call a general election, but most political analysts expect her
to go to the country some time this year.
