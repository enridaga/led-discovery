Duke Power Co said it began its
licensing process for a new hydroelectric power plant on Coley
Creek, near the towns of Cashiers, N.C., and Salem, S.C.
    Duke said it will decide whether to pursue the project once
the licensing process is completed.
    In order to be producing electricity by the turn of the
century, the company said, it needed to start the four to six
year licensing process now.
    If the site is developed to its full potential of 2,100
megawatts, its cost will be slightly greater than three billion
dlrs, including projected effects of inflation.
