An extension of the International Tin
Agreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed
to lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told
reporters.
    Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of
the International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto said
Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look
into how to replace the pact.
    But he said that given the present disagreement between
producers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-up
to the ITA.
    Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension
of the ITA, he said, "No one will propose that. It's also
unrealistic to do so."
    Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the
seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to
introduce a quota system which limited their exports and
consumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1.
    Indonesia's quota was set at 24,516 tonnes.
