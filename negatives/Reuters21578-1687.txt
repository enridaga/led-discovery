Syntex Corp said its
diagnostics subsidiary has introduced a rapid, antibody-based
test to diagnose strep throat infections, called AccuPoint (T)
Group H Strep Test.
    A Syntex spokesman said the test has received Food and Drug
Administration approval and is now available nationwide for use
in hospitals, doctors offices and laboratories.
    The company said it is the first of ten diagnostic tests
being developed for Syntex by Murex Corp. Others include
detection of pregnancy, ovulation and sexually transmitted
diseases.
