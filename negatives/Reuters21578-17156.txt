The World Bank said it approved four
loans to Jamaica totalling 104 mln dlrs to assist that country
with an economic structural adjustment program, a sugar
industry rehabilitation scheme and a population and health
project.
    The bank said two loans will support Jamaica's structural
adjustment program -- a 40 mln dlr loan for trade and financial
sector adjustment and a 20 mln dlr loan for the public
enterprise sector.
    The 40 mln dlr loan is designed to raise the performance of
exports and industry and strengthen the financial sector.
