West Germany and Bolivia signed two
cooperation treaties today expected to nearly double the amount
of overall aid the south american country receives from its
european trade partner, german officials said.
    Paul Resch, economic attache for the west german embassy,
told reuters that Germany had become the biggest european
community lender to bolivia.
    West german aid to Bolivia last year totalled 50 mln marks
and officials travelling with President Richard Von Weizsaecker
said overall aid to Bolivia is expected to reach 91 mln marks
this year.
    Weizsaecker is expected to announce the figure in a major
speech later today at the bolivian congress, the officials
said.
