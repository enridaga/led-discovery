Hitech Engineering Co said it won
litigation brought against it by Coldwell Banker Commercial
Services Group, a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co &lt;S>.
    In the lawsuit, tried in U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia, Coldwell had claimed that Hitech
improperly canceled a lease for additional office space and
sought damages of 350,000 dlrs.
    The company said the plaintiff has the right to appeal but
that no appeal has been filed to date. Hitech's legal counsel
is confident that the verdict will not be overturned, it added.
