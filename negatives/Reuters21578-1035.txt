A number of computer companies said they
formed Network Computing Forum, an industry group focusing on
ways to tie computers, workstations and networks together.
    The participants include Apollo Computer Inc &lt;APCI>,
Alliant Computer Systems Corp &lt;ALNT>, Apple Computer Inc
&lt;AAPL>, Concurrent Computer Inc &lt;CCUR>, and a number of other
companies.
    The Forum said its aim was to adopt protocols, services and
architectures that support integrated network computing. It
also hopes to promote industry standards. The first meeting of
the group is set for the Spring 1987.
