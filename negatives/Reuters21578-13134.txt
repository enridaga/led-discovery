West Germany should take steps to increase
its official development assistance, the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    A report by the organisation's Development Assistance
Committee (DAC) said German aid levels had shown only a
moderate increase in real terms in recent years, adding that
there was a risk that growth over the next few years might slow
further.
    German aid, estimated at around four billion dlrs in 1986,
represents 0.46 pct of the country's GNP. This is above the
DAC's average of 0.36 pct, but might decline if corrective
measures were not taken, the report said.
