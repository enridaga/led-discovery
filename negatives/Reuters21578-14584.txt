Eurocapital Corp said its
&lt;Europharmaceutical Corp> affiliate has submitted four
applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
approval to market in the U.S. three condom products to be made
by &lt;Inkey SA> of Barcelona.
    The company said one is for approval to market a condom
containing spermicide monoxynol-9, a second for the same condom
without the spermicide and the third and fourth for marketing
of a condom with a diffierent spermicide it did not identify
that is said is effective in reducing the risk of sexual
transmission of the AIDS virus.
    The company said  the approval process on the last two
applications may be lengthy.
    It also said it has increased its ownership of
Europharmaceutical to 51 pct from 45 pct.
    It said Europharmaceutical's obligation to pay Inkey for
exclusive distribution rights to all Inkey products has been
cut to 500,000 dlrs from two mln dlrs and payment has been
extended to 180 days after FDA approval to market any of the
condom products from 30 days.  It said Europharmaceutical is
now obligated to pay Inkey two cts for each condom distributed
and Inkey will ship to Europharmaceutical on open account.
