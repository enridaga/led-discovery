French media and publishing group Hachette
&lt;HACP.PA> expects a record 15 pct rise in its profits this
year, Hachette chairman Jean-Luc Lagardere said.
    Lagardere told a news conference that Hachette's profits
last year were 565.4 mln francs against 431.7 mln in 1985.

    He said that Hachette was carrying out feasibility studies
for the launching around October next year of a nationwide
daily newspaper. Earlier this year it made an unsuccessful
three billion franc bid for state-owned television network
TF-1.
    In a letter sent to shareholders, Lagardere said that 1987
was likely to be another record year for the company.
    Hachette owns the Europe-1 radio station, about 60 weekly
newspapers and magazines, and is also involved in printing.
    It posted a 14.7 billion franc consolidated turnover last
year against 11.6 billion in 1985.
