Newmont Gold Co said it filed a
registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for the proposed public offering of five mln shares
of common plus an over-allotment option of 500,000 shares.
    Newmont Gold said the newly registered shares would
represent about 5.2 pct of the 105 mln shares outstanding after
the share issue. It said it will use proceeds to repay the
long-term debt it owes to its parent, Newmont Mining Corp
&lt;NEM>, and for general corporate purposes.
    Newmont Mining will continue to own about 90 pct of Newmont
Gold after the offering.
    Newmont Gold said four mln shares will be offered initially
in the U.S. by a U.S. underwriting group and one mln shares
will be offered initially outside the U.S by an international
underwriting group.
    It said Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc, Lazard Freres and Co
and Salomon Brothers Inc and their affiliates will be
co-managers of both underwriting groups.
