Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and
his five-party coalition government have resigned, officials
said.
    A statement from the Quirinal presidential palace said head
of state Francesco Cossiga had reserved his decision on whether
to accept the resignation, normal procedure when a government
stands down.
    The statement said Cossiga had asked Craxi, who has been
prime minister for a post-war record of three-and-a-half years,
to continue to handle current government business.
