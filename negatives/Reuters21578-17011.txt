Budget Director James Miller said
President Reagan would veto the Democrat-controlled Congress'
new budget -- but offered to compromise on raising revenues.
    "If that budget comes down it will be vetoed out of hand, I
can tell you that," Miller said on NBC's "Today" program.
    He said Reagan would not accept the 19 billion dlr tax
increase in Congress' proposal but said "keep in mind the
president has proposed certain revenues in his budget.
    "They're not taxes," Miller said. "They are user charges and
asset sales. I think there is some room there we can sit down
and talk with the Democrats about."
