Ameribanc Inc is raising 15 mln dlrs
through an offering of convertible subordinated capital notes
due 1995 with an eight pct coupon and par pricing, said lead
manager Stifel, Nicolaus and Co Inc.
    The debentures are convertible into the company's common
stock at 18.75 dlrs per share, representing a premium of 27.1
pct over the stock price when terms on the debt were set.
    The issue is non-callable for two years. It was not rated
by Moody's Investors or Standard and Poor's at the time of the
pricing, Stifel said. Burns, Pauli and Co Inc co-managed the
deal.
