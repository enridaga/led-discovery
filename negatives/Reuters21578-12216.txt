Shares prices were mostly higher at the
oustset, bouyed by the latest opinion polls, one of which shows
the ruling Conservative party having a 13 point lead over the
Labour opposition party. Record closes on both the New york and
Tokyo stock exchanges supported market sentiment.
    Dealers expect the market to open around five to eight
points higher but then ease back should buying support fail to
emerge. The market appears fairly convinced of a Conservative
win in the next general election but is likely to be restrained
by uncertainty over its timing.
    Unilever rose 18p to 2,589 and British Telecom 2p to 254.
