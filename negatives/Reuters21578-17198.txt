Hills Department Stores Inc said it
has decided to amend the registration on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission covering its planned initial
offering.
    The company said it expects to offer three mln common
shares at a filing range of 11 to 12 dlrs a share along with a
40 mln dlr offering of convertible junior subordinated
debentures instead of the 6.9 mln common shares proposed in the
pending registration.
    Hills said it expects to file a registration statement on
the proposed changes within two weeks.
