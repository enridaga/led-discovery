The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in a
statement, said the phenomenal sell-off in the stock market is
very likely to have run its course.
    The chamber said "there is no justification for such a
dramatic downward correction."
    While conceding that there is some justifiable concern
about inflation, higher interest rates and a lower dollar,
these uncertainties have been overcompensated for over recent
weeks, the Chamber said.
