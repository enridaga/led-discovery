Bausch and Lomb Inc said it
began marketing a new product designed to lubricate and protect
the cornea of the eye for post-surgical and other patients.
    The company said the product, the Bio-Cor Fyodorov Collagen
Corneal Shield, will be manufactured and distributed through
its newly formed surgical products unit located in Clearwater,
Fla.
    The corneal shield was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in January, the company said.
