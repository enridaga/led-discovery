The U.K. Government said it would seek the
compulsory winding up of James Tennant Commodities Ltd on
grounds of public interest and that details would be heard in
the High Court on November 18.
    A Department of Trade and Industry spokesman said that
James Tennant was relatively small and that its activities had
concentrated on allowing investors to participate in pooled
trading schemes in commodity futures.
    No application had been made for the appointment of a
provisional liquidator in the case, he added.
