The balance sheet total of all
Luxembourg-based banks fell in January to 7,888 billion
luxembourg francs, a decline of 1.49 pct on the previous month,
the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois (IML) said.
    The IML, Luxembourg's monetary authority, said this was
partly due to the seasonal decline following the closure of
bank accounts in December and partly to the dollar's fall.
    But the end-January total represented a 5.10 pct rise on
end-January 1986, the IML said.
    The balance sheet total was also affected by currency
fluctuations, and allowing for this, the January total
represented a 0.3 pct rise on the previous month and a 13.6 pct
rise on January 1986, the IML said.
    There were 123 banks in Luxembourg at the end of January, a
rise of one on the month before and of five on January 1986,
the IML said.
