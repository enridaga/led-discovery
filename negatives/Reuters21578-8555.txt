President Reagan opposed new taxes
as he urged the Democratic controlled Congress to come up with
a budget that meets the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of 108
billion dlrs for fiscal 1988.
    He told reporters before meeting with House Republicans in
Congress that for six years he had proposed a "a sound, solid
budget" but alleged that Democrats had only come forth with a
so-called continuing resolution, a catch-all spending bill,
each year.
    Asked about taxes, he said "they're not going to get those
either."
    Reagan's appearance with Republicans coincided with a
dispute among House Budget Committee Democrats and Republicans.
Republicans have boycotted budget drafting sessions.
    "I'm still trying to get a budget that meets the
Gramm-Rudman target," Reagan said. "The Democrats have refused to
present a budget of their own."
    House Budget Committee Chairman William Gray told reporters
after Reagan's remarks that "They (Republicans) don't want to
participate. The President is up there bashing our brains while
Republicans won't give us a markup (drafting meeting). It's an
interesting combination."
