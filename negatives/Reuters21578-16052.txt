Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
of Kansas said Alan Greenspan would be a good replacement for
Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve Chairman.
    "While Paul Volcker's retirement is a real loss, this
country is very fortunate to have a man of Alan Greenspan's
caliber to take his place," Dole said in a statement.
    "Alan's knowledge of the economy, coupled with his
experience at the top levels of government, means that the
leadership of the Federal Reserve Board will be in good hands.
Alan, literally, has some big shoes to fill. But I haven't any
doubts he's more than equal to the task," Dole said.
