The EC Cereals Management Committee
agreed in Brussels today that 300,000 tonnes of U.K.
Intervention wheat would be made available for sale on the U.K.
Home market over the next three months, the Ministry of
Agriculture said.
    The committee agreed that 70,000 tonnes of wheat would be
made available on April 14 followed by a further 30,000 tonnes
later in the month.
    It also gave an assurance that a further 100,000 tonnes
would be allocated for both May and June, which would complete
the 300,000 tonnes originally requested by the U.K..
    The ministry said sales out of intervention for July and
August would be discussed later.
    Earlier, Paris trade sources said the EC Commission made
available a further 70,000 tonnes of British intervention feed
wheat for sale to the domestic market.
