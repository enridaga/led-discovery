European Community foreign ministers
agreed to formal talks on signing an economic pact with
Hungary, in a move which could clear the way towards
establishing EC diplomatic ties with Budapest, EC officials
said.
    They said Community foreign ministers agreed to mandate the
EC executive Commission to open talks on a cooperation pact
which would boost trade and economic ties with Hungary.
    Earlier this year, Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Jozsef
Marjai said Hungary might be willing to normalise relations
with the Community in exchange for such a deal, according to EC
officials. No date has been fixed for opening the talks.
