Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc said it
is not having any financial difficulties following the 508
point decline in the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
    The firm joined a long list of Wall Street securities
companies that have been rumored to be in financial straits
from losses caused in yesterday's selloff.
    Earlier today, the NYSE said there were no major membe
firms reporting any financial trouble. But, it said that H.B.
Shaine and Co Inc of Grand Rapids, Mich. could not continue to
do business.
