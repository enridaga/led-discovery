Cullinet Software Inc said it has
introduced Release 10.1 of Performance Monitor, an on-line
system that enables system programmers to analyze performance
information quicky.
    Cullinet said the Release 10.1 provides program analysis
functions for users of Cullinet's IDMS/R database software.
    The company said it also has enhanced the new system with a
"windowing" function that allows people to view several
resources concurrently.
    It added the new system is priced at 27,000 dlrs and will
be generally available later this month.
