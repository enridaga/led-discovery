Apollo Computer Inc said it introduced a
new family of computer workstations and improved the
performance and cut prices on some of its existing
workstations.
    In addition, the company announced new products that allow
personal computers to communicate with workstations.
   
    Apollo said its new workstation family, the Domain Series
4000 Personal Super Workstations, includes the first color
workstation priced under 19,000 dlrs that can process four
million instructions per second.
    Apollo said the Domain Series 4000 also features a 14,000
dlr monochrome workstation and a 13,000 dlr workstation server,
both of which can process four million instructions per second.
    Apollo said the new Domain Series 4000 models double the
performance of its existing Domain Series 3000 workstations and
provide performace equivalent to competing workstations at
half the price.
    "We are clearly telling users that Apollo is committed to
maintaining its price/performance leadership in the workstation
marketplace," said Thomas A. Vanderslice, Apollo's chief
executive officer.
    Apollo also said it will offer new color and monochrome
models for the Domain Series 3000, its entry-level workstation
family. It said it also cut some prices but did not specify.
