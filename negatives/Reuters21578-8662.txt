A British voter opinion poll in
tomorrow's Today newspaper shows a surge in support for the
centrist Alliance grouping and a fall for both the ruling
Conservatives and the Labour opposition party.
    The Marplan poll gives the Conservatives 36 pct, the
Liberal/Social Democratic Alliance 31 pct, and Labour 31 pct as
well. A Marplan survey last month gave the Tories 38 pct, the
Alliance 21 pct, and Labour 37 pct.
    The latest poll would, if translated into an election
result, produce a hung parliament, analysts said. That should
dampen speculation of an early June election, they added.
