A second U.S. Marine has been charged
with spying and a third arrested on suspicion of lying about
contacts with Soviet women in a growing scandal involving the
American Embassy in Moscow.
    The Pentagon made the announcements yesterday and the State
Department said U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William Brown had
been called home to supervise a security review of the embassy,
which is alleged to have been penetrated by Soviet KGB agents
helped by Marine guards.
    Brown is an ex-Marine who once was an economic officer at
the Moscow mission.
    Marine Cpl. Arnold Bracy, 21, was charged yesterday with
espionage, conspiracy and failure to follow lawful orders in a
case which U.S. officials have said involved sex with Soviet
women. Sgt. Clayton Lonetree, whose arrest triggered the
spy-sex scandal, has already been charged with espionage.
    Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims told reporters a third Marine,
Staff Sgt. Robert Stanley Stufflebeam, 24, who served in Moscow
between 1985 and 1986 at the same time as Lonetree and Bracy,
was being held on suspicion of lying to investigators about
contacts with foreign nationals.
    Stufflebeam, who was second in command of the embassy
guard, is suspected of failure to report all contacts with
foreigners and making false official statements in his
debriefing when he left the embassy.
