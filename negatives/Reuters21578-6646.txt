MCorp said it plans to convert 35 of its
62 member banks to branches during the next nine months.
    It said it expects the conversions, pending regulatory
approval of branching applications, will provide substantial
long-term benefits for its customers and shareholders.
    In connection with the conversions, MCorp said it also has
realigned its operating structure and named eight group
chairmen.
    It said the group chairmen, with its chairman and
president, will comprise its management committee.
