Callon Petroleum Co said its
auditors will qualify their opinion on 1986 financial
statements due to questions about Callon's ability to continue
as a going concern.
    The company said negotiations to restructure its debt and
allow for continued operations are proceeding.
    Today it reported a loss for 1986 of 4.20 dlrs per share,
compared with a year earlier loss of 4.71 dlrs.
