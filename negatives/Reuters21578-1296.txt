The American Stock Exchange (Amex),
which faces stiff competition from the New York Stock Exchange
and the over-the-counter market for listed companies, said it
is launching a 2 mln dlr advertising campaign.
    Amex will advertise on television for the first time, it
said. The campaign also includes print ads.
    "Our entry into television advertising reflects our optimism
for the future. We have proved ourselves a vigorous and
competitive marketplace and we are eager to communicate that
wherever and whenever we can," said Arthurt Levitt Jr., chairman
of the exchange, in a statement.
    The exchange said its advertising campaign, with the theme
"We Extend Your Reach,"  focuses on its role as a diversified
financial exchange trading both stocks and options.
    The television commercials will air on network, cable and
local television stations. The commercials will be broadcast
during March, May, September and November.
    The commercials, titled "The Options Pit," and "An Attractive
Investment," describe Amex's technology advances and
international ties. The print campaign consists of four ads
targeted to specific audiences: listed companies, individual
investors, institutional investors and brokers.
    The Amex currently has a two-way trading link with the
Toronto Exchange and has an agreement with the Europeaon
Options Exchange to trade XMI, the major market index of 20
blue-chip stocks, during European trading hours. The latter is
expected to begin by mid-1987.
