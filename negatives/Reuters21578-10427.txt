Pratt and Whitney, a unit
of United Technologies Corp, said a Swissair order for PW4000
turbofan engines could be worth more than 470 mln dlrs.
    Earlier, Swissair said it selected Pratt and Whitney's
PW4000 for its new fleet of McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD> MD-11
aircraft but gave no value for the engine order.
    Pratt and Whitney said the order could include up to 69
engines, including options and spares, and parts, making the
order potentially worth 470 mln dlrs.
    Swissair's order is for six MD-11 aircraft with an option
for another 12 planes.
    Pratt and Whitney said Swissair becomes the fifth major
carrier to select the PW4000.
    The new turbofan engine is scheduled to enter service this
summer with Pan American World Airways, a unit of Pan Am Corp
&lt;PN> and Singapore Airlines.
