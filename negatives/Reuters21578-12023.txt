Pacific Horizon Funds Inc said it will
place a sales charge on three of its six portfolios effective
April 20.
    The sales charge, which will not apply to investors who
were shareholders prior to that date, will be 4-1/2 pct on
investments less than 100,000 dlrs, and progressively less on
larger amounts.
    The funds affected are Pacific Horizon's Aggressive Growth,
its California Tax-Exempt Bond, and its High-Yield Bond.
