I  should  ever  play  as  well  as  Mr.  Handel.      ' If  I  did

Sir  Robert  Walpole  and  Mr.  Pulteney  are  very  »hot 
every  day  about  the  debts  of  the  nation,  and  nobody 
understands  them  but  themselves. I  shall  go  to  the 
opera  to-night  I  believe. I  have  sent  to  Lady  Sunderland 
to  know  if  she  has  any  room  in  her  box. To-morrow 
morning  an  opera  is  to  be  rehearsed ;  I  have  not  heard 
of  the  fame  of  it,  its  name  nor  author. The  last  is  a 
charming  piece  of  musick,  but  quite  neglected  for  the 
Beggars'  Opera."

apt  to  do  as  I  was),  and  made  me  angry  at  her  pertness."
