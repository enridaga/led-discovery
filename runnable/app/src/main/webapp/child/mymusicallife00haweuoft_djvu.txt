PRELUDE. 


PARABLES    OF   THE    GOLDEN    SEA 

THE    TIDAL    WAVES    BEAT    UPON    THE    SHORES    OP    THE    AGE8 

THEY    ABE    THE    WAVES    OF    HUMAN    FEELING 

THE    EBB    AND    FLOW    OF    EMOTION 

TIMING   THE    PULSES    OF    THE    HEART 

THE   WINDS    RISE    AND    FALL 

THE    FITFUL    BREATH   OF    PASSION 

THE    BLAST    OF    VOWER 

THE    SIGH    OF    RAPTURE    THE    SWOON    OF   DEATH 

THE    CLOUDS    GATHER    AND    PASS 

PROPHETS    OF    SORROW    HERALDS   OF   TEMPEST 

SHADOWS    OF    PAIN    AND    LOSS 

JOY  LIES    A   LONELY   WRECK 

AND    GRIEF    IS    LOUD 

AND    THE   NIGHT    IS    FILLED    WITH   STARS 

BUT    THE    MORNING   BREAKS 

AND    BEYOND   THE    SEA    AND   THE   CLOUD    RACK 

GLOWS    THE    IMPENETRABLE    BLUE 

I    STAND    ON    THE    SHORE    AND    UTTEE,

THIXK   it   was   Lord   Beaconsfield   who    said    that 

a  man  was    usually  interesting   in   proportion  as 

his  talk  ran  upon  what  he  was  familiar  with  ;  and 

a  man  usually  knew  more  about  himself  than  about 

anything  else,  he  seldom  failed  to  be  tolerable  if 

his  self-centred  talk  turned  out  to  be  unaffected 

and  sincere.     To  talk  about  one's  self  and  to  be 

nevertheless    possible.      In  the  early  pages   of  this 

I  shall  have  to  do  the  first  to  a  considerable  extent ; 

hope  to  avoid  the  second.

4  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

My   Musical   Life    is    a  companion    volume    to   Music 

and    Morals.       That    book     made    me    many 
2. 

"MCSIC  AND   friends,    and,    I     Lope,     few     enemies.       The 
public    was    kind,     and     the    publishers    were 
liberal.      Music   and  Morals    is   now    (1883)    in   its    12th 
edition. 

Music  is  not  the  business  of  my  life,  but  it  remains 
its  sweetest  recreation;  and  there  is  one  opinion  which 
used  to  be  widely  held  by  my  friends  in  the  old  days, 
and  to  which  I  subscribed  for  many  years.  Nature, 
they  often  said,  intended  me  for  a  violinist.  In  fact, 
my  musical  life  starts  from  the  violin;  and,  "  Stradi- 
vario  duce  " — Stradivarius  leading  the  way — I  feel  in- 
spired, "  after  long  years,"  to  retrace  with  a  certain 
keen  pleasure  these  labyrinthine  passages  of  Musical 
Memory. 

There  is  something  about  the  shape  of  a  violin — its 
curves,  its  physiognomy,  its  smiling  and  genial  £  |  's 
— which  seems  to  invite  and  welcome  inspection  and 
handling. 

TARISIO,  the  Italian  carpenter,  came  under  this  fasci- 
nation to  good  purpose.  He  began  by  mending  old 
fiddles;  he  played  himself  a  little;  he  got

yet  living  companions   of  his  solitude,  until  he 
began  to  (<  trade  in  fiddles/' 


TAEISIO.  5 

At  tlie  beginning  of  tins  century,  hidden  away  in  old 
Italian  convents  and  wayside  inns,  lay  the  masterpieces  of 
the  AMATI,  STRADIVARIUS,  the  GUARNERII,  and  BERGONZI, 
almost  unknown  and  little  valued.  But  TARISIO'S  eye  was 
getting  cultivated.  He  was  learning  to  know  a  fiddle  when 
he  saw  it. 

"  Your  violino,  signor,  requires  mending  ? "  says  the 
itinerant  pedlar,  as  he  salutes  some  monk  or  padre  known 
to  be  connected  with  the  sacristy  or  choir  of  Pisa.,  Florence, 
Milan.  "  I  can  mend  it." 

Out  comes  the  Stradivarius,  with  a  loose  bar  or  a  split 
rib,  and  sounding  abominably. 

"  Dio  mio  !  "  says  TARISIO,  "  and  all  the  blessed  saints  ! 
but  your  violiuo  is  in  a  bad  way.  My  respected  father  is 
prayed  to  try  one  that  I  have,  in  perfect  and  beautiful 
accord  and  repair;  and  permit  me  to  mend  this  worn-out 
machine." 

And  TARISIO,  whipping  a  shining,  clean  instrument  out  of 
his  bag,  hands  it  to  the  monk,  who  eyes  it  and  is  for  trying 
it.  He  tries  it ;  it  goes  soft  and  sweet,  though  not  loud  and 
wheezy,  like  the  battered  old  Strad.  TARISIO  clutches  his 
treasure. 

The  next  day  back  comes  the  pedlar  to  the  cloister,  is 
shown  up  to  the  padre,  whom  he  finds  scraping  away  on 
his  loan  fiddle. 

"But,"  he  exclaims,  "you  have  lent  me  a  beautiful 
violino,  and  in  perfect  order.'* 


6  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

"  Ah  !  if  the  father  would  accept  from  me  a  small  favour/' 
says  the  cunning  TARISIO. 

"  And  what  is  that  ?  " 

"  To  keep  the  violino  that  suits  him  so  well,  and  I 
will  take  in  exchange  the  old  machine  which  is  worn 
out,  but  with  my  skill  I  shall  still  make  something 
of  it !  " 

A  glass  of  good  wine,  or  a  lemonade,  or  black  coffee, 
clinches  the  bargain.  Off  goes  TARISIO,  having  parted  with 
a  characterless  German  fiddle — sweet  and  easy-going  and 
"looking  nice,"  and  worth  now  about  £5 — in  perfect  order, 
no  doubt, — and  having  secured  one  of  those  gems  of 
Cremona  which  now  run  into  £3CO.  Violin-collecting 
became  the  passion  of  TARISIO'S  life.  The  story  has  been 
told  by  MR.  CHARLES  READE,  and  all  the  fiddle-world  knows 
how  TARISIO  came  to  Paris  with  a  batch  of  old  instruments, 
and  was  taken  up  by  CHANOT  and  VUILLAUME,  through 
whose  hands  passed  nearly  every  one  of  those  chefs-d'oeuvre 
recovered  by  TARISIO  in  his  wanderings,  which  now  are  so 
eagerly  contended  for  by  English  and  American  millionaires, 
whenever  they  happen  to  get  into  the  market. 

I  have  heard  of  a  mania  for  snuff-boxes — it  was  old 
LABLACHE'S  hobby.  There  are  your  china-maniacs,  and 
your  picture-maniacs,  and  your  old-print  connoisseurs 
who  only  look  at  the  margin,  and  your  old-book- 
hunters  who  only  glance  at  the  title-page  and  edition, 
and  your  coin-collectors,  and  your  gem-collectors,  who 


FIDDLE  SHOPS.   '  7 

are  always  being  taken  in;  but  for  downright  fanaticism 
and  "  gone-cooniness,"  if  I  may  invent  the  word,  com- 
mend me  to  your  violin-maniac.  He  who  once  comes 
under  that  spell,  goes  down  to  the  grave  with  a  disordered 
mind. 

I  said  that  I  was,  perhaps,  intended  for  a  violinist  by 

nature.    I  can  understand  TARISIO'S  passion,  though  I  never 

followed  out  that  particular  branch  of  it  which 

4. 

FIDDLB  led  him  to  collect,  repair,  and  sell.  I  could 
not  buy  violins — the  prices  have  risen  since 
the  days  of  the  Italian  pedlar.  I  could  not  cheat  people 
out  of  them  ;  the  world  was  too  knowing  for  that, — and 
then  I  was  too  virtuous.  I  could  not  "  travel "  in  violins. 
It  was  not  my  vocation ;  and  one  may  in  these  days  go 
far  and  get  little — for  it  is  now  about  as  easy  to  find  a 
STRADIVARIUS  as  a  CORREGGIO.  But  long  before  I  had 
ever  touched  a  violin  I  was  fascinated  with  its  appear- 
ance. In  driving  up  to  town  as  a  child — when,  standing 
up  in  the  carriage,  I  could  just  look  out  of  the  window — 
certain  fiddle  shops  hung  with  mighty  rows  of  violoncellos 
attracted  my  attention.  I  had  dreams  of  these  large  editions 
— these  patriarchs  of  the  violin,  as  they  seemed  to  me. 
I  compared  them  in  my  mind  with  the  smaller  tenors  and 
violins.  I  dreamed  about  their  brown,  big,  dusty  bodies 
and  affable  good-natured-looking  heads  and  grinning  f  ^  's. 
These  violin  shops  were  the  great  points  watched  for  on  each

journey  up  to  London  from  Norwood,  where  I  spent  my 
early  days. 

"We  passed  through  Kennington.     Sometimes  we  used  to 
stop  at  a  friend's  house  overlooking  the  common.     He  was 

old,  quaint,  and   musical.      His  name  was  DR. 
5. 

DR.  MAITLAND — the  celebrated  author  of  The  Dark 
Ayes.  An  organ,  with  black  keys  where  the 
piano's  are  white,  and  white  where  the  piano's  are  black, 
stood  in  the  hall.  This  instrument  was  atrociously  out  of 
tune,  but  I  used  always  to  pump  it  full  of  wind  whenever 
I  got  the  chance,  and  let  off  as  many  of  the  discordant 
pipes  as  possible  before  I  could  be  stopped.  The  old 
gentleman  had  a  fiddle,  and  a  couple  of  friends  used  some- 
times to  look  in  and  bring  theirs,  and  they  played  HASSE'S 
and  CORELLI'S  trios.  I  remember  at  that  early  age  dis- 
covering the  rudiments  of  the  then  famous  JULLIEN'S 
"  Bridal  Waltz ''  in  a  movement  of  old  HASSE.  Considering 
the  great  dearth  of  respectable  violin  music  for  beginners, 
I  have  often  wondered  why  those  simple  and  severe 
gigues  and  sarabands  are  not  more  often  utilised.  In  any 
sale  of  old  music,  or  at  second-hand  music-shops,  certain 
neatly-bound,  though  time-worn  and  time-honoured  "sets," 
can  still  be  picked  up.  Though  stiff  and  formal,  as  it  were, 
with  starched  frills  and  periwigs  and  powder,  what  richness 
of  idea,  what  elegant  form,  what  severe  development !  Men 
were  feeling  their  way  into  the  paradise  of  modern  music ; 


THE  FIRST  TIME.  9 

but  all  was  new  to  them  ;  they  do  not  disguise  it,  the  naive 
delight  in  effects  repeated  again  and  again  with  consummate 
gravity  and  gusto,  because  they  were  new,  the  placid  content- 
ment with  a  simple  flowing  bit  of  melody,  and  the  frequent 
employment  of  the  perfect  cadence,  in  season  and  out  of 
season,  reminding  one  that  only  333  years  had  passed  away 
since  Monteverde  had  laid  the  foundation  of  modern  music 
by  that  famous  discovery.* 

To  a  blase  world  it  is  refreshing  to  go  back  and  keep 
company  with  those  old  pioneers  of  art,  and  realise  sympa- 
thetically with  them  the  joy  of  doing  a  thing  for 
THE  FIKST  the  first  time.  The  first  time !  What  heights 
and  depths  are  there  in  those  three  short  mono- 
syllables !  The  first  time  your  soul  has  thrilled  to  eloquence, 
the  first  time  a  poetical  thought  has  kindled  you,  the  first 
time  you  noticed  the  charm  of  a  woman's  society,  the  first 
time  your  pulses  quickened  at  her  approach,  the  first  time 
you  found  a  congenial  friend,  the  first  time  you  perceived  in 
colour  and  sound  something  which  went  beyond  the  eye  or 
the  ear  and  became  the  interpreter  of  the  soul.  The  joy  of 
the  explorer  as  he  sails  into  an  unknown  sea,  the  ecstasy 
of  the  astronomer  as  a  new  planet  floats  into  the  telescope, 
the  thrill  of  the  experimentalist  who  combines  with  a  new 
result  substances  which  from  the  beginning  of  time  have 
never  been  thus  brought  together,  the  glow  of  the  historian

when,  after  poring  over  his  facts,  the  meaning  of  them 
dawns  upon  him,  and  a  theory  is  born  once  and  for  ever 
which  is  destined  to  introduce  order  and  meaning  into  what 
before  was  chaos ! 


Youth  is  the  great  season  of  surprises,  as  it  certainly  is  of 

delights.     There  never  were  such  buttercup  fields  and  straw-

EXHIBITION          *  * 

OF  1851.  as  for  the  modern  ices,  they  are  either  frozen 
amiss  or  ill-mixed.  They  are  not  good  enough  for  me,  who 
can  remember  what  they  were  in  the  Exhibition  of  1851. 
One  of  my  keenest  musical  impressions  is  connected  with 
that  marvellous  show.  I  shall  never  see  such  another.  As 
I  stood  in  the  gallery  of  the  great  crystal  transept  and 
looked  down  upon  a  spectacle  such  has  been  witnessed  since, 
but  had  never  before  been  seen,  a  feeling  of  intoxication — 
there  is  no  other  word  for  it — came  over  me.  That  moving 
thronging  mass  of  gaily-dressed  people  below,  fading  away 
into  the  distance,  the  sunshine  that  filled  that  opaline 
building,  the  glittering  sheen  reflected  from  a  million  facets 
as  of  diamonds,  flecking  with  rainbow  hues  the  vapours 
which  dimmed  the  long  perspective.  The  murmur  of  that 
echoing,  moving  throng  beneath,  is  still  in  my  ears ;  it 
mingles  with  the  splashing  of  fountains  that  rose  from  vast 
shining  basins  and  radiant  cones  amid  tropical  foliage.  The 
Oriental  stalls,  the  hangings,  the  gaudy  red  flags  white

lettered,  the  decorated  produce  of  many  Nations  arranged 
in  what  appeared  to  me  to  be  magic  grottoes  of  marvellous 
wealth  and  beauty ;  the  snowy  statues,  many  of  them 
colossal,  standing  out  in  bold  relief  against  green  palms,  or 
Eastern  cloth  of  gold,  or  crimson  and  azure  tapestries — all 
this  rises  before  me  as  I  write. 

I  remember  perfectly  well  falling  into  a  kind  of  dream  as 

I  leant  over  the  painted  iron  balcony  and  looked  down  on 

Ibis  splendid  vista.     The  silver- bell-like  tones  of

through  the  human  hum,  and  noise  of  splashing 
waters,  but  it  Avas  a  long  way  off.  Suddenly,  in  the  adjoin- 
ing gallery,  the  large  organ  broke  out  with  a  blare  of 
trumpets  that  thrilled  and  riveted  me  with  an  inconceivable 
emotion.  I  knew  not  then  what  those  opening  bars  were. 
Evidently  something  martial,  festal,  jubilant,  and  full 
of  triumph.  I  listened  and  held  my  breath  to  hear 
MENDELSSOHN'S  "  Wedding  March  "  for  the  first  time,  and 
not  know  it !  To  hear  it  when  half  the  people  present 
had  never  heard  of  MENDELSSOHN,  three  years  after  his 
death,  and  when  not  one  in  a  hundred  could  have  told 
me  what  was  being  played — that  is  an  experience  I  shall 
never  forget.  As  successive  waves  of  fresh  inexhaustible 
inspiration  flowed  on,  vibrating  through  the  building  without 
a  check  or  a  pause,  the  peculiar  Mendelssohnian  spaces  of 
cantabile  melody  alternating  as  they  do  in  that  march  with 


12  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

the  passionate  and  almost  fierce  decision  of  the  chief  pro- 
cessional theme,  I  stood  riveted,  bathed  in  the  sound  as  m 
an  element.  I  felt  ready  to  melt  into  those  harmonious  yet 
turbulent  waves  and  float  away  upon  the  tides  of  "  Music's 
golden  sea  setting  towards  Eternity."  The  angel  of  TENNY- 
SON'S Vision  might  have  stood  by  me  whispering, 

And  thou  listenest  the  lordly  music  flowing  from  the  illimitable  years. 

Someone  called  me,  so  I  was  told  afterwards,  but  I  did  not 
hear.  They  supposed  that  I  was  following,  they  went  on, 
and  were  soon  lost  in  the  crowd.  Presently  one  came  back 
and  touched  me,  but  Itdid  not  feel.  I  could  not  be  roused, 
my  soul  was  living  apart  from  my  body.  When  the  music 
ceased  the  spell  slowly  dissolved,  and  I  was  led  away  still 
half  in  dreamland.  For  long  years  afterwards  the  "  Wedding 
March/'  which  is  now  considered  banale  and  clap -trap  by 
the  advanced  school,  affected  me  strangely.  Its  power  over 
me  has  almost  entirely  ceased.  It  is  a  memory  now  more 
than  a  realisation — 

eheu !  fugaces,  Posthume, 
Posthume,  labuutur  anni — 

This  was  in  1851 ;  but  it  must  have  been  about  the  year 
1846  that  I  was  taken  up  to  a  concert  at  Exeter 

•M 

THE        Hall,  and  heard  there  for   the  first   time   what 

K  MIDSUMMEB  .  „ 

NIGHT'S     seemed  to  me  to  be  music  or  unearthly  sweetness. 

AM'     The  room  was  crowded.     I  was  far  behind.     I 

could  only  see  the  fiddle-sticks  of  the  band  in  the  distance. 


THE  "MIDSUMMER  NIGHTS  DREAM."          13 

Four  long-drawn-out  tender  wails  on  the  wind  rising,  rising ; 
then  a  soft,  rapid,  flickering  kind  of  sound,  high  up  in  the 
treble  clef,  broke  from  a  multitude  of  fiddles,  ever  growing 
in  complexity  as  the  two  fiddles  at  each  desk  divided  the 
harmonies  amongst  them,  pausing  as  the  deep  melodious 
breathing  of  wind  instruments  suspended  in  heavy  slumbrous 
sighs  their  restless  agitation,  then  recommencing  till  a 
climax  was  reached,  and  the  whole  band  broke  in  with  that 
magnificent  subject  which  marks  the  first  complete  and 
satisfying  period  of  musical  solution  in  the  overture  to  the 
"  Midsummer  Night's  Dream  !  " 

I  was  at  once  affected  as  I  had  never  before  been.  I  did 
not  know  then  that  it  was  the  MENDELSSOHN  mania  that  had 
come  upon  me.  It  seized  upon  the  whole  musical  world  of 
forty  years  ago,  and  discoloured  the  taste  and  judgment  of 
those  affected,  for  every  other  composer.  The  epidemic 
lasted  for  about  twenty  years  at  its  height ;  declined  rather 

uddenly  with  the  growing  appreciation  of  SCHUMANN,  the 
tardy  recognition  of  SPOHR,  and  the  revival  of  SCHUBERT, 
receiving  its  quietus  of  course  with  the  triumph  of  WAGNER. 
People  now  "  place "  MENDELSSOHN,  then  they  worshipped 
him.  Can  I  forget  the  heavenly  close  of  that  dream  over- 
ture  that  day  ?  MR.  WILLY — that  capital  chef  d'orchestre, 
so  strict,  so  true,  so  sympathetic — was  leading  the  band. 
The  enchanting  master,  who  was  to  pass  away  in  the  fol- 
lowing year,  FELIX  MENDELSSOHN,  was  still  alive.  He  might 

have  been  in  London  at  the  time.     It  was  the  very  year  he

conducted  the  "  Elijah "  at  Birmingham.  His  works,  at 
the  moment  when  he  was  to  be  taken  from  us  for  ever,  were 
being  played  in  all  the  concert  rooms  in  London ;  the 
D  Minor  and  C  Minor  trios,  his  pianoforte  concertos,  the 
"  Ruy  Bias/'  the  overture  to  the  "Midsummer  Night's 
Dream."  That  day  the  band  played  with  a  freshness  and 
sympathy  which  made  their  own  intense  delight  contagious. 
I  can  never  hear  the  heavenly  sleep-music  at  the  close  of 
the  overture — which  some  dull  people  declare  is  borrowed 
from  Weber — without  the  memory  of  those  indescribable 
sensations  carrying  me  back  to  that  day  in  Exeter  Hall. 

When  I  heard  the  "Wedding  March"  later  in  1851,  without 

knowing  whose  or  what  it  was,  I  had  the  same  feeling.     My 

10.        spirit  unconsciously  saluted  the  genius  who  was 

™E        destined    to    rule    mv   musical    aspirations    for 

MENDELSSOHN 

SPELL,  nearly  thirty  years.  I  was  no  doubt  very  young 
and  ignorant  and  inexperienced.  I  was  scraping  HASSE, 
CORELLI,  and  modern  opera  tunes  on  a  very  bad  fiddle  at 
home.  "  La  Pluie  des  Perles "  and  "  La  Tenerezza/'  and 
such-like  pianoforte  trifles  of  the  period,  seemed  to  me 
delicious,  and  HENRI  HERZ'S  noisy  firework-variations 
struck  me  as  sublime.  When  STERNDALE  BENNETT  sat 
down  to  the  piano  one  day  and  played  two  or  three  of 
the  "  Songs  without  Words/'  then  great  novelties,  my 
perception  failed  me.  I  thought  nothing  of  them  nor  of 
him.  It  was  some  years  before  I  learned  to  prefer  such

pianoforte  masterpieces  to  the  showy  and  ephemeral  schools 
of  CZERNY,  HERZ,  and  THALBERG.  Why  I  was  so  instantly 
won  by  the  overture  to  the  "  Midsummer  Night's  Dream/' 
and  so  insensible  at  first  to  the  "  Songs  without  Words/'  is 
to  me  a  riddle.  After  the  first  hearing  of  the  overture  I 
became  a  confirmed  Mendelssohnian.  I  next  heard  "  I 
would  that  my  love/'  sung  by  two  boys  at  the  Brighton 
College,  and  I  could  listen  to  nothing  else  that  night. 

la  1847  I  was  staying  at  a  house  where  the  overture  to 
the  "Midsummer  Night's  Dream"  was  played  as  a  pianoforte 
duet.      It  is  arranged  a  quatre  mains  by  MEN- 
TOE  TEAK  DELSSOHN  himself.      Every  evening  it    was   my 

1  &A.7 

unspeakable  delight  to  listen  to  it.  The  world 
at  large  was  not  then  much  excited  about  MENDELSSOHN — 
no  one  spoke  of  him  out  of  certain  musical  cliques,  and 
I  was  not  in  the  cliques — but  my  curiosity  was  intensely 
excited ;  every  scrap  of  news  about  him  I  fell  upon  eagerly. 
In  those  days  I  never  read  the  papers.  I  never  knew 
when  MENDELSSOHN  was  in  England ;  no  one  ever  told 
me  about  the  "  Elijah "  at  Birmingham  in  1846.  No 
one  took  me  to  see  or  hear  MENDELSSOHN  when  he  was 
playing  and  conducting  in  London.  Everything  in  this 
world  seems  unimportant  until  all  is  too  late.  The  angels 
come  in  and  the  angels  go  out,  but  we  never  know  them 
until  they  have  withdrawn  themselves  from  us.  Then  we  look 
up  to  heaven,  and  our  eyes  fill  with  burning  bitter  tears. 


16  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

One  night,  just  as  the  last  notes  of  that  overture  had 
been  struck  on  the  piano,  the  door  opened — it  was  at 

12.  Guildford — someone  came  in  with   a  newspaper 
MEN-  ^    — "MENDELSSOHN  is  dead."     "Dead!"    echoed 

I«EL.SSOII^  8 

DEATH,  the  girl  who  had  been  playing  the  treble,  her 
hand  falling  from  the  white  keys  as  though  suddenly 
paralysed — "  dead  !  "  She  rose  from  the  piano  and  walked 
to  the  other  end  of  the  room.  I  was  watching  her.  I  had 
desolate  thoughts  of  my  own.  "  I  shall  never  see  him 
now/'  I  thought;  "he  will  make  no  more  music/'  The 
girl  came  back.  She  was  silent  and  agitated;  she  could 
not  control  her  emotion,  and  she  left  the  room  hurriedly. 
Others  were  there,  but  none  seemed  to  feel  it  as  she  did, 
or  as  I  did.  It  was  news  to  them;  to  us  it  was  a  calamitous, 
irreparable,  personal  loss.  Boys  don't  weep  on  these  occa- 
sions, but  I  had  my  own  thoughts,  and  I  could  understand 
another's. 

From  that  day  MENDELSSOHN  became  my  patron  saint  in 
music.  I  used  to  see  his  face  in  dreams,  transfigured, 

13.  splendid  with  inspired  thought.     He  would  come 
MY  VISIONS  to   me   an<j   smile,   and    speak  kind   words.      I 
DELSSOHN.   seemed  then  to  have  known  him  long,  his  step 

was  familiar,  the  long  tapering  fingers  of  his  beautiful 
white  hand — that  perfect  hand  of  which  MB.  CIIAPPELL  has 
an  exact  cast — his  slight  figure,  his  wavy,  sunny  hair,  his 
noble  forehead,  his  large  gentle  eyes  beaming  with  a  certain 


MENDELSSOHN.  17 

child-like  fondness,  full  of  unconscious  simplicity,  flashing 
at  times  with  a  fire  so  intense  that  it  seemed  to  burn  into 
the  soul  of  every  man  in  the  orchestra.  It  was  matter  of 
common  remark  that  when  MENDELSSOHN  conducted  a 
perfectly  sympathetic  band,  he  would  at  times  almost  cease 
to  move  the  baton.  Then,  with  his  head  a  little  on  one 
side,  himself  listening  like  one  entranced,  his  spirit  alone 
seemed  to  sway  the  musicians,  who  followed  every  inflexion 
vibrating  to  every  pulse  of  his  meaning,  as  though  he  had 
placed  them  under  some  strange  kind  of  magnetic  control. 

This  recurrent  vision  of  my  companionship  with  MEN- 
DELSSOHN— the  impossibility  of  believing  him  to  be  dead, 
our  frequent  and  strange  meeting  in  the  land  of  dreams — 
remains  one  of  the  sweetest  illusions  of  my  early  youth. 

I  never  meet  him  now.  I  never  see  him.  He  never 
comes  to  me.  Whenever  I  think  of  him,  I  think  not  of 
the  living  MENDELSSOHN  of  my  dreams,  but  of  the  placid 
head  lying  pillowed  in  its  last  sleep  as  sketched  by  his 
friend,  and  since  engraved.  The  summer  wind  seems  stir- 
ring amongst  the  branches  that  wave  close  by,  and 
underneath  are  written  those  words  from  the  "  Elijah " 
which  he  selected  and  set,  not  long  before  his  death,  to  the 
divinest  music,  "And  after  the  fire  a  still  small  voice, 

'  And  in  that  still  voice  onward  came  the  Lord '  .  .  ." 
***** 

As  my  ideas  group  themselves  most  naturally  about  my 
favourite  instrument — the  violin — I  may  as  welj  resume 

2 


18  NORWOOD   AND  LONDON. 

the  thread  of  my  narrative  in  connection  with  my  earliest 

violin  recollections.     I  became  possessed,  at  the 

NURSERY    age  of  six  years,  of  a  small  red  eighteenpenny 

fiddle  and  stick,  with  that  flimsy  bow  and  those 

thready  strings,  which  are  made  apparently  only  to  snap, 

even  as  the  fiddle  is   made  only  to  smash.     I  thus  early 

became  familiar  with  the  idol  of  niy  youth.     But  familiarity 

did  not  breed  contempt.     I  proceeded  to  elicit  from  the  red 

eighteenpenny  all  it  had  to  give ;  and  when  I  had  done  with 

it,  my  nurse  removed   the   belly,  and   found  it   made   an 

admirable   dust-pan   or  wooden    shovel    for   cinders,    and, 

finally,  excellent  firewood.     Many  went  that  way,  without 

my  passion  for  toy  fiddles  suffering  the  least  decline;  nay, 

it  rather  grew  by  that  it  (and  the  fire)  fed  on.     It  may  not 

be  superfluous  to  add  that  I  had  by  this  time  found  means 

to  make  the  flimsiest  strings  yield  up  sounds  which  I  need 

not  here  characterise,  and  to  such  purpose  that  it  became 

a  question  of  some  interest  how  long  such  sounds  could  be 

endured  by  the  human  ear.     I  do  not  mean  my  own.     All 

violinists,  including  infants  on  eighteenpennies,  admit  that 

to  their  own   ear   the   sounds   produced  are   nothing   but 

delightful ;   it  is  only  those  who  do   not   make  them  who 

complain.     As  it  seemed  unlikely  that  my  studies  on  the 

violin  would  stop,  it  became  expedient  that  they  should  be 

directed.      A  full-sized  violin  was   procured  me.      I  have 

every  reason  to  believe  it  was  one  of  the  worst  fiddles  I 

ever  saw. 


FIRST  LESSONS.  19 

I  had  played  many  times  with  much  applause,  holding  a. 

full-sized  violin  between  my  knees.    I  was  about  eight  years 

old   when  the  services   of  the  local  organist — a 

Ivb 

FIRST  MR.  INGRAM,  of  Norwood — were  called  in.  His 
skill  on  the  violin  was  not  great,  but  it  was 
enough  for  me;  too  much,  indeed,  for  he  insisted  on  my 
holding  the  violin  up  to  my  chin.  The  fact  is,  he  could 
not  play  it  in  any  other  position  himself,  so  how  could 
he  teach  me  ?  Of  course  the  instrument  was  a  great  deal 
too  large ;  but  I  strained  and  stretched  until  I  got  it  up  ; 
for  as  it  would  not  grow  down  to  me,  I  had  to  grow  up 
to  it.  '  And  here  I  glance  at  the  crucial  question,  Ought 
young  children  to  begin  upon  small-sized  violins?  All 
makers  say  "  Yes " ;  naturally,  for  they  supply  the  new 
violins  of  all  sizes.  But  I  emphatically  say  "  No."  The 
sooner  the  child  gets  accustomed  to  the  right  violin  intervals 
the  better;  the  small  violins  merely  present  him  with  a 
series  of  wrong  distances,  which  he  has  successively  to 
unlearn.  It  is  bad  enough  if  in  after  years  he  learns  the 
violoncello  or  tenor.  Few  violinists  survive  that  ordeal,  and 
most  people  who  take  to  the  tenor  or  'cello  after  playing  the 
violin  keep  to  it.  Either  they  have  not  been  successful  on 
the  violin,  or  they  hope  to  become  so  on  its  larger  though 
less  brilliant  relation  ;  but  they  have  a  perfectly  true  instinct 
that  it  is  difficult  to  excel  on  both,  because  of  the  intervals. 
Yet,  in  the  face  of  this,  you  put  a  series  of  violins  of 
different  sizes  into  the  pupil's  hand,  on  the  ground  that,

as  his  hand  enlarges  with  years,  the  enlarged  key-board 
suit  his  fingers  better;  but  that  is  not  the  way  the  brain 
works — the  brain  learns  intervals.  It  does  not  trouble  itself 
about  the  size  of  the  fingers  that  have  got  to  stretch  them. 
A  child  of  even  seven  or  eight  can  stretch  most  of  the  ordi- 
nary intervals  on  a  full-sized  violin  finger-board.  He  may 
not  be  able  to  hold  the  violin  to  his  chin ;  but  he  can  learn 
his  scales  and  pick  out  tunes,  sitting  on  a  stool  and  holding 
his  instrument  like  a  violoncello.  Before  the  age  of  eight 
I  found  no  difficulty  in  doing  this.  But  the  greater  the 
difficulty  the  better  the  practice.  The  tendons  cannot  be 
too  much  stretched  short  of  spraining  and  breaking.  Mere 
aching  is  to  be  made  no  account  of;  the  muscles  can  hardly 
be  too  much  worked.  A  child  will  soon  gain  surprising 
agility,  even  on  a  large  finger-board.  Avoid  the  hateful 
figured  slip  of  paper  that  used  to  be  pasted  on  violin 
finger-boards  in  my  youth,  with  round  dots  for  the  fingers. 
I  remember  tearing  mine  off  in  a  fit  of  uncontrollable 
irritation.  I  found  it  very  difficult,  with  the  use  of  my 
eyes,  to  put  my  fingers  on  the  dots,  and  even  then  the 
note  was  not  always  in  tune,  for  of  course  the  dot  might 
be  covered  in  a  dozen  ways  by  the  finger-tips,  and  a  hair's 
breadth  one  way  or  the  other  would  vary  the  note.  But  the 
principle  is  vicious.  A  violin  player's  eyes  have  no  more 
business  with  his  fingers  than  a  billiard  player's  eyes  have 
with  his  cue.  He  looks  at  the  ball,  and  the  musician,  if  he 
looks  at  anything,  should  look  at  the  notes,  or  at  his

audience,  or  he  can  shut   his   eyes  if  he  likes.     It  is  hia 
ears,  not  his  eyes,  have  to  do  with  his  fingers. 

I  was  about  eight  years  old.     My  musical  studies  were 
systematic,  if  not  well  directed.     Every  morning  for  two 

hours  I  practised  scales  and  various  tunes  at  a 
16. 
EARLY      double   desk,  my  father  on  one  side  and  I  on 

the  other.  We  played  the  most  deplorable 
arrangements,  and  we  made  the  most  detestable  noise.  We 
played  BEETHOVEN'S  overture  to  "Prometheus,"  arranged 
for  two  fiddles,  CALLCOTT'S  German  melodies  with  piano- 
forte accompaniment,  and  without  the  violoncello  part, 
and"  CORELLI'S  trios — also  without  the  third  instrument. 
I  had  somehow  ceased  to  take  lessons  now.  My  father's 
knowledge  of  violin  playing  was  exactly'  on  a  level  with  my 
own  ;  his  skill,  he  modestly  owned,  was  even  less,  but  had 
it  not  been  for  him  I  never  should  have  played  at  all.  Our 
method  was  simple.  We  sat  for  two  hours  after  breakfast 
and  scraped.  In  the  evening,  with  the  addition  of  the 
piano,  we  scraped  again — anything  we  could  get  hold  of — 
and  we  did  get  hold  of  odd  things :  LOCKE'S  music  to 
"  Macbeth/'  old  quadrilles,  the  "  Battle  of  Prague/'  "  God 
save  the  Emperor,"  and  the  "  Huntsman's  Chorus."  I  con- 
fess I  hated  the  practising,  it  was  simple  drudgery — and  put 
it  in  what  way  you  will,  the  early  stage  of  violin  playing  is 
drudgery — but  it  must  be  gone  through  with.  And  then 
I  had  my  hours  of  relaxation.  I  used  to  walk  up  and  down 


22  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

the  lawn  in  our  garden  playing  tunes  in  my  own  fashion. 
I  got  very  much  at  home  on  the  finger-board,  and  that  is  the 
grand  thing  after  all.  No  one  ever  gets  at  home  there  who 
has  not  begun  young — not  so  young  as  I  began,  but  at  least 
under  the  age  of  twelve.  I  was  soon  considered  an  infant 
phenomenon  on  the  violin,  stood  on  tables,  and  was  trotted 
out  at  parties,  and  I  thus  early  got  over  all  shyness  at 
playing  in  public. 

About  this  time  I  received  a  decided  impulse  from  hearing 
a  little  girl,  aged  six,  play  on  the  violin  exquisitely,  and,  as 
it  seemed  to  me,  prodigiously.  There  were 
ANEW  three  sisters,  named  TURNER;  the  eldest  was 
only  fifteen :  two  played  the  harp,  and  the 
youngest,  a  pretty  child  of  six,  played  the  violin.  She 
had  one  of  those  miniature  instruments — I  believe  a  real 
Cremona — which  can  still  occasionally  be  picked  up  at  old 
violin  shops.  I  remember  the  enthusiasm  she  created  in 
some  variations  on  airs  from  "  Sonuambula,"  an  opera  in 
which  JENNY  LIND  was  making  furor  at  the  time  in  London. 
The  poor  little  violinist  was  recalled  again  and  again.  It 
was  past  eleven,  and  as  she  came  on  in  her  little  pink 
dress  just  down  to  her  knees — holding  her  tiny  fiddle — 
I  recollect  her  raising  it  to  her  chin  to  begin  again,  but  her 
little  head  lay  so  wearily  on  one  side,  and  she  looked  so  tired 
that  her  acute  father  came  forward,  perceiving  that  the 
child  was  quite  worn  out,  drew  her  away,  and  in  a  few  words 


SAINTON— HILL— PIATTI— COOPER.  23 

asked  the  people  to  let  her  off,  adding  that  she  ought  to 
have  been  in  bed  an  hour  ago.  I  went  home  and  tried 
those  variations.  I  could  not  play  them,  but  her  playing  of 
them  gave  me  a  new  start.  The  finest  lesson  a  young 
player  can  have  is  to  hear  good  playing.  So  my  father 
thought.  We  had  both  come  to  a  kind  of  standstill  in  our 
music.  We  seemed,  as  he  expressed  it,  to  have  stuck. 

It  now  happily  occurred  to  him  to  subscribe  to  certain 
quartet  concerts  then  announced  to  take  place  at  Willis's 
Rooms.  In  those  days  such  things  were  novelties.  With 
the  exception  of  ELLA'S  Musical  Union,  then  in  its  early 
days,  I  believe  no  public  quartets  had  been  given  in  London, 
except  perhaps  as  a  rare  feature  in  some  chamber  concert. 

SAINTON  and  PIATTI  were  then  in  their  prime.  I  remember 

them  as  young  men  with  their  hair  jet-black.     My  father 

wrote  to  M.  SAINTON  and  asked  whether  he  could 

lo. 

SAINTON,    admit   me    as  a  child  half-price?     M.    SAINTON 

PIATTI, 

HILL,  wrote  back  with  the  utmost  politeness  to  say 
that  to  make  such  a  reduction  was  not  in 
accordance  with  their  rule,  but  that  under  the  circum- 
stances he  should  be  glad  to  conform  to  my  father's  wishes, 
especially  as  my  father's  sacred  office — that  of  a  clergyman 
— always  inspired  him  with  the  greatest  respect.  Accordingly 
I  went.  These  were  amongst  the  choicest  performances 
1  heard  in  my  boyhood.  Nor,  in  some  respects,  have  they 
ever  been  excelled  in  London  since.  What  a  quartet  caste 


24  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

that  was !  SAINTOX,  HILL,  PIATTI,  and  COOPER.  SAINTON, 
full  of  fire,  brilliancy,  and  delicacy.  COOPER  with  more 
tone,  and  a  depth  and  passion  which  sometimes  gave  him 
the  advantage  over  his  brilliant  French  rival ;  but  at  the 
end  of  each  concert  we  were  always  left  balancing  the 
merits  of  the  two  violinists,  I  inclining  at  times  to 
the  Englishman's  fervour  and  abandon,  but  won  back  by 
the  Frenchman's  finish  and  execution.  In  SPOHH'S  violin 
duets  each  had  an  opportunity  for  the  display  of  his  peculiar 
gift.  Each  was  on  his  mettle ;  each  gave  his  own  reading 
to  the  same  phrases  in  turn,  and  this  friendly  artistic 
rivalry  was  to  me  intensely  exciting.  HILL  was  a  splendid 
tenor,  full,  round,  and  smooth  in  tone ;  and  of  PIATTI, 
prince  of  violoncellists,  it  is  needless  here  to  speak. 
Willis's  Rooms  were  never  full  on  these  occasions ;  the 
"  Monday  Populars  "  had  not  yet  cultivated  the  public  taste 
up  to  chamber  music  of  the  classical  sort.  In  that  field 
PROFESSOR  ELLA,  with  his  Musical  Union,  had  hitherto 
laboured  alone.  But  everyone  at  Willis's  Rooms  was 
appreciative.  The  players  all  seemed  to  feel  the  atmosphere 
sympathetic  and  genial.  Everyone  played  heartily,  and 
the  artists  were  the  very  best  that  could  be  got. 

At  each  concert  some  bright  particular  star  appeared  as  a 

soloist.     I  remember  a  fair-haired  girl — fragile 
19 
MDLLE.     and   apparently  with   no  physique  to  commend 

attention    on    a    grand    pianoforte    in    a    large 


MDLLE.    CLAUSS.  25 

room.  She  came  in  a  light  blue  muslin  dress;  sat  down 
hurriedly,  and  tossed  her  curls  back,  looking  straight  up  at 
the  ceiling,  whilst  her  fingers  ran  quickly  in  a  slight  pre- 
lude over  the  keys;  then  she  plunged  into  a  polonaise — or 
something  of  the  kind;  it  might  have  been  one  of  poor 
CHOPIN'S;  it  probably  was,  for  he  was  about  that  time  the 
rage,  and  quite  in  the  last  stage,  dying  of  consumption  in 
London  and  Scotch  drawing-rooms,  catching  fresh  colds 
every  night,  faultlessly  attired  in  the  miserable  dress 
clothes  and  exposed  shirt-front  of  the  period.  General 
attention  had  not  then  been  called  to  his  music,  but  about 
that  time  it  was  beginning  to  be  fashionable  in  London, 
which  in  such  matters  tardily  followed  Paris,  where  CHOPIN 
had  long  been  adored.  I  have  since  been  told  that  MDLLE. 
CLAUSS — afterwards  SZAVARDY  CLAUSS — was  cold  and  mecha- 
nical. I  only  heard  her  that  once,  and  that  was  at  Willis's 
Rooms,  in,  I  believe,  1849.  We  did  not  think  her  cold 
then.  From  the  moment  she  sat  down  until  she  sprang 
up  with  that  same  little  flustered,  uneasy  manner  which  I 
noticed  on  her  entrance,  our  eyes  were  riveted  upon  her,  and 
we  followed  every  bar  and  inflexion  of  the  rapid  execution. 
She  seemed  to  play  her  piece  through — as  I  have  sometimes 
heard  RUBINSTEIN — without  taking  breath,  and  we  were 
forced  to  hold  ours  :  as  the  artists  sometimes  say  of  a 
picture,  "  It  is  painted  with  one  brush/'  so  MDLLE.  CLAUSS, 
never  relaxed  her  mood  or  her  grip ;  she  held  her  composer 
and  her  audience  absolutely  fast  until  she  had  done  with

both  ;  then  she  seemed  to  push  both  away  like  one  eager  to 
escape. 

On  a  certain  afternoon  there  was  neither  solo  pianist  nor 
violinist  down  on  the  programme,  but  a  player  on  the  contre- 
basso  was  to  occupy  the  vacant  place.     I  remem- 
ber my  disappointment.    Who  is  that  tall,  sallow- 

BOTTESrNL 

looking  creature  with  black  moustache  and  straight 
hair,  with  long  bony  fingers,  yet  withal  a  comely  hand,  who 
comes  lugging  a  great  double-bass  with  him?  Someone 
might  have  lifted  it  up  for  him  ;  but  no,  he  carries  it  him- 
self and  hoists  it  lovingly  on  to  the  platform.  He  seems 
familiar  with  its  ways,  and  will  allow  no  one  to  help  him. 
Why,  there  are  SAINTON,  HILL,  PIATTI,  and  COOPER,  all 
coming  on  without  their  fiddles.  They  seem  vastly  interested 
in  this  ungainly  couple — the  man  and  the  big  bass.  He 
has  no  music.  People  behind  me  are  standing  up  to  get  a 
better  sight  of  him,  although  he  is  tall  enough  in  all  con- 
science. I  had  better  stand  up  too ;  they  are  standing 
up  in  front  of  me,  I  shall  see  nothing ! — so  I  stood  on 
a  chair.  The  first  curiosity  over,  we  all  sat  down,  and, 
expecting  little  but  a  series  of  grunts,  were  astonished  at 
the  outset  at  the  ethereal  notes  lightly  touched  on  the 
three  thick  strings,  harmonics  of  course,  just  for  tuning. 
But  all  seemed  exquisitely  in  tune  with  the  piano. 

This  man  was  BOTTESINI,  then  the  latest  novelty.     How 
he  bewildered  us  by  playing  all  sorts  of  melodies  in  flute-like 


BOTTESINI.  27 

harmonics,  as  though  he  had  a  hundred  nightingales  caged 
in  his  double-bass !  Where  he  got  his  harmonic  sequences 
from ;  how  he  hit  the  exact  place  with  his  long,  sensitive, 
ivory-looking  fingers;  how  he  swarmed  up  and  down  the 
finger-board,  holding  it  round  the  neck  at  times  with  the  grip 
of  a  giant,  then,  after  eliciting  a  grumble  of  musical  thunder, 
darting  up  to  the  top  and  down  again,  with  an  expression 
on  his  face  that  never  seemed  to  alter,  and  his  face  always 
calmly  and  rather  grimly  surveying  the  audience  ;  how  his 
bow  moved  with  the  rapidity  of  lightning,  and  his  fingers 
seemed,  like  Miss  Kilmansegg's  leg,  to  be  a  judicious  com- 
pound of  clockwork  and  steam  :  all  this,  and  more,  is  now 
a  matter  of  musical  history,  but  it  was  new  then.  I  heard 
him  play  the  "  Carnival  de  Venice."  I  have  heard  him 
play  it  and  some  three  or  four  other  solos  since  at  intervals 
of  years.  His  stock  seemed  to  me  limited ;  but  when  you 
can  make  your  fortune  with  half  a  dozen,  or  even  a  couple 
of  solos,  why  play  more  ?  At  one  time  lie  travelled  with 
LAZARUS,  the  matchless  clarionet  player;  and  I  shall  long 
remember  the  famous  duet  they  invariably  played,  and 
which  was  always  encored.  Then  BOTTESINI  was  fond  of 
conducting  and  of  composing.  He  got  a  good  appointment 
in  Egypt,  and  I  suppose  got  tired  of  going  "  around  "  playing 
the  same  solos.  I  never  wearied  of  his  consummate  grace 
and  finish,  his  fatal  precision,  his  heavenly  tone,  his  fine 
taste.  One  sometimes  yearned  for  a  touch  of  human 
imperfection,  but  he  was  like  a  dead  shot :  he  never 


28  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

missed  what  lie  aimed  at,  and  he  never  aimed  at  less  than 
•perfection. 

Another  afternoon  there  came  on  a  boy  with  a  shock  head 
of  light  hair,  who  was  received  with  a  storm  of  applause. 

He  was  about  sixteen,  and  held  a  violin.  His 
THE  BOY  name  was  JOACHIM.  He  laid  his  head  upon  his 

Cremona,  lifted  his  bow  arm,  and  plunged  into 
such  a  marvellous  performance  of  BACH'S  "Chaconne"  as 
was  certainly  never  before  heard  in  London.  The  boy 
seemed  to  fall  into  a  dream  in  listening  to  his  own  com- 
plicated mechanism.  He  shook  out  the  notes  with  the 
utmost  ease  and  fluency.  It  all  seemed  no  trouble  to  him, 
and  left  him  quite  free  to  contemplate  the  masterpiece  which 
he  was  busy  in  interpreting.  MENDELSSOHN,  after  hearing 
him  play  the  same  masterpiece  on  one  occasion,  caught 
him  in  his  arms  and  embraced  him  before  the  audience. 

I  heard  few  concerts,  and  those  usually  of  a  poor  sort, 
but  I  was  ravenous  for  music,  and  each  performance  made 
an  indelible  impression  upon  my  mind.     I  re- 
member   the    very    rooms  —  the    "Horns"    at 

HULLAH. 

Kennington,  the  dining-room  at  the  Beulah  Spa, 
Upper  Norwood,  a  school-room  at  Brixton,  our  own  school- 
room at  Lower  Norwood — where  MR.  HULLAH — looking  (in 
1846)  very  much  as  he  does  now  (1883) — used  occasionally 
to  appear  to  superintend  the  classes  on  his  then  novel 


JOHN  HULLAH—MISS  DOLBY.  29 

system.  He  usually,  however,  sent  MR.  MAY,  a  very  nice- 
looking  young  man,  whom  I  have  since  met  in  London, 
and  who  is  now  "  the  same  age  as  other  people/' 

We  used  to  trudge,  my  father,  my  sister,  and  self,  through 
the  snow  to  these  classes.  It  was  not  an  unmixed  delight, 
like  so  many  other  things  in  this  world  that  are  so  good 
for  us.  I  wore  socks  and  shoes,  and  my  legs  were  bare 
to  my  knees.  I  invariably  forgot  my  gloves,  and  my  hands 
and  legs  were  always  blue  with  cold.  MR.  HULLAII  himself 
was  looked  up  to  with  a  certain  awe.  He  was  a  very  great 
and  celebrated  man,  but  his  affability  in  speaking  to  my 
father  was  surprising.  I  can  remember  his  genial,  kindly 
face ;  and  his  manner  with  children  was  quite  gentle  and 
friendly,  considering  who  he  was.  But  withal  he  was  very 
business-like  and  systematic — and  would  have  no  nonsense. 

f 

About  this  time  I  heard  Miss  DOLBY,  then  in  her  prime. 

How  she  did  sing  "  Bonny  Dundee, "  accompanying  herself! 

What  a  voice  !  what   a  bonhomie !     Always   the 

true   artiste,  the   estimable  woman,  the   earnest 

MISS   DOLBY. 

worker.  She  had  deserved  her  popularity,  and 
retained  her  hold  over  the  public  longer  than  most  singers. 
For  how  many  years  was  she  without  a  rival  in  oratorio  ! 
It  would  not  be  right  to  say  that  she  "  created  ''  "  O  rest 
in  the  Lord/'  but  it  is  true  to  say  that  for  years  the  song 
was  identified  with  her  rendering  of  it,  and  that  no  subse- 
quent singer  has  forsaken  that  rendering  with  any  success. 


30  NORWOOD  AND   LONDON, 

Some  have  over-hurried  it,  and  some  have  over-declaimed 
it.  I  have  heard  it  actually  preached  at  the  people — an 
inexpressibly  offensive  method ;  but  Miss  DOLBY  hit  the 
happy  mean,  with  the  truest  perception  of  the  right  func- 
tions of  oratorio  art.  She  seemed  personally  filled  with 
finely  chastened  but  deep  emotion,  and  she  gave  herself  up 
to  the  expression  of  it  in  the  presence  of  others,  but  not  at 
them.  She  knew  she  was  being  over-heard  and  she  expected 
sympathy ;  but  she  was  not  engaged  in  a  propaganda,  and 
did  not  aim  at  forcing  conviction. 

When  Miss  DOLBY  married  M.  SAINTON,  the  world  of  art 
rejoiced  over  the  union  of  two  persons  who  had  already 
passed  a  considerable  portion  of  their  busy  lives  in  the 
service  of  the  English  people,  and  with  that  simple-minded 
devotion  to  the  highest  interests  of  the  musical  art  which 
has  done  so  much  to  raise  the  social  status  of  musicians  and 
ennoble  the  cause  of  music  in  England. 

About  this  time  I  heard  JULLIEN'S  band   at  the  Surrey 

Zoological  Gardens.     The   siege  of  Gibraltar  was  going  on 

at  night,  with  explosions  and  fireworks  of  incon-

looked  quite  real  to  me — they  were  blown  to 
pieces  every  evening — and  the  fort,  with  the  sentinels  pacing 
up  and  down  on  the  ramparts,  as  large  as  life.  The  band 
played  in  a  covered  alcove  not  far  from  the  water's  brink. 
The  effect  on  a  summer's  evening  was  delightful.  JULLIEN'S 


JULLIEN— ERNST.  31 

enormous  white  waistcoat  and  heavily  gilt  arm-chair  made 
a  good  centre.  1  can  see  his  large,  puffy,  pale  face  and 
black  moustache  now,  as  he  lolled  back  exhausted  in  the 
gorgeous  fauteuil ;  then  sprang  up,  full  of  fire,  patted  the 
solo  cornet  on  the  shoulder  with  "  Pratiquez  !  "  I  happened 
to  overhear  him.  "  Pratiquez,  il  faut  toujours  pratiquez." 
BOTTESINI  also  played  there  in  the  still  summer  evenings, 
with  magical  effect,  accompanied  by  JULLIEN'S  band.  Days 
and  nights  of  my  childhood,  what  music  !  what  fireworks  ! 

At  this  time  JENNY  LIND  and  ERNST  were  both  in  London ; 

and  LISZT,  I  believe,  passed  through  like  a  meteor.     I  never 

heard  any  of  them  in  their  prime,  though  I  did 

hear     MADAME     LIND-GOLDSCHMIDT     sing     the 

ERNST. 

"  Ravens "  at  a  concert  years  afterwards,  and 
it  was  ray  privilege  to  hear  ERNST  before  he  had  lost 
his  cunning,  nor  shall  I  ever  hear  his  like  again.  He 
played  once  at  Her  Majesty's  Opera  House,  when  the  whole 
assembly  seemed  to  dream  through  a  performance  of  the 
"  Hungarian  Airs."  The  lightest  whisper  of  the  violin  con- 
trolled the  house ;  the  magician  hardly  stirred  his  wand  at 
times,  and  no  one  could  tell  from  the  sound  when  he  passed 
from  the  up  to  the  down  bow  in  those  long  cantabile  notes 
which  had  such  power  to  entrance  me. 

I  heard  ERNST  later  at  Brighton.  He  played  out  of  tune, 
and  I  was  told  that  he  was  so  shaken  in  nerve,  that  playing 
a  BEETHOVEN  quartet  in  private,  and  coming  to  a  passage 


32  NORWOOD  AND  LONDON. 

of  no  great  difficulty,  which  I  have  often  scrambled  through 
with  impunity,  the  great  master  laid  down  his  fiddle  and 
declared  himself  unequal  to  the  effort. 

Great,  deep-souled,  weird  magician  of  the  Cremona !  I 
can  see  thy  pale,  gaunt  face  even  now  !  those  dark,  haggard- 
looking  eyes,  with  the  strange  veiled  fires,  semi-mesmeric, 
the  wasted  hands,  so  expressive  and  sensitive,  the  thin,  lank 
hair  and  emaciated  form,  yet  with  nothing  demoniac  about 
thee  like  PAGANINI,  from  whom  thou  wast  absolutely  distinct. 
No  copy  thou, — thyself  all  thyself — tender,  sympathetic, 
gentle  as  a  child,  suffering,  always  suffering;  full  of  an 
excessive  sensibility ;  full  of  charm  ;  irresistible  and  fascinat- 
ing beyond  words  !  Thy  Cremona  should  have  been  buried 
with  thee.  It  has  fallen  into  other  hands.  I  see  it  every 
season  in  the  concert-room:  MADAME  NORMAN-NKRUDA  plays 
it.  I  know  she  is  an  admirable  artist.  I  do  not  hear  thy 
Cremona;  its  voice  has  gone  out  with  thee,  its  soul  has 
passed  with  thine. 

In  the  night  I  hear  it  under  the  stars,  when  the  moon  is 
low,  and  I  see  the  dark  ridges  of  the  clover  hills,  and  rabbits 
and  hares,  black  against  the  paler  sky,  pausing  to  feed  or 
crouching  to  listen  to  the  voices  of  the  night. 

Alone  in  the  autumn  woods,  when  through  the  shivering 
trees  I  see  the  angry  yellow  streaks  of  the  sunset,  and  the 
dead  leaves  fall  across  a  sky  that  threatens  storm. 


SIVOEI—CHATTEETON.  33 

By  the  sea,  when  the  cold  mists  rise,  and  hollow  murmurs, 
like  the  low  wail  of  lost  spirits,  rush  along  the  beach. 

In  some  still  valley  in  the  South,  in  midsummer,  the  slate- 
coloured  moth  on  the  rock  flashes  suddenly  into  crimson  and 
takes  wing ;  the  bright-eyed  lizard  darts  timorously,  and  the 
singing  of  the  grasshopper  never  ceases  in  the  long  grass ; 
the  air  is  heavy  and  slumberous  with  insect  life  and  tho 
breath  of  flowers.  I  can  see  the  blue  sky — intense  blue, 
mirrored  in  the  lake — and  a  bird  floats  mirrored  in  the  blue, 
and  over  the  shining  water  comes  the  sound,  breaking  the 
singing  silences  of  nature :  such  things  are  in  our  dreams  ! 

It  is  thus  only  I  can  hear  again  the  spirit  voice  of  thy 
Cremona,  dead  master,  but  not  at  St.  James's  Hall;  DO 
longer  in  the  crowded  haunts  of  men  as  once.  Its  body  only 
is  there :  its  soul  was  the  very  soul  of  the  master  who  has 
passed  to  where  the  chiming  is  "  after  the  chiming  of  the 
eternal  spheres/' 

I  heard  other  great  players :  Sivom,  delicate,  refined,  with 

a  perfect  command  of  his  instrument — a  pupil  of  PAGANINI'S, 

playing  all  his  pieces,  and  probably  no  more  like 

SIVOKI,     him  than   a   Roman  candle   is   like   a   meteor; 

'  CHATTERTON  on  the  harp,  a  thankless  instrument, 

without  variety  and  never  in  tune,  whose  depths  are  quickly 

sounded — an  arpeggio,  a  few  harmonics,  a  few  full  glorious

chords,  an  ethereal  whispering,  and  da  capo  \  PIATTI  on  the 
violoncello — a  truly  disembodied  violoncello — so  pure  and 
free  from  catgut  and  rosin  came  the  sound ;  and  pianists 
innumerable  in  later  days.  But  if,  looking  back  and  up  to 
the  present  hour,  I  am  asked  to  name  off-hand  the  greatest 
players — the  very  greatest  I  have  heard — I  say  at  once 
ERNST,  LISZT,  RUBINSTEIN. 


II. 

BRIGHTON    AND    THE    ISLE    OF   WIGHT. 
1850-1356. 

FROM  such  heights  I  am  loth  to  return  to  my  own  insig- 
nificant doings,  but  they  happen  to  supply    me   with   the 
o          framework  for  my  present  meditations:  they  are, 
MY  SECOND  in  fact,  the  pegs  on  which  1  have  chosen  to  hang 
my  thoughts.     I  was  at  a  complete  standstill :  I 
sorely  needed  instruction.     I  went  to  the  seaside  for  my 
health.     One   day,  in  the  morning,  I  entered  the  concert 
room  of  the  town  hall  at  Margate.     It  was  empty,  but  on  a 
platform  at  the  farther  end,  half  a  dozen  musicians  were 
rehearsing.     One  sat  up  at  a  front  desk  and  seemed  to  be 
leading  on  the  violin.     As  they  paused,  I  walked  straight 
up  to  him.     I  was  about  twelve  then. 


MY  SECOND  MASTER.  35 

"  Please,  sir/'  I  began  rather  nervously,  "  do  you  teach 
the  violin  ?  " 

He  looked  round  rather  surprised,  but  in  another  moment 
he  smiled  kindly,  and  said  : 

"  Why,  yes — at  least,"  he  added,  "  that  depends.  Do  you 
mean  you  want  to  learn  ?  " 

"  That 's  it,"  I  said,  "  I  have  learned  a  little.  Will  you 
teach  me  ?  " 

t(  Wait  a  bit.  I  must  finish  here  first,  and  then  I  '11 
come  down  to  you.  Can. you  wait  ?  "  he  added,  cheerily. 

I  had  been  terribly  nervous  when  I  began  to  ask  him,  but 
now  I  felt  my  heart  beating  with  joy. 

"  Oh  yes/'  I  said,  "  I  can  wait !  "  and  I  waited  and  heard 
them  play,  and  watched  every  motion  of  one  whom  I  already 
looked  upon  as  my  master. 

And  he  became  my  master — my  first  real  master.  Good, 
patient  MR.  DEVONPOBT  !  I  took  to  him,  and  he  took  to  me 
at  once.  He  got  me  to  unlearn  all  my  slovenly  ways,  taught 
me  how  to  hold  my  fiddle  and  how  to  finger  and  how  to  bow. 
It  seems  I  did  everything  wrong.  He  used  to  write  out 
KREUTZER'S  early  exercises,  over  his  breakfast,  and  bring  them 
to  me  all  blotted,  in  pen  and  ink,  and  actually  got  into 
disgrace,  so  he  said,  with  his  landlady,  for  inking  the  table- 
cloth !  That  seemed  to  me  heroic ;  but  who  would  not  have 
mastered  the  crabbed  bowing,  the  ups  and  downs  and 
staccatos,  and  slur  two  and  bow  one,  and  slur  three  and  bow 
one,  and  slur  two  and  two,  after  that !  And  I  did  my  best, 

3  *  ' 


36         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

though  not  to  his  satisfaction;  but  he  never  measured  his 
time  with  me,  and  he  had  an  indefinitely  sweet  way  with 
him  which  won  me  greatly,  and  made  me  love  my  violin — a 
five-pound  VUILHAUME  copy  of  STRADIVARIUS,  crude  in  tone 
— more  than  ever. 

When  I  left  the  sea,  I  lost  my  master.  I  never  saw  him 
again.  If  he  is  alive  now,  and  these  lines  should  chance  to 
meet  his  eye,  I  will  join  hands  with  him  across  the  years. 
"Why  should  he  not  be  alive  ?  HULLAH  and  SAINTON  and 
PIATTI  andMB  DOLBY  and  MKLiND-GoLDSCHMiDT,  and  I  know 
not  how  many  more  of  his  contemporaries,  and  my  elders, 
are  alive.  Only  there  was  a  sadness  and  delicacy  about  that 
pale  diaphanous  face,  its  hectic  flush,  its  light  hair,  and  slight 
fringe  of  moustache ;  I  can  remember  it  so  well ;  and  I  must 
own,  too,  there  was  a  little  cough,  which  makes  me  fear  that 
DEVONPORT  was  not  destined  to  live  long.  Someone  remarked 
it  at  the  time,  but  I  thought  nothing  of  it  then. 

I  made  a  great  stride  under  DEVONPORT,  and  my  next 
master,  whom  I  disliked  exceedingly,  was  a  young  Pole, 

LAPINSKI,  who  could  not  speak  a  word  of  English, 
28.  r 

MY  THIKD  Our  lessons  were  very  dull.  He  taught  me  little, 
but  he  taught  me  something — the  art  of  making 
my  fingers  ache — the  great  art,  according  to  JOACHIM. 
My  time  with  him  was  pure  drudgery,  unrelieved  by  a 
single  glow  of  pleasure,  or  gleam  of  recreation ;  he  was  a 
dogged  and  hard  task-master,  knew  exactly  what  he  meant. 


THE  MYSTERY  OF  TEACHING.  87 

and  was  utterly  indifferent  to  the  likes  and  dislikes  of  his 
pupil — the  very  opposite  to  DEVONPORT,  whom  in  six  weeks  I 
got  positively  to  love.  In  music,  you  learn  more  in  a  week 
from  a  sympathetic  teacher,  or  at  least  from  someone  who  is 
so  to  you,  than  from  another,  however  excellent,  in  a  month. 
You  will  make  no  progress  if  he  can  give  you  no  impulse. 

What  a  mystery  lies  in  that  word  "  teaching*' !     One  will 

constrain  you  irresistibly,  and  another  shall  not  be  able  to 

29.        persuade  you.      One   will    kindle   you   with   an 

ambition   that   aspires  to   what  the   day   before 

MYSTERY   OF  * 

TEACHING,  seemed  inaccessible  heights,  whilst  another  will 
labour  in  vain  to  stir  your  sluggish  mood  to  cope  with  the 
smallest  obstacle.  The  reciprocal  relation  is  too  often  for- 
gotten. It  is  assumed  that  any  good  master  or  mistress  will 
suit  any  willing  pupil.  Not  at  all — any  more  than  A  can 
mesmerise  B,  who  goes  into  a  trance  immediately  on  the 
appearance  of  C.  All  personal  relations,  and  teaching  rela- 
tions are  intensely  personal,  have  to  do  with  subtle  con- 
ditions— unexplored — but  inexorable  and  instantly  perceived. 
The  soul  puts  out,  as  it  were,  its  invisible  antennae,  knowing 
the  soul  that  is  kindred  to  itself.  I  do  not  want  to  be  told 
whether  you  can  teach  me  anything.  I  know  you  cannot. 
I  will  not  learn  from  you  what  I  must  learn  from  another ; 
what  he  will  be  bound  to  teach  me.  All  you  may  have  to 
say  may  be  good  and  true,  but  it  is  a  little  impertinent  anrl 
out  of  place.  You  spoil  the  truth.  You  mar  the  beauty,

not  hear  these  things  from  you  ;  you  spoil  nature  ; 
you  wither  art  ;  you  are  not  for  me,  and  I  am  not  for  you  — 
"  Let  us  go  hence,  my  songs  —  she  will  not  hear." 

My  next  master  was  OURY.    I  fell  in  with  him  at  Brighton 

when  I  was  about  sixteen.     He  had  travelled  with  PAGANINI 

80.        and  was  a  consummate   violinist   himself.      He 


MY  LAST  was  a  shor^  angry-looking,  stoutly-built  little 
OLRY.  man.  Genial  with  those  who  were  sympathetic 
to  him,  and  sharp,  savage,  and  sarcastic  with  others  —  he 
made  many  enemies,  and  was  unscrupulous  in  his  language. 
I  found  he  had  been  unlucky,  and  I  hardly  wonder  at  it  ; 
for  a  man  more  uncertain,  unstable,  and  capricious  in  temper 
I  never  met  —  but  he  was  an  exquisite  player  ;  his  fingers 
were  thick  and  plump,  his  hand  was  fat  and  short,  not 
unlike  that  of  poor  JAELL,  the  late  pianist.  How  he  could 
stop  his  intervals  in  tune  and  execute  passages  of  exceeding 
delicacy  with  such  hands  was  a  mystery  to  me  ;  but  JAELL 
did  things  even  more  amazing  with  his  —  stretching  the  most 
impossible  intervals,  and  bowling  his  fat  hands  up  and  down 
the  key-board  like  a  couple  of  galvanised  balls. 

I  was  at  this  time  about  sixteen  and  a  member  of  the 
Brighton  Symphony  Society.  We  played  the  symphonies  of 
the  old  masters  to  not  very  critical  audiences  in  the  Pavilion, 
and  I  have  also  played  in  the  Brighton  Town  Hall.  It  was 
at  these  meetings  I  first  fell  in  with  OURY. 

I  noticed  a  little  group  in  the  ante-room  on  one  of  the 


OURY.  39 

rehearsal  nights;  they  were  chattering  round  a  thickset 
crotchety-looking  little  man  and  trying  to  persuade  him  to 
do  something.  He  held  his  fiddle,  but  would  not  easily 
yield  to  their  entreaties.  They  were  asking  him  to  play. 
At  last  he  raised  his  Cremona  to  his  chin  and  began  to 
improvise.  What  fancy  and  delicacy  and  execution  !  what 
refinement !  His  peculiar  gift  lay  not  only  in  a  full  round 
tone,  but  in  the  musical "  embroideries  " — the  long  flourishes, 
the  torrents  of  multitudinous  notes  ranging  all  over  the 
instrument.  I  can  liken  those  astonishing  violin  passages  to 
nothing  but  the  elaborate  embroidery  of  little  notes  which 
in  CHOPIN'S  music  are  spangled  in  tiny  type  all  round  the 
subject,  which  is  in  large  type.  When  OURY  was  in  a  good 
humour  he  would  gratify  us  in  this  way,  and  then  stop 
abruptly,  and  nothing  after  that  would  induce  him  to  play 
another  note.  He  had  the  fine  large  style  of  the  DE  BEEIOT 
school,  combined  with  a  dash  of  the  brilliant  and  romantic 
PAGANINI,  and  the  most  exquisite  taste  of  his  own.  In 
those  days  DE  BERIOT'S  music  reigned  supreme  in  the 
concert-room  until  the  appearance  of  PAGANINI.  It  had  not 
yet  gone  out  of  fashion,  and  I  remember  hearing  OURY* 

*  "  Do  we  not  remember  him,"  writes  a  correspondent  in  August  1883, 
"  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century  ago  in  Brighton,  when  hia  name  was 
foremost  on  the  programme  of  every  public  musical  entertainment ;  and 
his  wife,  Madame  de  Belleville  Oury,  the  most  artistic  pianoforte  per- 
former of  her  day.  But  time  has  at  length  played  out  poor  old  Oury, 
his  latter  days  were  passed  in  peace  at  Norwich,  and  there  it  was,  as  his 
nephew,  Mr.  Crook,  informed  me,  he  shifted  his  mortal  coil  a  fortnight 
since  at  the  ripe  age  of  83." 


40         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

play  DR  BERIOT'S  showy  first  concerto  -with  a  full  orchestra, 
at  the  Pavilion,  in  a  way  which  reminded  me  of  some 
conqueror  traversing  a  battle-field;  the  enthusiasm  he 
aroused  was  quite  remarkable,  in  that  languid  and  ignorant 
crowd  of  loitering  triflers.  He  certainly  brought  the  house 
down.  He  was  a  great  player,  though  past  his  prime,  and 
he  knew  how  to  score  point  after  point  without  ever 
sacrificing  his  musical  honour  by  stooping  to  clap-trap. 

From  OURY  I  received,  between  the  ages  of  fifteen  and 
seventeen,  my  last  definite  violin  instruction.  After  that 
I  studied  for  myself  and  heard  assiduously  the  best  players, 
but  I  was  never  taught  anything.  OURY  had  been  trained 
himself  in  the  old  and  new  schools  of  RODE,  BAILLOT, 
and  DE  BERIOT,  and  only  grafted  on  the  sensational  dis- 
coveries, methods,  and  tricks  of  PAGANINI,  ERNST,  and  SIVORI. 
But  he  was  artist  enough  to  absorb  without  corruption 
and  appropriate  without  mimicry.  He  always  treated  me 
with  a  semi-humorous,  though  kindly,  indulgence.  He  was 
extremely  impatient,  and  got  quite  bitter  and  angry  with 
my  ways ;  stormed  at  my  self-will ;  said  I  had  such  a 
terrible  second  finger  that  he  believed  the  devil  was  in 
it.  I  had  a  habit  of  playing  whole  tunes  with  my  second 
finger  on  the  fourth  string.  It  seemed  more  muscular  than 
the  rest,  and  from  his  point  of  view  quite  upset  the  equili- 
brium, of  the  hand.  He  had  a  habit  of  sighing  deeply  over 
the  lessons, 

"  You  should  have  been  in  the  profession.     What 's  the 


OURY.  41 

use  of  teaching  you?  Bali !  you  will  never  do  anything. 
I  shall  teach  you  no  more." 

Then  he  would  listen,  as  I  played  some  bravura  passage 
in  my  own  way,  half-amused,  half-surprised,  half-satirical ; 
my  method  was  clearly  wrong,  but  how  had  I  got  through 
the  passage  at  all  ?  Then  taking  the  violin  from  me  he 
would  play  it  himself,  without  explanation,  and  then  play  on 
and  say : 

"  Listen  to  me ;  that  is  your  best  lesson,  you  rascal !  I 
believe  you  never  practice  at  all.  Nature  has  given  you 
too  much  facility.  Your  playing  will  never  be  worth  any- 
thing, You  do  not  deserve  the  gifts  God  has  given  you/' 

At  times  poor  OURY  took  quite  a  serious  and  desponding 
view  of  me.  He  would  sit  long  over  his  hour,  playing  away 
and  playing  to  me,  telling  me  stories  about  PAGANINI'S 
loosening  the  horsehair  of  his  bow  and  passing  the  whole 
violin  between  the  stick  and  the  horsehair,  thus  allowing 
the  loosened  horsehair  to  scrape  all  four  strings  together, 
and  producing  the  effect  of  a  quartet.  He  described  the 
great  magician's  playing  of  harmonic  passages,  and  showed 
me  how  it  was  done,  and  told  me  how  the  fiddlers  when 
PAGANINI  played  sat  open-mouthed,  unable  to  make  out 
how  he  got  at  all  his  consecutive  harmonics. 

In  his  lighter  moods  he  taught  me  the  farm-yard  on 
the  violin ;  how  to  make  the  donkey  bray,  the  hen  chuckle, 
the  cuckoo  sing,  the  cow  moo.  He  taught  me  PAGANINI'S 
"  Carnaval  de  Venise  "  variations  ;  some  of  them — especially 


42         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

the  canary  variation — so  absurdly  easy  to  any  fingers  at 
home  on  the  violin,  yet  apparently  so  miraculous  to  the 
uninitiated .  But  it  remained  his  bitterest  reflection  that 
amateur  I  was,  and  amateur  I  was  destined  to  be ;  other- 
wise, I  believe,  I  should  have  been  a  pupil  after  his  heart, 
for  he  spent  hour  after  hour  with  me,  anl  never  seemed  to 
reckon  his  time  or  his  toil  by  money. 

If  I  did  not  acquire  the  right  method,  it  was  not  OURY'S 

fault.     He  taught  me  how  to  hold  the  violin ;  to  spread  my 

fingers  instead   of    crumpling   up   those    I   was 

ol. 

omn's     not   using;    to  bow   without   sawing  round  my

shoulder. 

"  In  position/'  he  used  often  to  say,  "  nothing  is  right 
unless  all  is  right.  Hold  your  wrist  right,  the  bow  must 
go  right ;  hold  your  fiddle  well  up,  or  you  cannot  get  the 
tone/' 

Above  all,  he  taught  me  how  to  whip  instead  of  scraping 
the  sound  out.  This  springing,  elastic  bowing  he  contrasted 
with  the  grinding  of  badly-taught  fiddlers,  who  checked  the 
vibration.  Some  violinists  of  repute  have  been  "  grinders/' 
but  I  could  never  bear  to  listen  to  them.  OURY  poisoned 
me  early  against  the  grinders,  and  all  short  of  the  men  of 
perfect  method.  He  instilled  into  me  principles  rather  than 
rules.  I  caught  from  him  what  I  was  to  do,  and  how  I  was 
to  do  it.  He  did  not  lecture  at  me  like  some  masters ;  he  took 
the  violin  out  of  my  hands  without  speaking,  or  with  merely 


OURY'S  METHOD.  43 

an  impatient  expletive,  of  which,  I  regret  to  say,  he  was 
rather  too  free,  and  played  the  passage  for  me.  His 
explanations  I  might  have  forgotten,  this  I  could  never 
forget,  and  I  could  tell  at  once  whether  what  I  did 
sounded  like  what  he  did. 

OURY  taught  me  the  secret  of  cantabile  playing  on  the 
violin — how  to  treat  a  simple  melody  with  rare  phrasing, 
until  it  was  transfigured  by  the  mood  of  the  player.  He 
taught  me  RODE'S  Air  in  G — that  beautiful  melody  which 
has  been,  with  its  well-known  variations,  the  piece  de 
resistance  of  so  many  generations  of  violinists  and  soprani. 
I  was  drilled  in  every  note,  the  bowing  was  rigidly  fixed 
for  me,  the  whole  piece  was  marked,  bar  by  bar,  with 
slur,  p  and  /,  rail  and  crescendo.  I  was  not  allowed  to 
depart  a  hair's  breath  from  rule.  When  I  could  do  this 
easily  and  accurately,  OUKY  surprised  me  one  day  by  saying, 

"  Now  you  can  play  it  as  you  like,  you  need  not  attend 
to  a  single  mark  !  " 

"  How  so  ?  "  I  said. 

"  Don't  you  see/'  he  said,  "  the  marks  don't  signify : 
that  is  only  one  way  of  playing  it.  If  you  've  got  any  music 
in  you,  you  can  play  it  in  a  dozen  other  ways.  Now,  I  will 
make  it  equally  good,"  and  he  took  the  violin  and  played 
it  through,  reversing  as  nearly  as  possible  all  the  p's  and  f's, 
"bowing"  the  slur  and  slurring  the  c(  bow,"  and  it  sounded 
just  as  well.  I  never  forgot  that  lesson.  At  other  times 
OCRY  was  most  punctilious  about  what  he  called  "correct" 


44         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

bowing.  He  complained  of  my  habit  of  beginning  a  forte 
"  attaque"  with  an  up  bow — an  unusual  perversity,  I  admit 
— but  I  replied,  in  my  conceit,  I  had  observed  RICHARD 
BLAGROVE  do  the  same  thing.  OURY  said,  as  sharply  as 
wisely,  "  When  you  play  like  BLAG  ROVE,  you  may  do  it 
too;  until  then,  oblige  me,  sir,  by  minding  your  up  and 
down  bow,  or  I  cease  to  be  your  violin  tutor."

symphonies,  and  scrambled  over  MOZART'S  "  Jupiter"  and 
BEETHOVEN'S  8th,  very  much  to  our  own  satisfaction.  I 
remember  the  disgust  of  OURY  when  an  enterprising  amateur 
let  off  a  pistol  behind  the  platform  to  reinforce  the  sudden 
explosion  on  the  drum  in  the  Surprise  movement.  I 
suppose  JULLIEN'S  "  British  Army  Quadrilles "  had  put  it 
into  his  head. 

OURY  detested  JULLIEN — why,  I  could  never  make  out. 

I  was  fond  of  maintaining  that  JULLIEN  had  done  much  for 

music  in  England,  introduced  classical  works,  was

"  He  knows  nothing,  I  tell  you;  he  is  an  ignorant,  affected 
charlatan.  He  cannot  write  down  his  own  compositions, 
he  borrows  his  subjects,  he  steals  his  treatment,  and  he 
bribes  a  man  to  lick  it  into  shape  for  him.  MELLON,  his 
leader,  is  a  good  musician;  but  don't  talk  to  me  of  JULLIEN. 
You  admire  the  way  his  band  plays  the  overture  to  the 
'  Midsummer  Night's  Dream/  but  those  men  learnt  it  under 
MENDELSSOHN'S  baton !  MENDELSSOHN  took  an  infinity  of 
trouble  with  those  very  men.  They  knew  the  music  by 
heart  before  JULLIEN  touched  it,  and  they  played  away 
without  even  looking  at  him." 

I  used  about  this  time  to  hear  some  very  good  quartet- 
playing  at  CAPTAIN  NEWBERRY'S,  Brunswick  Square.     The 
34         captain  must   have   been   nearly   seventy  about 
BAINTON  ON  that  time.     He  was  excessively  good-humoured, 
AND       but  belonged  to   the  old  school  of   HAYDN  and 
EN>  MOZART.      BEETHOVEN'S    earlier    quartets    were 
admitted,  but  the  RAZAMOUSKY'S  were  declared  to  be  outside 
the  pale,  and  the  captain  annoyed  me  extremely  by  speaking 
in  a  very   slighting  way   of  MENDELSSOHN.      "  Rides    his 
subjects  to  death/'  he  used  to  say ;  "  tears  'em  all  to  pieces," 
"  goes  thin,  very  thin."     Those  were  the  days  when  I  felt 
quite  sure  that  no  one  ever  had  or  ever  would  write  such 
inspired  music  as   MENDELSSOHN.      I  think  M.    SAINTON'S 
calm  verdict,  not  long  afterwards,  irritated  me   still  more. 
I  said  to  him  with  ill-advised  confidence :  "  I  had  sooner 


46         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

hear  MENDELSSOHN'S  canzonet  or  the  quintet  than  any  of 
BEETHOVEN'S  chamber  music." 

"  Vous  avez  cependant  tort/'  said  the  great  artist,  "  there 
is  no  comparison  to  be  made.  You  cannot  speak  of  the 
two  together.  MENDELSSOHN,  c'etait  un  jeune  homme  d'un 
enorme  talent ;  mais  BEETHOVEN — oh !  c'est  autre  chose  ! " 

» 
The  captain  had  some  fine  violins ;  one  I  specially  coveted ; 

he  held  it  to  be  a  genuine  STRADIVARIUS;  it  was  labelled 
1712;  quite  in  the  finest  period,  and  of  the 
errand  pattern — the  back  a  magnificently  ribbed

slice  of  maple  in  one  piece ;  the  front  hardly 
so  fine;  the  head  strong,  though  not  so  fine  as  I  have 
seen — more  like  a  BERGONZI — but  the  fiddle  itself  could 
never  be  mistaken  for  a  BERGONZI.  It  had  a  tone  like 
a  trumpet  on  the  fourth  string;  the  third  was  full,  but 
the  second  puzzled  me  for  years — it  being  weak  by  com- 
parison— but  the  violin  was  petulant,  and  after  having  it 
in  my  possession  for  thirty  years,  I  know  what  to  do  with 
it  if  I  could  ever  again  take  the  time  and  trouble  to  bring 
it  into  perfect  order  and  keep  it  so,  as  it  was  once  my  pride 
to  do. 

On  CAPTAIN  NEWBERRY'S  death  that  fiddle  was  sent  me 
by  his  widow,  who  did  not  survive  him  long.  She  said  she 
believed  it  was  his  wish. 

This  violin  was  my  faithful  companion  for  years.  I  now

unstrung  from  one  end  of  the  year  to  the  other.  It 
belonged  to  the  captain's  uncle;  he  had  set  his  heart  on 
it,  and  having  a  very  fine  pair  of  carriage  horses,  for  which 
he  had  given  £180,  he  one  day  made  them  over  to  his 
uncle  and  obtained  the  Strad  in  exchange.  This  was  the 
last  price  paid  for  my  violin,  some  fifty  years  ago.  It  came 
into  the  hands  of  NEWBERRY'S  relative  early  in  the  present 
century — how,  I  know  not.  Many  years  ago  I  took  this 
fiddle  down  to  Bath  and  played  it  a  good  deal  there  in  a 
band  conducted  by  the  well-known  MR.  SALMON.  I  found 
he  recognised  it  immediately.  I  there  made  acquaintance 
with  the  score  of  MENDELSSOHN'S  "  Athalie "  playing  it  in 
the  orchestra.  I  studied  the  Scotch  and  Italian  symphonies 
in  the  same  way.

No  amateur  should  omit  ail  opportunity  of  orchestral  or 

chorus  work.     In  this  way  you  get  a  more  living  acquain-

PLAYING,  acquaintance  with  the  "  Elijah  "  and  "  St.  Paul " 
in  this  way.  What  writing  for  the  violin  there  is  in  the 
chorus  parts !  what  telling  passages  are  those  in  "  Be  not 
afraid,"  where  the  first  violins  lift  the  phrases,  rise  after 
rise,  until  the  shrill  climax  is  reached  and  the  aspiring 
passage  is  closed  with  a  long  drawn-out^. 

When  the  violins  pealed  louder  and  louder,  mounting 
upwards,  it  was  always  a  delight  to  me  to  hear  my  own

powerful  first  string  thrilling  through  all  the  others.  The 
conductor  used  to  know  this  passage  and  the  way  in  which 
it  told  on  my  Strad,  and  invariably  gave  me  a  knowing  nod 
as  he  heard  my  violin  at  the  first  fiddle-desk  through  all  the 
others.  I  may  add  that,  as  a  rule,  when  any  particular 
violin  in  a  band  is  heard  above  the  rest,  it  usually  belongs 
to  a  bungler;  but  there  are  passages  where  the  leading 
violins  have  carte  blanche  to  play  up,  and  then,  if  you  can, 
you  may  be  allowed  to  sing  through  the  rest ;  and,  if  this 
be  anywhere  allowable,  it  is  of  course  so  at  the  first  violin 
desk. 

Most  boys  find  it  difficult  to   keep  up   their   music   at

WIGHT  member  SIR  BENJAMIN  BRODIE,  the  great  doctor, 
a  thin,  wizen,  little  old  man,  coming  and  staring  at  me,  about 
the  year  1848,  at  No.  2,  Spanish  Place,  my  grandfather's 
house  in  London.  I  was  then  suffering  from  hip  disease. 
They  asked  him  whether  I  should  be  taken  to  Brighton. 
He  mumbled  something  to  himself  and  turned  away  to 
speak  with  my  father  aside.  I  merely  noticed  an  expression 
of  great  pain  and  anxiety  on  my  father's  face  as  he  listened. 
Afterwards  I  knew  the  great  doctor  had  said  it  did  not 
matter  where  I  went,  for  in  any  case  I  could  not  live.  He 
thought  it  was  a  question  of  weeks.  He  little  knew  how

much  it  would  take  to  kill  me.  People  are  born  long-lived. 
It  runs  in  families.  It  has  little  to  do  with  health  and 
disease.  If  you  are  long-lived  you  will  weather  disease,  and 
if  you  are  short-lived  you  will  drop  suddenly  in  full  health, 
or  be  blown  out  like  a  candle,  with  a  whiff  of  fever  or 
bronchitis.  My  grandfather  died  Rector  of  Aldwinkle, 
when  past  eighty;  my  father  having  been  given  over  at 
thirty-two  by  his  doctors,  as  I  was  condemned  by  SIR 
BENJAMIN  BRODIE  at  eleven,  became  Rector  of  Slaughara, 
Sussex,  at  seventy-two,  and  was  made  a  Canon  and  Pre- 
bendary of  Chichester  Cathedral  when  hard  upon  eighty. 
He  picked  up  his  general  health  about  sixty.  I  was  more 
fortunate,  I  picked  up  mine  before  thirty.  SIR  BENJAMIN 
pocketed  his  fee  and  departed.  In  great  perplexity  what  to 
do,  we  cast  lots ;  I  think  it  was  at  my  suggestion.  The  lot 
came  out  in  favour  of  Brighton.  To  Brighton  I  was  taken, 
apparently  in  a  dying  state,  but  at  my  grandmother's  house 
in  Brunswick  Square  I  began  rapidly  to  amend. 

My  violin  was  my  solace,  when  I  got  strong  enough  to 
hold  it  again.  The  time  that  should  have  been  spent  upon 
mathematics,  Latin,  and  Greek,  was  spent  in  my  case  upon 
French,  German,  and  music — I  may  add  novels,  for  between 
the  ages  of  twelve  and  sixteen  I  read  all  BULWER,  WALTER 
SCOTT,  G.  P.  R.  JAMES,  FENIMORE  COOPER,  and,  in  certain 
visits  to  Bath  and  Bognor,  I  took  care  to  exhaust  the 
ancient  stores  of  fiction  which  I  found  secreted  in  the  an-

'BicKNELL,    now     Incumbent    of    St.    Saviour's, 

Highbury.    That  good  man  never  overcame  my  dislike  to 

mathematics,  but  he  got  me  on  in  Latin,  and  he  was  kind 

enough  to  tolerate  my  violin. 

I  could  no  longer  play  cricket,  or  climb  trees,  the  chief 
delights  of  my  earlier  days — nor  could  I  take  long  walks 
with  the  boys.  I  was  left  entirely  alone  in  play  hours — i.e. 
almost  every  afternoon.  I  think  I  was  perfectly  happy  by 
myself.  Freshwater,  Isle  of  Wight,  in  1853,  was  very 
different  from  Freshwater  in  1883.  There  were  no  forts 
built  then,  no  tourists,  hardly  a  lodging  house,  and  only  a 
few  cottages.  There  was  the  Rector,  a  REV.  MR.  ISAACSON, 
learned,  dogmatic,  and  of  the  old  high  and  dry  school  in 
the  pulpit ;  there  were  two  or  three  families  who  owned 
between  them  most  of  that  part  of  the  island  —  the 
Hammonds,  the  Croziers,  and  the  Cottons.  There  was  a 
rotten  steamer  called  the  "  Solent "  which  plied  between 
the  dirty  little  town  of  Yarmouth  and  the  mainland — and 
when  it  crossed  we  got  letters ;  and  when  it  did  not  cross 
we  went  without.  And  there  was  such  utter  solitude  for 
me,  in  the  silent  lanes,  the  summer  woodlands,  and  by  the 
lovely  sea-shore,  that — well — I  had  plenty  of  time  to  think. 
I  sat  on  stiles  and  thought ;  I  tasted  almost  every  kind  of

berry  and  herb  that  grew  iu  the  hedges.  I  watched  the 
butterflies  and  the  teeming  insect  life,  and  I  would  lie  down 
in  the  woody  recesses  and  leafy  coverts  like  one  dead,  until 
the  birds,  the  rabbits,  and  even  the  weasels  and  stoats  came 
close  enough  for  me  to  see  their  exquisitely  clean  soft 
fur,  bright  eyes,  or  radiant  plumage.  I  have  surprised 
a  wild  hawk  on  her  nest  in  the  gorse,  and  she  has  never 
moved. 

About  this  time  I  wrote  quantities  of  the  most  dismal 
poetry,  which  appeared  at  intervals  in  the  columns  of  the 
Brighton  papers.  It  was  naturally  a  mixture  of  BRYANT 
and  LONGFELLOW,  later  on  it  became  a  jumble  of  TENNYSON 
and  BROWNING — but  such  matters  belong  more  to  literature 
than  to  music. 

OURY  had  already  begun  to  direct  my  violin  studies. 
I  had  ample  time  at  school  in  the  Isle  of  Wight  for  prac- 
tising, and  I  practised  steadily,  nearly  every  day.  I  had  a 
faculty  for  practising.  I  knew  what  to  do,  and  I  did  it. 
I  always  remembered  what  JOACHIM  had  said  about  tiring 
out  the  hand ;  and  with  some  abominable  torture  passages, 
invented  for  me  by  that  morose  Pole,  LAPINSKI,  I  took  a 
vicious  pleasure  in  making  my  fingers  ache,  and  an  intense 
delight  in  discovering  the  magical  effects  of  the  torture 
upon  my  execution. 

I  put  my  chief  trust  in  KREUTZER'S  exercises — admirable 
in  invention  and  most  attractive  as  musical  studies — the

more  difficult  ones  in  chords  being  little  violin  solos  in 
themselves.  I  perfected  myself  in  certain  solos 
at  this  time.  I  had  no  one  to  play  my  ac- 

MY    SOLOS. 

companimeuts,  and  no  one  cared  to  hear  me 
play  at  school,  except  some  of  the  boys  who  liked  to 
hear  me  imitate  the  donkey  and  give  the  farm-yard 
entertainment — including  the  groans 'of  a  chronic  invalid 
and  a  great  fight  of  cats  on  the  roof — which  never  failed  to 
be  greeted  with  rapturous  applause. 

My  great  solos  were  RODE'S  air  in  G,  DE  BERIOT'S  "  First 
Concerto,"  and  several  of  his  "Airs  varies";  ERNST'S 
"  Carnaval  de  Venise/'  his  Elegie,  and  some  occasional 
"  Morceaux  "  which  I  had  heard  him  play  shockingly  out  of 
tune  at  Brighton. 

Then  there  was  the  "  Cuckoo  Solo '' —  one  of  the  pieces 
played  by  the  little  girl  of  six  who  so  fascinated  me  at 
Norwood.  Besides  these,  I  had  certain  mixtures  of  my  own 
— a  mixture  of  Italian  airs  with  some  prodigious  cadenzas 
and  a  bravura  passage  at  the  end  in  the  worst  possible  taste, 
which  always  brought  down  the  house.  Then  I  invented  a 
final  variation  to  the  "  Carnaval  de  Venise,"  more  preposterous 
than  any  of  the  PAGANINI  or  ERNST  series.  This  variation 
was  so  difficult  that  I  could  never  really  play  it ;  but  my 
attempts  to  scramble  through  it  being  always  vociferously 
applauded,  I  habitually  inflicted  it  upon  un discriminating 
audiences — alas !  the  commonest  kind  of  musical  audiences 
in  this  country — though  I  am  thankful  to  say  this  is  far

less  true  now,  and  in  London,  than  it  was  in  the  days  of  my 
boyhood. 

I  said  no  one  cared  to  hear  me  play  at  Freshwater.     Yes, 

some  people  did.     One  autumn  whilst  I  was  at  Freshwater, 

an    old    house,   Farringford,    with    a    rambling 

AT  FARRETO-  garden  at  the  back  of  the   downs,   was  let  to 

RD'      Baron  A. — an  eminent  light  of  the  Bench — and 


*&• 


his  charming  family.  I  forget  how  they  discovered  my 
existence,  but  I  dare  say  Lady  A.  and  the  young  ladies 
found  the  place  rather  dull,  and  they  were  not  the  people  to 
neglect  their  opportunities. 

I  received  an  invitation  to  dinner;  my  violin  was  also 
asked.  I  did  not  reply  like  SIVORI  when  similarly  invited  to 
bring  his  violin  with  him :  "  Merci !  mon  violon  ne  dine 
pas!"  I  saw  to  my  strings  and  screws,  put  together  my 
solos,  and  went. 

Lady  A.,  with  her  beautiful  grey  hair,  her  sweet  and 
dignified  smile,  and  a  soul  full  of  musical  sensibility,  received 
me  with  the  most  nattering  cordiality.  The  eldest  young 

lady,  now  the  Marchioness  of  S ,  I  remember  seeing 

once  or  twice  only  at  Farringford.  Table-turning  was  all 
the  fashion  then.  The  Farringford  circle  was,  like  most 
others,  divided  on  the  question,  but  the  old  Baron  was  a 
sceptic. 

We  all  sat  round  a  heavy  dining-table  one  day,  and  the 
thing  certainly  began  to  go  round,  and  was  only  arrested  in 


54         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

its  course  through  a  large  bow  window  by  the  hurried 
breaking  up  of  the  circle.  I  didn't  turn  any  more  tables 
at  Farringford,  but  Lady  A.  used  to  beg  me  to  come  as 
often  as  I  could  and  play,  and  I  think  I  went  there  on  an 
average  twice  a  week  and  enjoyed  myself  immensely.  The 
Farringford  music  was  not  strong,  as  to  pianoforte  playing 
at  least ;  but  the  youngest  daughter,  Miss  M.,  little  more 
than  a  child,  had  a  sweet  voice,  and  seemed  to  me  altogether 
an  angelic  being,  and  between  them  they  managed  to  get 
through  some  of  my  easier  accompaniments.  OURY  had 
given  me  an  air  of  MAYERSEDER'S,  to  which  he  had  added 
a  pathetic  little  closing  cadence  of  his  own.  He  had  taught 
me  to  play  it  with  due  expression,  and  this  air  Lady  A.  could 
never  hear  often  enough.  The  little  cadence  in  sliding 
sixths  at  the  end,  she  said,  always  made  her  feel  inclined 
to  scream.  One  night  Miss  M.  induced  her  mother  to  sing 
"Auld  Robin  Gray."  "You  know,  mamma/'  she  said, 
"  everyone  used  to  cry  when  you  sang  '  Auld  Robin  Gray.' " 
"  Ah  !  my  dear,"  said  the  old  lady — "that  was  long  ago.  I 
can't  sing  now,  I  'm  an  old  woman  " ;  but  she  did  sing,  and 
with  a  pathetic  simple  grace  and  feeling  which  I  can 
remember  vividly  even  now ;  and  as  I  listened  I  easily  per- 
ceived where  Miss  M.  had  got  her  sweet  soprano  voice 
from. 

Soon  after  the  A.'s  left  Farringford  it  was  taken  by  the 
Poet   Laureate.     At  that  time   I  was  rapidly   outgrowing 


TENNYSON.  55 

LONGFELLOW,  and  my  enthusiasm  for  MR.  TENNYSON  amounted 
to  a  mania :  he  was  to  me  in  poetry  what 
MENDELSSOHN  was  in  music.  I  can  now  place 

TESSYSON. 

him.  I  can  now  see  how  great  he  is.  I  can 
now  understand  his  relation  to  other  poets.  Then  I  could 
not.  He  confused  and  dazzled  me.  He  took  possession  of 
my  imagination.  He  taught  me  to  see  and  to  feel  for  the 
first  time  the  heights  and  depths  of  life  ;  to  discern  dimly 
what  I  could  then  have  had  little  knowledge  of — "The 
world  with  all  its  lights  and  shadows,  all  the  wealth  and 
all  the  woe."  In  fact,  TENNYSON  was  then  doing  for  the 
rising  generation  of  that  age  what  BYRON  and  SHELLEY, 
WORDSWORTH  and  COLERIDGE,  had  done  for  theirs,  only  he 
united  in  himself  more  representative  qualities  than  any  one 
of  the  poets  who  preceded  him,  and  in  this  respect  he  seems 
to  me  still  a  greater  poet,  and  certainly  as  subtle  a  thinker 
as  any  one  of  them,  WORDSWORTH  and  COLERIDGE  not 
excepted. 

All  this  is  an  after- thought.  Then  I  did  not  analyse  or 
compare.  The  Brighton  papers  received  elaborate  prose 
effusions  from  my  pen  upon  the  subject,  at  the  time,  of  a 
frothy  and  rhetorical  character.  Sometimes  I  look  at  them 
in  my  old  scrap-books,  and  marvel  at  the  bombast,  inflation, 
and  prodigious  inanity  of  the  matter  and  the  style.  No 
doubt  I  was  not  quite  right  in  my  head  about  TENNYSON, 
and  this  accounts  for  my  wending  my  steps  towards  Farring- 
ford  one  autumn  afternoon,  soon  after  he  had  come  there. 


56         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

The  poet  never  went  to  church,  so  the  poet  could  never 
be  seen.  The  man  who,  in  the  "In  Memoriam,"  had 
recently  re-formulated  the  religion  of  the  nineteenth  century, 
might,  one  would  have  thought,  be  excused  the  dismal 
routine  that  went  on  at  the  parish  church,  and  the  patristic 
theology  doled  out  by  the  worthy  rector.  But  no  !  MR. 
TENNYSON'S  soul  was  freely  despaired  of  in  the  neighbour- 
hood, and  many  of  the  people  about  Freshwater  would  have 
been  "  very  faithful  "  with  him  if  they  could  only  have  got 
at  him — but  they  could  not  get  at  him.  Under  these 
circumstances  I  got  at  him. 

I  suppose  the  continued  play  of  one  idea  upon  my  brain 

was  too  much  for  me.     To  live  so  close  to  the  man  who 

42.        filled   the   whole  of  my   poetic  and  imaginative 

MY  VISIT  TO  horizon  without  ever  seeing  him.  was  more  than 

TENNYSON 

IN  1854.  i  could  bear.  I  walked  over  the  neglected  grass- 
grown  gravel  between  the  tall  trees  yellowing  in  the  autumn, 
and  up  to  the  glass-pannelled  doors,  as  bold  as  fate. 

"Mn.  TENNYSON/'  said  the  maid,  "saw  no  one/'  I  was 
aware  of  that.  Was  MRS.  TENNYSON  at  home  ?  Perhaps 
she  would  see  me  ?  The  servant  looked  dubious.  I  was  a 
shabby-looking  student,  sure  enough,  but  there  was  some- 
thing about  me  which  could  not  be  said  nay  !  I  evidently 
meant  to  get  in,  and  in  I  got. 

In  another  moment  I  found  myself  in  the  drawing-room 
lately  tenanted  by  the  Baron  and  Lady  A. 


MY  VISIT  TO  TENNYSON  IN  1854.  57 

There  was  the  arm-chair  where  lady  A.  had  sat  reclining, 
with  her  head  resting  on  a  little  cushion,  as  she  sang 
"  Auld  Robin  Gray." 

There  was  the  piano  beside  which  Miss  M.  stood  and  sang 
very  shyly  and  under  protest  in  her  simple  white  muslin 
dress  and  a  rose  in  her  hair ;  there — but  the  door  opened, 
and  a  quiet,  gentle  lady  appeared,  and  bowed  silently  to  me. 
I  had  to  begin  then. 

I  had  no  excuse  to  make,  and  so  I  offered  no  apology.  I 
had  called  desiring  to  see  MR.  TENNYSON,  that  was  all. 

The  lady  looked  surprised,  and  sat  down  by  a  little  work- 
table  with  a  little  work-basket  on  it.  She  asked  me  very 
kindly  to  sit  down  too.  So  I  sat  down.  What  next?  Now 
I  got  clumsy  with  a  vengeance.  All  my  wits  forsook  me. 
I  looked  out  at  the  tangled  garden — everything  was  allowed 
to  grow  wild.  I  had  to  say  something.  I  looked  at  the 
kind  lady,  who  had  already  taken  up  her  work  and  begun 
plying  her  needle.  I  said  that  my  admiration  for  MR. 
TENNYSON'S  poems  was  so  great  that,  as  I  was  living  in  the 
neighbourhood,  I  had  called  with  an  earnest  desire  to  see 
him.  I  then  began  to  repeat  that  I  considered  his  poems 
so  exquisite  that — a  smile  was  on  the  kind  lady's  face  as  she 
listened  for  the  thousand  and  first  time  to  such  large  and 
general  praises  of  the  Laureate's  genius.  But  the  smile 
somehow  paralysed  me.  She  evidently  considered  me  a 
harmless  lunatic,  not  an  impertinent  intruder. 

This  was  fortunate,  for  had  I  been  summarily  shown  the 


58         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

door  I  should  not  have  been  surprised.  I  should  not  have 
gone,  for  I  was  desperate  and  prepared  to  show  fight,  and 
be  kicked  out,  if  needful,  by  the  Laureate  alone ;  but  the 
Fates  were  propitious. 

Said  MRS.  TENNYSON,  "  My  husband  is  always  very  busy, 
and  I  do  not  at  all  think  it  likely  he  can  see  you." 

"  Do  you  think  he  would  if  you  ask  him  ?  "  I  stammered 
out. 

Said  MRS.  TENNYSON,  a  little  taken  aback,  "I  don't 
know." 

"  Then,"  said  I,  pursuing  my  advantage  with,  if  any  calm 
at  all,  the  calmness  of  a  calm  despair,  "  would  you  object 
to  asking  him  to  see  me,  if  only  for  an  instant  ?  " 

What  passed  in  that  indulgent  lady's  mind  I  shall  never 
know ;  the  uppermost  thought  was  probably  not  flattering 
to  me,  and  her  chief  desire  was,  no  doubt,  to  get  rid  pf  me. 
"  He  won't  go  till  he  has  seen  my  husband — he  ought  never 
to  have  got  in  ;  but  as  he  is  here,  I  '11  manage  it  and  have 
done  with  him " ;  or  she  might  have  reflected  thus  :  "  The 
poor  fellow  is  not  right  in  his  head ;  it  would  be  a  charity 
to  meet  him  half-way,  and  not  much  trouble." 

At  any  rate  at  this  juncture  MRS.  TENNYSON  rose  and  left 
the  room.  She  was  gone  about  four  minutes  by  the  clock. 
It  seemed  to  me  four  hours.  What  I  went  through  in  those 
four  minutes  no  words  can  utter.  "  Will  he  come  ?  I 
almost  hope  he  won't.  If  he  won't  come,  I  shall  have  done 
all  I  could  to  see  him,  without  experiencing  a  shock  to 


MY  VISIT  TO  TENNYSON  IN  1854.  59 

which  my  nervous  system  is  quite  unequal."  At  that 
moment,  indeed,  I  was  trembling  with  excitement  from  top 
to  toe.  I  thought  I  would  try  and  recollect  some  of  his 
own  sublime  verse,  it  might  steady  me  a  little.  I  knew 
volumes  of  it  by  heart — couldn't  recollect  a  line  anywhere, 

except — 

Wrinkled  ostler  grim  and  thin, 

Here  is  custom  come  your  way, 
Take  my  brute  and  lead  him  in, 
Stuff  his  ribs  with  mouldy  hay. 

I  believe  I  was  muttering  this  mechanically  when  I  heard 
a  man's  voice  close  outside  the  door. 

"  Who  is  it  ?     Is  it  an  impostor  ?  " 

Ah,  verily,  the  word  smote  me  to  the  heart.  What  right 
had  I  to  be  there  ?  Conscience  said,  "  Thou  art  the  man  !  " 
I  would  have  willingly  disappeared  into  my  boots,  like  the 
genius  in  the  fairy  tale.  "  O,  that  this  too,  too  solid  flesh 
would  melt";  but  I  remained  palpable  and  motionless — 
glued  to  the  spot. 

In  another  moment  the  door  opened.  The  man  whose 
voice  I  had  heard — in  other  words,  MR.  TENNYSON — entered. 

He  was  not  in  Court-dress;  he  had  not  got  a  laurel 
wreath  on  his  head,  nor  a  lily  in  his  hand — not  even  a 
harp. 

It  was  in  the  days  when  he  shaved.  I  have  two  portraits 
of  him  without  a  beard.  I  believe  they  are  very  rare 
now. 

I  thought  it  would  be  inappropriate  to  prostrate  myself 


60         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

so  I  remained  standing  and  stupefied.  He  advanced  towards 
me  and  shook  hands  without  cordiality.  Why  should  he  be 
cordial  ?  I  began  desperately  to  say  that  I  had  the  greatest 
admiration  for  his  poetry ;  that  I  could  not  bear  to  leave  the 
island  without  seeing  him.  He  soon  stopped  me,  and  taking 
a  card  of  CAPTAIN  CROZIER'S  which  lay  on  the  table,  asked  me 
if  I  knew  him.  I  said  I  did,  and  described  his  house  and 
grounds  in  the  neighbourhood  of  Freshwater. 

I  have  no  recollection  of  anything   else,  but  I   believe 

some  allusion  was  made  to  Baron  A ,  when  the  poet 

observed  abruptly,  "  Now  I  must  go ;  good-bye  !  "  and  he 
went.  And  that  was  all  I  saw  of  MR.  TENNYSON  for  nearly 
thirty  years.  The  next  time  I  set  eyes  on  him  was  one 
Sunday  morning,  about  twenty-eight  years  later.  He  came 
up  the  side  aisle  of  my  church,  St.  James,  Westmoreland 
Street,  Marylebone,  an.d,  with  his  son  HALLAM,  sat  near  the 
pulpit,  almost  in  the  very  spot  that  had  been  pointed  out 
to  me  when  I  was  appointed  incumbent  as  the  pew  occupied 
by  HALLAM  the  historian  and  Iris  son  ARTHUR — the  ARTHUR 
of  the  "  In  Memoriam." 

But  I  have  not  quite  done  with  the  interview  at  Fresh- 
water.    As  the  poet  retired,  MRS.  TENNYSON  re-entered  and 

sat  down  again  at  her  work-table.     To  her  sur- 
43. 
MRS.       prise,  no  doubt,  I  also  sat  down.     The  fact  is,  I 

had  crossed  the  Rubicon,  and  was  now  in  a  state 
of  considerable  elation  and  perfectly  reckless.     I   thanked 


MBS.  TENNYSON.  61 

her  effusively  for  the  privilege  I  had  had — I  believe  I  made 
several  tender  and  irrelevant  inquiries  after  the  poet's  health, 
and  wound  up  with  earnestly  requesting  her  to  give  me  a  bit 
of  his  handwriting. 

This  was  perhaps  going  a  little  too  far — but  I  had  now 
nothing  to  lose — no  character  for  sanity,  or  prudence,  or 
propriety ;  so  I  went  in  steadily  for  some  of  the  poet's 
handwriting. 

The  forbearing  lady  pointed  out  that  she  treasured  it  so 
much  herself  that  she  never  gave  it  away.  This  would  not 
do.  I  said  I  should  treasure  it  to  my  dying  day,  any  little 
scrap — by  which  I  suppose  I  meant  that  I  did  not  require 
the  whole  manuscript  of  "  Maud,"  which  the  poet  was  then 
writing,  and  which  is  full  of  Freshwater  scenery.  I  might 
be  induced  to  leave  the  house  with  something  short  of  that. 

With  infinite  charity  and  without  a  sign  of  irritation  she 
at  last  drew  from  her  work-basket  an  envelope  in  MR. 
TENNYSON'S  handwriting,  directed  to  herself,  and  gave  it 
to  me. 

It  was  not  his  signature,  but  it  contained  his  name. 

Then,  and  then  only,  I  rose.  I  had  veni,  I  had  vidi, 
I  had  vici.  I  returned  to  my  school,  and  at  tea-time 
related  to  my  tutor  with  some  little  pride  and  self-conceit 
the  nature  of  my  exploit  that  afternoon.  He  administered 
to  me  a  well-merited  rebuke,  which,  as  it  came  after  my 
indiscretion,  and  in  no  way  interfered  with  my  long-coveted 
joy,  I  took  patiently  enough  and  with  all  meekness. 


62         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

There  is  a  strange  link  between  these  two  old  memories 
of  Farringford,  Isle  of  Wight.  I  may  call  it  the  link  of  a 

common  oblivion.      Years  afterwards  I  tried  to 
44. 
THE  LINK  OF  recall  to  Lady  A.,  who  frequented  my  church  in 

her  later  days,  the,  to  me,  delicious  evenings  I 
had  spent  with  her  and  her  daughters  at  Farringford. 
She  had  not  the  slightest  recollection  of  ever  having 
received  me  there,  or  sung  to  me  there,  or  heard  me  play. 
She  reintroduced  me  to  her  eldest  daughter,  the  Marchioness 
of  S.,  then  Viscountess  C.,  one  night  at  her  house  in  Port- 
land Place,  who  was  probably  not  aware  of  ever  having 
seen  me  before,  although  I  remembered  her  well  at  Farring- 
ford. Years  afterwards  I  tried  to  recall  to  MB.  and  MRS. 
TENNYSON  that  preposterous  visit  of  mine,  which  I  have 
detailed,  but  neither  of  them  could  recall  it  in  the  slightest 
degree. 

So  strange  is  it  that  eveuts  which  upon  some  of  the 
actors  leave  such  an  indelible  impression  pass  entirely 
away  from  the  memories  of  the  others — and  what  a 
sermon  might  be  preached  on  that  text !  The  very  same 
scene  in  which  you  and  I  are  the  only  ones  concerned — 
is  nothing  to  you,  everything  to  me.

ACCOMPANTISTS.  63 

I  have  been   a  martyr  to  bad  accompanyists.     All  young 

ladies  think  they  can  accompany  themselves — so  why  not 

you  or  any  other  man  ?     The  truth  is  that  very 

4o. 

ACCOMPANY-  few  ladies  can  accompany  at  all.  If  they  sing 
they  will  probably  try,  in  the  absence  of  any 
musical  friend,  to  make  shift  with  a  few  chords  in  order 
that  the  assembly  may  not  be  deprived  of  a  song.  But 
also  if  they  sing  they  will  probably  have  forgotten  the  little 
they  once  knew  about  pianoforte  playing.  To  accompany 
yourself  properly  you  must  do  it  with  ease  and  accuracy  : 
nothing  is  so  charming  and  nothing  is  so  rare. 

Singing  ladies,  especially  amateurs,  are  pitiably  unscrupu- 
lous, and  moderately  unconscious  of  the  wild  effect  pro- 
duced by  that  fitful  and  inaccurate  dabbling  with  the  key- 
board which  they  palm  off  upon  their  listeners  as  an 
accompaniment.  Now  and  then  a  Scotch  ballad  may  sur- 
vive such  treatment — a  Scotch  ballad  seems  always  grateful 
for  any  accompaniment  at  all — but  to  attempt  GOUNOD  or 
SCHUBERT  in  this  style  is  conduct  indicative  of  a  weak  intel- 
lect and  a  feeble  conscience. 

To  accompany  well  you  must  not  only  be  a  good  musician 
but  you  must  be  mesmeric,  sympathetic,  intuitive.  You 
must  know  what  I  want  before  I  tell  you,  you  must  feel 
which  way  my  spirit  sets,  for  the  motions  of  the  soul  are 
swift  as  an  angel's  flight.  I  cannot  pause  in  those  quick 
and  subtle  transitions  of  emotion,  fancy,  passion,  to  tell 
you  a  secret ;  if  it  is  not  yours  already,  you  are  unworthy  of

it.  What !  when  I  had  played  three  bars  thus,  you  could 
not  guess  that  1  should  hurry  the  fourth  and  droop  with  a 
melodious  sigh  upon  the  fifth  !  You  dared  to  strike  in  at 
the  end  of  a  note  which  my  intention  would  have  stretched 
out  into  at  least  another  semibreve  !  You  are  untrue  to 
the  rhythm  of  my  soul.  Get  up  from  the  piano,  my  con- 
ceited, self-satisfied  young  lady.  Your  finishing  lessons  in 
music  can  do  nothing  for  you.  Your  case  is  hopeless.  You 
have  not  enough  music  in  you  to  know  that  you  are  a 
failure. 

But  you  may  be  even  a  good  musician  and  yet  not  be 
able  to  accompany.  If  you  cannot,  be  passive  for  a  while. 
You  are  of  no  use  to  me.  You  want  to  take  the  initiative 
• — you  must  always  be  creating,  you  think  you  know  best, 
you  impose  your  "  reading  "  upon  me.  What !  you  will 
do  this  when  I  am  the  soloist  or  the  singer !  You  are 
professional — 'tis  the  vice  of  professionals — and  I  am  but 
an  amateur.  No  matter ;  if  I  know  not  best,  that  is  my 
affair;  for  better  for  worse  you  have  to  follow  me,  or 
you  will  mar  me.  The  art  of  true  accompanying  lies  in  a 
willing  self-immolation.  An  excess  of  sensibility,  but  a 
passive  excess.  Yet  must  your  collaboration  be  strong. 
You  must  not  desert  me  or  fail  me  in  the  moment  of  my 
need  or  expectancy.  You  must  cover  me  with  thunder, 
you  must  buoy  me  up  as  a  barque  is  buoyed  up  on  the 
bosom  of  a  great  flood.  You  must  be  still  anon  and  wait, 
dream  with  my  spirit,  as  the  winds  that  droop  fitfully  when

the  sea  grows  calm  and  the  white  sails  flap  idly,  sighing 
for  the  breeze.  I  sleep,  but  my  heart  waketh !  Every  mood

is  finished  my  soul  shall  bless  thee,  and  thou,  too,  shalt  feel

In  my  vacations  at  Brighton  I  suffered  musically  many 

things  at  the  hands  of  many  accompany ists,  chiefly  young

familiar  with  my  style;  but  I  sometimes  fell  among  the 
Philistine  women  at  evening  parties  and  musical  circles. 
In  those  days  musical  taste  at  Brighton  was  not  high. 
No  one  thought  of  listening  to  mere  pianoforte  playing. 
There  were  a  few  good  singers  to  whom  people  did  attend. 
I  remember  MRS.  WELDON,  then  a  mere  girl,  Miss  TREHERNE, 
and  possesssed  of  considerable  personal  attractions.  She 
was  a  charming  drawing-room  singer,  and  was  always 
listened  to  with  respect  in  those  days. 

A  delicious  little  song,  "  Birds  in  the  Branches,"  of  Ger- 
man origin,  made  a  great  impression  on  me  when  sung  by 
a  Miss  CHAPMAN — a  very  handsome,  pale,  refined-looking 
girl — daughter  of  MR.  CHAPMAN  of  the  Overend  and  Gurney 
Bank.  They  lived  in  Brunswick  Square,  and  I  met  this 
young  lady  on  an  average  twice  a  week  at  musical  parties, 
and  late  and  early  she  sang  very  deliciously  and  dreamily,

C6         BRIGHTON  AND  THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

"  Birds  in  the  Branches/'  The  poor  girl  married  a  fashion- 
able baronet  in  the  neighbourhood,  and  died  sh  ortly  after- 
wards. 

Miss  HARRIETT  YOUNG,  the  author  of  several  popular  songs, 
•was  a  brilliant  amateur  pianist.  Her  singing — she  had  a 
light  high  soprano — was  even  more  esteemed ;  people  were 
not  musical  enough  to  understand  the  merit  of  her  playing. 
I  remember  hearing  her  in  the  MENDELSSOHN  D  minor  trio 
at  PROFESSOR,  D'ALQUEN'S  one  night,  and  being  much  over- 
come by  my  feelings  at  the  wild  and  magnificent  close,  I 
turned  to  a  musician  who  was  standing  close  to  me  and 
exclaimed,  "  'Tis  like  going  up  to  heaven  by  a  whirlwind  ! '' 
He  merely  stared. 

D'ALQTJEN  used  to  play  at  CAPTAIN  NEWBERRY'S.  He 
got  one  of  his  violins  when  the  Captain  died.  He  did  a 
great  deal  for  music  in  Brighton.  He  was  an  admirable 
musician,  an  excellent  teacher,  and  a  German  artist  of  the 
solid  MOSCHELES  type.  I  was  one  night  at  his  house 
when  a  telegram  arrived  to  say  that  Sebastopol  had  at  last 
fallen,  and  D'ALQUEN  sat  down  to  the  piano  and  executed 
a  rather  disjointed  but  murderous  improvisation  inspired 
by  the  siege  and  ultimate  surrender  of  that  redoubtable 
fortress ;  the  great  guns  in  the  bass  were  continuous  and 
the  firing  was  very  heavy.  Before  midnight  another  tele- 
gram arrived  to  say  that  it  was  all  a  mistake,  and  Sebas- 
topol had  not  fallen.  Of  course  we  took  no  notice,  and 
indeed  were  rather  anxious  to  conceal  the  awkward  and 


PLAYING  AT  PARTIES.  67 

malaprop  intelligence  from  the  worthy  Professor.  We  all 
felt  it  was  high  time  Sevastopol  did  fall,  and  some  time  after- 
wards it  fell,  and  D'ALQUEN'S  piano,  which  had  suffered 
considerably  from  the  cannonade  by  anticipation,  had  at 
last  something  to  show  for  it. 

In  those  days  the  musical  culture  of  Brighton  was  chiefly 
managed  by  HERR  KUHE,  still  an  ornament  of  the  Brighton 
season,  MONS.  DE  PARIS,  and  SIGNOR  Li  CALSI,  sometime  con- 
ductor of  the  Italian  Opera,  and,  let  me  add,  an  admirable 
musician,  pianist,  and,  above  all,  accompanyist.  He 
accompanied  me  occasionally  on  the  piano,  and  also  in 
another  capacity,  for  we  travelled  together  as  far  as  Genoa. 
I  was  on  my  way  to  Naples.  Li  CALSI  had  started  with 
rifle  and  sword  to  join  GARIBALDI,  like  many  other  Italian 
patriots.  He  got  to  Sicily,  and  got  no  farther.  He  was 
a  Sicilian  by  birth.  He  revisited  his  friends,  and  parted 
with  his  rifle. 

After  GARIBALDI'S  capture  of  Naples  there  was  really  little 

more  to  do.     I  went  on  and  assisted  at  the  siege  of  Capua, 

but  it  was  mere  dabbling  in  war,  and  Li  CALSI 

47. 

PLATING  AT  probably  felt  that  the  work  was  over,  and  well 
over,  without  him,  and  he  might  as  well  rest  and 
be  thankful  at  Palermo,  most  delightful  of  southern  cities. 
But  I  am  not  writing  my  life  abroad,  or  the  story  of  my 
Garibaldian  campaign  at  Naples,  and  I  make  haste  to  return 
to  Brighton.

68         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

The  musical  parties  at  Brighton  were  a  source  of  very 
mixed  satisfaction  to  me.  I  believe  I  always  had  the 
instinct  of  a  virtuoso,  and  I  certainly  had  the  irrita- 
bility and  impatience  of  one.  It  was  not  de  rigueur  at 
Brighton  to  listen  to  anyone,  but  I  never  could  bear 
playing  to  people  who  did  not  listen.  In  mixed  com- 
panies I  resorted  to  every  conceivable  trick  and  device 
to  ensnare  attention ;  and  I  am  quite  aware — as  STERN  DALE 
BENNETT,  who  accompanied  the  first  solo  I  ever  played 
in  a  public  concert  room,  told  me  some  years  afterwards 
— that  I  injured  my  style  by  a  partiality  for  crude  and 
sensational  effect,  which  my  better  judgment  even  then 
revolted  from. 

I  had  the  deepest  contempt  for  mixed  audiences.  On 
more  than  one  occasion,  when  I  had  been  unable  with  my 
utmost  efforts  to  silence  the  roar  of  conversation,  I  have 
simply  laid  down  my  violin  in  the  middle  of  a  bar,  and 
received  the  thanks  of  my  hostess — who  thought  it  was  all 
right  and  quite  "  too-too"— with  a  smile  and  a  bow  far  more 
satirical  than  polite.  But  I  am  bound  to  say  that  the  violin, 
being  in  those  days  somewhat  of  a  novelty  iu  private  society, 
and  I  having  won  a  sort  of  reputation,  I  usually  got  the  ear 
of  the  room,  and  I  may  perhaps,  without  undue  vanity  say, 
usually  kept  it. 

Being  naturally  short  of  stature,  I  have  suffered  much  from 
having  often  to  play  behind  a  crowd,  a  few  only  of  whom 


"MOMENTS  PERDU S."  69 

could  either  hear  or  see  me.     The  soloist  or  singer  ought 
48.        always   to   be  raised,    if    possible.      He   has    to 
"wns^BB81  magnetise    ms     audience    as    well    as   play   to 
SEEN.      them.     He  cannot  do  this  unless  he  can  see  and 
be    seen.      When    I   got   more    knowing,   I   always    chose 
a   vantage-ground   and   cleared   a  space  in  front    of    me. 
The  next   best   thing  to   being  raised  for  a  speaker  or   a 
player  is  to  be  isolated.     Public  performers  often  neglect 
this.     I  have  seen  a  singer  in  a  dark  dress  against  a  dark 
background,  and  half-way  down  the  room  she  has  been  un- 
distinguishable  from  the  chorus  behind  her.     I  have  seen  a 
lecturer  in  a  black  coat,  with  a  black  board  for  his  back- 
ground, and  a  little  way  off  it  has  been  "  Vox  et  praeterea 
nihil." 

As  from  the  age  of  seven  I  have  always  played  the  violin 
more  or  less  publicly,  I  entered  upon  my  amateur  career 

at    Brighton  without  the   smallest   nervousness.

although  showy  (and,  I  blush  to  add,  tricky), 
was  never  as  finished  as  I  could  have  desired.  My  tone, 
however,  was  considered  by  OURY  remarkable,  and  except 
when  drilling  me  with  a  purpose  he  would  never  interfere 
with  my  reading  of  a  solo.  It  was  the  only  point  in  which 
he  gave  in  to  me. 

"  I  never  taught  you  that,"  he  would  say  sharply. 

"  Shall  I  alter  it  ?  "  I  would  ask. 


70         BRIGHTON  AND  THE  ISLE  OF   WIGHT. 

"  No,  no,  let  it  alone ;  follow  your  own  inspiration ;  you 
must  do  as  you  will,  the  effect  is  good/' 

Indeed,  no  one  ever  taught  me  the  art  c£  drawing  tears 
from  the  eyes  of  my  listeners.  Moments  came  to  me 
•when  I  was  playing — I  seemed  far  away  from  the  world. 
I  was  not  scheming  for  effect — there  was  no  trick  about  it. 
I  could  give  no  reason  for  the  rail,  the  p,  the  pp,  the  /. 
Something  in  my  soul  ordered  it  so,  and  my  fingers  followed, 
communicating  every  inner  vibration  through  their  tips  to 
the  vibrating  string  until  the  mighty  heart  of  the  Cremona 
pealed  out  like  a  clarion,  or  whispered  tremblingly  in 
response.  But  those  moments  did  not  come  to  me  in  mixed, 
buzzing  audiences  ;  then  I  merely  waged  impatient  war  with 
a  mob. 

They  came  in  still  rooms  where  a  few  were  met,  and 
the  lights  were  low,  and  the  windows  open  toward  the 
sea. 

They  came  in  brilliantly  lighted  halls,  what  time  I  had 
full  command  from  some  platform  of  an  attentive  crowd 
gathered  to  listen,  not  to  chatter. 

They  came  when  some  one  or  other  sat  and  played  with 
me,  whose  spirit-pulses  rose  and  fell  with  mine — in  a  world 
of  sound  where  the  morning  stars  seemed  always  singing 
together. 

I  was  such  a  thorn  in  the  side  of  my  accompanyists  that 
at  last  they  got  to  have  a  wholesome  dread  of  me.  In 
this  way  I  often  got  off  playing  at  houses  where  people  asked 


A  SACRIFICE.  n 

me  to  bring  my  violin  impromptu,  because  I  happened  to 
be  the  fashion. 

I  remember  one  such  house — the  young  lady  who  was 

to  accompany  me  had  just  come  home  from  school  with 

all  the    accomplishments.     Her  music  was    so 

superfine  that  she    had  even  learned    to    play 

A  SACRIFICE. 

MENDELSSOHN'S  "  Songs  without  Words/'  No.  I., 
Book  I.,  vilely,  as  I  am  afraid  I  told  her  in  language  more 
true  than  polite.  I  was  just  seventeen.  She  was  very 
good-looking,  with  a  considerable  opinion  of  my  musical 
faculties,  and  apparently  not  unwilling  to  be  taught,  so  I 
went  through  No.  I.,  Book  I.  I  was  sanguine  enough 
to  hope  that  I  might  impart  to  her  a  right  feeling  for  it. 
All  in  vain.  She  played  it  like  a  bit  of  wood — mechani- 
cally correct  and  mechanically  stupid.  I  gave  it  up,  and 
took  out  my  violin — it  was  the  morning,  and  we  had  met 
to  rehearse  quietly  for  the  evening  RODE'S  air.  in  G. 
Of  course,  the  accompaniment  to  this  was  simple,  very 
simple,  but  all  depended  upon  the  sympathetic  following 
— a  hair's-brcadth  out,  and  the  whole  would  be  marred. 
I  felt  blank  enough  at  the  prospect  after  No.  I.,  Book  I. 
She  glanced  at  the  music. 

« It  'a  not  very  difficult,  is  it  ?  " 

"Oh  dear  no,"  I  replied,  "the  notes  you  have  to  play 
are  easy  enough ;  you  must  follow  me.  It 's  not  in 
strict  time,  you  know.  I  play  it  varying  the  time  accord- 


72         BRIGHTON  AND   THE  ISLE  OF  WIGHT. 

ing   to   expression,   and  you    must    watch    and  wait    for 
me." 

So  we  began.  I  stopped  her  at  the  second  bar.  We  began 
again.  I  stopped  her  at  the  fourth  bar.  I  was  very  patient 
but  very  determined.  She  was  very  good  and  patient  too, 
but  alas  !  hopelessly  incompetent.  I  stopped  her  at  the 
sixth  bar — I  was  losing  my  temper  a  little.  I  did  not  notice 
her  growing  distress.  I  went  on  saying  rather  hardly, 
"  You  came  in  too  soon/'  "  You  don't  wait  for  me/'  "  Begin 
again/'  and  so  on.  Not  until  I  turned  round  to  rebuke 
the  unfortunate  girl  for  a  new  blunder,  and  saw  a  great  tear 
roll  on  to  the  ivory  keys,  accompanied  by  a  little  suppressed 
sob,  was  I  fully  alive  to  the  situation.  My  angry  complaint 
died  upon  my  lips.  I  muttered  some  clumsy  apology,  but 
she  rose  from  the  piano  scarlet  with  humiliation  and  rushed 
out  of  the  room.  I  felt  like  a  brute,  but  I  was  profoundly 
thankful  to  think  that  I  had  escaped  the  ordeal  of  having 
to  go  through  RODE'S  air  in  G  with  a  young  lady  who  had 
just  given  me  such  a  taste  of  her  quality. 

I  am  glad  to  say  that,  although  her  mother  thought  it 
silly,  this  was  the  first  and  last  time  she  ever  played  in  my 
presence,  or  proposed  to  accompany  me.  This  is  only  a 
specimen  of  the  trials  I  had  to  go  through  when  I  was  a 
violin-playing  youth  about  Brighton  and  elsewhere. 

Some  of  the  best  rooms  for  music  which  I  have  played 
in  at  Brighton  are  the  drawing-rooms  in  Adelaide  Crescent, 


BEIGRTON  TASTE.  73 

and  some  among  the  worst  are  to  be  found  in  Lansdowne 

Place.     I  suppose  I  had  my  unknown  admirers, 
51. 
BRIGHTON    as  one  day  I  received   an   invitation   to   a  ball 

given  by  the  officers  then  quartered  at  Brighton, 
whom  I  used  to  meet  in  society,  but  only  knew  by  sight. 
This,  on  account  of  my  youth,  I  was  very  properly  advised 
to  decline,  as  well  as  many  other  invitations  to  play  at  the 
houses  of  strangers  who  got  introductions  to  me  through 
those  occasionally  doubtful  blessings  called  "mutual  friends/' 
From  what  I  have  said  it  will  appear  that  musical  taste 
in  Brighton  about  1856  was  not  high.  I  can  hardly 
recollect  a  salient  point  to  relieve  the  dull  dead  level  of 
amateur  dabbling.  Here  and  there  one  met  with  a  pianist 
of  promise,  a  strong  cornet  or  private  flute,  with  consider- 
able taste  and  execution,  and  invariably  out  of  tune  with 
the  piano,  and  the  usual  number  of  girls  singing  the  ditties 
of  "Claribel  "  or  "  Virginia  Gabriel/'  &c.,  who  have  at  last 
been  crowded  out,  I  am  thankful  to  say,  by  ARTHUR 
SULLIVAN,  F.  CLAY,  and  TOSTI. 

I  was  always  very  open  to  new  musical  impressions,  and 

very  ready   to   hail  the  least  symptoms  of  musical  ability. 

Amateurs  suppose  that  persons  who  have  studied 

MDSICAL    music,  especially  professionals,  are  hard  to  please. 

This  is  a  mistake.      A  real  musician  gives  you 

the  utmost  credit  for  what  you  do,  and  even  for  what  you 

try  to  do.     He  can  put  up  with  almost  anything  but  stupid

insensibility  and  conceit.  He  discerns  quickly  the  least 
spark  of  talent,  and  makes  little  account  of  deficiencies 
•which  time  and  industry  \vill  correct.  "When  I  hear  any- 
one, I  cannot  help  instinctively  gauging  their  first-rate 
musical  organisation,  second-rate  ditto,  third-rate  ditto, 
fourth  organic  incompetence.  Of  course  there  is  every 
degree,  and  anything  below  second-rate  quality  is  in  my 
opinion  not  worth  cultivating.  The  curse  of  English  pro- 
fessional music  is  the  plethora  of  second-rate  quality.  The 
glory  of  English  amateur  music  is  that  sprinkling  of  first- 
rate  quality  which  towers  above  the  dead  level  of  amateur 
incompetence.  The  dullest  thing  I  know  is  to  listen  to 
cultivated  second-class  quality,  amateur  or  professional.  It 
is  not  bad  enough  to  condemn,  nor  good  enough  to  praise, 
nor  interesting  enough  to  listen  to.  'Tis  the  pretentious 
curse  of  drawing-rooms,  the  bane  of  concert  rooms,  and  the 
despair  of  helpless  creatures  who  struggle  about  in  the  whirl- 
pool of  London  music  and  subside  into  nursery  governesses, 
milliners,  or  marriage. 

There  are  some  people  whose  musical  organisation  is  so 
fine,  and  whose  instinctive  method  is  so  true,  that  without 

that  stern  discipline  usually  essential  to  the  pro- 
53. 
NATURAL    duction  of  the  voice,  they  have  managed  to  teach 

themselves  how  to  sing  modestly  but  faultlessly, 
as  far  as  they  go,  although  not  knowing  even  their  notes. 
Those  people  will  sing  you  a  national  ballad  with  true

pathos,  and  even  a  certain  technical  finish,  which  many  a 
skilled  professional  might  envy. 

I  remember  delighting  in  LORD  HEADLEY'S  singing,  which 
was  of  this  kind.  He  lived  close  to  us,  in  Brunswick 
Square,  and  I  often  heard  him  after  dinner  sing  his  Irish 
ballads — not  invariably  MOORE,  but  some  wilder  still, 
and  some  quite  unfamiliar  to  me.  He  used  to  throw  back 
his  rather  large  head,  and  display  a  very  broad  white  waist- 
coat ;  and  standing  with  his  two  thumbs  thrust  into  the  arm- 
holes  of  his  waistcoat,  and  his  fingers  spread  out  and  twitch- 
ing nervously  with  emotion,  he  would  pour  out  his  ditty 
with  the  truest  instinct  and  often  finest  pathos.  In  this, 
without  knowing  a  note  of  music,  he  evidently  took  exceed- 
ing delight  himself,  and  so  did  we.  He  who  loves  the 
sound  of  his  own  voice  is  not  always  so  fortunate.  LORD 
HEADLEY'S  voice  was  small,  flexible,  and  exquisitely  sympa- 
thetic, and  made  me  always  think  of  TOM  MOORE'S  graceful 
musical  declamation  of  the  Irish  melodies,  which,  of  course, 
I  had  only  read  about. 

I  do  not  think,  on  the  whole,  the  sea-coast  street  music, 
especially  at  Brighton,  has  improved  during  the  last  thirty 

years — the  German  bands,  niggers,  and  itinerant

beach  at  Brighton,  with  a  power  of  expression  that  drew 
crowds,  and  half-crowns  too.  I  was  so  much  fascinated  by 
this  Italian,  that  I  took  him  home  with  me  and  bade  him 
try  my  violin.  It  was  simply  horrible.  He  scraped,  and 
rasped,  and  powdered  the  rosin  all  over  the  finger-board, 
till  I  was  glad  to  get  the  instrument  out  of  his  hands. 
The  fact  is,  the  coarse  playing,  so  effective  on  the  Parade, 
was  intolerable  indoors.  He  was  essentially  a  street  player 
— a  genius, — but  his  music  was,  like  coarse  and  effective 
scene-painting,  better  a  little  way  off.  Once  after  that 
I  gave  him  a  lunch  at  "  Mutton's  " ;  but  I  found  him  dull, 
servile,  uneducated,  and  stupid  to  a  degree,  even  about  music. 
I  discovered  that  he  could  not  write  down  his  own  arrange- 
ments, which  were  so  effective ;  the  modest  harper,  content  to 
efface  himself,  did  it  all,  and  BENEVENTANO  only  provided  the 
general  idea,  and  stamped  the  performance  with  his  strongly- 
flavoured  and  dramatic  genius,  which  drew  the  half-crowns. 
Ah,  SIGNOR  BENEVENTANO  !  your  qualities  are  too  rare. 
There  are  plenty  who  can  play  the  violin  better  than  you, 
but  would  never  arrest  the  passer  by.  You  were  a  child  of 
Nature  more  than  of  Art,  but  you  had  just  that  one  touch 
which  makes  the  whole  world  kin ;  and  the  hundreds  that 
nightly  listened  to  you  with  rapt  and  breathless  attention, 
did  not  know  and  did  not  care  what  school  you  belonged 
to,  for  you  held  the  golden  key  of  passion  that  unlocks  all 
hearts.

CAMBRIDGE. 

1856-1859. 

I  WENT  up  to  Trinity  College  in  1856.     I  was  completely 

alone.     I  had  an  introduction  to  DR.  WHEWELL,  the  Master 

of  Trinity.     But  what  was  DR.  WHEWELL  to  me, 

DK.        or  I   to   DR.  WHEWELL?      Something,    strange 

AND       to  say,  we  were  destined  still  to  be  to  each  other. 

BEDGWICK.     f^.f    ,,   . 

Of  this  more  anon. 

Soon  after  passing  my  entrance  examination,  I  was  sum- 
moned into  the  great  man's  presence.  In  the  course  of  our 
interview,  I  ventured  rashly  to  say  that  I  understood  Cam- 
bridge was  more  given  to  mathematics  than  to  classics. 
DR.  WHEWELL  replied,  with  lofty  forbearance,  that  when  I 
had  been  a  little  longer  at  Cambridge  I  should  possibly 
correct  that  .opinion.  As  I  bad  entered  under  the  college- 
tutor,  MR.  MUNRO,  perhaps  the  most  famous  Latin  scholar 
of  the  day,  my  remark  was  indeed  an  unfortunate  one,  most 
fully  displaying  my  simplicity  and  ignorance. 

TVe  Master  questioned  me  as  to  my  aims  and  ambitions. 
I  had  none — I  told  him  so  very  simply — I  played  the  fiddle. 
He  seemed  surprised  ;  but  from  the  first  moment  of  seeing 
him  I  took  a  liking  to  him,  and  I  believe  he  did  to  me.  He 
had  been  seldom  known  to  notice  a  Freshman  personally, 
unless  it  were  some  public  school-boy  of  distinction.  After 


re  CAMBRIDGE. 

my  first  interview,  I  was  closely  questioned  at  dinner  in  hall, 
when  I  found  that  WHEWELL  was  regarded  as  a  sort  of  ogre, 
not  to  be  approached  without  the  utmost  awe,  and  to  be 
generally  avoided  if  possible.  Of  this  I  had  been  happily 
ignorant ;  and,  indeed,  there  had  been  nothing  to  alarm  me 
in  the  great  man.  His  physique  was  that  of  a  sturdy  miner  j 
his  face,  to  my  mind,  noble,  majestic,  and,  as  most  thought, 
ugly.  But  I  shall  never  look  upon  his  like  again.  His 
walk  was  impressive  ;  his  flowing  gown  gathered  negligently 
about  him.  I  can  see  him  now,  as  he  stalked  across  the 
quad  into  the  Trinity  Lodge.  He  was  one  of  Nature's  intel- 
lectual monarchs.  His  reputation  was  world-wide.  I  shall 
never  forget  that  broad  forehead,  with  its  bushy  eye-brows, 
and  those  flashing  eyes.  I  remember  him  so  very  dis- 
tinctly as  he  used  to  sit  in  the  Master's  stall  at  chapel ; 
his  very  presence  seemed  to  lend  a  certain  dignity  to  that 
light  and  inattentive  assembly  of  collegians,  most  of  whom 
only  "turned  up"  to  be  "pricked  off/'  under  pain  of  being 
"hauled  up/'  In  the  companion  stall  sat  another  noble 
figure,  PROFESSOR  SEDGWICK,  also  of  European  fame,  then 
professor  of  geology,  and  far  advanced  in  years. 

Grand  old  WHEWELL  !  encyclopaedic  mind  !  Genial,  elo- 
quent Scdgwick!  most  loving  teacher  of  fossil  truth!  Where 
are  your  successors?  Ye  were  men  of  large  and  monumental 
type.  When  you  departed,  one  after  the  other,  the  very 
university  seemed  to  shrink.  I  look  back  at  that  time—

gether  at  Cambridge,  whilst  Macaulay,  Livingstone,  Owen, 
Lord  Lawrence,  and  Tennyson  came  to  dine  as  guests 
at  the  Trinity  high  table,  and  appeared  in  chapel  after- 
wards. Truly  there  were  giants  in  the  land  in  those 
days  1 

Whewell,  who  contrived  to  say  something  rude  to  every- 
body he  knew  sooner  or  later,  never  but  once  spoke  a  harsh 
word  to  me.  It  was  on  this  wise.  lie  had  a  particular 
objection  to  undergraduates  standing  on  the  Trinity  bridge 
and  looking  over  into  the  river.  I  suppose  he  thought  it 
mere  idleness — which,  indeed,  it  generally  was.  I  was  in 
feeble  health  at  the  time,  and  one  morning  I  was  looking 
over  the  bridge,  in  the  mild  sunshine  of  spring,  into  the 
river.  By  came  the  master,  with  his  rapid  and  magisterial 
stride. 

"  I  '11  thank  you,  Mr.  Ilaweis/'  he  said  abruptly,  "  not  to 
loiter  on  the  bridge/'  and  he  swept  past  me  angrily,  before 
ever  I  had  time  to  cap  him.  I  am  glad  now  even  of  that 
little  memory. 

His  intellect  was  immense,  his  knowledge  vast,  his  virtues 
many  and. great,  his  nature  rugged  and  combative,  and  his 
kindness  of  heart  undoubted ;  his  faults  were  all  on  the  sur- 
face— they  were  of  an  irritating  and  offensive  character,  and 
any  fool  could  carp  at  them.  I  was  not  fool  enough  to  be 
annoyed  at  the  great  man's  brusqueness,  and  before  long  I 
had  other  proofs  of  his  gentleness,  forbearance,  and  even 
genuine  humility.  On  one  occasion,  in  all  the  conceit  and 


80  CAMBRIDGE. 

"  bumptiousness  "  of  a  freshman,  I  wrote  a  saucy  letter  in 
the  newspaper,  reflecting  upon  the  manner  in  which  the 
Vice-Chaucellors  selected  the  university  preachers.  Whe- 
well  was  Vice-Chancellor,  and  I  repented  and  apologised  to 
him.  I  have  his  letter  now;  kind,  gentle,  and  dignified, 
without  a  touch  of  harshness,  with  advice  like  a  father's. 

Whewell's  evening  parties — called  by  the  freshmen  Whe- 
well's    "  Stand-ups,"    because     undergraduates    were    not 
supposed  to  "  sit "  on  these  solemn  occasions — were  most 
abhorred  in  my  time ;  but  I  lived  to  see  a  great  change. 
•  •  •  •  • 

The  Master  married,  during  my  term  of  college  life, 
Lady  Affleck,  a  charming  person,  and  from  the  time  she 
became  mistress  at  the  Lodge  the  rugged  old  lion  seemed 
to  grow  affable,  and  gentle,  and  apparently  eager  to  do 
what  he  could  to  make  people  "  at  home/'  I  have  seen 
his  wife  go  up  to  him  and  whisper  in  his  ear,  and  the 
Master  would  nod  approval,  and  thread  his  way  at  her 
bidding  through  the  crowd  of  guests  to  someone  who  had 
to  be  introduced  or  noticed.  The  parties  at  the  Lodge 
"grew  suddenly  pleasant  and  sought  after;  the  men  sot 
down  and  chatted,  and  Lady  Affleck — a  thing  unknown  in 
Whewell's  lonely  days — introduced  the  undergraduates  to 
the  young  ladies  present. 

When  he  married,  the  Master  did  a  very  graceful  thing. 
He  sent  for  me  one  morning,  brought  Lady  Affleck  into 
the  drawing-room,  and  said  in  his  bluff  way,  "  Mr.  Haweis, 


WHEWELL  AND    MUSIC.  81 

[  wish  you  to  know  LADY  AFFLECK,  my  wife.  She  is  musical  ; 
she  wishes  to  hear  your  violin."  The  Master  then  left  me 
with  her,  and  she  got  me  to  arrange  to  come  and  play 
at  the  Lodge  on  the  following  night  at  a  great  party.  I 
was  to  bring  my  own  accompanyist.  I  had  played  at 
DR.  WHEWELL'S  before  that  night,  but  that  night  the  master 
paid  me  special  attention.  It  was  part  of  his  greatness 
and  of  his  true  humility  to  recognise  any  sort  of  merit, 
even  when  most  different  in  kind  to  his  own. 

WHEWELI/S  ability  was  of  a  truly  cosmic  and  universal 
character,  but  nature  had  denied  him  one  gift  —  the  gift  of 

music.      He  always  beat    time   in    chapel,   and 
56. 

generally   sang   atrociously  out  of  tune.      I  do 


AND  MUSIC.  ,1   .     ,      i          i       j  .  -i   . 

not  think  he  had  any  ear;  music  to  him  was 
something  marvellous  and  fascinating;  he  could  talk  learn- 
edly on  music,  admire  music,  go  to  concerts,  have  music 
at  his  house,  worry  over  it,  insist  upon  silence  when 
it  was  going  on  ;  and  yet  I  knew,  and  he  knew  that 
I  knew,  that  he  knew  nothing  about  it;  it  was  a  closed 
world  to  him,  a  riddle,  yet  one  he  was  incessantly  bent 
upon  solving,  and  he  felt  that  I  had  the  key  to  it  and  he 
had  not. 

On  that  night  I  played  ERNST'S  "  Elegie,"  not  quite  so 
hackneyed  then  as  it  is  now,  and  some  other  occasional 
pieces  by  ERNST,  in  which  I  gave  the  full  rein  to  my  fancy. 
The  Master  left  his  company,  and  taking  a  chair  in  front

of  where  I  stood,  remained  in  absorbed  meditation  during 
the  performance. 

I  was  naturally  a  little  elated  at  this  mark  of  respect 
shown  to  an  unknown  freshman  in  the  presence  of  so  many 
"  Heads "  of  Houses  and  the  elite  of  the  University.  I 
played  my  best  and  indulged  rather  freely  in  a  few  more 
or  less  illegitimate  dodges,  which  I  thought  calculated  to 
bewilder  the  great  man.  I  was  rewarded,  for  at  the  close 
DR.  WHEWELL  laid  his  hand  upon  my  arm.  "Tell  me  one 
thing;  how  do  you  produce  that  rapid  passage,  ascending 
and  descending  notes  of  fixed  intervals  ?"  I  had  simply 
as  a  tour  de  force  glided  my  whole  hand  up  and  down 
the  fourth  open  string,  taking,  of  course,  the  complete  series 
of  harmonics  up  and  down  several  times  and  producing  thus 
the  effect  of  a  rapid  cadenza  with  the  utmost  ease ;  the 
trick  only  requires  a  certain  lightness  of  touch,  and  a 
knowledge  of  where  and  when  to  stop  with  effect.  I  replied 
that  I  had  only  used  the  series  of  open  harmonics  which 
are  yielded,  according  to  the  well-known  mathematical  law, 
by  every  stretched  string  when  the  vibration  is  interrupted 
at  the  fixed  harmonic  nodes.  The  artistic  application  of 
a  law  which,  perhaps,  he  had  never  realised  but  in  theory 
seemed  to  delight  him  intensely,  and  he  listened  whilst  I 
repeated  the  cadenza,  and  again  and  again  showed  him  the 
various  intervals  on  the  finger-board,  where  the  open  har- 
monics might  be  made  to  speak ;  a  hairVbreadth  one  way 
or  the  other  producing  a  horrid  scratch  instead  of  the  sweet 


,    MY  NEIGHBOURS.  83 

flute-like  ring.  It  struck  him  as  marvellous  how  a  violinist 
could  hit  upon  the  various  intervals  to  such  a  nicety,  as  to 
evoke  the  harmonic  notes.  I  replied  that  this  was  easy 
enough  when  the  hand  was  simply  swept  up  and  down  the 
string  as  I  had  done,  but  that  to  hit  upon  the  lesser  nodes 
for  single  harmonics  was  one  of  the  recognised  violin 
difficulties.  I  then  showed  him  a  series  of  stopped  har- 
monics, and  played,  much  to  his  surprise,  a  tune  in  stopped 
harmonics.  He  was  interested  to  hear  that  PAGANINI  had 
been  the  first  to  introduce  this  practice,  which  has  since 
become  common  property.  But  I  have  a  little  antici- 
pated. 

After  the  anxiety  of  my  entrance  examination  at  Trinity 
College,  which  I  passed  without  glory,  I  solaced  my  lone- 
liness by  making  as  much  noise  as  ever  I  could 
MY        on  my  violin.     I  had  three  rooms  at  the  furthest 
LS'  extremity    of   the    old    court   leading    into  the 
Bishop's  Hostel.     Open  windows  commanding  two  Quads 
made   me   a  very  formidable   and   undesirable   neighbour. 
Incessant  practising  with   a   saloon   pistol — with   which  I 
was  a  crack  shot — on  my  doors  added  a  general  liveliness 
to  the  situation.     Occasionally  I  received  midnight  expostu- 
lations.     It   was  agreed  at  last  that  firing  was  not  to  go 
on  after  eight  o'clock,   nor  music   after  ten.      This   latter 
rule  was,  I  admit,  more  honoured  in  the  breach  than  the 
observance,   and  often  have   I  seen  MR.   FROST   or   JOHN

84  CAMBRIDGE. 

LUNN — musical  fellows  of  neighbouring  colleges — pounding 
away  in  their  shirt-sleeves,  cigar  in  mouth,  at  my  piano 
till  past  midnight,  while  I  myself,  the  present  EARL  OF 
MAR,  and  MR.  GEORGE  COOKE — still  a  notable  violoncello 
player  in  London  (1883) — &c.,  made  up  the  quartet  or 
quintet  in  the  rear.  The  consumption  of  beer  and  buttered 
muffins  after  tea  was  unusually  large  on  certain  hot  nights. 
The  listeners  who  stepped  in  to  smoke  and  chat,  declared 
that  under  the  infliction  of  music  additional  support  was 
absolutely  needed.  The  dean  occasionally  sent  polite  and 
deprecatory  messages  from  over  the  way,  whilst  Messrs. 
HAMMOND  and  BURN,  fellows  of  Trinity,  who  "  kept "  just 
underneath  me  on  the  same  stair-case,  exhibited  a  certain 
angelic  forbearance  with  the  pandemonium  upstairs  which, 
after  the  lapse  of  twenty -five  years,  I  cannot  sufficiently 
admire. 

My  mathematics  may  have  been  weak,  and  my  classics 

uncertain,  but  it  was  impossible  to  ignore  my  existence.     I 

had  not  been  up  a  fortnight  when  the  president 

58. 

i  PLAT  A  of  the  Cambridge  University  Musical  Society 
called  upon  me.  He  believed  I  played  the 
violin.  "  How  did  he  know  that  ?  "  I  asked.  He  laughed 
out,  "  Everybody  in  the  place  knows  it."  Then  and  there 
he  requested  me  to  join  the  Musical  Society,  and  play  a 
solo  at  the  next  concert.  I  readily  agreed,  and  from  that 
time  I  became  solo  violinist  at  the  Cambridge  Musical 


I  PLAY  A  SOLO.  85 

Society,  and  played  a  solo  at  nearly  every  concert  in  the 
Town  Hall  for  the  next  three  years. 

I  confess  to  some  nervousness  on  my  first  public  appear- 
ance at  a  University  Concert.  It  was  a  grand  night. 
STERNDALE  BENNETT,  our  new  professor  of  music,  himself 
conducted  his  "  May  Queen/'  and  I  think  MR.  COLERIDGE, 
an  enthusiastic  amateur  and  old  musical  star  at  the  University, 
since  very  well  known  in  London,  sang.  I  had  selected  as 
my  cheval  de  bataille,  RODE'S  air  in  G  with  variations,  and 
to  my  own  surprise,  when  my  turn  came  to  go  on,  I  was 
quite  shaky.  The  hall  was  crammed,  the  Master  of  Trinity 
sat  in  the  front  row  with  other  heads  of  colleges  and  their 
families.  I  tuned  in  the  ante-room.  Someone  offered  me 
a  glass  of  wine.  I  had  never  resorted  to  stimulants  before 
playing,  but  I  rashly  drank  it ;  it  was  in  my  head  at  once., 
STERNDALE  BENNETT  conducted  me  to  the  platform.  I  was  a 
total  stranger  to  the  company — a  freshman  in  my  second 
month  only.  My  fingers  felt  limp  and  unrestrained,  my 
head  was  half  swimming.  The  crowd  looked  like  a  mist. 
I  played  with  exaggerated  expression.  I  tore  the  passion  to 
tatters.  I  trampled  on  the  time.  I  felt  the  excess  of 
sentiment  was  bad,  and  specially  abhorrent  to  STERNDALE 
BENNETT,  who  followed  my  vagaries  like  a  lamb,  bless  him 
for  ever ! 

But  the  thing  took.  The  style  was  new ;  at  least  it  was 
unconventional  and  probably  daring,  for  I  really  hardly  knew 
what  I  was  about.  The  Air  was  listened  to  in  dead  silence, 


8G  CAMBRIDGE. 

half  out  of  curiosity  no  doubt ;  but  a  burst  of  applause 
followed  the  last  die-away  notes.  I  plunged  into  the 
variations;  I  felt  my  execution  slovenly  and  beneath  my 
usual  mark ;  but  I  was  more  than  once  interrupted  by 
applause,  and  at  the  close  of  the  next  cantabile  movement  of 
extreme  beauty,  which  I  played  better — a  sort  of  meditation 
on  the  original  air — the  enthusiasm  rose  to  fever  pitch ; 
men  stood  up  in  the  distant  gallery  and  waved  their  caps, 
and  I  remained  holding  my  violin,  unable  to  proceed  with 
the  last  rapid  variation.  When  silence  was  restored  I 
played  this  atrociously;  I  hardly  played  it  at  all,  it  was 
quite  wild.  STERNDALE  BENNETT,  seeing  that  it  was  all  up 
with  me  that  night,  hurried  and  banged  it  through  anyhow  ; 
but  the  critical  faculty  of  the  room  was  gone,  so  was  my 
head ;  I  had  won  by  a  toss,  and  although  then,  and  often 
afterwards,  owing  to  neglect  of  practice,  I  was  frequently 
not  up  to  my  own  mark,  my  position  as  solo  violinist  at  the 
University  Concerts  was  never  disputed  up  to  the  time  that 
I  took  my  degree. 

My  most  extensive  effort  was  DE  BERIOT'S  first  concerto, 
which  I    played  through   by   heart,   of  course,  with   full 

orchestra.     It  did  not  go  well,  the  band  was  not 
oy. 
OLDDOO    perfectly   drilled   and   too  often  smothered  me; 

Ar'  but  I  was  bent  on  playing  with  a  full  orchestra, 
and  I  had  my  will ;  but  I  never  repeated  the  experiment  at 
those  concerts.  As  I  was  invariably  encored  I  taxed  my 


OLD  DOG   TRAY.  87 

ingenuity  to  devise  new  sensations.  "  Old  Dog  Tray,"  the 
words  of  which  were  at  that  time  very  familiar,  was  a 
favourite  encore,  the  first  verse  taken  cheerfully,  and  each 
verse  up  to  the  sausage  verse  increasing  in  pathos  and 
emotion  until  the  climax  was  reached  in — 

Some  tempting  mutton  pies 

In  which  I  recognise 
The  flavour  of  my  old  dog  Tray. 

Old  dog  Tray  he  was  faithful,  etc.  etc. 

The  audience  were  never  tired  of  following  the  sound- 
drama  conducted  by  me  through  its  various  stages,  until  the 
sausage  verse  invariably  broke  down  amidst  roars  of  laughter. 

In  my  first  terra,  as  I  have  intimated,  I  had  formed  a 
quartet  society,  which  met  in  my  rooms.  The  two  violins 

were  the  EARL  OP  MAR  and  mvself :  the  tenor 
60. 

MY  QUAKTET  varied,  but  MR.  GEORGE  COOKE  was  our  standing 
violoncello.  HAYDN,  in  some  respects  the  greatest 
quartet  writer,  was  our  staple,  but  we  went  into  MOZART  and 
BEETHOVEN,  and  we  worked  up  the  great  BEETHOVEN  septet 
with  the  assistance  of  the  piano.  The  Canzonet  quartet  and 
MENDELSSOHN'S  quintet  were  amongst  our  favourites,  but  the 
last  movement  in  the  great  quintet  was  a  piece  de  resistance 
which  we  never  quite  overcame. 

To  this  close  and  genial  little  society  I  owe  my  practical 
acquaintance  with  most  of  the  famous  quartets.  I  was  a 
great  deal  too  much  "  about "  to  do  any  real  good  with

classics  or  mathematics.  I  was  playing  somewhere  nearly 
every  night,  and  had  the  entree  at  most  evening  parties  held 
at  the  Trinity  Lodge,  the  Master  of  Sidney- Sussex, 
DR.  PHELPS  —  brother  of  the  great  actor — St.  John's, 
Catherine's  Hall  (PHILPOTT'S,  now  Bishop  of  Worcester), 
HARVEY  GOODWIN  (now  Bishop  of  Carlisle),  &c.  My  town 
connection  was  also  pretty  extensive.  At  the  house 
of  my  kind  friends,  MR.  and  MRS.  B-.  POTTS  (of  Euclid 
celebrity),  I  was  ever  welcome.  There  I  met  ADAMS,  of 
comet  celebrity;  BABINGTON,  who  popped  a  little  American 
weed  into  the  Cam  one  day,  which  choked  all  the  rivers  in 
England  for  several  years.  Many  other  scholars  and  men 
of  science  were  frequent  visitors  at  MR.  POTTS'  house  on 
Parker's  Piece,  but  I  think  I  was  perhaps  as  frequent  as 
any  of  them. 

HENRY  KINGSLEY,  Fellow  and  Tutor  of  Sidney,  met  me 

at  the  house  of  HOPKINS,  the  eminent  mathematician,  one 

6i.        night,   and   was  so  pleased  with  my  playing  of 

HENBY     BEETHOVEN'S    F   sonata  that   he    gave    me    the

me  a  most  interesting  series  of  TURNER'S  water-colours, 
of  which  he  was  a  great  collector.  He  pointed  out  the 
rapidity  and  eager  fidelity  of  TURNER'S  work.  Two  extra- 
ordinary water-colour  studies  of  a  descending  avalanche  in 
the  Alps  struck  me  very  much.  TURNER  had  dashed  off 
the  first  where  the  snow  cataract  began,  and,  rushing  to 


HENRY  KINGSLEY  AND   TURNER  89 

another  spot  lower  down  the  mountain,  he  was  just  in 
time  to  make  another  sketch  before  the  avalanche  had 
reached  the  bottom.  I  also  saw  several  sketches  all 
blurred.  TURNER  had  doubled  up  the  paper,  wet  as  it 
was,  arid  put  it  into  his  pocket,  thus  destroying  his  work 
as  soon  as  he  had  "  taken  his  observation."  In  others 
the  rapid  painter  had  dabbled  away  quickly  over  a  folded 
crease  of  the  paper.  KINGSLEY  had  stretched  it,  cut  out 
the  white  angle,  and  joined  together  the  parts  that  tallied. 

My  father  had  been  a  great  admirer  of  TURNER,  and 
a  great  reader  of  RUSKIN.  I  could  just  remember 
TURNER'S  later  pictures  appearing  in  the  Academy,  and 
I  distinctly  remember  my  father's  reading  out  passages 
from  the  immortal  Seven  Lamps  and  Stones  of  Venice. 
I  was,  therefore,  prepared  for  KINGSLEY'S  attentions ;  and  as 
I  was  able  to  feed  him  with  one  art,  he  generously  gave  me 
all  the  pleasure  he  could  with  another.  I  was  very  grateful 
to  KINGSLEY  for  his  friendly  appreciation.  He  never 
treated  me  as  merely  a  fiddler — this  was  the  tone  of  the 
fellows  and  tutors  and  public  schoolmen  at  my  own  college. 
I  began  to  see  that  if  a  man  does  one  thing  well,  he  cannot 
easily  get  credit  for  doing  anything  else.  I  remembered 
this  when  I  went  into  the  Church  and  dropped  my  violin. 
I  did  not,  indeed,  spend  much  time  at  college  over  my  class 
work,  but  I  spent  long  hours  in  the  University  library  and 
pored  incessantly  over  DANTE,  GOETHE,  HEINE,  and  the 
German  philosophers  —  HEGEL,  FICHTE,  SCHELLING,  and 


90  CAMBRIDGE. 

the  SCHLEGELS — with  dictionaries  and  translations.  I  had 
a  passion  for  writing,  though,  unfortunately,  I  had  nothing 
to  say.  Ma.  W.  G.  CLARKE,  the  public  orator,  and  one  of 
my  examiners,  whilst  declaring  my  hand-writing  to  be 
almost  illegible — a  statement  in  which  he  was  correct — 
observed  with  a  friendly  smile,  which  stung  me  (in  my  heart 
full  of  literary  ambition)  to  the  quick,  "More  at  home 
with  the  violin  bow,  Mr.  Haweis,  than  the  pen — eh?" 
And  I  remember  one  night,  when  I  was  dining  at  the 
Master  of  Sidney's,  the  great  DOCTOR  DONALDSON  saying 
across  the  table  to  HARVEY  GOODWIN  (now  Bishop  of 
Carlisle),  also  one  of  my  senate  house  examiners,  "Well,  I 
never  examined  Mr.  Haweis  in  classics  or  mathematics,  but 
I  can  bear  witness  that,  whatever  he  may  be  in  the  senate 
house,  he  invariably  passes  a  brilliant  examination  in  the 
concert-room/' 

I  could  never  get  the  smallest  recognition  of  any  kind  at 
the  University  from  the  authorities  for  anything  but  music.

quenched,  and,  with  the  assistance  of  one  or  two  clever 
undergraduates,  who  have  since  risen  to  name  and  fame, 
and  whom  I  will  therefore  spare,  I  floated  a  University 
magazine  called  The  Lion. 

My  own    contributions    alone   would    have   been    quite

enough  to  damn  that  preposterous  serial ;  but  GEORGE  OTTO 
TUEVELYAN,  Avho  had  just  corne  up  from  Harrow,  thought  it 
would  be  well  and  pleasant  to  hasten  the  process.  So  he 
issued  The  Bear,  which  consisted  of  short  parodies  of 
articles  that  had  appeared  in  The  Lion.  The  thing  was 
cleverly  and  good-humouredly  done,  and  to  me  the  moral 
was  "  stick  to  the  fiddle."  The  Lion  expired  with  a 
bumptious  roar  in  the  third  number ;  it  contained,  however, 
the  only  readable  article  I  had  yet  written — readable  because 
written  from  my  heart — on  "  MENDELSSOHN."  We  got  a  vast 
deal  of  fun  out  of  our  little  venture.  The  greatest  success 
was  certainly  in  calling  forth  The  Bear  which  slew  it,  and 
a  wag  suggested  that  a  new  University  magazine  should  be 
started  called  David,  to  "  slay  both  the  Lion  and  the  Bear." 

From  that  time  I  ceased  to  instruct  an  ungrateful  and 
prejudiced  University,  but  I  continued  for  some  years  to 

deluge  the  provincial  press  with  columns  of  in-

transcendental  metaphysics,  the  position  of  women, 
and  other  matters  about  which  I  knew  absolutely  nothing. 
A.S  I  now  look  back  upon  those  scrap-books  full  of  articles, 
it  is  inconceivable  to  me  how  they  ever  got  printed.  But  I 
had  always  the  pen  of  a  ready  writer,  and  along  with  it  the 
common  misfortune  of  having  very  little  to  say.  But  such 
matters  only  touch  at  certain  points  my  musical  life,  and  I 
willingly  return  to  my  muttona.

One  day  as  I  was  sitting  in  my  arm-chair  with  an  open 

book  upon   my  knee,   contemplating   vaguely  the   row   of

VISITOR,  jyfy  «  oak  -was  sported/'  and  I  accordingly  "  did 
the  dead."  I  was  in  no  mood  for  interruption.  In  front 
of  me,  in  the  centre  of  my  china  row  of  busts — HANDEL, 
MOZART,  HAYDN,  CHOPIN — stood  MENDELSSOHN'S  bust, 
raised  above  the  rest  and  draped  with  black  velvet,  with 
F.M.B.  in  gold  on  the  velvet.  The  china  face  at  times, 
as  the  light  caught  the  shadows  about  the  delicate  mouth, 
seemed  to  smile  down  upon  me.  The  high  forehead  sur- 
rounded by  wavy  hair,  the  aquiline  nose What?  more 

knockings  !  I  rose  at  last,  and  opening  the  door  brusquely 
was  confronted  by  a  strange  figure  with  a  sort  of  wide  plaid 
waistcoat,  well-made  frock-coat,  heavily-dyed  thin  whiskers, 
and  dark  wig  (as  I  well  saw  when  the  broad-brimmed  hat 
was  off),  yellow  gloves  and  patent  boots.  Middle-aged  ? 
No — in  spite  of  the  wig  and  showy  get  up — old,  very  old, 
but  oddly  vigorous,  inclined  to  embonpoint,  ruddy,  florid, 
perhaps  choleric  face,  marked  features  overspread  now 
with  a  beaming  smile  and  a  knowing  twinkle  in  the  rather 
rheumy  eyes. 

I  never  saw  such  an  odd  man.  My  anger  evaporated.  I 
laughed  out  almost,  and  instinctively  extended  my  hand  and 
shook  that  of  the  irresistible  stranger  warmly,  although  I 
did  not  know  him  from  Adam. 


OLD    VENUA:    A   STRANGE   VISITOR.  93 

"  Beg  pardon,"  he  said,  "  may  I  come  in  ?  I  tell  you,  my 
friend,  my  name  is  VENUA — never  heard  of  me — no  matter — 
old  VENUA  knows  you  ;  heard  you  play  at  the  Town  Hall — 

got  the  stuff  in  you ;  you  can  play  d d  well ;  you  can 

play  better  den  dat — nature  gif  you  all  dis  gift — you  practise 

and  den  you  play  like  ze  d 1  himself.  Old  VENUA,  dey 

say  to  me,  he  know  all  about  it — he  can  tell  you  how  to 
play.  Forty  year  ago  you  should  have  heard  me  play  de 

fiddle  by 1  play  de  fiddle  now;  gif  me  your  fiddle — 

vonderful  tone  your  fiddle — where  is  your  fiddle? " 

All  this  was  uttered  without  a  pause,  very  rapidly. 

The  strange,  rambling,  stuttering,  energetic,  decided  old 
creature  had  now  rolled  into  my  room  ;  he  had  sat  down  and 
pulled  out  an  enormous  silk  pocket-handkerchief.  Then  an 
old  gold  snuff-box.  "  This  gif  me  by  ze  Grand  Duke  of 
Hesse  Darmstadt.  You  take  a  pinch.  Oh  no  !  You  are 
young  man.  You  know  noding  of  snuff — bad  'abit — young 
man,  bad  'abit !  never  you  take  snuff !  Old  VENUA  can't 
get  on  widout  his  snuff.  All  de  bigwigs  take  snuff  with  old 
VENUA — but  where  is  your  fiddle  ?  bring  him  out  I  say. 
Vonderful  tone — let  me  see  him." 

What  a  jargon !  Was  it  Italian,  French,  or  German- 
English  ?  I  could  never  make  out.  In  an  old  book,  only 
the  other  day,  I  met  with  a  short  biography  of  a  certain 
VENUA,  violinist,  who  flourished  at  the  beginning  of  this 
century.  Old  VENUA,  of  Cambridge,  was  undoubtedly  this 
man.  He  was  very  long  past  his  prime  and  utterly  for-

gotten.  I  brought  him  out  the  fiddle ;  he  put  it  to 
his  chin ;  in  a  moment  I  could  see  he  had  played — 
his  touch,  execution,  all  but  his  intonation  were  gone, 
but  his  style  was  first-rate  and  his  expression  admirable 
in  intention. 

From  that  day  I  and  old  VENUA  became  close  allies.  He 
used  to  ask  me  to  dine  with  him,  generally  on  Sunday, 
and  his  ceaseless  flow  of  anecdote  and  dramatic  style  of 
conversation  amused  me  greatly. 

He  had  known  PAGANINI,  he  had  seen  BEETHOVEN,  he  had 
chatted  with  SPOHR,  he  remembered  the  first  Napoleon,  He 

mimicked  HAYDN'S  style  of  conversation,  violin

LK'      him  too.     Yet  this  was  in  1859,  and  HAYDN  died 
in  1809. 

"  Gif  me  a  sobjech,"  says  HAYDN.  "  Zo  ! — here — Tra-la-

his  composition — but  in  de  string  quartet  HAYDN  ze  great 
creator — a  Brince — a  real  Brince  and  founder  of  ze  quartet 
art!" 

VENUA  loved  the  violin,  and  his  impromptu  lectures  upon 
it  taught  me  much — always  characteristic,  humorous,  genial, 
and  to  the  point. 

"  If  you  want  to  make  a  man  irritable,  discontented, 
restless,  miserable,  give  him  a  violin." 

"Why?  "said  I. 

"  Because,"  he  replied — and  I  will  now  resume  to  some 
extent  the  use  of  my  own  language — "  the  violin  is  the  most 
exacting  and  inexorable  of  non-human  things.  A  loose  joint 
somewhere  and  he  goes  '  tubby '  (a  term  used  to  express  a 
dull  vibration),  a  worn  finger-board  and  he  squeaks,  a  bridge 
too  high  and  his  note  grows  hard  and  bitter,  or  too  low 
and  he  whizzes,  or  too  forward  and  one  string  goes  loud, 
or  too  backward  and  two  strings  go  soft  and  weak ;  and 
the  sound-post  (i.e.  the  little  peg  which  bears  the  strain  on 
the  belly  and  back),  mein  Gott !  dat  is  de  Teffel."  But, 
correcting  himself,  he  added,  "  No,  the  French  are  right, 
they  call  it  the  soul  of  the  violin,  I'dme  du  violon ;  and  it 
is  the  soul — if  that  is  not  right,  all  the  fiddle  goes  wrong. 
A  man  may  sit  the  whole  morning  worrying  the  sound-post 
a  shade  this  way  or  that,  and  at  last,  in  despair,  he  will  give 
it  up ;  then  he  will  go  to  the  bridge  and  waste  his  whole

afternoon  fidgeting  it  about,  and  then  he  will  give  that  up. 
A  hair's-breadth  this  way  with  the  bridge — oh  !  the  fourth 
string  is  lovely ;  but,  bah  !  the  second  and  third  are  killed  ; 
a  little  back  then,  and  now  the  fourth  is  dead,  and  the 
chanterelle  (i.e.  first  string)  sings  like  a  lark — misery !  it 
is  the  only  string  vat  sing  at  all.  Give  him  a  fiddle !  "  cried 
the  old  gentleman,  gesticulating;  "yes,  give  him  a  fiddle,  it 
will  make  him  mad !  " 

Interspersed  with  such  droll  exaggerations  were  excellent 
hints,  such  as,  "Leave  your  bridge  and  your  sound-post 
alone  if  ever  you  get  the  fiddle  to  sound  near  right ;  don't 
change  your  bridge  unless  you  are  absolutely  obliged — • 
sound-board,  neck,  head,  nut,  everything,  but  not  the 
bridge ;  a  fiddle  and  a  bridge  that  have  lived  for  years 
together  love  each  other  as  man  and  wife ;  let  them  alone, 
my  young  freund,  vy  make  mischief  ?  "  and  old  VENUA'S 
eye  twinkled  as  he  chuckled  at  h?s  own  joke,  and  never 
ceased  talking  and  flourishing  his  arras. 

It  was  VENUA  who  first  taught  me  about  the  fabric  of 
the  violin  what  my  old  master,  OURY — who  was  a  pupil 
of  MORI — first  made  me  feel  about  violin  playing — a 
tender  love  and  sympathy  for  the  instrument  as  well  as 
the  art. 

What  was  VENUA'S  connection  with  Cambridge  I  never 
could  make  out.  He  seemed  independent.  He  had  long 
ceased  to  teach  or  play,  yet  he  was  frequently  away,  and 
appeared  only  at  intervals,  always  retaining  the  same  lodg-

ings  at  Cambridge,  and  generally  giving  me  a  call  when  he 
was  in  town.  When  I  came  up,  about  a  year  after  leaving 
the  University,  for  my  voluntary  theological  examination, 
I  inquired  for  my  old  friend  VENUA  ;  but  he  was  gone,  and 
no  one  could  give  me  any  news  of  him.  I  never  saw  him 
again.  He  remained  to  me  simply  a  detached  episode  in 
my  musical  life. 

I  think  it  was  in  my  second  year  (1838)  at  college  that  a 
few  friends,  more  enterprising  than  discreet,  revealed  to  me 

a  design  which  promised  to  yield  considerable 
A  CONCERT  amusement,  if  not  profit.  They  proposed  to  get 

out  large  hand-bills"  in  a  town  some  fifteen 
miles  away,  stating  that  a  distinguished  foreign  company, 
consisting  of  Signer  this,  that,  and  the  other,  and  Herr 
so-and-so,  would  appear  on  a  certain  evening  at  the  Town 
Hall,  and  give  a  concert  of  an  exceptionally  attractive 
character.  I  agreed  to  be  of  the  party,  and  we  all  dis- 
guised ourselves  with  false  hair,  I  wearing  a  flowing  beard 
and  ample  moustache.  We  cultivated  broken  English. 
Only  one  of  us — who  acted  as  agent  and  made  arrange- 
ments at  the  inn,  saw  to  the  posters,  and  took  the  money 
— spoke  our  native  tongue  with  anything  like  fluency. 
We  arrived  about  six  o'clock;  the  concert  was  at  eight. 
We  walked  through  the  town  in  heavy  great  coats,  well 
muffled  up,  although  it  was  now  the  middle  of  summer, 
and  admired  the  large  bills  on  the  hoardings ;  my  own

name  was  specially  big,  as  tbe  celebrated  German  violinist, 
HERB  ERNSTEIN.  Things  were  going  merrily,  and  it  was 
rumoured  that  we  should  have  a  full  room,  when  at  six 
o'clock  the  news  arrived  in  the  town  that  one  of  the  most 
respectable  inhabitants  of  the  place  had  been  run  over  on 
the  railway.  This  cast  a  sudden  gloom  over  the  place. 
There  was  talk  about  postponing  the  concert,  but  several 
people  had  taken  tickets,  and  we  felt  bound  to  go  through 
with  it.  Very  few,  however,  turned  up,  and  the  attendance 
was  so  thin  that  it  became  a  question  whether  we  should 
not  offer  the  audience  their  money  back  and  suspend 
operations,  out  of  deference  to  the  wide-spread  feeling.  We 
ultimately  compromised  the  matter  by  going  through  with 
the  first  part  of  the  concert  only.  We  none  of  us  made 
our  fortunes  that  night,  and  we  returned  to  Cambridge  by 
the  last  train  rather  crest-fallen,  and  considerably  after 
midnight. 

The  moon  was  shining  brightly,  the  air  was  warm  and 
balmy.     We  walked  from  the  station  to  the  old  market- 
place.     None  of  us  had  the  courage  to  repair

about   one  o'clock  in  the  morning  would  have  looked,  to 
say  the  least,  odd. 

The  Cambridge  market-place  was  deserted.     We  held  a 
council  of  war.     We  were  in  no  particular  hurry,  and  as

we  could  not  make  up  our  minds  what  to  do,  I  took 
out  my  violin,  sat  down  on  a  stone-slab,  and  waked  the 
echoes. 

Out  of  a  dark  side-street  presently  strode,  or  rather 
shuffled  up,  a  strange-looking  man.  As  I  played  on  he 
sidled  up  to  me  and  stood  gazing  at  me  in  mute 
astonishment.  When  I  ceased  he  gasped  out : 

"Who  be  you,  Sir?" 

"Who  should  you  think?"  I  said. 

"  Dun-no,  Sir;  never  'eered  anything  like  it  afore  in  all 
my  born  days  ! " 

"  Fond  of  music  ? "  I  said  cheerfully,  and  was  preparing 
to  give  him  another  taste  of  my  quality,  when  he  laid 
his  grimy  hand  on  my  arm,  and  peering  into  my  face, 
said: 

"You  jist  tell  me  one  thing,  Sir.  Be  you  one  of  the 
gents  that's  a  coming  down  next  week  with  MR.  JULLIEN'S 
band?" 

"  Why — if  they  're  only  coming  down  next  week,  I  should 
say  not." 

My  companion,  our  agent,  here  plucked  me  by  the  sleeve ; 
he  had  gained  admittance  to  an  inn  hard  by,  and  it  being 
now  nearly  two  o'clock  we  concluded  to  turn  in.  I  have 
come  to  the  conclusion  that  adventures  of  this  kind  are 
better  before  and  afterwards;  at  the  time  they  are  often 
but  poor  sport,  but  they  are  anticipated  with  pleasure  and 
recalled  with  interest.  I  am  not  aware  that  our  secret

was   ever  betrayed,   or  that   our  escapade   was   ever  dis- 
covered. 

Towards  the  close  of  my  career  at  Cambridge  a  sort  of 
rival  to  the  Musical  Society  sprang  up,  which  met  at  Sidney 

Hall,   and   was   largely  choral.     MRS.  ELLICOTT 
68. 
MRS.        (wife  of  the  Bishop  of  Gloucester  and  Bristol)  was 

the  vocal  star  at  Cambridge  in  my  time,  and  her 
services  were  usually  in  request  whenever  the  concert  could 
by  any  stretch  of  imagination  be  called  of  a  private  or 
a  collegiate  character.  On  special  occasions,  however,  the 
Fitzwilliam  programme  admitted  instrumental  music,  and 
the  last  occasion  on  which  I  played  in  public  at  Cambridge 
was  when  I  led  BEETHOVEN'S  Grand  Scptuor  for  the  Fitz- 
william Society  in  Sidney  Hall. 

What  my  life  at  Cambridge  might  have  been  without  my 

violin  I  cannot  say.     Had  I  worked  harder  at  Latin,  Greek, 

and  mathematics,  I  sometimes  ask  myself,  Who 

D«7i 

WHAT  DOTH  would  have  been  the  better  for  it  now  ?  Had 
I  even  got  a  fellowship,  should  I  have  been 
the  better  for  it  then?  Had  I  read  less  miscellaneously, 
written  less  voluminously,  played  less  habitually,  and 
known  half  a  dozen  studious  men  only,  instead  of  hun- 
dreds of  all  sorts,  during  those  three  years  of  college 
life,  should  I  have  been  better  or  worse  fitted  for  my 
after  life  than  the  studious  men  who  went  up  with  me 


WHAT  DOTH  IT  PROFIT?  101 

were  for  theirs  ?  Where  are  those  studious  men  ?  One  of 
the  cleverest  drank  himself  to  death  in  India.  Another 
senior  wrangler — and  not  the  only  one  I  have  known 
suffer  thus — became  unfit  for  several  years  for  all  mental 
exertion,  and  is  now  a  lawyer — like  any  other  lawyer.  Some 
have  subsided  into  the  Church  and  are  forgotten  in  country 
livings,  useful,  obscure,  happy.  Others  were  expected  to  do 
great  things,  but  have  not  done  them.  Some  are  professors ; 
others  fellows  of  colleges,  like  other  fellows  of  colleges ; 
many  are  married  and  in  every  sense  done  for,  and  many 
are  dead ;  a  few  have  risen  to  eminence,  but  these  were  in 
no  one  instance  the  men  who  attained  the  very  highest 
honours.  CECIL  RA.IKES,  who  usually  sat  opposite  me  in  hall 
and  was  freshman  in  my  year,  is,  I  suppose  (1883),  in  the 
running  for  the  highest  Parliamentary  prizes.  GEORGE  OTTO 
TREVELYAN,  who  came  up  in  my  second  year,  always  brilliant, 
many-sided,  genial,  has  added  to  his  versatile  acquirements 
the  qualities  of  a  leading  statesman.  FAWCETT,  also  my  con- 
temporary, is  another  remarkable  instance  of  academical 
distinction  and  Parliamentary  success.  I  cannot  at  this 
moment  recall  any  distinguished  writer,  man  of  science, 
la\yyer,  or  divine  now  before  the  world,  who,  during  that 
time  (1857-9),  also  obtained  the  highest  honours  at  Cam- 
bridge, but  others  might  probably  assist  my  memory. 

Of  this  I  am  certain,  that  the  academical  course  paralyses 
some,  develops  others,  and  exerts  over  a  considerable 
number  no  sort  of  mental  influence  whatever.  Over  me  the 


102  CAMBRIDGE. 

academical  course  exerted  no  sort  of  mental  influence  what- 
ever. I  shall  perhaps  be  told  that  this  was  my  own  fault. 
Perhaps  it  was.  I  knew  as  much  mathematics,  and  quite 
as  much  Latin  and  Greek,  when  I  went  up  as  when  I  took 
my  degree.  If  I  knew  more  history  and  philosophy,  that  was 
not  due  to  the  University  training — the  history  and  philo- 
sophy which  the  University  required  was  just  the  sort  of 
history  and  philosophy  I  did  not  happen  to  know.  Almost 
all  the  knowledge  which  has  been  of  any  real  use  to  me  in 
the  world  I  have  acquired  since  my  University  proclaimed 
me  Master  of  Arts.  All  that  sort  of  knowledge  which  has 
enabled  me  to  make  money  by  my  pen,  to  write  books, 
to  preach  sermons,  to  give  Royal  Institution  lectures, 
to  organise  parishes,  to  write  leaders  and  edit  journals, 
is  of  a  kind  which  the  University  training  not  only  does 
not  impart,  but  tends  rather  to  discourage. 

The  highest  University  training  wins  the  highest  Univer- 
sity prizes,  but  it  does  not  fit  men  for  the  highest  honours 
which  the  world  has  to  give.  These  are  won  generally  by 
your  good  all-round  men,  your  good  classic,  your  senior 
optime  or  low  wrangler ;  and  sometimes — as  in  the  case  of 
TENNYSON,  who  won  the  Prize  Poem  at  Cambridge,  or  my 
late  lamented  friend,  the  historian  J.  R.  GREEN  at  Oxford 
(both  good  classics) — by  men  who  have  attained  little  if 
any  University  distinction  in  either  classics  or  mathematics. 

That  I  did  not  profit  as  I  ought  to  have  done  by  the 
studies  of  the  place  I  freely  admit.  That  I  fiddled  away 


WITH  GARIBALDI.  103 

much  of  my  time  I  cannot  deny.  But  that  I  wasted  it  I 
cannot  allow,  although  a  M.A.  degree  is  all  the  academical 
result  I  have  to  show  for  three  years  of  elaborate  and 
expensive  training  at  Trinity  College,  Cambridge.

1  TOOK  my  degree  in  1859  and  disappeared  from,  the 
University  for  more  than  a  year.  I  was  still  not  in  good 

health,  and  my  father  thought  that  a  little 
WITH  foreign  travel  might  be  good  for  me.  I  started 

with  £80  to  begin  with,  for  Italy  via  Paris,  and 
with  strict  injunctions  to  keep  out  of  the  way  of  the  Italian 
Revolution  then  going  on  under  GARIBALDI,  and,  I  may 
add,  CAVOUR.  How  I  was  nearly  roasted  alive  travelling 
straight  through  from  Paris  to  Milan  in  the  middle  of  June ; 
how  I  found  myself  at  Genoa  in  the  autumn,  and,  being 
seized  with  the  fever  of  the  Revolution,  went  straight  down 
to  Naples,  assisted  at  the  siege  of  Capua — saw  GARIBALDI 
on  the  battle-field — heard  him  address  the  mob  at  Naples — 
witnessed  the  entrance  of  VICTOR  EMMANUEL  into  Naples, 
induced  him  to  write  his  memoirs,  and  corresponded  with 
him,  narrowly  escaped  assassination  on  the  Chiaja,  saw 
CAVOUR,  RICASOLI,  the  young  princes,  the  beautiful  and

unfortunate  Queen  of  Naples,  TURR,  COZENZ,  MEDICI,  ROXDI, 
one  of  GARIBALDI'S  aides-de-camp,  and  all  the  Garibaldian 
heroes  with  whom  I  mixed  daily  at  St.  Angelo,  Caserta, 
Capua,  Santa  Maria,  and  Naples;  saw,  for  the  first  time, 
Pope  Pius  IX.  (to  whom  I  was  presented  twenty  years 
afterwards),  and  was  just  in  time  to  assist  at  the  peace 
celebrations  and  great  Te  Deum  at  Milan,  in  the  presence  of 
the  King  and  CAVOUR  and  DELLA  MARMORA  ;  all  these  and 
many  other  golden  memories  of  the  sunny  south  in  the  great 
historical  year  A.D.  1860  belong  to  another  side  of  my  auto- 
biography, which  I  shall  probably  never  think  it  worth  while 
to  write. 

The  part  which  music  played  in  the  Italian  Revolution 
was  remarkable.  A  certain  gay  and  intrepid  march  tune, 

characteristically  called  "  Garibaldi's  Hymn," 
GARIBALDI'S  was  shouted,  blown,  scraped,  and  rattled  on 

drums  in  and  out  of  season.  The  whole  spirit 
of  the  volunteer  movement  seemed  to  be  in  it.  "When  I 
first  heard  it  at  Genoa,  it  sounded  poor  and  common- 
place; but  as  day  by  day  and  all  day  long  it  sounded  in 
my  ears,  it  began  at  last  to  ring  in  my  head ;  and  by  the 
time  I  got  to  Naples  I  was  humming  and  whistling  it 
with  all  the  world.  To  see  the  jaunty,  ragged  volunteers 
marching  along  the  hot  roads  covered  with  white  marble 
dust,  and  keeping  pace  to  "  Garibaldi's  Hymn,"  is  one  of 
my  most  vivid  memories.  It  was  to  Italians  of  18GO  what

A  LETTER  FROM  GARIBALDI.  105 

the  "Marseillaise"  was  to  the  French  of  1793 — but  as 
much  purer  and  more  joyous  than  that  fierce  and  gloomy 
stave,  as  the  movement  for  freedom  under  GARIBALDI  and 
MAZZINI  was  brighter  and  purer  than  the  confused  and 
murderous  cries  for  liberty  in  1793  under  ROBESPIERRE 
and  DANTON. 

The    most    interesting    memorials    of    GARIBALDI    that

A  FitoMER    ^^'  mem°irs-     I  have  printed  a  fac-simile  of  a 

GARIBALDI,  short  note,  one   of  several  received    about   that 
time.     The  following  is  a  translation : — 

Caprera,  February  8,  1870. 
MY  DEAR  HAWEIS, 

Thank  you  for  your  kind  invitation  to  take  up  my  quarters 
in  your  house,  but  I  am  not  going  to  England  just  at  present.  I  write 
to  you  by  this  courier  in  Italian :  let  me  know  whether  it  is  indifferent 
to  you  whether  I  write  in  French  or  Italian.  I  received  the  numbers  of 
The  Argosy  with  your  account  of  me,  and  I  am  grateful  to  you  for 
them. 

Yours, 

G.  GARIBALDI. 

Looking  back  upon  that  exciting  time  1  marvel  at  my 
good  fortune.     How  I  escaped  the  chances  of  disease  and 

73.  danger   of   all   kinds,   through    which   I    passed 


IIAIR- 


scathless,   I  cannot  imagine.      A  special  Provi- 

BREADTH 

ESCAPES,  dence  must  have  been  watching  over  me.  I 
travelled  nine  months  in  Italy,  after  losing  my  great-coat 
and  having  most  of  my  luggage  stolen.  I  neglected  every 


106  ITALY. 

precaution  and  risked  every  danger.  During  the  siege  of 
Capua  I  was  more  than  once  nearly  shot  by  the  Neapolitan 
riflemen,  twice  on  the  point  of  assassination,  and  I  narrowly 
escaped  being  blown  to  pieces  by  a  shell  at  the  batteries  of 
St.  Angelo. 

To  help  the  poor  Garibaldians  in  the  camp,  I  nearly 
starved  myself  outside  the  walls  of  Capua  during  the 
bombardment.  They  had  my  brandy,  and  my  biscuits, 
and  my  cash ;  often  too  my  broken-down  horse,  and  at  my 
Naples  hotel  the  houseless  and  purseless  ones  sometimes 
shared  even  my  bedroom.  All  day  long,  under  a  burning 
sun,  I  got  soaked  to  the  skin,  with  little  get-at-able  to 
eat  or  drink,  but  coffee  and  bread  in  the  morning  and 
some  wretched  apology  for  a  meal  at  night.  Provisions 
were  scarce,  and  every  restaurant  in  Santa  Maria  was 
cleaned  out.  A  light  shawl  was  all  I  had  to  keep  off  chill, 
malaria,  and  fever  raging  all  round  me.  I  drank  freely  the 
polluted  water  of  Naples.  I  ate  freely  its  dangerous  red 
melons,  inhaled  the  pestiferous  air  of  its  overcrowded  back 
streets,  in  that  monstrously  unsanitary  and  overcrowded 
time ;  yet  not  once  had  I  a  touch  of  fever  or  any  ailment 
whatever,  except  fits  of  exhaustion  consequent  upon  over- 
heating and  over-excitement,  under-feeding  and  general 
bodily  fatigue.  My  rickety  constitution,  which  the  dis- 
astrous malady  of  my  boyhood  had  failed  to  shatter,  must 
have  been  made  of  iron,  and  I  dare  say  I  shall  live  to  the 
age  of  Methusalch.  I  remember  now  how  the  small-pox 


MUSIC  IN  ITALY  107 

spared  me  when  it  raged  as  an  epidemic  in  my  first  parish, 
St.  Peter's,  Bethnal  Green ;  how  the  cholera  spared  rne  when 
it  raged  in  my  second  East  End  parish,  St.  Peter's,  Stepney. 
People  who  enjoy  this  kind  of  luck  usually  get  hit  at  last ; 
but  I  cannot  but  reflect,  with  wonder  and  thankfulness,  that 
during  the  twenty  years  I  have  been  in  the  Church,  preach- 
ing in  London  on  an  average  twice  every  Sunday,  although 
often  feeble  and  suffering,  I  have  seldom  been  absent  from 
my  pulpit,  and  never  once  been  unable  to  officiate,  through 
indisposition.  I  think  few  even  of  the  more  robust  of  the 
London  clergy  can  say  as  much. 

I  was  greatly  struck  by  the  musfcal  poverty  of  Italy. 
Even  the  performances  in  the  Scala  at  Milan  were  poor  in 

comparison  with  the  London  and  Paris  opera- 
MUSIC  IN  houses.  The  street  music  at  Naples  and  at 

Venice  was  characteristic.  In  Florence  and 
Pisa  the  guitar  was  played  with  a  certain  elan  by  the 
young  men  as  they  walked  home  at  night,  trolling  out 
some  graceful  love-song  or  drinking  ditty  with  light 
chorus,  very  different  from  our  heayy  drinking  choruses. 
But  the  mechanical  organs,  with  their  eternal  fragments  of 
VERDI,  were  extremely  wearisome,  and  the  Italian  pianoforte- 
playing,  even  when  good,  had  little  charm  for  ears  accus- 
tomed to  the  inspirations  of  BEETHOVEN,  SCHUMANN, 
MENDELSSOHN,  CHOPIN,  and  MOZART.  Still,  the  romance 
school  of  the  pianoforte  in  Italy  is  a  distinct  one  and  not 


103  ITALY. 

to  be  ignored.  FUMAGALLI  was  a  man  of  real  genius,  who 
died  too  young ;  and  TITO  MATTEI  now  resident  in  England, 
has  won  many  converts  to  the  brilliant,  sentimental,  and 
sensational  style  ever  dear  to  the  heart  of  the  Italian. 
But  the  classical  reaction  at  Rome  (1883),  under  SIGXOR 
SGAMBATI,  threatens  to  make  serious  way.  Less  fertile  in 
melody  than  VERDI,  and  more  severe  than  LISZT,  it  may 
end  in  falling  between  two  stools ;  but  the  ability  of  its 
founder  and  leader,  SGAMBATI,  is  undoubted,  and  was 
duly  recognised  when  he  appeared  in  London,  in  1882, 
at  the  Philharmonic  and  Crystal  Palace  concerts,  as  well 
as  at  an  Italian  matinee  at  my  house,  when  he  played 
with  the  Florentine  violinist  PAPINI,  the  Sicilian  baritone 
VERGARA,  and  my  old  friend  of  good  Garibaldian  intentions, 
SIGNOR  Li  CALSI. 

I  have  a  few  charming  memories  connected  with  music 
in    Italy,    but    they   all    circle   round    my    valued    friend, 

C.  H.  DEACON,  now  so  well  known  and  so  justly

ALONK  AT  esteemed  in  the  musical  world  of  London.  I 
arrived  at  Milan  one  Friday.  The  sun  was 
pitilessly  hot,  the  sky  wearisomely  blue.  Sick,  worn-out 
with  all-night  travel,  for  the  first  time  in  my  life  hundreds 
of  miles  away  from  any  human  being  who  cared  whether  I 
was  dead  or  alive,  my  spirits  were  at  their  lowest  ebb. 
I  got  in  about  the  middle  of  the  day,  and,  depositing  my 
one  portmanteau  at  the  Hotel  "  Reale/'  wandered  aimlessly 


ALONE  AT  MILAN.  109 

out  into  the  broiling  streets,  and,  being  hungry  and  faint, 
entered  a  cafe.  Everyone  seemed  half  asleep;  no  one 
understood  French,  and  so  no  one  understood  me.  It 
was  evidently  not  eating  time  at  Milan.  I  could  not 
touch  the  black  coffee  and  stale  sponge-cakes,  so  I  got 
back  to  my  bedroom,  ordered  a  lemonade,  and  lay  down 
thinking  of  "  Home,  sweet  Home,"  and  the  friends  in 
Brunswick  Square,  Brighton,  whom  I  might  have  been 
lunching  with  had  I  not  been  such  a  fool  as  to  come  to 
Italy.  I  lodged  at  my  capital  Milanese  hotel  (1860) — 
breakfast,  bed,  and  dinner  for  7  frs.  a  day.  At  Florence 
and  Rome  the  prices  in  those  days  were  but  8  frs.,  and  at 
Genoa  6  frs.  I  had  not  spoken  to  a  soul  for  many 
hours.  I  never  felt  so  utterly  lost  and  alone  before,  nor 
have  I  ever  felt  so  since.  The  second  day  I  met  at  the 
table  d'hote  a  friendly  face,  the  face  of  a  good  and  genial 
man.  It  was  the  REV.  C.  H.  ANDREWS,  then  English 
chaplain  at  Milan.  I  solaced  myself  with  some  talk. 
The  English  Church  service  was  held  in  a  large  room  in 
our  hotel.  The  next  day  was  Sunday.  I  went  to  service 
in  the  morning.  It  was  like  sitting  by  the  waters  of 
Babylon;  but  I  saw  some  English  faces  in  that  strange 
land,  and  began  to  take  courage.  ANDREWS  was  my  only 
resource,  so  towards  ANDREWS'S  door  I  made  my  way  in 
the  afternoon. 

On    entering,  I   found    a    gentleman  seated — thin   face, 
full     moustache,     well-dressed,    refined    in    manner,    and 


110  ITALY. 

charming  in  conversation.  I  was  about  to  retire  when 
both  bade  me  be  seated.  ANDREWS  at  once  presented  me 
to  this  stranger.  It  was  Mr.  C.  H.  DEACON,  the  pillar 
o£  the  English  Church  at  Milan,  and  general  friend  and 
benefactor  of  all  itinerant  and  homeless  tourists  who 
drifted  into  the  English  Church  on  their  way  through 
Milan. 

To  MR.  and  MRS.  DEACON — since  members  of  my  con- 
gregation in  London — and  my  good  friend  ANDREWS,  I  owe 
some  of  my  happiest  hours  in  Italy.  On  the  hot 

GOLDEN  nights  ANDREWS  and  I,  now  become  great  friends, 
used  to  make  our  way  naturally  to  DEACON'S 
charming  house,  and  there,  at  the  invitation  of  MRS. 
DEACON — most  delightful  of  hostesses — drink  unlimited  tea 
and  make  music.  I  had  not  brought  my  violin  to  Italy — I 
should  certainly  have  lost  it  if  I  had.  I  lost  nearly  every- 
thing that  I  had  with  me  in  Italy  that  year.  I  never 
touched  a  violin  in  Italy,  but  I  soon  found  that  DEACON 
was  a  splendid  pianist ;  and  at  his  house  I  met  PEZZE,  the 
violoncellist,  and  SESSA,  the  violinist.  DEACON  introduced 
me  to  REYNOLDS,  who  called  himself  Vice-Consul;  and  I 
remember  that  LORD  BYRON'S  cook,  who  was  still  living, 
served  us  up  an  admirable  dinner  one  night  at  the  Consul's 
residence. 

The  heat  being  overpowering,  and  the  natives  having 
chosen  that  moment  for  clearing  the  drains  at  my  hotel, 


A   STRANGE  BELL.  Ill 

the  place  became  little  better  than  a  pest-house,  and  we  con- 
cluded to  go  to  the  lakes.  We  went  to  Corao.  There  DEACON 
joined  us. 

I  think  it  was  in  the  Italian  Alps  that  I  first  noticed  the 
poetical  effect  of  bells.     The  sound  of  convent  bells  across 

the  Lake  of  Lugano,  or  over  Corao.  where  the 

77. 

A  STRANGE  sound  is  hemmed  in  between  Carddenabbia  and 
Bellagio,  is  to  me  full  of  haunting  memories. 
There  were  other  bells,  too,  on  the  Lake  of  Como,  of  a  very 
puzzling  kind,  as  will  appear  from  what  follows. 

^  The  deceptiveness  of  bell-sounds  upon  the  water  can  only 
be  compared  to  the  deceptiveness  of  objects  seen  lying  under 
the  water,  and  the  refraction  of  sound-waves  to  the  ear  is 
about  equal  to  the  refraction  of  light- waves  to  the  eye.  I 
remember  rowing  on  the  Lake  of  Como  on  one  still  summer 
night,  and  I  heard  what  seemed  to  me  the  clear  tinkle  of  a 
goat-bell,  which  I  supposed  to  be  coming  from  the  sloping 
banks  of  the  lake.  Distant  it  certainly  seemed,  and  yet 
singularly  distinct.  As  I  rowed  on,  it  still  sounded  from 
afar,  when  suddenly  through  the  darkness  I  heard  a  loud 
Italian  oath  from  a  boat  a  short  distance  from  me.  I  paid 
no  attention,  but  rowed  on ;  the  boat  rowed  after  me  with 
a  flood  of  Italian  Billingsgate.  My  mettle  was  now  up,  and, 
shipping  oars,  I  repaired  to  the  stern,  and  replied  with  all 
the  strength  and  vivacity  which  my  small  acquaintance  with 
Italian  slang  permitted. 


112  ITALY. 

Of  the  cause  of  dispute  I  was  utterly  ignorant,  but  I 
thought  an  unprovoked  attack  deserved  a  spirited  reply ; 
and  so  I  freely  devoted  my  unknown  friend  to  the  Diavolo, 
"Mars,  Bacchus,  Virorura/'  and  the  other  pagan  deities  to 
which,  by  his  vocabulary,  I  deemed  him  to  be  most  partial. 
Between  the  pauses  o£  our  brisk  civilities  I  heard  the  clear 
tinkle  of  the  distant  goat-bell  (what  had  that  to  do  with 
him  ?)  and  the  chiming  of  the  convent  clocks  all  along  the 
shore  of  the  lake,  when,  suddenly  leaning  over  the  boat,  my 
hand  touched  a  large  cork,  on  which  hung  a  floating  bell, 
and  I  perceived  I  had  for  some  time  been  dragging,  entangled 
astern,  the  fisherman's  night-line,  with  its  alarum  destined 
to  give  warning  against  such  marauders  as  myself.  Th'e 
distant  bell,  in  fact,  had  been  swinging  close  under  my  nose  ! 
There  was  no  goat — only  a  cork,  and  my  friend  thought  I 
was  making  a  night-raid  upon  his  fish !  At  that  moment 
our  boats  met,  and  instead  of  coming  to  blows  we  explained, 
shook  hands  with  much  polite  laughter,  and,  on  one  side  at 
least,  paid  up  with  effusion. 

Our  hotel   at  Carddenabbia  overlooked  the  lake.    There 

was  a  grand  piano  in  the  great  saloon,  with  a  marble  balcony 

opening  upon  the  water.     Here,  when  the  moon

The  white  mist  bathed  the  opposite  promontory  of  Bellagio. 
I  can  just  remember  a  face  on  the  balcony  in  the  twilight

— and  eyes,  too.  I  was  in  my  twenty-third  year.  I 
no  longer  sighed  for  Brunswick  Square — I  was  reconciled 
to  Italy.

1861-1861. 

I  HAD  for  years  been  an  irregular  student  of  theology,  and 
I  had  read  very  carefully  most  of  the  standard  theological 

books — PEARSON.  BUTLER.  PALEY.  HOOKER — and 
79. 

A  SUDDEN  also  weighted  myself  heavily  with  the  High 
Church  theology — PUSEY,  NEWMAN,  MANNING, 
KEBLE,  Miss  SEWELL,  &c.,  besides  reading  MAURICE  and 
W.  F.  ROBERTSON.  This  preparation  laid  me  peculiarly 
open  to  the  influence  of  Essays  and  Reviews,  which  I 
eagerly  devoured  at  Florence  on  my  way  home,  and  I 
was  soon  afterwards  further  enlightened  by  the  writings  of 
JOWETT  and  COLENSO.  These  last  are  the  men  who  gave  me 
some  hope  for  the  future  of  the  Church  of  England.  The 
seed  of  something  like  an  enlightened  and  liberal  theology 
seemed  to  be  sown.  Theology  soon  absorbed  the  whole  of 
my  attention,  and  music  went  to  the  wall  on  my  return 
from  Italy.  I  went  up  to  Cambridge  for  my  voluntary 
theological  examination  in  1861,  was  ordained  the  same  year,

went  straight  to  my  lodgings,  in  the  district  of  St.  Peter's, 
Hackney  Road,  Bethnal  Green,  and  my  violin  career  was 
virtually  closed. 

From  the  time  that  I  entered  the  Church  I  have  never 
played  to  any  real  purpose.     I  resolved  to  make  that  sacri- 
fice, and  no  subsequent  reflection  has  led  me  to 
repent   of  my   decision.      I   could    never    have

played  the  violin  by  halves,  and  had  I  come  up 
to  London  and  entered  the  Church  in  the  character  of  a 
fiddling  parson,  I  should  in  all  probability  never  have  got 
credit  for,  or  applied  myself  seriously  to  win,  any  other 
position.  At  all  events,  I  should  have  been  heavily  weighted 
and  laid  myself  open  to  many  temptations.  I  should  always 
have  been  coming  West  in  search  of  musical  society  and  dis- 
traction, and  people  would  have  said,  as  indeed  my  old 
friends  have  said,  and  as  my  caricaturists  continue  to  say, 
"  He  should  have  stuck  to  the  one  thing  which  he  could 
do  well,  and  not  meddled  with  theology."  These  good 
people  sometimes  gave  me  credit  for  having  made  an  heroic 
sacrifice.  They  knew  nothing  about  it.  The  sacrifice  I 
made  was  a  very  small  one.  From  the  age  of  eight  to 
the  age  of  twenty-three  I  had  played  the  fiddle  in  season 
and  out  of  season.  Applause  had  lost  its  charm  for  me. 
I  was  hardened  to  flattery.  My  own  critical  taste  dis- 
enchanted me  with  my  own  performances.  Nothing  but  the 
best  suited  me,  and  I  knew  I  never  could  attain  to  that  as

an  executant  myself,  because  I  never  could  take  up  the  violin 
professionally.  Then,  fiddling  was  not  my  only  taste.  I  had 
a  passion  for  oratory,  for  literature,  for  the  study  of  human 
nature,  and  for  church  work.  For  a  time  my  new  parochial 
sphere  with  its  special  enthusiasms  expelled  everything  else. 

I  know  not  what  glamour  in  those  days  hung  over  the 
grimy  and  repulsive  aspects  of  Bethnal  Green  life.  The 
reeking  streets  seemed  beautiful  to  me  in  the 
AN  EAST  END  evening  sunshine ;  the  unwashed  and  multitu- 
dinous children,  feeding  on  garbage  in  the 
gutter,  filled  me  with  infinite  tenderness  and  pity,  the  more 
so  because  they  seemed  so  happy ;  the  sick  poor  dying  in 
back  rooms,  the  workhouse  wards,  the  close  factory  houses 
packed  with  pale  girls  starving  at  straw-bonnet  work,  the 
old  men  eternally  dipping  dolls'  heads,  the  button-hole 
sewers,  the  infatuated  weavers,  descendants  of  the  Huguenot 
refugees,  still  working  their  antiquated  hand-looms  at  famine 
prices — all  these  scenes  of  my  daily  life  seemed  to  me  then 
exquisitely  pathetic,  novel,  interesting,  and  exciting.  I  was 
not  in  the  least  depressed  by  the  surrounding  misery;  I 
was  not  responsible  for  it.  It  was  a  problem  to  work  at. 
1  was  strangely  exhilarated  by  it.  I  was  not  left  to  struggle 
alone.  The  aristocracy  of  my  congregation  were  the  small 
tradespeople.  They  rallied  round  me  nobly,  and  I  loved 
them  ;  they  seemed  to  me  infinitely  good,  and  worthy,  and 
staunch.  I  dropped  in  to  tea  at  the  back  of  the  shop.  I

cheered  up  the  mother  cumbered  with  much  serving,  and  the 
daughters  with  their  smiling  faces  and  ready  hands  were  my 
district  visitors,  and  taught  in  the  Sunday  school. 

In  those  happy  and  hopeful  days,  the  late  Mr.  J.   R. 

GREEN,  since  famous  as  the  author  of  A   Short  History  of 

82.        the  English  People,  was  my  constant  companion 

JOUN       and  close  friend.     He  had  a  sole  charge  in  the 

RICHARD

two  years  we  met  almost  daily ;  we  were  facing  the  same 
difficulties,  discussing  the  same  doubts,  trying  to  solve  the 
same  problems. 

But  this  is  no  book  concerning  my  clerical  life.     I  hasten 
to  recover  the  thin  golden  thread  of  music,  which  still  con- 
tinued, and  probably  will  continue  to  the  end,  to 

OO. 

MUSIC  AND  run  through  my  days,  hidden  at  times  in  the 
>E8'  complex  fabric  of  the  general  life-work,  but  never 
really  lost  or  broken.  Thousands  around  me  were  leading 
dull  lives  of  monotonous  toil,  with  little  refreshment  or 
variety,  too  much  shut  up  to  ihe  beer-house  or  the  counter, 
tempted  by  want  and  gin,  tempted  also  to  all  kinds  of 
chicanery  and  petty  theft,  and  full  of  sordid  aims.  I  deter- 
mined to  try  the  effect  of  music,  and  good  music,  upon 
their  narrow,  busy,  overburdened  lives.  I  invited  Mr. 
C.  H.  DEACON,  SIGNOR  REGONDI — incomparable  on  the 
guitar  and  concertina — and  SIGNOR  PEZZE  to  come  down 


MUSIC  AND  THE  MASSES.  117 

and  give  a  concert  in  the  national  school-room.  The  prices 
of  admission  were  low — Id.  and  3d.  The  room  \vas 
crammed ;  the  music  was  a  little  over  the  people's  heads ; 
the  respectable  element  predominated  a  little  too  much,  as  I 
expected,  but  the  class  I  aimed  at  was  fairly  represented. 
The  audience  was  hushed,  attentive,  a  little  awed,  but 
intensely  appreciative.  I  did  not  play  myself.  No  one  had 
heard  me  play  there,  so  no  one  expected  me  to  play  then  ; 
and  I  might  have  lost  my  character  as  general  manager  and 
president  had  I  contributed  to  the  programme  in  a  musical 
capacity.  I  confess  the  old  war-horse  within  me  began  to 
chafe  and  paw  the  ground,  impatient  for  action,  when  the 
players  got  well  to  work.  I  seemed  to  feel  that  my  real 
place  was  at  their  side.  I  had  been  too  lately  weaned,  but 
I  kept  my  feelings  to  myself. 

I  believe  in  music  as  I  believe  in  pictures  for  the  masses. 
It  draws  people  together,  oils  the  wheels  of  the  social 
system,  and  very  much  facilitates  the  intercourse  between  a 
pastor  and  his  flock.  Music  is  better  than  penny  readings 
or  lectures  for  this  purpose,  chiefly  because  penny  readings, 
as  a  rule,  are  so  badly  and  stupidly  conducted.  For  one 
person  who  can  attract  attention  by  his  reading  or  lecturing 
there  are  a  dozen  who  can  excite  interest  among  the  poorer 
classes  by  singing  and  playing;  and  professional  musicians 
are,  as  a  rule,  very  kind  and  liberal  in  giving  their  services 
if  only  a  fit  occasion  presents  itself. 

Tea-meetings,  speeches,  and  lectures  were,  however,  easier 


118       BETHNAL   GREEN  AND   WESTMINSTER. 

to  organize,  and  I  was  not  long  enough  at  Betlmal  Green — 
hardly  two  years — to  test  fairly  by  their  frequency  the  good 
of  cheap  concerts  for  the  people  parochially,  nor  was  it  my 
own  parish,  nor  had  I  entirely  my  own  way.  But  the  experi- 
ment has  been  notoriously  successful  since,  in  the  shape  of 
coffee  music-halls  and  cheap  entertainments  for  the  people. 
I  am  convinced  that  the  influence  of  music  over  the  poor 
is  quite  angelic.  Music  is  the  hand-maid  of  religion  and 
the  mother  of  sympathy.  The  hymns  and  hymn  tunes 
taken  home  by  the  children  from  church  and  chapel  are 
blessed  outlets  of  feeling,  and  full  of  religious  instruction — 
they  humanize  households  all  through  the  land.  The  Moody 
and  Sankey  tunes  have  exercised  a  cheering  and  even 
hallowing  influence  far  and  wide,  in  remote  Welsh  hamlets, 
from  Northumberland  to  Devonshire,  in  the  crowded  dens 
of  our  manufacturing  centres,  and  in  lonely  seaside  villages. 
Teach  the  people  to  sing,  and  you  will  make  them  happy ; 
teach  them  to  listen  to  sweet  sounds,  and  you  will  go  far 
to  render  them  harmless  to  themselves,  if  not  a  blessing  to 
their  fellows. 

Since  my  ordination  I  have,  with  great  reluctance,  and 

under    considerable    pressure    from    old    friends,    broken 

through    my  rule   of  never   playing  in  public.

LAST  APPEARANCES.  119 

The  people,  I  think,  were  too  much  surprised  thoroughly  to 
enjoy  me  in  so  completely  novel  and  unexpected  a  character. 

Again,  at  Saint  James  the  Less,  Westminster,  at  another 
school-room  concert,  I  played.  There  I  think  the  feelings 
of  the  audience  were  very  mixed.  A  good  many  seemed 
scandalised  at  a  parson  playing  the  fiddle  at  all.  Others 
were  shocked  at  his  performing  thus  publicly. 

When  invited  by  the  late  lamented  MR.  SPOTTISWOODE, 
then  President  of  the  Royal  Institution,  to  lecture  on  "  Old 
Violins  "  before  that  learned  assembly,  I  certainly  ventured 
to  touch  some  of  the  matchless  violins  lent  me  on  that 
occasion  just  sufficiently  to  illustrate  a  few  points,  and 
demonstrate  certain  peculiarities  of  tone.  But,  although 
sufficient  for  the  purpose,  my  hand  had  lost  its  cunning,  nor 
shall  I  ever  again  play  the  violin  at  all  to  my  own  liking. 
Indeed,  I  keep  my  Strad.  in  a  cabinet  behind  glass.  There 
he  rests  unsounded  and  unstrung. 

Before  the  end  of  the  century  he  will  probably  pass  out  of 
my  hands.  It  is  well  that  he  should  sleep  awhile.  I  have 
worked  him  hard  enough  in  my  day.  About  A.D.  1900  he 
will  probably  emerge,  fresh,  powerful,  and  perhaps  sweeter 
than  ever,  to  tell  the  unborn  generations  of  the  twentieth 
century  how  great  and  magical  an  artificer  was  ANTONIUS 
STRADIVARIUS  CREMONENSIS,  A.D.  1712. 

If  these  famous  old  violins  did  not  have  these  long  periods 
of  rest  they  would  soon  be  all  worn  out,  and  A.D.  2000  would

only  have  them  as  museum  specimens,  no  longer  fit  to  be 
played  upon.  It  is  the  collector  who  keeps  them

them  by  and  neither  play  upon  them  nor  lend 
them  about, — who  are  the  real  benefactors  and  conservers  of 
the  Cremona  gems.  This  thought  often  consoles  me  when 
I  look  at  the  kind  and  faithful  face  of  my  old  violin,  or 
take  him  out  to  pass  my  hand  at  times  caressingly  over 
the  dear,  familiar  maple  back,  polished  and  all  aglow,  like 
transparent  sunlit  agate  and  so  finely  veined.  I  look  at  him 
as  he  lies  mute  in  my  hands — but  not  dead.  Ah  !  how  he 
used  to  sound  beneath  my  bow  in  the  crowded  halls  and  at 
gay  scenes  that  have  faded  out  for  ever  with  the  "  days  that 
are  no  more/'  Ay  !  and  how  he  shall  sound  again  in  other 
hands,  and  sing  rapturously  to  other  hearts,  long  after  my 
hand  has  grown  cold  and  my  heart  has  ceased  to  beat. 

The  pulpit  had  now  fairly  taken  the  place  of  the  violin. 

Of  course  I  wrote  my  sermons  elaborately,  so  elaborately 

that  after  I  had  written  two  I  did  not  quite  see 

my  way  to  writing  a  third,  for  the  simple  reason

that  I  had  exhausted  the  whole  range  of  Christian 
teaching,  practice  as  well  as  doctrine,  and  there  did  not 
seem  to  me  to  be  any  more  to  say.  Necessity,  however, 
is  the  mother  of  invention,  and  I  contrived  to  go  on  reading 
sermons  at  first  to  an  empty  church  until  I  felt  that  some- 
thing must  be  done.  I  had  studied  audiences  in  the  concert

room.  I  had  never  uttered  two  words  in  public,  but  in  the 
Isle  of  Wight  I  had  been  occasionally  in  the  habit  of  select- 
ing a  solitary  hillock  and  addressing  the  cows  in  terras  of 
great  eloquence  on  various  topics  of  public  interest. 

This  is  not  the  place  to  dwell  upon  my  early  attempts  at 

extemporary  preaching.     Suffice  it  to  say  that  the  faculties 

87.        which  make  the  success  of  a  soloist  are  tempera- 

THB        mentally  at  least  the  same  as  those  required  by

AND       the  actor  or  the  orator.     Some  intellectual  power 

ARTISTIC  TEM- 
PERAMENT, and  a  special  cultivation  are  of  course  required 

in  addition,  and  it  is  quite  as  possible  to  be  a  good  speaker 
without  having  an  ear  for  music  as  it  is  possible  to  have 
an  ear  for  music  without  being  a  successful  soloist;  but 
it  is  not  possible,  without  the  dramatic  intuition  and 
sympathetic  temperament,  to  be  a  good  soloist,  actor, 
speaker,  or  preacher.  I  found  then  that  the  time  I  had 
spent  in  acquiring  the  art  of  dominating  an  audience  in  the 
concert-room  had  not  been  wholly  wasted.  An  orator  is 
sometimes  said  to  play  upon  his  audience  as  upon  an  old 
fiddle.  The  simile  is  not  ill  chosen.  The  special  vehicle  I 
had  learned  to  control  was  indeed  lost  to  me  in  the  Church, 
but  the  living  spirit,  the  breathing  creatures,  the  beating 
hearts  I  had  studied  how  to  move,  were  the  same;  and 
although  suffering  from  a  certain  incoherency  of  mind  and 
excessive  redundancy  of  language,  I  did  not  despair  of  suc- 
cess in  my  new  sphere.  It  seemed  to  me  to  be  one  full  of 


122       BETHNAL   GEEEN  AND    WESTMINSTER. 

great  possibilities.  I  was  more  hopeful  then,  than  I  am 
now  about  Church  reform.  I  thought  the  clergy  as  a  class 
more  intelligent.  I  thought  more  of  the  old  theology  could 
be  worked  up  into  a  new  and  living  organism  than  I  now  see 
to  be  possible.  I  was  more  hopeful  about  vital  Christianity. 
I  believed  in  welding  together  classes  on  the  basis  of  a 
common  and  Christ-like  humanity ;  in  raising  and  purifying 
the  working  classes  by  the  presentation,  if  not  of  a  nobler, 
at  all  events  of  a  more  practical  ideal.  As  time  went  on, 
I  found  the  problem  more  complex  and  less  soluble. 

Then,  I  was  more  hopeful  about  my  own  powers.  T 
thought  that  steady  industry  and  perseverance  would  supply 
my  natural  defects  of  brain  and  fitfulness  of  temperament, 
which  were  very  considerable.  Happy  imperfection  of 
judgment !  happy  inconsistency  of  thought !  How  many 
endea,vours  after  the  Christian  life  would  never  have  been 
made  did  men  stop  to  count  the  cost  or  estimate  their  own 
weakness  !  How  many  good  works  would  never  be  begun 
could  the  inevitable  failures  be  foreseen  !  Still  the  impulse 
of  youthful  fervour  and  inexperience  which  endures  as  seeing 
that  which  is  invisible,  is  never  wholly  without  fruit,  and, 
after  all,  seems  closely  akin  to  the  faith  that  removes  moun- 
tains. I  would  not  have  had  my  life  at  the  East  End 
without  its  illusions  or  its  failures.  The  first  have  com- 
forted and  the  last  have  humbled  me,  and  both  have 
worked  together  for  good  by  inspiring  me  to  work  for  the 
attainable. 


FIRST  LITERARY  SUCCESSES.  123 

When  I  had  been  nearly  two  years  in  the  Church  and 

went  west  to  St.  James  the  Less,  Westminster,  as  curate, 

88.        there    was    very    little    outward    trace,  of    my 

T  Jf™8*      musical  life  left.     One  morning  I  was  reminded 

Lfl-TERAKY 

SUCCESSES,  that  I  was  still  a  musician  by  a  letter  from  the 
De,an  of  Canterbury,  DEAN  ALFORD.  He  had  just  become 
editor  of  the  Contemporary  Review.  He  sent  me  two  volumes 
of  MOZART'S  letters,  and  asked  me  for  a  page  or  two  of  notice. 
With  the  exception  of  a  little  East  End  sketch  called 
"  Amy  Arnold/'  for  which  I  received  the  modest  sum  of 
£2  from  a  religious  Society,  this  was  the  first  remunerative 
work  that  had  come  the  way  of  my  pen.  I  had  got  rather 
disheartened  about  my  writing.  The  provincial  press  printed 
my  prose  lucubrations,  and  my  poems  were  often  accepted — 
never  paid  for.  I  can  see  now  what  shut  me  out  of  the 
magazines.  It  was  the  superb  magniloquence  of  my  style. 
"  Words  !  words  !  words  !  "  they  killed  me.  "  Amy  Arnold" 
was  a  simple,  unaffected  little  narrative,  with  a  touch  of 
pathos  stealing  over  the  page  like  the  evening  sunlight  that 
fell  through  the  dusty  casement  upon  the  bed  of  the  dying 
girl.  That  real  sketch  from  life  was  accepted,  and  I  had 
begun  to  feel  that  until  I  had  something  to  say  it  was  of  no 
use  to  trifle  with  war-paint,  or  strut  about  in  the  borrowed 
plumes  of  extravagant  imagery  and  flimsy  rhetoric. 

So  my  pen,  with  the  exception  of  sermon  writing,  which 
I  was  even  then  fast  abandoning  in  favour  of  the  spoken 
word,  had  lain  tolerably  idle,  and  when  I  opened  MOZART'S 


124      BETIINAL   GREEN  AND   WESTMINSTER. 

letters  with  a  beating  heart,  I  resolved  to  wield  what  had 
hitherto  been  but  a  goose-quill  in  sober  earnest,  and  to 
succeed. ^  That  article,  which  is  now  to  be  found  in  the 
Biographical  Section  of  Music  and  Morals,  at  once  "  placed  " 
my  literary  faculty  in  the  Dean's  estimation.  I  may  say  it 
made  my  literary  fortune. 

The    sudden    change   from    literary   failure    to    success 

surprised  me  a  little,  but  the  fact  is  my  whole  style  had 

suddenly  changed.     I  still  could  be  magniloquent

pulpit  studies  and  the  cultivation  of  the  spoken 
word,  the  value  of  directness  and  plain  speaking,  both  as  a 
means  of  expressing  thought  and  winning  attention.  I 
began  instinctively  to  choose  the  short  instead  of  the  long 
words,  and  then  I  found  that  I  could  bring  in  the  long 
words  and  rolling  sentences  occasionally  with  all  the  more 
crushing  effect.  Somebody  pointed  out  to  me  that  this 
habitual  temperance  and  occasional  exuberance  of  language 
was  a  leading  feature  of  MILTON'S  prose.  This  encouraged 
me  in  chastening  my  style.  I  thought  I  might  not  be  able 
to  imitate  MILTON  in  any  other  way. 

From  that  day  I  never  have  found  any  difficulty  in 
gaining  admission  to  any  magazine  that  I  chose  to  write 
for,  from  the  Quarterly  Review  down  to  the  veriest  "  penny 
dreadful.''  The  following  week  the  Dean  of  Canterbury 
sent  me  about  twenty  volumes  of  all  sorts  to  review  lor

the    Contemporary.      Amongst    these    was    MR.    HOWELL'S 
Venetian  Life. 

MR.    HOWELL   was   at  that   time    an    unknown    writer. 

It  was  my  happiness  to  discern  him  at  once  on  this  side 

90.        of  the  big  pond.     I  believe  my  review  was  the 

«Hv°E™i8K  first  notice  that  he  Sot  in  Engiand.  I  had 
LIFE."  not  read  two  pages  of  his  book  before  I  expe- 
rienced the  indescribable  sensation  of  something  new, 
characteristic,  and  charming.  Any  man,  be  he  painter, 
poet,  essayist,  or  musician,  who  can  give  us  that  feeling, 
that  distinct  breath  of  novelty,  that  odour  as  of  brine  from 
the  great  ocean  and  fount  of  creation,  lifts  himself  at  once 
above  the  herd.  He  has  the  incommunicable  touch  that 
cannot  be  taught ;  the  power  of  making  the  ever  original  and 
personal  soul  shine  through — not  as  a  reflection,  a  copy,  a 
parody — a  soul  like  any  other  soul,  but  the  soul  of  the  soul 
in  him,  the  writer — unlike  all  the  world — with 'a  message  for 
the  soul  of  the  soul  in  me,  the  reader,  unlike  every  other 
reader,  discerned,  appealed  to,  found  out.  That  is  the 
precious  and  prophetic  quality  which  stamps  all  best  art  and 
literature.  It  comes  from  the  Alone  and  goes  to  the  Alone  ; 
it  is  the  eternal  open  secret.  "  I  visit  the  Royal  Academy 
every  year,"  said  ALMA  TADEMA  to  me  the  other  day,  "  and 
seek  for  some  picture  which  will  give  me  a  new  sensation. 
I  can  hardly  ever  find  one.  I  seek  in  vain.  Endless  repe- 
tition ! "  This  power  of  giving  utterance  to  the  new  belongs

to  all  genius  and  places  it.  Musician s,  as  well  as  others, 
get  insensibly  classed  by  this  same  strength  of  individuality, 
which  the  whole  of  our  modern  life  in  this  conventional 
copy-book  world  conspires  to  stifle  and  stamp  out. 

BEETHOVEN,  SPOHR,  SCHUMANN,  MENDELSSOHN,  CHOPIN, 
WAGNER — each  is  new;  does  not  try  to  be  new  like  your  char- 
latans ;  cannot  help  it ;  does  naturally,  without  effort,  with- 
out knowing  it,  what  was  inconceivable  to  all  men  the 
moment  before,  what  has  not  been  done,  could  never  have 
been  done  earlier  or  by  anyone  else,  or  at  any  other  time. 
Then  the  school  is  founded  and  the  aroma  of  novelty  passes. 
Manufacture  sets  in.  Art  gets  itself  machine-made.  None 
think  it  possible  ever  again  to  create  or  write  or  paint 
otherwise.  But  Genius,  that  eternal  child,  comes  by  fling- 
ing garlands  wet  with  dew,  and  the  scales  fall  once  more 
from  our  eyes,  and  lo  !  a  new  heaven  and  a  new  earth  stand 
revealed,  and  the  old  things  have  passed  away  and  all  things 
have  become  new,  even  as  every  day  is  new,  born  out  of  the 
infinite  sunlight  to  fade  again  into  the  "  azure  of  the  All," 
whilst  "God  fulfils  Himself  in  many  ways." 

Under  the  Dean  of  Canterbury's  editorial  encouragement 
I  wrote  essay  after  essay  in  rapid  succession  for  the  Con-

appeared  in  Good  Words,  formed  the  staple  of

1871.  They  were  in  no  sense  written  to  order;  several 
of  them  had  been  in  my  mind  for  years.  At  Fresh- 
water, Isle  of  Wight,  during  many  a  lonely  ramble,  I 
grappled  ineffectually  with  the  problem  of  musical  sound, 
and  the  reason  why  it  acted  so  directly  and  powerfully  upon 
the  life  of  emotion.  In  Italy,  at  Florence,  pacing  the  Cas- 
cine  by  the  Arno  beneath  a  network  of  emerald  foliage  in 
spring — in  my  gondola  on  the  shores  of  the  Lido  off  Venice 
— in  the  southern  vineyards  at  Naples,  when  all  the  grapes 
were  gathered  and  the  trailing  vines  hung  yellow  and  scarlet — 
in  the  fig  gardens  of  Genoa,  and  amid  the  perfumed  orange- 
groves  of  the  Riviera,  all  hung  with  golden  fruit  yet  still 
breathing  with  flowers,  the  same  problem  haunted  me,  when 
at  last  it  seemed  to  flash  suddenly  and  satisfyingly  upon  me 
that  Sound  was  the  sovereign  art-vehicle  of  Emotion, 
because  it  possessed  itself  all  the  properties  of  emotion,  viz., 
elation,  depression,  velocity,  &c.  Everyone  said,  how  simple  ! 
Of  course ;  and  yet  I  am  not  aware  that  it  had  occurred  to 
anyone  to  point  this  out  before,  though  many  have  quietly 
assumed  it  since. 

These  ideas,  I  say,  had  long  been  maturing  in  my  mind, 
and  when  I  took  up  my  pen  in  England  I  established  this 
position  in  the  first  part  of  my  book  with  intense  pleasure, 
and  I  may  say  that  the  whole  of  Music  and  Morals  was 
written  out  of  a  full  heart  and  brain,  in  which  many  thoughts 
had  been  stored  for  years  without  ever  having  found  a 
congenial  outlet  in  any  literary  form.

ON     RECURRENT     IDEAS. 

IREDERICK  DENISON    MAURICE    once    said,    "People 
sometimes  tell  me  that  I  repeat  myself — they  appa- 
rently wish  to  hear  something  new  every  time  they

Everyone  has  not  the  courage  to  speak  like  this ;  but  all

sort  of  teaching,  by  the  way,  for  which  MAURICE  had  a 
deep  contempt)  deals  with  a  few  master  thoughts — what 
WAGNER  would  call  "  Leitmotiven."  Evolution  rules 
DARWIN.  An  intense  faith  in  the  moral  and  Spiritual 
Constitution  of  the  world  rules  TENNYSON.  A  reverent 
Pessimism  pervades  the  works  of  GEORGE  ELIOT,  an  equally 
reverent  Optimism  characterises  EMERSON.  When  the 
ferment  of  creative  and  imaginative  sensibility  subsides,  all 
thoughtful  minds  have  a  tendency  to  settle  into  grooves 
marked  out  by  idiosyncrasy,  temperament,  quality  of  brain 
tissue,  heredity,  and  sometimes  social  environment. 

No  class  of  writers  better  illustrate  this  than  historians. 

HALLAM  is  impersonal;  JOHN   RICHARD  GREEN,  personal; 

one  will  construe  history,  like  BUCKLE,  through

law,  and  see  historical  movements  making  men ; 
another,  like  CARLYLE,  will  let  the  human  element  count 
for  much,  and  see  men  making  historical  movements;  whilst 
a  third,  like  MACAULAY,  will  recognise  the  personal  and 
impersonal  power  in  history,  and  warp  both  a  little  with 
party  politics. 

Those  who  expect  to  take  up  My  Musical  Life  and 
find  in  it  nothing  but  novelty,  may  be  disappointed  to  light 
upon  more  than  once  something  which  recalls  Music  and 
Morals ;  yet  all  I  have  ever  aspired  to  is  to  "  sing  to  one 
clear  harp  in  divers  tones,"  the  few  clear  and  strong  and 


ROOT  THOUGHTS.  133 

sweet  and  happy  things  that  have  been  revealed  to  me 
through  music. 

My  thoughts  on  music  are  recurrent  thoughts.  The  same 
beam  of  light  rests  upon  many  a  ripple.  But  thoughts  will 
sometimes  bear  re-statement.  When  a  thought  is  new  it  is 
often  a  little  confused,  yet  is  there  a  certain  force  and 
radiance  in  the  very  confusion.  The  haze  of  sunrise — the 
' '  wild  freshness  of  morning " — is  at  once  the  first  and  the 
last  memory  that  abides  with  us.  The  old  man  forgets 
the  crowded  and  dusty  thoroughfares  of  middle  life  and 
babbles  of  green  fields. 

The  two  thoughts  which  lie  at  the  root  of  all  my  musical 
as  of  all  my  religious  thinking  are:  1st.  THE  TREMENDOUS 
EMPIRE  OP  THE  SENSES,  by   which  I  mean  the 
ROOT       spell  of  the  beautiful  world  without  us,  its  colour, 
light,  loveliness,  its  gracious,  radiant,  and  tender 
women;   its   happy  innocent  children;  its  generous,  inge- 
nious, and  indomitable   men;  its  tragedies   and  comedies; 
"all  the  wealth   and  all  the   woe";   its   hints  of  an  im- 
perishable universe,  '  unseen  though  felt,  overshadowing  us ' ; 
its  silent  finger  pointing  to  the  sky;  all  this  I  view  with 
'  reverence  and  good  heed,'  and  without  satiety.     Life  to  me 
is  from  quite  an  external  point  of  view,  with  all  its  sin 
and  sorrow,  infinitely  worth  living.

young ;  to  stand  always  at  the  open  gates  of  Paradise ;  to 
listen  to  'the  lordly  music  flowing  from  the  illimitable 
years  ! '  This  is  my  desire.  But  'tis  a  world  of  time,  and 
of  things  seen  and  temporal,  after  all — altiora  peto.

in  pain  and  loss,  in  the  failure  of  hope,  in  the  shame  of 
remorse,  when  all  things  in  heaven  and  earth  seem  unstable 
— I  am  aware  of  a  secret  life,  a  consciousness  independent 
of  time  and  chance.  This  revives  my  spirit;  this  soothes 
me  with  a  sense  of  the  infinite.

Alone,  with  closed  eyes,  the  royal  visions  pass.  Angelic 
faces  are  with  me  in  the  twilight,  voices  that  cannot  be 
heard,  touches  that  cannot  be  felt,  and  suddenly  a  summer 
land  within  breaks  forth  when  all  is  dark  without.  I  per- 
ceive that  man  does  not  live  by  bread  alone.  The  outer 
world  is  the  dream,  the  inner  life  is  the  reality.  I  carry 
it  everywhere  with  me.  I  thought  the  visible  universe  was 
all  in  all.  I  perceive  it  to  be  as  nothing  in  comparison  with 
the  soul  that  sits  enthroned  above  it.  It  is  that  which 
makes  the  poor  man  royal  and  beggars  the  king.  What 
wealth  have  you  within,  not  what  will  men  and  women  give 
you ;  what,  not  where,  are  you.  Does  not  each  one  carry 
within  himself  the  riches  and  the  poverty  of  a  world  ?  and 
is  there  not  a  life  within  a  life?  This  is  THE  SOLITARY 
SUPREMACY  OF  THE  SOUL. 


A  RETROSPECT.  135 

Musical  sound  fascinated  me  early  as  the  refined 
physical  medium  on  the  very  border-land  of  spirit,  which, 
when  directly  excited,  dealt  with  and  controlled  the  springs 
of  this  mysterious  inner  life  of  feeling — this  region  of 
emotion  which  gives  the  spirit  its  solitary  supremacy,  and 
colours  or  discolours  at  will  all  the  objects  of  sense.  The 
Editor  of  the  Quarterly  Review  invited  me  to  explain  my 
views  upon  the  subject.  I  repeated  in  a  succinct 
A  form  what  I  had  said  in  my  book,  Music  and 
'  Morals.  The  London  Institution  asked  me  to 
lecture  on  the  same  subject.  I  had  by  this  time  com- 
pletely possessed  my  thought  and  I  became  aware  of  my 
increased  facility  in  handling  it.  With  the  aid  of  a  piece 
of  chalk  and  a  black-board  I  there  attempted  to  convey 
to  a  mixed  audience  what  at  one  time  I  should  have 
despaired  of  expressing  without  the  aid  of  musical  sound 
or  elaborate  diagrams.  The  Quarterly  article  (vol.  131, 
No.  xxxvi)  I  do  not  intend  to  reprint;  but  the  words  I 
spoke  at  Finsbury  Circus,  although  going  over  some  ground 
familiar  to  the  readers  of  my  first  volume,  seem  to  me  to 
resume  briefly  my  Kecurrent  Thoughts  on  the  Rationale 
of  Music,  and  its  place  amongst  the  Arts,  and  will,  I  think, 
be  found  acceptable  as  an  introduction  to  the  meditations 
contained  in  Book  II.  of  this  volume. 


136  THE  RATIONALE  OF  MUSIC. 

II. 

THE   RATIONALE    OF   MUSIC. 

To  discuss  music  without  the  aid  of  instruments,  notes,  or 
diagrams,  is  not  an  easy  and  would  be  an  impossible  thing, 

were  I  mainly  dealing  with  its  science,  history, 
y  /  • 
THE  ETERNAL  or   performance.      But   it   is    with  the    general 

philosophy  and  rationale  of  the  art  that  I  am 
now  concerned.  Music  has  come  in  for  its  full  share  of 
science,  history,  and  criticism  ;  but  how  few  have  dived  into 
its  essence,  and  instead  of  seeking  for  the  inevitable  "  how," 
asked  after  the  eternal  "  why  "  ! 

I  have  always  held  that  music  should  be  discussed  and 

written  about  just  like  any  other  art.   The  musical  criticisms 

of  the  day  deal  chiefly  in  technicality  and  per- 

Jo. 

HOW  TO  MS-  sonality,  and  it  is  rather  unfortunate  that  the  few 

CUSS  MUSIC.  ..  i  -ii  L      •     a. 

writers  who  occasionally  venture  out  into  tne 
deep,  and  discourse  on  music  per  se,  are  deficient  in  the 
one  thing  needful — "  musical  perception "  ;  in  that  ocean 
they  cannot  swim,  and  the  sooner  some  of  them  get  to  shore 
the  better.  Music  has  its  Morals,  its  right  and  its  wrong, 
its  high  and  its  low,  like  any  other  art ;  and  until  people 
can  be  got  to  understand  how  this  can  be,  and  why  it  must 
be,  music  will  never  assert  its  dignity  among  the  arts  and 
receive  its  dues.  Before  MR.  RUSKIN  wrote,  people  thought 


HOUGH  ELEMENTS  OF  SOUND.  137 

that  there  was  no  right  or  wrong  about  painting,  sculpture, 
and  architecture,  and  musical  criticism  has  been  in  the 
same  Slough  of  Despond.  And  what  is  the  consequence? 
Painting  and  sculpture  rank  above  music,  yet  music,  not 
painting,  not  sculpture,  is  the  modern  art.  Who  shall  be 
found  to  do  for  the  new  art  of  music  what  MR.  RUSKIN  has 
done  for  painting  and  architecture — to  create  for  it  a  moral 
philosophy  as  well  as  a  rationale  ?  I  need  not  say  that  in 
Music  and  Morals  I  have  tried  to  show  how  this  might 
be  done,  and  I  have  been  much  gratified  to  observe  that 
writers  who  are  apt  to  treat  my  opinions  as  common,  when 
not  wrong,  and  as  wrong  when  not  common,  have  not 
always  been  deterred  from  the  not  uncommon  practice  of 
appropriating  them  without  acknowledgment. 

I  now  glance  briefly :   I.  At  the  development  of  music 
out  of  the  rough  elements  of  sound. 

II.  At  its  place  amongst  the  sister  arts  and  its  peculiar 
functions. 

III.  At  the  obvious  nature  of  its  influence. 

Music,   its  origin,   function,   and  influence — that  is  my 
subject. 

We  now  enter  at  once  into  the  world  of  mystery   and 

99.        imagination  :    of  mystery  because,   though  you 

EODGH      know  how  a  sound  can  be  produced,  you  do  not

way  of  illustration,  the  most  beautiful  sounds  you  have  ever 
heard.  But  sounds  of  less  agreeable  nature  have  first  to  be 
realised.  Before  we  enter  the  temple  of  music  or  penetrate 
its  inner  shrine,  we  find  ourselves  distracted  with  the  rough 
elements  of  sound,  the  rabble  of  noise  outside — how  out  or 
such  elements  shall  we  ever  collect  the  "  choirs  that  chime 
after  the  chiming  of  the  eternal  spheres  "  ? 

We  have  Sound  in  the  world  around  us  of  every  con- 
ceivable kind.  Listen  to  the  distant  roar  of  a  great  populous 
city.  Its  cry  goes  up  by  day  and  night.  Myriad  voices 
ascend  from  sea  and  land.  If  you  notice  the  waves  as 
they  drag  down  the  shingles  on  the  beach,  in  their  retiring 
scream  they  give  forth  a  series  of  semitones  ;  and  there  is  a 
rough  and  elemental  sort  of  musical  sound  in  the  moaning 
of  the  wind,  which  has  supplied  poets  with  allusions  more 
sentimental  than  accurate  ;  still  the  wind's  harp  does  go  up 
arid  down,  like  the  mooing  of  a  cow.  And  doubtless  the 
rough  inflexions  of  the  human  voice  existed  long  before 
music  became  an  art.  As  the  voice  rises  and  falls  you  have 
a  scale  of  emotional  inflexion  which  gives  it  full  force ;  for 
it  is  the  sound  quite  as  much  as  the  words  used  which  yields 
the  impression  of  what  is  passing  in  your  mind.  But  even 
hero  we  have  not  arrived  at  musical  sound,  we  have  only 
touched  some  materials  of  it.  How  shall  we  get  at  musical 
sound  ?  Or,  in  other  words,  what  is  the  difference  between 
a  Noise  and  a  musical  Note  ?  A  noise  is  only  understood 
when  the  nature  of  a  musical  note  is  understood.  Roughly 


NOISE.  139 

speaking,  a  musical  note  means  a  "clang,"  to  use  HELM- 
HOLTZ'S  word,  in  which  there  is  one  fundamental  tone,  and 
along  with  it  the  third,  fifth,  and  octave  as  buried  tones. 
When  the  fundamental  is  strong,  and  the  hidden  tones,  the 
third,  fifth,  and  octave,  &c.,  very  faint,  you  get  the  impression 
of  one  musical  note  which  is  invariably  the  fundamental 
tone.  There  are  many  hidden  mysteries  in  a  fundamental 
tone,  a  greater  or  less  variety  of  overtones,  varying  accord- 
ing to  your  sound-quality.  I  have  had  occasion  to  dwell 
more  scientifically  upon  this  in  my  chapter  on  "  Bells." 

Now,  what   makes  noise  as  opposed  to  a  musical  note 
is  just  this.     You  get  the  third,  fifth,  and  the   octave,  or 
some    other   overtones,  louder   than   the  funda- 
mental note.      To  illustrate  this  summarily,  we

might  compare  the  notes  of  a  violin  or  a 
fine  bell  with  a  Chinese  gong;  or  you  may  strike  a 
coal-scuttle,  or  a  warming-pan,  and  produce  an  equally 
satisfactory  result.  A  gong  is,  however,  perhaps  the  best 
type  of  noise — I  do  not  allude  to  those  smooth  Japanese 
metal  plates,  or  bars,  which  often  give  one  or  more 
very  sweet  tones,  but  those  horrible  gongs,  dented  all 
over,  that  you  thump  with  a  drum-stick,  beginning  pp. 
and  ending  with  a  purgatorial  crescendo  in  ff.  This,  I 
say,  is  noise,  and  most  of  the  sounds  which  fall  upon  the 
ear  are  noise,  especially  what  we  hear  "  whene'er  we  take 
our  walks  abroad ''  in  the  streets  of  London. 


140  THE  RATIONALE  OF  MUSIC. 

"When,  then,    we  have  found  a  clear  fundamental  tone, 
with  its  accompanying  fainter  overtones,  we  have  found  a 

musical  note.     Now  analyze  this  musical  note. 
101. 
MUSICAL    It  can  vary  in  three  ways,  and   in   three  ways 

only.  When  you  know  how  it  so  varies  you 
know  all  that  can  be  known  about  it.  A  musical  note, 
then,  can  vary  in  pitch,  in  intensity,  and  in  quality  or 
timbre. 

1.  What  makes  the  pitch  of  a  note?    It  depends  upon 
the  rapidity  of  the  vibrations.     Supposing  you  take  as  an 
illustration  the   sound  given  by  a  note  of  an  harmonium, 
which  is  caused  by  the  vibration  of  a  metal  tongue.     When 
this  tongue  vibrates  slowly,  or  only  a  few  times  backwards 
and  forwards  in  a  second,  you  get  a  note  of  a  deep  pitch ; 
but  when  it  vibrates  at  the  rate  of  67,000  vibrations  to  the 
note,  the  pitch  is   so  shrill  that  although  some  cats  may 
hear  it,  no  human  beings  can.     The  ear  of  the  cat  is  finer 
than  ours.     Cats  and  some  birds  are  microphones  compared 
to  man;  they  see  sights  we  cannot  see,  they  smell  smells 
we    very  fortunately  cannot  smell,  and  they  hear   sounds 
which  we   cannot  hear.     A  note  is  high  or  low  in  pitch, 
according   as  the   number  of  vibrations  which  produce  it 
are  in  a  given  time  few  or  many,  fast  or  slow. 

2.  What   makes  its  intensity?     It  is  the  length  of  the 
vibration  waves  that  determines  their  loudness  or  intensity. 
If  the  wave  or  the  extent  of  "  excursion  "  of  the  vibrating 
molecules  be  large,  the  shape  of  the  wave  being  the  same 


BIRTH  OF  MUSIC.  141 

the  sound   is  loud;    if  the   reverse,   the    shape   being  the 
same,  the  sound  is  faint. 

3.  What  determines  the  quality  ?  The  quality  depends  on 
the  mode  of  vibration.  It  is,  as  HELMHOLTZ  has  shown,  the 
number,  order,  and  intensity  of  the  vibrations  of  the  over- 
tones in  a  "clang"'  which  determines  timbre  or  quality, 
and  which  makes  the  differences  between  the  same  note 
sounded  on  a  violin,  piano,  harp,  flute,  &c. 

But  even  now  we  have  only  arrived  at  the  composition  of 

musical  notes,  not  at  the  composition  of  music.     How  then 

did  music  arise  ?     Of  course  the  human  ear  has 

102. 

BIRTH  OP  always  been  open  to  sweet  and  disagreeable 
sounds,  and  has  gradually  been  led  to  choose 
between  them.  I  do  not  want  to  quarrel  with  the  mythical 
notion  that  some  pristine  man  or  woman,  wandering  on  the 
sea-shore,  may  have  found  a  shell  with  seaweed  stretched 
like  strings  across  it,  out  of  which  the  wind  was  making 
an  ^Eolian  harp,  and  that  so  the  first  idea  of  the  harp  may 
have  arisen.  This  may  have  happened,  for  aught  we  know. 
The  creating  of  artificial  notes  for  mere  pleasure  seems  to 
have  been  a  custom  from  time  immemorial. 

Bones  of  extinct  mammals  have  been  found  made  into 
flutes.  At  least  M.  Lartet  says  so.  What  he  found  looked 
like  a  flute  to  him,  and  far  be  it  from  me  to  bring  art  into 
collision  with  science  by  saying  it  does  not  look  like  a 
flute.  I  think,  on  the  whole,  it  does  ;  and,  if  so,  this  may 


142  THE  RATIONALE  OF  MUSIC. 

be  another  proof  that  primitive  man  delighted  in  sweet 
sounds.  But  we  are  still  far  from  the  art  of  music.  Here 
are  witnesses  to  an  ancient  impulse  in  the  direction  of  an 
art,  but  not  the  art  itself. 

We  may  as  well  skip  Egypt  and  Assyria,  and  assume  that 
the  musical  survival  of  the  fittest  remained,  after  the  ex- 
tinction of  those  empires, — with  Greece.  However,  we  need 
not  pause  long  even  in  Greece ;  for,  although  the  Greeks 
had  many  modes  or  scales,  as  they  never  discovered  the 
natural  advantages  of  the  octave  completed  by  the  eighth 
note,  their  musical  art  could  not  progress. 

It  is  useless  for  pedants  to  prose  about  the  emotional 
advantages  and  special  musical  character  of  the  Dorian, 
Lydian,  or  Phrygian  modes — as  if  we  had  lost,  or  could 
lose,  anything  by  adopting  our  system  of  fixed  tonality; 
for  once  get  that  and  you  can  obviously  write  in  any  mode, 
and  give  your  key  any  special  character  you  like ;  and  the 
proof  of  this  is  that  BERLIOZ  has  used  the  proud  Hypodorian 
mode  in  the  second  part  of  "  Christ's  Infancy  "  Saint-Saens 
opens  the  "  Noces  de  Promethee "  with  it.  GOUNOD  uses 
it  in  Faust  for  the  "Roi  de  Thule."  The  Hypophrygian 
mode  colours  the  close  of  William  Tell,  act  ii.  (RossiNi)  ; 
and  we  might  multiply  instances — but  the  Greeks  could 
never  have  written  Faust  or  William  Tell,  as  will  presently 
appear. 

The  fact  is,  that  in  Greece  musical  sound  was  auxiliary 
to  the  exercise  of  the  dance,  the  ceremony  of  the  feast,  the 


BIRTH  OF  MUSIC.  143 

discipline  of  the  arena,  or  the  voice  of  the  orator ;  it 
accompanied  chanting,  and  most  people  are  agreed  that 
harmony,  in  our  sense  of  the  word,  was  at  that  time  un- 
known. The  Greek  system,  like  some  others  in  the  realms  of 
theology,  philosophy,  and  science,  was  elaborate  but  sterile, 
and  so  Greece  handed  her  traditions  on  to  Rome,  and  still  no 
progress  was  made,  because  music,  like  all  other  arts,  had 
to  bide  her  time.  Her  Muse  is  essentially  the  dear  posses- 
sion of  the  modern  world  ;  she  lives  and  moves  and  finds 
free  development  and  expansion  in  our  atmosphere  alone; 
and  this  is  what  makes  her  so  absorbing  and  fascinating, 
and  entitles  her,  now  that  she  has  reached  her  glorious 
maturity,  to  rank  above  the  other  arts.  I  say  that  Music 
is  essentially  the  Modern  Art,  although  her  mystic  treasures 
lay  buried  for  centuries  in  the  womb  of  Time. 

So  all  things  have  their  supreme  moment ;  so  electricity 
slept  in  the  amber,  and  was  known  to  the  Greek  six  hundred 
years  before  Christ,  but  was  only  wedded  to  applied  science 
in  the  laboratory  of  the  nineteenth  century.  Every  ancient 
who  boiled  a  kettle  must  have  observed  the  rush  of  steam 
from  its  spout,  but  it  remained  for  Watt  and  Stephenson  to 
adapt  it  to  commerce,  manufacture,  and  transport.  And 
all  arts  have  fared  the  same.  Like  spirits  in  the  vasty  deep, 
they  wait  for  their  special  call.  That  call  is  always  the 
same.  It  is  the  deep  need  of  an  Age.

is,  like  Sensation,  one   and  indivisible  in  its  essence ;  but, 

103.       like  Sensation,  it  is  manifold  in  its  channels  of

imperative  mood  of  our  nature :  without  it  we  wither  and 
pine;  with  it  we  grow,  we  develop,  we  soar.  Man  is 
essentially  a  dramatic  animal :  he  is  ever  seeking  to  make 
known  what  is  in  him;  he  aspires  to  the  true  possession 
of  himself.  Life  becomes  more  rich  when  it  passes  into 
word  and  action.  Every  moment  in  proportion  as  we  are 
truly  alive  we  are  longing  to  manifest  ourselves  as  we 
can.  We  are  not  satisfied  till  someone  else  enjoys  what 
we  enjoy,  knows  what  we  know,  feels  what  we  feel,  and 
the  great  burden-lifters  of  humanity  are  those  who  have 
told  us  the  things  we  knew  already,  but  which  we  could 
not  express  for  ourselves.  These  are  "  the  souls  that 
have  made  our  souls  wiser.'*  These  are  the  prophets  and 
the  poets  and  the  artists,  dear,  kindred,  world-embracing 
spirits  that  give  humanity  back  to  itself,  and  make  it  doubly 
worth  having  by  bestowing  upon  it  those  memorable  and 
entrancing  gifts  of  expression  that  "  on  the  stretched  fore- 
finger of  Time  sparkle  for  ever."

And  do  you  not  feel  this  as  you  stand  before  any  great 

work  of  art — the  "Madonna  di  San  Sisto."  at

inexpressible  thoughts — here  before  me  are  the  Divine  figures 
I  have  seen  in  my  dreams"?  When  you  hear  the  Elijah 
do  you  not  stand  in  the  cleft  of  the  rock  with  the  prophet, 
and  veil  your  face  as  the  whirlwind  sweeps  by,  and  amid  the 
crash  of  the  thunder  and  rending  of  the  rocks,  you  perceive 
that  the  Lord  is  not  in  the  tempest,  nor  in  the  earthquake, 
nor  in  the  fire,  but  at  last  in  the  still  small  voice  ?  And 
upon  you  has  not  this  had  a  great  and  hallowing  effect  ? 
Has  not  music  taken  your  own  turbulent  emotions,  and 
expressed  them  for  you  in  the  storm,  leaving  you  sublimely 
elevated  and  yet  sublimely  calm  at  the  close?  Such  will 
indeed  appear  to  be  the  special  function  of  musical  art. 
But  I  must  not  anticipate. 

I   said   each   art   has   to    bide  its  time.     When   a  man 

appears  before  his  time  he  has  to  stand  down,  and  another 

takes   up   his  message  later  on.     And  so  it   is

an  Art;  let  music  come  up  before  its  time, 
another  art,  Sculpture,  will  elbow  it  out,  and  each  growth 
will  be  rapid  in  due  season,  like  that  of  seeds.  Sculpture, 
Architecture,  Painting,  Music,  all  follow  the  same  law. 
Look  at  sculpture  in  Greece  from  AGELADES  and  PHIDIAS 
to  PRAXITELES  and  LYSIPPUS,  a  brief  one  hundred  and  fifty 
years — the  art  reached  its  culmination,  then  dropped,  like  a 
flower  shedding  its  petals,  throughout  the  Isles  of  Greece. 
It  was  the  same  with  the  Greek  drama,  with  Gothic  Architec-

ture  in  the  twelfth  and  thirteenth  centuries,  with  Italian 
painting  in  the  fourteenth  and  fifteenth  centuries  ;  and  Music, 
from  HA.VDEL  to  WAGXER,  is  following  a  similar  course ; 
for  I  think  the  future  history  of  Music  must  be  in  its 
combination  with  the  other  arts,  and  its  adaptation  in  higher 
complexity  to  the  ever-restless  needs  of  human  emotion. 

Now  observe  the  grand  fundamental  law  of  art  succession. 

Each  art  comes  as  the  angelic  response  to  some  cry  of  deep 

106.       developmental  need,   and  it  embodies  the  ideal

PROGRESS, 

AKD  DECAY.  was  the  art  of  the  Greeks  because  they  knew 
nothing  higher  than  the  beauty  and  symmetry  of  the  human 
body;  that  was  the  climax  of  their  adoring  souls,  and  it 
came  forth  in  the  beautiful,  graceful,  and  sublime  forms 
of  Venus,  Apollo,  and  Jove.  We  pass  over  Roman  art, 
for  that  was  either  done  by  Greeks  in  Rome  or  was  simply 
a  pale,  too  often  a  mechanical,  development  of  Greek  art. 
"VVe  also  pass  over  the  early  Christian  art,  for  the  early 
Christians  looked  askance  at  art,  and  yet  were  subdued  by 
it,  for  they  were  forced  at  last  to  weave  the  heathen  sym- 
bols— legends  of  Maia  and  Orpheus — into  their  sepulchral 
frescoes.  We  come  later  on  to  the  extinction  of  almost  all 
sensibility  in  art,  through  Byzantine  forms — in  fact,  to  the 
year  814,  the  time  of  CHARLEMAGNE — a  time  when  the  people 
of  Europe  were  so  busily  engaged  in  slaughtering  one 
another  that,  of  course,  there  was  little  to  be  expected  in  the 


RISE,  PROGRESS,  AND  DECAY.  147 

way  of  art,  which  requires  for  its  elaboration  a  certain 
amount  of  peace  and  leisure. 

But  the  great  human  needs  are  ever  silently  developing, 
and  by-and-by  another  art  arose,  that  of  Gothic  Architecture. 
This  became  a  grand  medium  for  expressing  the  new  thoughts 
and  feelings  of  the  people,  the  awe,  the  worship,  the  grandeur, 
and,  above  all,  the  human  interests  of  the  new  Christianity 
now  spreading  rapidly,  like  some  fertile  and  invincible 
creeper,  over  the  ruined  fragments  of  the  prostrate  Roman 
columns — the  foundation-stones  of  the  modern  world.  MR. 
RUSKIN  has  told  us  how  the  old  monks  built  their  very 
lives,  and  along  with  them  the  hearts  of  the  people,  into 
those  noble  cathedrals  which  are  dotted  over  all  Christian 
lands,  and  remain  the  pride  and  boast  of  the  civilized  world, 
lie  has  made  us  feel  how  the  recluse  must  have  revelled  in 
his  cell  as  he  gazed  upon  the  stone  which  he  was  ready  to 
carve,  or  intrust  to  the  itinerant  mason ;  how  he  paced  his 
cloister  and  dreamed  of  the  execution  of  those  ideas  which 
he  had  perhaps  long  cherished,  until  by  degrees  his  imagi- 
nation moulded  the  very  life  of  the  period,  its  activity,  its 
coarseness,  its  humour,  as  well  as  its  devotion,  into  sculptured 
capital  and  gargoyle. 

The  efflorescent  and  flamboyant  wildness  of  design  marked 
at  length  the  extreme  limits  of  the  stone  art.  The  too  fitful, 
fanciful  impatience  or  despair  succeeded  loss  of  healthy  per- 
ception, loss  of  interest,  of  reason,  of  law,  and  Gothic  archi- 
tecture became  worse  than  dead — degraded.  But  the  stone

148  THE  RATIONALE  OF  MUSIC. 

art  only  fell  when  its  powers  as  an  expressional  medium  were 
exhausted. 

Art  now  turned  the  stonemason's  chisel  into  the  painter's 
brush ;  rapidly  through  the  schools  of  Venice,  Florence,  and 
Rome,  were  the  foundations  of  the  art  laid,  the  discovery  of 
perspective,  anatomy,  and  colour.  The  noble  edifice  rose 
from  GIOTTO  to  RAPHAEL  only  to  exhaust  in  its  turn,  and  in  a 
comparatively  short  time,  the  new,  more  plastic,  more 
pathetic  vehicle  of  colour,  and  turn  restlessly  to  seek  and  to 
find  another  medium. 

What  was  that  other  latest-born  minister  of  expression, 
eager  to  seize  the  torch  as  it  fell  from  the  painter's  trem- 
bling hands.     It  was  Music.     She  offered  herself 
107. 
MUSIC      a  new  emotional  medium  fitted  to  express  what 

'  neither  Sculpture,  Architecture,  nor  Painting 
could  express,  the  mystic  and  complex  emotions  of  that 
hidden  life  made  up  of  self-analysis,  sensibility,  love, 
prayer,  trance,  vision,  ecstasy,  which  Christianity  brought 
into  the  world,  and  which  gave  to  the  human  soul  that 
inner  and  intense  quality  of  spiritual  independence  which 
must  henceforth  stamp  and  qualify  all  human  progress. 
It  is  impossible  to  deny  that  more  secular  elements  entered 
into  the  formation  of  the  modern  spirit,  although  its  inward- 
ness was  its  chief  characteristic. 

Great  geographical  discoveries,  New  Worlds,  Australia 
America,  and  the  remote  East ;  great  commercial  activities,

great  inventions,  the  printing  press,  steam  navigation,  and 
the  electric  telegraph;  great  religious  movements, great  revo- 
lutions, the  rise  of  the  English  Reformation,  the  translation 
of  the  Bible ;  many  things  combined  to  produce  the  unparal- 
leled activity  of  the  modern  spirit.  But  amongst  all  these 
factors  Christianity  was  paramount ;  it  explored  and  sifted 
emotion  as  it  had  never  been  explored  and  sifted  before ;  it 
set  free  the  springs  of  the  inner  life,  and  taught  men  the 
sublime  secret  of  an  independent  emotional  consciousness, 
before  which  the  outer  world  vanished  into  space,  whilst  the 
changes,  the  rise  and  fall,  and  subtle  sequences  of  mental 
states  became  the  only  realities. 

But  the  hunger  of  art  could  not  long  be  evaded.     These 
very  states  called  aloud  for  expression ;  they  were  elaborated 

in  the  silence  of  the  cloister,  and  it  was  thence 
108. 
SECRET  OF  that  music  stept  forth  into  the  world,  as  the  new 

art  medium.  Now,  as  I  have  elsewhere  pointed 
out  at  some  length,  music  possesses  two  qualities  combined 
by  no  other  art :  first,  the  quality  of  velocity — it  moves ; 
and  secondly,  the  quality  of  direct  appeal — it  stirs  feelings 
without  having  recourse  to  ideas  or  images.  The  drama, 
indeed,  has  movement,  but  it  only  stirs  emotion  through 
ideas;  painting  stirs  us  by  the  ideas  presented  and  the 
direct  emotional  impact  of  colour,  but  it  has  no  velocity ; 
that  has  to  be  supplied  by  imagination.  You  may  ally 
music  with  anything  you  please,  but  it  alone  can  deal

first-hand  with  emotion,  arouse  it,  control  it,  direct  it, 
and  follow  its  chameleon  life  through  all  its  innumerable 
windings. 

This,  the  secret  of  music,  once  stated,  is  stated  for  ever;  it 
is  revealed  in  two  words,  Directness  and  Velocity. 

And  now,  having  shown  the  place  of  music  amongst  the 
arts,  I  should   naturally   proceed   to   trace   the  history   of 
109.       Modern  Music  through  what  MR.  HULLAH  has 
P^DERN>F  terme<i  its  three  periods.     "We  must  be  satisfied 
MCSIC.      here  with  but  one  glimpse.     First  period,   A.D. 
370  to  1400.     AMBROSE  (374)  selected  certain  of  the  Greek 
modes   for  chants.     GREGORY    (590)   revived  the  forgotten 
work   of  the  good   Milanese   bishop,  and  added  four  new 
scales.     Then  came  HUCHBALD  of  Tournay  (932),  who  intro- 
duced a  sort  of  harmony  which  must  have  resembled  the 
mixture  stop  of  the  organ.     GUIDO  (1020)  of  Arezzo,  and 
FRANCO  of  Cologne   (1200),  who  between  them  divide  the 
honours  of  descant,  cantus  mensurabilis,  or  division  into  bars, 
and  flats  and  sharps,  together  with    the   invention  of  the 
monochord. 

In  the  second  period,  1400  to  1600,  we  have  JOSQUIN  DES 
PRES  in  Belgium,  and  PALESTRINA  in  Italy,  and  the  rise  of  a 
true  system  of  tonality ;  and  when  we  enter  the  third  period, 
1600  to  1750,  we  have  reached  the  true  octave;  the  major 
and  minor  scale  in  which  we  find  the  uniform  arrangement 
of  semitones  and  the  perfect  cadence,  ascribed  by  some  to

MONTE  VERDE  1590.  When  this  moment  arrived,  the  basis 
of  a  sound  musical  development  was  reached,  and  modern 
music  then  first  became  possible.  The  science  of  the  cloister 
had  at  last  stepped  forth  to  wed,  to  train  and  discipline  the 
wild,  untutored  art  of  the  world  outside. 

Rapid  and  sudden,  like  the  burst  of  Greek  sculpture  or 
Italian  painting,  was  the  rise  and  progress  of  modern  music, 
the  instant  the  science  of  the  Church  touched  the  heart  of 
the  World. 

CARISSIMI  died  1672 ;  he  was  the  type  of  the  transition 
period.  He  might  have  seen  PALESTRINA,  and  he  lived  to 
hear  CORELLI.  In  CORELLI'S  life-time  the  germ  of  every 
style  of  music  since  known  arose.  He  witnessed  the  singing 
schools  of  Naples  in  the  south,  the  rise  of  the  great  violin 
schools  in  the  north,  the  foundation  of  the  oratorio  in  Rome, 
the  progress  of  instrumental  music  throughout  Italy, 
France,  and  England.  All  this  took  place  in  the  last  cen- 
tury, and  we  are  struck  with  a  certain  awe  when  we  remem- 
ber that  men  are  still  (1883)  alive  who  may  have  listened  to 
MOZART  (died  1791),  and  conversed  with  the  venerable  HAYDN 
(died  1808).  (See  Music  and  Morals.) 

I  return  from  this  by  no  means  irrelevant  digression  to 
illustrate  the  functions  by  completing  the  analysis 
MUSIC  AND  of  music,  as  the  direct  language  of  the  emotions. 
Have  you  ever  analysed  your  thoughts  and  feel- 
ings?   Some  say  it  is  an  unhealthy  practice,  but  that  quite

depends;  and  if  it  is  used  for  a  legitimate  purpose,  it  is 
interesting  to  observe  what  is  going  on  in  the  realm  of 
emotion.  Every  moment  is  occupied  by  some  feeling — 
good,  bad,  or  indifferent.  You  are  very  seldom  neutral,  and 
when  you  are,  it  is  worthy  of  being  noted  as  a  fixed  point 
from  which  to  measure  the  "  excursional "  extent  of  your 
emotion. 

If  I  now  repeat  my  analysis  of  the  properties  of  emotion, 
and  then  refer  it  to  those  of  sound,  as  manipulated  by  music, 
we  shall  find  that  precisely  the  same  qualities  which  exist 
inwardly  in  emotion,  exist  outwardly  in  sound.  And  that 
is  the  reason  why  music  is  fitted  to  be,  and  is  recognised 
as,  the  language  of  emotion.  I  pointed  this  out  in  Music 
and  Morals,  and  when  it  was  pointed  out  it  seemed  very 
simple. 

Emotion,  then,  consists  first  of  elation  and  depression ; 

that   is,  it   goes   up   and   down   like   a  wavy  line.     When 

a  lecturer  addresses   an  audience,  the  interest 

KEW        may  go  down  lower  and  lower ;  then,  perhaps, 

'  he  says  something  which  tickles  the  fancy,  and 

the  emotion  goes  up  and  up,  his  hearers'  hopes  are  raised, 

and  they  say  to  themselves,  "  Oh,  it 's  not  going  to  be  so 

dull,  after  all."     Here,  then,  is  an  instance  of  depression 

followed  by  elation. 

The  next  quality  is  intensity.  Your  emotion  varies  in 
intensity.  You  grow  intense  and  earnest  as  you  listen

to  a  speaker  who  interests  you,  until  perhaps  you  are 
quite,  as  you  say,  carried  away,  or  entranced  by  his 
eloquence. 

Then  your  emotion  has  variety.  "We  may  illustrate  this. 
A  man  is  sitting  on  a  foggy  day  in  his  parlour,  when 
a  friend  suddenly  drops  in.  He  is  glad  to  see  him,  and  out 
of  depression  he  begins  to  rise  into  elation.  And  then 
comes  a  story  of  the  hunting  field,  a  well-known  wall  had  to 
be  cleared,  and  someone  was  thrown ;  and  as  he  listens  with 
more  and  more  interest,  he  finds  the  climax  to  be  that  the 
narrator  himself  was  the  man  who  was  thrown,  and  that 
he  has  come  on  this  depressing  day  to  see  him  partly  on 
that  account.  Then  other  friends  drop  in,  and  you  ring  for 
cigars  and  wine.  You  are  informed  there  are  no  cigars, 
and  your  emotion  is  now  divided  by  the  story,  the  cigars,  the 
servant,  and  your  friends ;  you  are  the  subject  of  a  great 
variety  of  simultaneous  emotions,  some  not  over-pleasurable, 
but,  at  any  rate,  there  is  variety. 

Then,  fourthly,  emotion  has  a  kind  of  form — you  may 
give  it  an  arbitrary  form ;  you  can  represent  its  direction 
by  lines  curved  according  to  elation  or  depression,  thick  or 
thin  according  to  intensity,  and  you  can  bracket  them 
together  to  show  that  they  are  simultaneous.  (Vide  Music 
and  Morals.) 

Lastly,  emotion  possesses  velocity ;  it  travels,  and  it  is 
never  quite  at  rest ;  you  may  call  its  velocity  x. 

Now  pass  to  musical  sound.     The  notes  in  a  musical  scale 


154  THE  RATIONALE  OF  MUSIC. 

go  up  and  down;  they  have  elation  and  depression,  may 
vary  in  loudness  from  pp.  to  ff.t  from  crescendo  to 
diminuendo,  and  so  they  have  intensities.  Many  lines  of 
melody  and  harmony  can  be  carried  on  simultaneously, 
as  in  a  part  song  or  a  score  of  Wagner's ;  there  is  then 
no  mistake  about  variety.  Then  music  has  form.  Musical 
form  is  as  much  a  recognised  musical  phrase  as  "  nicely- 
felt  colour"  is  in  painting,  and  it  is  more  to  the  point, 
for  we  have  but  to  cast  our  eyes  over  a  score  of  SPOHR 
or  BEETHOVEN,  and  compare  it  with  one  of  HANDEL'S,  to 
see  how  widely  different  is  the  general  form  even  to  the 
eye.  Lastly,  from  adagio  to  presto  you  have  reached  in 
music  that  crowning  property  of  emotion,  velocity,  for 
music  is  never  at  rest. 

Side  by  side,  then,  we  place,  after  five-fold  analysis, 
emotion  and  music,  the  thing  to  be  expressed  and  the 
thing  which  expresses  it.  In  passing  from  one  to  the 
other  we  have  simply  exchanged  certain  arbitrary  lines 
and  an  x  for  a  set  of  symbols  capable  of  bringing  the 
various  properties  of  emotion  into  connection  with  sound. 
That  set  of  symbols,  so  long  in  arriving,  so  glorious  in 
its  advent,  is  obviously  modern  Musical  Notation,  and  in 
wedding  that  to  sound  we  have  reached  at  last  the  sove- 
reign and  direct  medium  of  emotional  expression  in  THE 

ART    OF    MODERN    MUSIC. 

And  now  if  it  be  asked,  "  What  is  the  use  of  music  ? " 


USE 


OF  MUSIC.  155 


I    may   ask   in   return,  ""What   is   the  use  of  emotion?" 

It  colours  all  life,  it  inspires  all  words,  it  nerves 
112. 
uss  OF     for  all  action.     What  would  your  life  be  without 

it  ?  And  what  is  the  grandest  thought  without 
it  ?  You  know  you  may  repeat  a  grand  passage  of  SHAKE- 
SPEARE without  emotion.  The  noblest  passages  in  the  Bible 
are  often  read  aloud  without  kindling  a  thrill  or  quickening 
a  pulse.  But  apply  the  heat  of  noble  dramatic  action  or 
impassioned  religious  eloquence,  and  how  changed  is  the 
leaden  atmosphere  !  how  living  and  pregnant  is  the  thought ! 
Music  expresses  no  thoughts,  stands  for  no  ideas  or  intellec- 
tual conceptions,  rouses  (except  by  association)  no  images ; 
but  it  stands  for  independent  states  of  consciousness,  it 
creates  the  atmosphere  in  which  thoughts  are  born,  it  deals 
with  the  mystic  states  in  which  thought  is  steeped  and 
coloured. 

"Without  emotion  thought  would  perish,  or  remain  passive 
and  inert.  No  age,  no  sentient  creature  has  been  quite 
without  a  sense  of  musical  sound  as  the  language  of  emotion. 
In  its  rude  elements  even  dumb  animals  are  affected  by  it. 
It  influences  dogs,  horses,  and  cattle  generally.  Notice  how 
a  musical  sound,  though  monotonous,  is  understood  and 
obeyed,  and  how  the  jingle  of  bells  notoriously  encourages 
horses  to  perform  their  work.  The  plough-boy  is  inspirited 
by  the  strains  of  his  own  whistling.  And  do  you  wonder 
that  the  Spartans  were  enabled  to  march  to  victory  inspired 
by  the  lays  of  the  minstrel  TYRT^US — that  our  soldiers

require  the  fife  and  drum?  And  I  have  been  told  a  thing 
at  which  I  have  much  wondered,  that  there  are  people  in 
the  North  who  are  very  delighted  and  cheered  by  that 
monotonous  instrument  of  torture,  the  Scotch  bagpipe. 

I  must  not  trust  myself  to  dwell  upon  the  religious  func- 
tions of  music — active,  as  in  the  Lutheran  hymn,  sung  by 
the  people;  passive,  as  in  the  mass  or  Catholic 

llo. 

SONGS  OF    anthem,  sung  for  the  people.     The  songs  of  the 

'  temple  have  had  more  attention  paid  them  than 

the  songs  of  the  street ;  but  the  time  will  come  when  these, 

too,  will  be  understood  as  important  factors  in  the  life  and 

morality  of  the  people. 

A  great  statesman  has  said,  "  Let  me  make  the  songs  of 
the  people,  and  let  who  will  make  their  laws."     And  when 

we  think  what  might  be  the  influence  of  music 
114. 
SONGS  OP    we  cannot  but  regret  that  the  popular  songs  of 

England  are,  in  fact,  represented  by  "  Tommy, 
make  room  for  your  uncle."  The  songs  of  our  music 
halls  kindle  emotions  truly,  but  of  what  kind  are  they  ? 
When  you  employ  music,  wed  it  to  thought,  and  thus 
awaken  emotions,  you  must  remember  you  are  playing 
with  two-edged  tools,  for  the  emotions  kindled  and  directed 
may  be  such  as  it  is  unhealthy  and  'mischievous  to  cherish. 
Emotion  means  fire,  and  a  heap  of  live  coals  on  your 
carpet  and  in  your  grate  subserve  very  different  purposes ; 


MUSIC  MEANS  MORALS.  157 

for  in  the  one  case  your  house  is  warmed,  and  in  the 
other  case  it  is  burned  clown.  So  it  is  with  music,  which 
kindles  and  directs  emotion.  Music  under  certain  conditions 
elevates,  while  under  certain  other  conditions  it  demoralises. 
Music  ought  to  be  used  discreetly,  advisedly,  and  soberly, 
and  that  is  why  the  particular  kind  of  music  we  adopt,  and 
the  words  to  which  music  is  set,  should  be  very  carefully 
considered. 

Music  is  not  intended  simply  to  tickle  the  ear;  music 
means   Morals.     And   here  let   me    remind   you   that  not 

half  enough  has  been  said  of  the  discipline  of 
115. 
MUSIC  MEANS  emotion,    a  function   exercised    in    the   highest 

degree  by  music.  Upon  this  very  quality  of 
discipline,  nobility,  and  truth  of  emotional  expression, 
turns  the  distinction  between  the  modern  German  and 
the  modern  Italian  schools,  as  schools.  I  say  modern 
Italian,  because  the  old  Church  schools  of  Pergolese  and 
Stradella  were  severe,  beautiful,  and!  sublime  compared  to 
the  modern  Italian  opera  and  romance.  Yet  must  we  not 
deny  the  splendid  melodic  and  even  harmonic  qualities  which 
are  to  be  found  in  the  essentially  false  form  and  spirit  of 
the  Italian  opera.  It  has  been  too  much  the  fashion 
of  the  English  Wagnerites  to  decry  Italian  music ;  but  the 
German  Wagnerite  is  more  liberal  and  catholic  in  his  ap- 
preciation, while  WAGNER  himself  was  the  most  liberal  and 
truly  catholic  musician  of  them  all.  He  could  appreciate 


158  THE  RATIONALE  Of  MUSIC. 

every  kind  of  music,  and  so  caa  those  who  interpret  him 
best. 

I  remember,  when  I  was  at  Nuremberg,  falling  in  with 
RICHTER,  then  conductor  of  the  Bayreuth  Festival.  We  were 

seated   in  the  parlour   of  a   little  old-fashioned 
116. 
BICHTEB  ON  German  inn,    discussing   the  various  schools    of 

music,  when  I  happened  to  allude  to  a  famous 
quartet  in  VERDI'S  Rigoletto,  and  to  BELLINI'S  Norma, 
whereupon  RICHTER,  the  great  Wagner  disciple — RICHTER, 
the  conductor  of  the  Bayreuth  Festival,  the  incarnation 
of  the  music  of  the  future,  sprang  up,  and  lifting  high 
his  glass,  in  honour  of  the  great  Italian,  exclaimed, 
"  Ach,  der  Bellini — ist  ein  ganz  colossaler  Kerl !  " 

To  resume.  The  secret  of  a  good  school  of  music  is, 
that  it  is  a  real  exponent  and  a  sound  discipliner  of  the 

emotions.  Listening  to  a  symphony  or  sonata 
REFINING  of  BEETHOVEN'S  is  not  a  joke :  it  is  a  study, 

an  emotional  training.  You  sit  down  and  listen 
attentively,  and  the  master  leads  you  through  various 
moods;  he  elates  you  and  depresses  you;  your  feeling 
waxes  and  wanes  with  various  intensities,  not  spasmodi- 
cally, but  by  coherent  sequences.  You  are  put  through 
a  whole  system  of  feeling,  not  of  your  own  choosing;  you 
are  not  allowed  to  choose,  you  are  to  control  yourself  here 
and  expand  there ;  and  at  last,  after  due  exercise,  you  are 


AN  ENGLISH  SCHOOL   OF  MUSIC.  159 

landed  on  the  composer's  own  platform,  disciplined,  re- 
freshed, and  elevated.  Although  urged  here  and  there,  the 
light  rein  has  been  upon  you,  and  the  master  drives  you 
much  in  the  same-  way  that  a  skilled  charioteer  drives  a 
spirited  steed. 

This  is  the  process  of  all  really  great  music,  and  the 
reason  why  the  Italian,  as  a  school,  and,  indeed,  all  bad 
music,  Italian  or  otherwise,  is  injurious  is  because  it  deals 
unfairly  or  untruly  with  your  emotions.  It  does  not  give 
you  a  balanced,  rational,  or  healthful  sequence  of  feeling. 
It  is  like  a  picture  the  effect  of  which  is  spoilt  by  a  washy 
background  of  raw  colour,  or  like  a  melodrama  such  as  The 
Bells,  which,  without  any  reflection  on  MR.  IRVING'  s  fine 
acting,  we  may,  however,  call  a  very  good  melodrama,  but  of 
a  bad  art  sort.  It  is  unlike  a  play  of  SHAKESPEARE'S.  If  he 
has  horrors  to  bring  before  you,  he  prepares  you  for  them  ; 
you  are  not  trifled  with  and  exhausted,  your  emotions  are 
not  whipped  and  spurred  until  they  almost  cease  to  respond. 
All  bad  art  trifles  with,  exhausts,  and  enervates  you  ;  and 
music  most  of  all,  because  it  deals  at  first  hand  with  the 
emotions. 

I  look  for  a  great  popular  development  of  musical  art  in 
118.       England.    You  know  very  well  that  "  the  English 


AN  ENGLISH  are  no£  a  jnugjcai  people."     They  may  cultivate

great  masters  on  the  Continent.  The  national  music  is  ahout 
"Champagne  Charley/'  "Tommy,"  "Waking  the  Baby," 
"Grandfather's  Clock,"  and  "Over  the  Garden  Wall." 
It  is  true  we  have  SIR  ARTHUR  SULLIVAN,  whose  composi- 
tions are  always  welcome ;  but  he  studied  in  Germany,  he 
took  the  Mendelssohn  scholarship  at  Leipsic,  and  therefore 
he  may  be  considered,  so  far  as  music  is  concerned,  a  Ger- 
man to  the  backbone ;  it  can  scarcely  be  said  of  him,  from 
a  musical  point  of  view,  that,  "  in  spite  of  all  temptations 
to  belong  to  other  nations,  he  remained  an  Englishman." 

But  in  the  last  forty  years  the  progress  of  music  in 
England  has  been  very  great.  MR.  HULLAH  told  me  that 
when  he  began  to  examine  schools  he  found  children  who 
could  not  sing  two  or  three  consecutive  notes  in  tune  ;  but 
that  now,  very  greatly  through  MR.  HULLAH'S  own  work, 
this  state  of  things  is  altered,  and  he  says  that  if  you  go 
through  the  length  and  breadth  of  the  land,  you  will  find 
that  the  national  ear  has  been  to  a  great  extent  cultivated. 
But  we  must  not  stop  here;  the  national  art  must  be 
improved,  and  then  the  national  taste,  and,  above  all,  the 
education  of  the  nation,  as  a  whole,  in  music. 

I  should  like  to  see  someone  who  should  be  responsible 

119.       for  conducting  the  musical  performances  of  our 

BOARD      children.     Nothing  is  more  striking  in  our  Board 

MUSIC.      Schools    than    the    admirable    management    of 

every   othq*   department    of   instruction,  and  the  muddle, 


EOAED  SCHOOL  MUSIC.  Ifil 

looseness,  uncertainty,  and  general  inefficiency  of  tlic 
musical  instruction.  Sound,  popular  music,  songs,  and 
part  singing,  at  sight  as  well  as  by  ear,  should  radiate 
from  the  Board  Schools.  I  desire  to  see  cheap  sheets 
of  music  placed  in  the  hands  of  the  children,  which  they 
may  take  to  their  homes,  and  so  learn  the  art  of  singing 
part  songs,  as  they  do  in  Amsterdam,  and,  indeed,  in 
Holland  generally.  Even  in  Switzerland  there  is  a  certain 
coherent  musical  part  "  yodelling/'  at  ajiy  rate  superior  to 
the  "  He  'a  a  jolly  good  fellow  "  style  of  chorus  affected  at 
our  own  convivial  assemblies. 

Let  the  heaven-born  art  of  music  spread ;  let  it  bless  the 
homes  and  hearths  of  the  people  ;  let  the  children  sing,  and 
sing  together ;  let  the  concertina,  the  violin,  or  the  flute  be 
found  in  every  cottage ;  let  not  the  only  fiddle  in  the  place 
be  hung  up  in  the  beer-shop,  the  only  choruses  in  the  village 
be  heard  in  the  choir  and  at  the  public-house.  And  while 
music  refines  pleasure,  let  it  stimulate  work.  Let  part 
songs  and  sweet  melody  rise  in  all  our  crowded  factories 
above  the  whirl  of  wheels  and  clanking  of  machinery ;  thus 
let  the  factory  girl  forget  her  toil  and  the  artisan  his  grie- 
vance, and  Music,  the  Civiliser,  the  Recreator,  the  Soother 
and  Purifier  of  the  emotions,  shall  become  the  music  of  the 
future  for  England.

THE  soul  is  one,  simple,  indivisible.     The  senses  are  five,

UNITY  OF  GOETHE  imagined  we  might  perceive,  without 
having  recourse  to  these  five  ministers ;  to  be 
in  each  other's  presence  might  suffice  to  place  souls  in 
perfect  and  intimate  communion,  without  speech,  or  touch, 
or  sight,  or  sound.  When  dealing  with  one  sense,  I  am 
aware  of  limitation  and  imperfection ;  it  gives  me  what 
it  can  of  perception — and  no  more.  I  must  eke  out  its 
message  by  another — to  complete  sight  I  must  resort  to 
touch ;  but  I  soon  find  'tis  but  half  a  world  without  sound. 
Insatiable  is  the  soul  until  perception  flows  in  through  all 
the  senses.  WAGNER  felt  this  when  he  insisted  upon  the 
arts  being  united,  thus  instructing  the  soul  fully,  by  a 
simultaneous  appeal,  in  which  that  which  could  not  be 
conveyed  by  one  channel  came  in  through  another. 

Something  of  this  kind  I  happened  to  say  in  a  sermon 
one  night,  and  the  next  day  I  received  an  anonymous  MS. 


THE  HUMAN  EAR.  163 

in  which  the  sense  of  hearing  was  discussed  in  several  de- 
sultory paragraphs,  full  of  ingenuity  and,  I  must 
AN  ANONY-  add,  of   technical  knowledge.      The  anonymous 
author  will,  perhaps,  pardon  me  for  making  use 
of  his  ideas  here.     These  remarks  interested  me  for  several 
reasons  :  first,  because  they  were  thoughtful  and  suggestive ; 
secondly,  because   they   teemed  with  accurate  information  ; 
thirdly,  because  the  argument  from  design,  now  habitually 
set  aside,  is  unexpectedly  endorsed  from  a  scientific  plat- 
form ;  and  lastly,  because  the  description  of  the  ear  from 
a  musical  standpoint  very  fitly  led  up  to  the  meditations 
which  I  am  about  to  offer  to  my  reader  on  hearing  music. 

My  unknown  correspondent  began  by  pointing  out  that 
the  human  ear  was  the  most  perfect  conceivable  mechanism 

for  the   reception   and  transmission   of  musical 
122.  r 

THE  HDMAN  sounds.  He  added,  on  what  authority  I  know 
not,  that  as  regards  structural  aggregation  of 
elements,  this  has  been  so  since  the  creation  of  the  world ; 
no  alterations  under  the  influences  of  time  are  supposed  to 
have  occurred.  The  progressive  evolution  of  music  has  not 
been  accompanied  by  any  synchronous  changes  in  the 
acoustic  apparatus  of  the  human  ear.  Yet  in  the  human  ear 
we  find  provisions  for  the  differentiation  of  noises  and 
musical  notes,  from  the  canon's  crash  to  the  one  sixty-fourth 
of  a  musical  tone — the  former  (probably)  in  the  labyrinth, 
the  latter  in  the  fibres  of  Corti,  (33|-  to  each  semitone).  We 

11   *

have  sympathetically  vibrating  membranes  and  strings 
of  varying  tension,  capable  of  answering  to  an  almost 
infinite  variety  of  fundamental  tones,  discriminating  their 
pitch  ;  we  even  have  dampers,  to  arrest  vibrations. 

Again,  in  the  human  ear  we  have  had  from  all  time  a  tele- 
phonic membrane  (the  tympanum)  capable  of  transmitting 
4,000  vibrations  a  second  to  the  central  electro-magnetic 
medium  (or  brain)  of  the  human  telegraphic  system  of  nerves 
and  branch  offices,  in  which  the  sensations  arising  from  the 
perception  of  sound  are  generated  and  reflected. 

As  in  the  case  of  colour  and  the  differentiation  of  various 
spectrum  rays,  presumably  dependent  upon  the  heat, 
velocity,  and  angle  of  refraction  of  the  ray  as  it  strikes  the 
retinal  elements,  so  in  musical  variety  of  tones,  an  educa- 
tional evolution  must  have  been  at  work  in  the  recognition 
and  discrimination  of  sound  waves  and  vibrations  of  vary- 
ing length  and  intensity.  But  this  involves  no  necessary 
change  in  physical  conformation,  retinal  or  auditory,  only  a 
functional  development  necessitated  by  the  ever-increasing 
demands  of  sound.  MR.  GLADSTONE  has  attempted  to  show 
the  ignorance  of  the  ancients  of  the  colour  red,  how  many 
changes  in  the  retinal  power  of  differentiating  and  answering 
to  the  creative  genius  of  man,  exercised  through  the  acci- 
dental discoveries  of  the  chemical  art,  have  occurred  since 
the  Homeric  age?  Take  all  our  modern  varieties  of 
colour : — 

How    must    certain    ages    of    colour-training    influence 


THE  HUMAN  EAR.  165 

the  retina  in  its  actual  or  progressive  functional  develop- 
ment? 

Similarly,  how  largely  must  certain  periods  of  musical 
genius,  with  their  correlative  expressions,  in  contemporaneous 
musical  compositions,  have  affected  the  functional  powers  of 
the  acoustic  elements  in  the  ear  and  the  hearing  brain  centre 
in  which  lay  the  latent  capacities  for  their  reception  ? 

The  style,  even  when  clipped,  is  a  little  heavy.  My 
anonymous  correspondent  here  exclaims : — 

"  Strange  and  marvellous  creative  foresight,  evidence  of 
design  within  design,  anticipatory  through  the  ages  of  all 
possible  or  conceivable  variety  or  combination  of  varieties  in 
musical  evolution  !  " 

And  he  concludes  with  this  quaint  general  summary  : — 

"  Most  perfect  camera  (human  eye)  ;  most  perfect  tele- 
phone (human  ear) ;  most  perfect  violin  (human  larynx)  ; 
most  perfect  hydrostatic  apparatus  (human  heart).;  most 
perfect  series  of  mechanical  powers  (human  muscles  and

HEARING   MUSIC. 

WOULD  you  rather  be  blind  or  deaf?  Most  people  will 
illogically  reply,  "  Neither  ! "  but  when  pressed,  nine  out  of 

ten  will  be  found  to  answer,  "Leave  me  the 
DEAF  AND  sight  of  my  eyes — let  me  be  deaf."  Yet  all 

experience  shows  that  they  are  wrong.  Deafness 
tries  the  temper  more,  isolates  more,  unfits  for  social 
converse,  cuts  off  from  the  world  of  breathing  emotional 
activity,  tenfold  more  than  blindness.  There  is  something 
as  yet  unanalysed  about  sound,  which  doubles  and  in- 
tensifies at  all  points  the  sense  of  living :  when  we  hear, 
we  are  somehow  more  alive  than  when  we  see.  Apart 
from  sound,  the  outward  world  has  a  dream-like  and 
unreal  look  --  -we  only  half  believe  in  it ;  we  miss  at  each 
moment  what  it  contains.  It  presents,  indeed,  innumerable 
pictures  of  still-life;  but  these  refuse  to  yield  up  half  their 
secrets.  If  anyone  is  inclined  to  doubt  this,  let  him  stop  his 


DEAF  FOE  TEN  MINUTES.  1G7 

cars  with  cotton  wool  for  five  minutes,  and  sit  in  the  room 
•with  some  intelligent  friend  who  enjoys  the  full  use  of  his 
ears,  and  at  the  end  of  five  or  ten  minutes  let  the  two  com- 
pare notes.  Of  course,  we  must  suppose  that  both  are 
doing  nothing,  except  the  one  taking  stock  of  his  loss,  and 
the  other  taking  stock  of  his  gain. 

I  sit  then,  in   my  chair  stone   deaf.      I  look  up  at  the 

pictures  on  the  wall — a   man  driving  a  goat,  a  hay-stack, 

and  some  pigs — an  engraving  of  MILLAIS  lt  Black

1  notice  the  bird  on  his  perch;  his  mouth  is 
wide  open,  he  looks  to  me  as  if  he  were  in  a  fit.  I 
point  at  him  in  an  alarmed  manner;  my  friend  shakes 
his  head  with  a  smile — the  bird 's  only  singing.  I  can't 
say  I  am  glad  to  hear  it,  for  I  cannot  hear  anything. 
Presently  my  friend  rises  and  goes  to  the  door,  opens  it — 
what  on  earth  for  ?  Why,  in  jumps  the  cat.  I  suppose  he 
heard  it  outside ;  it  might  have  mewed  till  doomsday,  as  far 
as  my  ears  were  concerned.  My  strange  companion  has  no 
sooner  sat  down  on  his  chair,  than  he  jumps  up  as  if  stung. 
He  points  out,  in  answer  to  my  bewildered  look,  that  the  legs 
are  loose ;  he  must  have  heard  them  creak,  I  suppose.  Then 
he  goes  up  to  the  clock,  and  begins  winding  it  up ;  he  must 
have  noticed  that  it  had  left  off  ticking.  I  might  not  have 
found  that  out  for  hours.  Another  start !  he  rushes  from 
the  room,  I  follow — the  maid  has  spilt  the  coal-scuttle  all

down  the  stairs ;  he  probably  heard  the  smash,.  My  wife 
might  have  fallen  down-stairs  and  broken  her  neck,  and  I 
should  have  known  nothing  about  it.  No  sooner  are  we 
alone  again,  than  he  once  more  rises,  I  know  not  why ;  but 
I  perceive  he  is  met  at  the  door  by  someone  who  has  called 
him ;  it  is  of  no  use  for  anyone  to  call  me. 

There  happens  to  be  a  kettle  on  the  fire,  and  at  a  par- 
ticular moment  my  prudent  friend  rises.  I  should  never 
have  thought  of  it — the  kettle  is  going  to  boil  over;  he 
hears.  All  this  is  insupportable.  I  am  being  left  out  of 
life — it  is  worse  than  being  shut  up  in  the  dark.  I  tear  the 
wool  out  of  my  ears  long  before  the  expiration  of  the  ten 
minutes,  and  my  friend  addresses  me  as  follows : 

"  I  pass  over  the  canary,  the  cat,  the  chair,  the  coal- 
scuttle, and  the  kettle.  You  happened  to  find  out  about 
them  a  day  after  the  fair  by  using  your  eyes;  but  besides  all 
this,  of  how  much  vivid  life  were  you  deprived — how  many 
details  of  consciousness,  how  many  avenues  of  thought  were 
lost  to  you  in  less  than  ten  minutes  !  As  I  sat,  I  could  hear 
your  favourite  nocturne  of  CHOPIN  being  played  in  the  next 
room.  Perhaps  you  did  not  know  it  was  raining ;  nor  should 
I  have  noticed  it,  only  I  heard  it  on  the  sky-light.  I  there- 
fore rang  the  bell,  ordered  a  trap-door  open  in  the  roof  to  be 
shut,  and  sent  the  carriage  for  a  lady  who  would  have  other- 
wise had  to  walk  home.  You  did  not  notice  a  loud  crack 
behind  you ;  but,  in  fact,  a  hot  coal  flew  out  of  the  fire,  and 
1  seized  it  in  time  to  prevent  mischief.  The  postman's  knock 


THE  MUSICAL  EAR.  169 

reminded  me  of  some  letters  I  ought  to  write,  and  I  made  a 
note  of  them.  The  band  playing  outside  put  me  in  mind  of 
some  concert-tickets  I  had  promised  to  send.  A  neighbour- 
ing church-bell  reminded  me  of  the  fact  that  it  was 
Wednesday,  and  about  a  quarter  to  eleven  o'clock.  Punch, 
and  Judy  heard  in  the  distance  reminded  me  of  the  children, 
and  some  toys  I  had  promised.  I  could  hear  the  distant 
whistle  of  a  train.  The  pleasant  crackling  of  the  fire  behind 
me  was  most  genial.  I  let  a  poor  bee  out  who  was  buzzing 
madly  upon  the  window-pane.  I  heard  a  ring  at  the  street- 
bell,  presently  I  heard  a  well-known  voice  in  the  hall.  I 
knew  who  had  arrived — I  knew  who  met  him;  I  could 
shrewdly  conjecture  where  they  went  together,  and  I  guessed 
not  unnaturally  that  the  children's  lessons  would  be  neg- 
lected that  morning,  since  a  far  more  agreeable  companion 
had  stepped  in  to  monopolise  the  eldest  daughter.  Of  all 
which  things,  my  poor  friend,  you  knew  nothing,  because 
your  ears  were  stuffed  with  cotton  wool." 

Alas  1  too  many  of  us   go   through  life  with   our    ears 
stuffed  with  cotton  wool.     Some  persons  can  hear,  but  not 

well ;  others  can  hear  common  sounds  and  musical 
125. 
THE  MUSICAL  sounds,  and  no  one  would  suspect  in  them  any 

AB"  defect,  until  it  some  day  turns  out  that  they  do 
not  know  the  difference  between  "  God  save  the  Queen " 
and  "Auld  lang  syne."  Thus  we  reach  the  distinction 
between  the  common  ear  and  the  musical  ear.  Then,  in 


170  HEARING  MUSIC. 

connection  with  the  musical  ear,  there  are  mysteries.  Some 
cannot  hear  sounds  lower  than  a  certain  note;  others  cannot 
hear  them  higher  than  a  certain  note,  as  musical  sounds. 

The  mystery  of  the  musical  ear  has  not  been  solved. 
Yet  some  things  are  known  about  it.  There  is  probably 
no  ear  so  radically  defective — except  a  deaf  ear — as  to 
be  incapable  of  a  certain  musical  training.  The  curate 
who  arrives  in  a  High  Church  parish  without  a  notion  of 
the  right  note  to  intone  upon,  and  with  the  vaguest  powers 
of  singing  it  when  it  is  given  him,  in  a  few  months  learns 
to  take  fairly  the  various  pitches  in  the  service. 

But  still  the  question  remains — a  physiological  one — why 
is  one  ear  musical  and  another  not  ?  PROFESSOR  HELM- 

HOLTZ.  whose  discoveries  in  the  sound-world  are 
12G. 

HELMIIOI/TZ  only  comparable  to  the  discoveries  of  NEWTON  in 
the  world  of  light,  has  put  forth  an  ingenious 
theory  somewhat  to  this  effect : — He  discovered  within  the 
ear,  and  soaked  in  a  sensitive  fluid,  rows  and  rows  of 
microscopic  nerves — several  hundred  in  number — each  one 
of  which,  like  the  string  of  a  pianoforte,  he  believed 
vibrated  to  some  note;  therefore,  we  were  to  infer  that 
just  as  a  note  sung  outside  a  piano  will  set  up  in  the 
corresponding  wire  a  sympathetic  vibration,  so  any  sound 
or  sounds  in  the  outer  world  represented  by  a  nerve 
wire,  or  nerves  in  the  ear,  could  be  heard  by  the  ear; 
and,  as  a  consequence,  I  suppose  any  absence  of,  or  defect 


WHAT  IS  THE  MUSICAL  EAR?  171 

in  these  internal  nerve  wires,  would  prevent  us  from  hearing 
the  sound  as  others  better  constituted  would  hear  it. 

The  next  direct  question  of  musical  ear  now  becomes  one 

of  inherited  tendency  and  special  training.     The  musical  ear 

127.       is  the  ear  that  has  learned — by  constantly  using 

nJI1!^1!!., the  same  intervals — to  recognise  the  tones  and 

TX1IS  MUSICAL 

EAR?  semi-tones  of  the  usual  scale,  and  to  regard  all 
variations  of  quarter-tones  as  exceptions  and  subtleties  not 
to  be  taken  account  of  in  the  general  construction  of  melody 
and  harmony.  Now,  our  octave,  and  our  division  of  the 
octave  into  tones  and  semi-tones,  is  not  artificial,  but  natural, 
founded  as  much  upon  certain  laws  of  sound-vibration  as 
our  notation  (if  I  may  say  so)  of  colour  is  founded  upon  the 
laws  of  light-vibration.  But  although  the  selection  of  eight 
notes  with  their  semi-tones  is  the  natural  and  scientific  scale, 
seeing  that  the  ear  is  capable  of  hearing  impartially  vast 
numbers  of  other  vibrations  of  sound  which  produce  vast 
numbers  of  other  intervals,  quarter-notes,  &c.,  what  we  have 
to  do  in  training  the  musical  ear  is  just  to  harp  on  the  in- 
tervals which  compose  the  musical  scale  in  various  keys,  and 
on  these  only.  In  this  way  the  ear  gets  gradually  weaned 
from  sympathy  with  what  is  out  of  tune — ceases  to  be  dog- 
like  or  savage-like,  and  becomes  the  cultured  organ  for 
recognising  the  natural  order  and  progression  of  those 
measured  and  related  vibrations  which  we  call  musical 
sound.  Of  course,  a  tendency  like  this  can  be  inherited 


172  HEARING  MUSIC. 

just  as  much  as  any  other,  and  in  almost  all  cases  it  can 
be  improved  and  cultivated. 

•  •  .  •  « 

I  have  mentioned  PROFESSOR  HELMHOLTZ'S  theory,  but 
have  reason  to  think  that  he  is  not,  on  reconsideration, 
prepared  to  endorse  it  fully.  The  little  rows  of  minute 
nerve-wires,  each  vibrating  to  a  definite  sound,  is  indeed  a 
fascinating  idea;  but  whether  true  or  false,  it  enables  us,  by 
a  kind  of  physical  parable,  to  understand  the  sort  of  way  in 
which  the  ear,  being  capable  of  perceiving  a  large  variety  of 
sounds,  may  be  trained  to  give  the  preference  to  certain 
ones  by  constantly  allowing  itself  to  be  exercised  by  their 
vibrations,  and  accustoming  itself  to  select  certain  notes,  and 
establish  between  them  definite  arid  fixed  relations.  The 
exact  physical  mechanism  which  enables  the  ear  to  do  this 
may  have  yet  to  be  discovered,  but  that  it  exists  there  can 
be  no  doubt,  and  the  use  and  cultivation  of  it  is  in  fact  the 
use  and  cultivation  of  what  we  call  "  an  ear  for  music." 

And  now  I  feel  I  owe  the  reader  an  apology.     When  I 

have  some  subject  which  I  am  desirous  to  discuss,  something

my  third  (and  this  is  the  one  I  generally  succumb  to) 
is  to  begin  before  the  beginning.  Thus  the  important 
remarks  which  I  am  about  to  make  on  hearing  music 


MRS.  DE  PERKINS  "AT  HOME."  173 

have  been  fairly  pushed  aside,  first,  by  one  preface  on 
the  sense  of  hearing  generally,  and  second,  by  another 
preface  on  the  musical  ear  in  particular ;  but  In  medias 
res  shall  be  my  motto  now ;  no  more  dallying  with  the 
subject;  no  more  strutting  in  front  of  the  curtain;  no 
more  prologue — the  actors  wait,  the  bell  rings,  the  curtain 
rises ;  let  us  hope  there  is  a  good  audience. 

This  is  an  afternoon  "AT  HOME."  These  words,  you 
will  observe,  are  printed  in  very  large  type.  In  a  corner 
129.  of  the  card  we  gather  from  the  small  word 
pmakiNs  "music,"  the  quite  mixed  and  genial  nature 
"AT  HOME."  of  the  whole  entertainment.  SIGNOR  BOREO 
GUFFAW,  the  well-known  bass  singer,  is  expected  to  look 
in,  a  few  amateurs  have  promised  to  help  if  necessary, 
and  everyone  who  knows  MRS.  DE  PERKINS  is  aware  that 
this  is  one  of  those  two  annual  assemblies  in  which  that 
well-meaning  lady  endeavours  to  pay  off  the  various  dinners 
and  "  At  Homes "  which  she  may  herself  have  been 
exposed  to  during  the  past  year.  DE  PERKINS,  who  is 
elderly,  engaged  in  the  city,  and  not  wealthy,  won't  give 
dinners ;  he  does  not  like  these  "  At  Homes,"  but  he  is  told 
that  they  are  necessary — and  then  GUFFAW,  who  taught 
MRS.  DE  PERKINS  before  she  was  married,  is  very  good- 
natured,  and  so  is  everyone  ;  and  the  rooms,  not  very  large, 
are  soon  full,  the  staircase  early  ceases  to  be  navigable, 
and  MRS.  DE  PERKINS,  who  really  is  rather  nice,  stands 


HEARING  MUSIC. 

at  the  door,  and  does  her  best  to  catch  everyone's  eye, 
although,  by  a  certain  wild  and  anxious  look  in  her 
face,  we  know  that  she  is  wondering  why  GUFFAW  does 
not  begin. 

Jammed  into  a  niche  which   just  fits  me  if  I  hold  my 

arms  quite  stiff,  and  stand  up  stark  and  straight,  I  presently 

hear  the  eminent  foreigner  begin  "  In   questa 

30-       Tomba  'scura."      Do   I   enioy   this   song?      In 
m  A  NICIIE. 

the  first  place  I  am  ill  at  ease.  I  crane  my 
neck  to  look  round  the  corner :  I  can  just  see  the  portly 
basso  with  his  thumbs  in  his  waistcoat  pockets,  but  just 
opposite  me  stands  my  hostess  receiving  more  guests,  and 
the  consequence  is.  that  GUFFAW'S  "Tomba"  is  mixed  up 
with  all  kinds  of  sotto  voce's — "  So  glad  you  Ve  come/' 
"  How  's  -  -  ?  "  "  You  musn't  talk/'  "  Tea  in  the  next 
room" — whilst  in  front  of  me  conversation,  momentarily 
suspended,  recommences,  all  about  some  garden  party  and 
someone  being  lost,  and  where  they  were  found,  and  who 
they  were  with,  and  so  on. 

Do  I  enjoy  the  music?    Whether  I  do  or  not,  I  intend 

to  get  out  of  this  miserable  niche — away  to  the  other  room, 

131.       where  there  is  tea.     The  song  is  over,  and  there 

YOU  MUST  js  naturally   a    pause  in  the    conversation :    at

scheme  for  boring  the  Channel  Tunnel  —  attracting,  in 
short,  more  than  one  attentive  listener — when  up  trips 
my  anxious  but  smiling  hostess,  "  You  must  really  listen 
to  this  gentleman  who  is  playing :  a  clergyman,  you  know, 
most  gifted ;  he  plays  nothing  but  the  oldest  masters :  Bach, 
and  that  sort,  you  know.  Hush  !  hush  !  "  and  she  glides  off 
tapping  and  silencing  people  right  and  left,  just  as  they  have 
got  into  a  nice  chat  and  are  beginning  to  make  way — as  I 
was,  in  fact. 

I  look  round  me.  Disappointed,  cross,  irritable-looking 
faces,  which  a  moment  before  were  smiling  and  animated, 
and  from  the  distance  the  hard  tinkle  of  the  perfectly  self- 
satisfied  musician  grating  upon  everyone's  nerves — why? 
Not  because  it  is  so  bad,  simply  because  it  is  not  wanted 
then  and  there.  Gradually,  as  the  everlasting  fugue  goes 
on  and  on,  or  runs  into  another  fugue,  people  begin  to  talk 
feebly.  I  begin  about  the  Channel  again,  but  by  this  time 
my  audience  has  dispersed  ;  my  most  devoted  hearer — a  lady 
who  suffers  frightfully  from  sea-sickness — does  not  seem  to 
remember  where  I  left  off.  I  can't  quite  remember  myself 
— we  drop  the  subject.  I  have  got  to  begin  all  over  again, 
but  with  something  different,  to  someone  else ;  then  at  last 
the  fugue  leaves  off.  Did  anyone  enjoy  the  music  ?  Then 
GUFFAW  is  put  on  to  sing  a  duet  just  as  I  was  telling  that 
capital  story  about  the  sparrow  in  church.  Well,  of  course 
it  was  no  good,  all  the  point  was  taken  out  of  it  because  I 
had  to  hurry  over  it  and  end  in  a  guilty  kind  of  underbreath. 


176  HEARING  MUSIC. 

1  did  not  stay  to  hear  the  new  amateur  tenor,  MR.  FLUTULOO, 
who,  I  am  told,  sang  with  an  eye-glass  fixed  rigidly  in  one 
eye,  whilst  he  positively  wept  with  the  other.  I  can  believe 
that  the  sensation  he  created  may  have  been  considerable, 
I  was  a  great  deal  too  sore  about  the  Channel  Tunnel  and 
the  sparrow,  &c.,  to  care ;  in  short,  I  left  MRS.  DE  PERKINS'S 
At  Home  in  a  very  bad  humour  after,  I  regret  to  say,  hear- 
ing  some  music,  but  certainly  not  enjoying  it.  The  moral 
of  this  is — 

1 .  Let  it  be  either  Music  or  conversation,  but  not  both. 

2.  If  music,  let  all  the  audience  be  musical,  and  all  the 
musicians  good. 

3.  Don't  cram  the  room  and  suffocate  the  singers,  but  ask 
a  moderate  company,  let  them  all  be  seated,  and  let  the 
conversation  in  between    be    limited  to  the  merest  inter- 
change of  courtesies. 

4.  Avoid  the  current  musical  "  At  Home."     The  DE  PER- 
KINS'S method  never  answers  ;  it  offends  the  real  musicians, 
encourages  musical  impostors,  and  bores  the  company. 

Some  people  enjoy  themselves  at  concerts.     But  "some 

people  "and  "concerts"  are  vague  terms.     You  must  go 

132.       with  the  right  people,  and  you  must  go  to  the 

C0^RT8    right   concerts.     These  right  conditions  will,  of 

BALLADS,    course,  vary  according  to  taste  and  cultivation. 

The  right  people  for  you  are  in  all  cases  the  people  with 

whom   you  are  musically   in   sympathy.      The  right   con- 


CONCERTS  AND  BALLADS.  177 

cevts  for  you  are  the  concerts  you  can  at  least  m  some 
measure  enjoy  and  understand.  The  classical  pedant 
sneers  at  people  who  delight  in  ballad  concerts  and  hate 
WAGNER,  but  the  greatest  composers  have  not  been  above 
ballads ;  and  although  there  are  bad  ballads,  yet  the  cha- 
racteristics of  a  ballad — namely,  that  it  should  be  lyrical, 
simple,  and  easily  understood — are  not  bad  characteristics. 
Some  of  the  greatest  men  have  been  infinite  losers  because 
they  happened  to  be  generally  unintelligible,  whilst  inferior 
people  have  exercised  an  influence  out  of  proportion  to  their 
merits,  simply  because  they  made  themselves  generally 
understood.  And  be  it  observed,  that  this  element  of  in- 
telligibility is  one  common  to  the  ballad  and  all  the  greatest 
works  of  art.  The  greatest  men  all  "  strike  home."  The 
transfiguration  is  simple — so  is  the  Moses  of  Michael  Angelo. 
So  is  HANDEL'S  Messiah  taken  as  a  whole.  So  is  the  Elijah 
of  MENDELSSOHN.  They  are  a  great  deal  more  than  simple, 
but  they  are  that.  I  have  drawn  a  deplorable  scene  descrip- 
tive of  the  hearing  of  music  in  private ;  let  me  revive  a 
scene,  fresh,  doubtless,  in  the  memory  of  many  now  living, 
in  which  the  hearing  of  music  in  public  probably  reached 
its  climax.  I  allude  to  the  production  of  MENDELSSOHN'S 
Elijah  at  the  Birmingham  festival  of  1846,  upon  which 
occasion  MENDELSSOHN  himself  wielded  the  conductor's 
baton. 

On  that  memorable  August  morning  in  the  year  184G,

when,  punctual  to  the  minute,  FELIX  MENDELSSOHN  stepped 

133.       into  the   conductor's   seat,  and,   facing  the  im- 

THE'-ELiJAH"mense  au^ience  assembled  in  the  noble  Town 

AT  BIRMING- 
HAM IN  184G.  jjall  of  Birmingham,  was  received  with  a  storm 

MENDELS- 
SOHN,      of  applause  which  was  taken  up  and  redoubled  by 

the  chorus  and  orchestra — how  little  did  that  vast  audience 
know  that  in  little  more  than  a  year  from  that  time  the 
heart  of  the  great  composer  would  have  ceased  to  beat ! 
That  day,  we  must  always  think,  was  the  crowning  moment 
of  his  life,  and  that  great  oratorio  seems  to  us  the  culmina- 
tion of  his  mighty  musical  and  dramatic  faculty.  All  those 
who  were  present  declare  that  that  first  public  performance 
was  one  never  to  be  forgotten — the  novelty  of  treatment,  the 
startling  effects,  the  enchanting  subjects,  the  prodigious 
daring  of  some  of  the  situations,  the  heavenly  melodies 
which  have  since  become  musical  watchwards,  and,  above 
all,  the  presence  of  the  composer,  who  sent  an  electric  thrill 
through  the  room,  and  inspired  chorus,  band,  and  singers 
with  the  same  lofty  enthusiasm  which  made  him  so  great 
and  irresistible  in  achievement — all  this  may  now,  alas,  be 
remembered,  but  can  never  be  reproduced.  It  made  the 
hearing  of  the  music  of  Elijah  for  the  first  time  a  perfectly 
typical  occasion,  and  one  whose  conditions,  as  far  as  they 
are  realisable,  should  never  cease  to  be  striven  after. 

A  dire  contrast  to  such  performances  as  this  may  be  found 
any  day  in  those  extraordinary  entertainments  called  mixed

MONSTER 

CONCERT.  with  what  may  be  called  a  harmonic  indigestion 
of  the  worst  possible  description.  MENDELSSOHN,  SPOHR, 
MEYERBEER,  MOSCHELES,  and  VON  BULOW,  have  in  turn 
expressed  their  amazement  and  horror  at  the  popular  notion 
of  a  concert  programme.  But  all  this  is  a  part  of  the 
general  state  of  musical  ignorance  in  England,  and  can  onl  y 
disappear  when  increased  culture  makes  the  incongruity  of 
such  mixtures  apparent  to  their  present  admirers. 

There  are  other  kinds  of  mixed  concerts  which  have  their 

excuse,  but  they  are  private  ;  there  are  no  contradictions, 

135.       no   aggravations,   no  jolts    in    them.      We   are

Italian  buffo  song  after  a  duet  from  MOZART'S  requiem,  or 
a  ballad  of  CLARIBEL,  followed  by  a  bit  of  SPOHR'S  Last 
Judgment.  And  yet  the  programme  is  mixed,  varied, — as 
the  conversation  of  friends  is  varied,  flitting  bird-like 
through  many  lands,  pausing  above  giddy  precipices, 
gliding  over  summer  seas,  lingering  in  bright  meadows, 
poised  above  populous  cities,  lingering  about  the  habita- 
tions of  man.  But  no  more  prosy  efforts  to  describe  what

She  is  fair,  with  brown-red  hair;  she  is  serene,  with  one 
of  those  quiet,  equable  temperaments,  whose  privilege  it 
is  to  blend  others  into  harmony  by  yielding 
SHADOWS  OF  to  each  new  wave  of  thought  and  feeling  as  it 
rises,  with  that  sort  of  simple,  unaffected  plea- 
sure, the  very  sight  of  which  makes  others  happy.  Alas ! 
she  has  been  dead  these  many  summers ;  yet  it  is  the 
privilege  of  memory  to  unlock  the  doors  of  old  rooms, 
and  find  there  suddenly,  as  in  a  dream,  the  scenes 
that  have  faded  out  of  the  real  world  for  ever.  For  a 
moment  I  close  my  eyes.  It  is  an  autumn  evening  by  the 
sea.  How  pleasantly  the  waves  came  plashing  in  as  we 
paced  the  shore  in  the  deepening  light !  We  spoke  of  those 
weird  songs  of  SCHUBERT  which  seetn  like  sad  eyes  looking 
out  into  the  sunset  over  some  waste  of  measureless  waters; 
we  spoke  of  those  Nocturnes  of  CIIOPIN,  like  dream-scenes, 
painted  on  tinted  backgrounds. 

"His  life/'  said  FERDINAND,  "was  what  NOVALIS  would 
have  called  a  dream  within  a  dream*" 

"  Yes,"  I  answered,  "  but  a  dream  always  starting  from 
reality  and  breaking  into  it  again." 

"  And  is  not  that  reflected  in  his  music  ? "  rejoined 
ESTELLE.  "  It  makes  it  sometimes  quite  terrible  to  me,  the 
harsh  contrast  between  the  reality  and  the  dream,  a  chord, 
a  transition  bar,  and  then  fainter  and  fainter  grows  the 
shadow-land,  so  intensely  real  and  passionate  the  moment 
before, — it  darkens  and  melts  into  a  thin,  cold  mist, — 


SHADOWS  OF  THE  PAST.  181 

just  as  those  gorgeous  shadows  of  purple  and  orange 
011  the  sea,  which  seemed  a  minute  ago  almost  substantial, 
melt  and  leave  the  cold  sea  dark,  and  the  air  keen  and 
sharp." 

"Yes,  that  was  the  history  of  CHOPIN'S  life;  the  love 
of  MADAME  SAND  was  his  dream,  and  the  awakening 
was  the  cold  sea  and  the  sharp,  keen  air  that  killed 
him." 

"  But  before  the  end  what  dreams  haunted  him,  frag- 
ments of  the  never- forgotten  days,  embalmed  in  fugitive 
melody,  and  mystically  woven  harmonies  !  I  think  he  must 
have  lived  over  again  perfectly  in  such  moments.  They 
were  the  realities,  and  the  outer  life,  latterly  at  least,  became 
the  dream.  Listen ! 

"  What  sweetness  is  here,  this  grassy  bank,  these  droop- 
ing citron  flowers,  these  glowing  azaleas,  fringing  the 
summer  Islet,  set  like  a  jewel  in  the  bosom  of  the  Mediter- 
ranean !  The  name  of  LUCREZIA  FLORIANI  rises  to  my 
lips,  the  name  of  the  PRINCE  KAROL,  who  is  CHOPIN.  Time 
is  not,  -these  skies  are  eternally  blue,  this  welling  up  of 
crystal  water,  just  kissing  the  fringe  of  drooping  blossom 
against  the  shore,  this  hum  of  insect  life,  breaking  the 
silence,  only  to  make  the  summer  air  more  slumbrous,  and 
the  little  rain-cloud  on  the  horizon,  which,  toward  evening, 
will  creep  up,  until  the  distance  is  blotted  out,  and  t'ne 
black  sky  is  rent  with  forked  lightning.  Such  things

entered  into  CHOPIN'S  soul,  and  live  for  ever  in  his  profound 
and  strange  musical  reveries. 

"  But  apart  from  this  deeply  personal  element,  the 
deepest  thing  of  all,  as  it  is  in  the  nature  of  every 
true  Pole,  was  the  undertone  of  sad  patriotism;  this 
pierces  when  least  expected,  this  is  never  long  absent.

"  It  is  a  dazzling  crowd,  glittering  with  diamond  lights — 
a  profusion  of  rare  jewels;  the  halls  are  filled  with  perfume, 
the  strains  of  a  mazurka  are  in  the  air,  they  seem  to  call 
forth  as  by  magic,  and  support  with  the  breath  of  some 
mystic  life,  these  floating,  swaying  forms  of  beautiful  women, 
and  these  countrymen  of  CHOPIN,  without  a  country,  and 
as  the  dance  goes  weaving  on,  with  a  certain  dreamy  and 
pensive  grace,  we  perceive  that  in  the  heart  of  the  music 
there  is  a  deep  wound,  a  minor  chord  of  inextinguishable 
pain,  hidden  by  lovely  arabesques  of  subtle  sweetness,  win- 
ning, beguiling,  subduing;  but  never  for  long  hiding  the 
forlorn  sorrow  of  a  hopeless,  but  undying  patriotism.  Now 
it  is  a  Polonaise.  Listen ! 

"  What  enterprise,  what  indomitable  effort  to  achieve  the 
impossible,  what  frantic  exploits,  as  of  one  resolved  to  die 
on  the  battle-field,  but  before  dying  to  overwhelm  with 
deeds  of  intrepid  valour  his  terrible  and  relentless  foe !

catch  through  the  sulphurous  clouds  a  sight  of  remote 
battle-scenes  and  distant  combinations,  until  the  warrior 
rises  again  in  his  strength,  and  once  more  for  a  time  his 
enemies.fly  scattered." 

"  I  shall  think  of  all  this  when  I  play  your  favourite 
Polonaise."  She  drew  her  shawl  close  to  her — the  mist 
crept  round  the  bay — it  was  no  longer  summer ;  we  went 
in,  we  three,  how  happy,  how  harmonious,  blended  by  the 
grace — the  free,  the  tender  grace — of  one  lovely  and  beloved 
presence ! 

Unlock  the  door — let  no  footfall  from  the  present  disturb 

this  shadow-scene.     It  is  the  old  room — the  familiar  room. 

I  see  her  there.     There  is  no  sense  of  strange- 

137. 
A  NIGIIT  IN  ness  or  unreality  about  her ;  she  smiles,  as  she 

was  wont  to  smile,  she  moves  softly — her  fingers 
turn  the  music  leaves — the  candles  are  lighted — her  face  is 
half  in  shade — I  can  hear  her  low  melodious  laugh.  I 
seem  to  be  once  more  holding  my  Stradivarius  violin 
lovingly.  What !  there  is  no  sign  of  dust,  or  age,  or 
neglect  about  this  long-closed  room.  As  we  go  back  to 
past  chapters  of  a  beloved  story,  so  have  I  gone  back  to 
read  again  a  fragment  of  life,  and  as  I  look,  and  look, 
and  look,  the  intervening  years  roll  away,  the  shadows 
become  real,  "till  only  the  dead  seem  living,  and  only  the 
living  seem  dead." 

Let  it  be  MENDELSSOHN'S  D  minor  trio,  the  playing  of

that  night  remains  with  me — we  seemed  alive — sensitively 
alive  to  every  vibration ;  her  fingers  caressed  the  cool  ivory 
keys  lovingly,  the  Stradivarius  spoke  rapturously  to  the 
lightest  touch  of  the  bow,  the  full-toned  violoncello  gave 
out  the  deep  but  tender  notes,  like  the  voices  of  the  sea  in 
enchanted  caves.  How  clean  and  "  seizing/'  as  the  French 
say,  was  her  rendering  of  the  opening  movement !  How 
wonderfully  woven-in  were  the  parts !  We  all  three  made 
but  one,  yet  retaining  our  perfect  individualities.  A 
mystic  presence  invisible  seemed  to  be  with  us,  we  felt  as  if 
playing  in  the  presence  of  the  great,  the  gentle  MENDELS- 
SOHN ;  and  though  we  played,  so  absorbed  were  we,  that  we 
seemed  at  the  same  moment  to  be  following  our  own  music 
like  listeners,  in  ourselves  and  out  of  ourselves.  Between 
the  movements  we  spoke  not.  I  marked  the  flush  upon 
her  cheek — the  bright  light  in  her  eyes.  He  was  grave, 
intensely  pre-occupied — the  dream-power  was  upon  us  all. 
The  peace  and  full  contentment  of  the  slow  movement  with 
its  rich  and  measured  flow  of  melody  melting  at  last  into 
that  heavenly  trance  at  the  close,  which  leaves  us  at  the 
open  gates  of  Paradise ;  then  the  sudden  break  at  the 
scherzo,  as  though  a  joyous  troop  of  lower  earth-spirits  had 
burst  in  to  tear  us  away  from  the  divine  contemplation,  and 
toss  us  back  into  a  world  of  wild  uproar  and  merriment ; 
then  a  slight  pause  before  the  tempestuous,  but  intensely 
earnest,  conclusion.  Here  is  the  battle  of  life,  with  its 
suspense,  its  failure,  its  endeavour  —  striving  for  the 


A  NIGHT  IN  THE  PAST.  385 

victory,  its  wild  and  passionate  overthrow,  its  indomitable 
recovery  and  untamed  valour;  that  is  the  bracing  and 
sublime  atmosphere  of  the  last  movement  more  true  to 
life  than  ecstasy,  more  wholesome  than  peace,  more 
dignified  than  pleasure;  and  that  is  where  the  D  minor 
trio  leaves  us. 

Then  we  drifted  into  talk  of  MENDELSSOHN.  As  she  sat 
she  occasionally  played  some  fragment  from  a  concerto — 
some  striking  chord  from  the  St.  Paul,  some  passage  from 
Ruy  Bias,  or  an  echo  from  the  incomparably  delicate  over- 
ture to  the  beautiful  "  Melusine,''  till  one  said  "  Sing,"  and 
she  sang  from  SCHUMANN,  the  ballads  from  HEINE — those 
tragedies  and  melodramas  in  three  verses,  or  in  two  lines, 
and  BRAHM'S  "  Guten  Abend,  Gute  Nacht.'-7  Then  followed 
songs  without  words,  and  sitting  in  the  shadow  I  saw  her 
face  in  the  light,  and  felt  her  spirit  rise  and  fall  upon  the 
pulses  of  invisible  sound,  in  unison  with  ours.  Then  came 
some  of  ERNST'S  reveries  on  the  violin,  and  so  the  evening 
wore  away,  and  we  took  no  account  of  the  hours. 

Were  there  any  other  listeners  ?  Yes,  at  times  one  and 
another  of  them  would  recall  a  passage — a  likeness  between 
MENDELSSOHN  and  BACH,  a  phrase  of  SCARLATTI,  or  a  com- 
bination of  WAGNER  in  a  BKAHM'S  movement. 

This,  if  you  like,  was  a  mixed  programme,  but  its  parts 
were  mixed  with  subtle  sympathies,  and  united  by  the 
finest  threads  of  thought  and  emotion.  Thus  we  moved 
on  from  one  delight  to  another  with  no  sense  of  un-

pleasant  or  disjointed  break — as  those  who  pass  out  of  a 
lovely  grotto  into  the  sunlight,  and  after  winding  through 
hedge-rows  of  May  bloom  to  the  quiet  shore,  pass  back 
into  a  garden  of  tall  trees  and  smooth  lawns,  and  thence 
to  some  lovely  conservatory  filled  with  tropical  bloom,  thence 
to  a  marble  vestibule,  thence  to  halls  of  tapestry,  and 
luxurious  couches  and  repose.  And  there  has  been  no 
break — nothing  has  jarred  upon  us  in  the  midst  of  variety. 
Hand  in  hand  we  have  been  with  friends;  we  have  seen 
smiles  upon  dear  faces.  We  have  poured  forth  words,  and 
soul  has  been  revealed  to  soul ;  and  without,  the  world  of 
fair  things  has  imaged  the  life  of  vivid  and  inexhaustible 
thought  and  feeling  within.  Compare,  I  pray  you,  these 
parables  of  "  Hearing  Music "  aright,  with  the  strange  and 
disjointed  legend  of  "MRS.  DE  PERKINS  and  her  musical

I  will  take  a  wider  sweep.     I  have  received  the  keenest 
national  impressions  from  music. 

At  midnight  I  heard  the  players  pass  by.     The   warm 

Italian  air,  scarce  chilled  by  the  night,  came  in  from  the 

orange  gardens.     I  leaned  my  head  forward  to

come  from  yonder  lighted  palace ;  now  they  pass 
on  up  through  the  groves  of  citron  and  myrtle,  from  the 
distant  deep  shadows,  the  regular  pulse  of  the  music  brings 
back  the  feeling  of  the  dance ;  it  is  a  mere  echo,  a  shadow 


HOLLAND.— EMOTION  AND  THE  PAINTER.    187 

dance — fainter  and  fainter  now ;  I  can  hear  it  no  more.     I 
look  up,  the  stars  burn  like  gold. 

All  Italy  in  a  moment  is  resumed  for  me  in  that  slight 
picture.  A  few  bars  of  music,  heard  at  random,  may  conjure 
it  up  again — first  the  emotion,  then  the  picture. 

The  Feast  of  the  Kermess  was  over  in  Amsterdam.    The 

town  filled   with   country  people  had  been   emptying   all 

through  the  night.     The  booths  in  the  market- 

139-       places  were  struck.     I   stood  high  up.   looking 

HOLLAND.      r 

over  the  network  of  canals  towards  the  Scheldt. 
Above  my  head  I  heard  the  cry  of  the  wild  swan,  winging 
its  way  southward  from  Sweden,  and  below  a  rough  chorus 
of  men  and  women  came  over  the  bridge.  It  was  loud, 
boisterous  singing,  but  in  parts  well  defined,  rhythmic,  and 
full  of  a  strong  charm;  they  passed  into  a  side  street;  the 
drinking  chorus  seemed  to  split  into  fragments  and  then 
cease.  How  often  has  it  since  rung  in  my  ears,  and  so 
often  has  it  brought  back  with  it  the  hearty,  coarse,  eager 
life  of  Holland,  and  the  keen,  brackish  odour  of  the  wind 
blowing  in  from  the  North  Sea. 

But  in  each  case  observe  the  peculiar,  direct  power  which 

music  has   of   dealing  with  the   nerve  centres.

EMOTION  AND  It  is  not  the  image  which  is  recalled  and  Avhich 

E>  brings  back  the  feeling,  but  the  sound  awakes 

directly  a  peculiar  rhythm  of  nervous  wave-motion,  which 


188  HEARING  MUSIC. 

is  the  physical  vehicle  for  a  peculiar  feeling.  Thus  a 
breath  of  the  past  in  a  desert  at  first  unpeopled,  the  very 
atmosphere  of  a  past  moment  is  restored,  in  which  mystic 
air  the  forms  of  dead  scenes  and  persons  begin  to  live  and 
grow  again,  and  at  last  become  intensely  vivid.  In  this, 
note  that  music  differs  from  every  other  art.  The  painter 
and  poet  alike  depend  directly  upon  scenes  and  concrete 
images  for  their  emotion,  but  the  musician  depends  directly 
upon  emotion  for  his  scenes  and  images,  and  even  when  these 
are  absent,  he  is  not  less  potent — sometimes  more  so — for  he 
can  handle  and  mould  the  temperature  of  the  mind  itself  at 
will,  wind  up  feeling  unconnected  with  thought  through 
every  semitone,  modulate  and  change  it,  fit  and  unfit  us  for 
exertion,  make  us  forget  the  hard,  persistent  images  of 
pain  and  trouble,  and  the  coarse  realism  that  damps  joy, 
— by  creating  an  atmosphere  within  in  which  these  cannot 
breathe,  and  so  are  expelled  as  to  any  power  they  may 
have  to  move  us, — actually  expelled  for  a  season  from  the 
mind. 

There  is  a  phrase,  "  I  was  carried  away  by  the  music." 

That  expression  is  true  to  feeling  ;  it  means, "  When  I  heard 

this  or  that,  I  ceased  to  be  affected  by  the  out- 

JIAGIC  OP    ward  things  or  thoughts  which  a  moment  before 

moved  me;  I  entered  a  world  of  other  feeling, 

Or — what  I  before  possessed  was  so  heightened  and  changed 

that   I  seemed  to  have  been  '  carried  away '  from  the   old 


SECRET  OF  THE  AUDITORY  NERVE.         189 

thing  in  a  moment."  But  it  would  be  sti)l  truer  to  say, 
not  "  music  carried  me  away,"  but  "  music  carried  away,  or 
changed,  the  mood,  and  with  it  the  significance  of  the 
things  which  occupied  me  in  that  mood." 

The  easy  command  over  the  emotions  possessed  by  sound, 

and  elaborated  by  the  art  of  music,  is  due  to  the  direct 

142.       impact   of  the  air-waves  upon  the  drum  of  the 

SECRET  OF  ear    -which   collects   them   and    sends    them    to 
THE  AUDI- 
TORY NERVE,  the  seat  of  consciousness  in  the  brain  by  means 

of  the  auditory  nerve.  The  same,  of  course,  is  true  of 
the  waves  of  colour  upon  the  eye,  scent  upon  the  nose, 
and  vibrations  of  touch  taken  by  the  brain  even  from  the 
most  distant  nerve  in  the  body.  But  the  auditory  nerve  has 
in  some  things  a  strange  advantage  and  prerogative  of  power 
over  the  others.  First,  the  /distance  from  the  ear  to  the 
brain  is  shorter  than  that  of  any  other  of  the  sensitive 
surfaces,  so  the  time  taken  to  convey  the  impressions  of 
sound  is  less,  and  therefore  the  impact  more  direct.  This 
measured  by  time  is  infinitesimal,  but  measured  by  emotional 
effect  it  counts  for  much.  Secondly,  the  vibrations  of  sound 
as  distinguished  from  the  vibrations  of  light,  and  even  the 
vibrations  of  touch,  which  are,  after  all,  differently  local, — 
the  vibrations  of  sound  induce  a  sympathetic  vibration  iu 
every  nerve  in  the  body ;  they  set  it  going,  in  short,  as  the 
strings  of  a  piano  are  set  going  by  the  stroke  of  a  hammer  on 
the  floor,  and  when  the  sound  is  excessive  or  peculiar,  all  the

great  ganglionic  centres  are  disturbed,  the  diaphragm  and 
many  other  nerves  and  muscles  are  influenced,  the  stomach 
is  affected,  the  spine  "  creeps/'  as  we  say,  the  heart  quickens 
and  throbs  with  strong  beatings  in  the  throat.  Thus  a 
curiously  sympathetic  action  is  set  up  through  this  phy- 
sical peculiarity  which  sound  has  of  shaking,  moving,  and 
at  times  causing  to  tremble  the  human  body. 

But  the  cause  of  the  sympathetic  action  of  the  great 
ganglionic  centres  under  the  pulsations  of  sound  lies  deeper 
still.  It  is  to  be  found  in  the  fact  that  the  auditory  nerve  is 
closely  connected,  at  its  origin  in  the  medulla  oblongata  of 
the  brain,  with  that  of  the  important  nervus  vagus  or  pneu- 
mogastic  supplying  the  heart,  lungs,  and  the  most  important 
abdominal  viscera.  It  is  also  in  intimate  communication 
with  the  branches  of  the  great  sympathetic  nerve  from  the 
ganglia  which  supply  the  muscles  regulating  the  tension  of 
the  ear's  drum,  and  which  modify  the  effect  of  the  waves 
of  sound  upon  it.  And  these  branches,  again,  are  in  direct 
communication  with  the  vagus  and  the  great  ganglionic 
centres,  controlling  the  action  of  the  heart  and  stomach. 
Thus  excitation  of  the  auditory  nerve  readily  agitates  these 
close  neighbours,  and  they  proceed  to  spread  the  influence 
far  and  wide  through  all  the  delicate  network  of  sympathetic 
nerve  telegraphy  which  pervades  the  entire  system.  Thus 
the  effect  of  sound  is  speedily  propagated  through  myriad 
side-channels,  until  the  whole  body  is  thrilling  with  its  con- 
fluent waves. 


MUSIC  IN  A   ROOM,— MUSIC  AND  SPACE.    191 

Now  we  can  explain,  perhaps,  why  it  is  that  our  musical 
sensations  are  different  in  small  rooms  and  large  ones,  or,  to 

speak  more  closely,  why  the  relations  between  the 
MUSIC  IN  A  volume  of  sound  and  the  space  to  be  filled  must 

be  suitable  in  order  to  produce  the  right  effect. 
I  can  sit  close  to  a  piano  and  listen  to  a  "  Lied  ohne  Worte/7 
I  can  take  in  every  inflection  of  touch  with  ease,  not  a  refine- 
ment is  lost,  but  if  I  go  to  the  end  of  a  long  room,  the 
impact  is  less  direct,  the  pleasure  is  less  intense  :  the  player 
must  then  exaggerate  all  his  effects,  hence  a  loss  of  refine- 
ment and  ease.  Public  players  and  singers  constantly  make 
shipwreck  thus  in  private  rooms.  Accustomed  to  vast 
spaces,  they  roar  and  bang  until  the  audience  is  deaf,  and 
the  only  reason  why  the  unknowing  applaud  on  such  occa- 
sions, and  the  only  difference,  as  far  as  they  are  concerned, 
between  the  professional  and  the  amateur,  is  simply  that  the 
first  is  so  much  louder  than  the  second.  This  makes  them 
clap  their  hands  and  cry  "  Bravo  ! "  but  in  reality  they  are 
applauding  a  defect. 

The  only  musical  sounds  which  really  master  vast  spaces 
like  the  Albert  Hall  are  those  o£  a  mighty  organ  or  an 

immense  chorus.     The  Handel  Festival  choruses 
144. 

MUSIC  AND  are  fairly  proportioned  to  the  Crystal  Palace,  but 

on  one  occasion,   when   a  terrific  thunderstorm 

burst  over  Sydenham  in  the  middle  of  Israel  in  Egypt,  every 

one  beneath  that  crystal  dome  felt  that,  acoustically,  the 


192  HEARING  MUSIC. 

peal  of  thunder  was  very  superior  to  the  whole  power  of  the 
chorus,  because  the  relation  between  the  space  to  be  filled  and 
the  volume  of  sound  required  to  fill  it  was  in  better  proportion. 
But  there  is  still  something  which  has  not  yet  been  said 
for  small  sounds  in  large  places.  Transport  yourself  in 
imagination  to  the  Albert  Hall  on  some  night  when,  as  is 
usually  the  case,  there  is  but  a  scanty  orchestra,  and 
presently  a  new  mystery  of  sound  will  present  itself  to  you. 
At  first  you  will  be  disappointed.  Anyone  can  hear  that 
the  hall  is  not  properly  occupied  by  the  sound ;  the  violins 
should  be  trebled  at  least,  several  of  the  wind  instruments 
doubled,  &c.  You  think  you  will  not  listen  to  this  charming 
E  flat  symphony  of  MOZART  ;  you  cannot  help  feeling  that 
you  lose  a  delicate  inflection  here,  a  staccato  there,  a  flute 
tone,  a  pianissimo  on  the  drum,  or  a  whole  piece  of  counter 
melody, — owing  to  the  scattered  conditions  of  isolated  vibra- 
tions lost  in  space. 

But  you  have  still  something  to  learn,  something  like  a 
new   musical  truth,   which   few   people  seem  yet   to   have 

noticed.      Listen  !      The   sounds  from  the  band 
145. 
SODND-     reach    you   too    late,  perhaps.      They    are    not 

*'  simultaneous ;  the  impact  on  the  ear  is  some- 
what feeble,  you  must  even  strain  attentively  to  catch 
what  is  passing,  but  the  more  you  do  so  the  easier  it 
becomes,  just  as  the  eye,  in  looking  through  a  lens,  may 
see  all  dim,  but  gaze  on  until  the  objects  grow  sharp  and 


SOUND-FILTERING.  193 

clear.  The  nerves  of  the  eye  have  adapted  themselves  to 
the  new  conditions,  the  longer  you  look  the  better  you 
see.  So  in  these  vast  uncomfortable  spaces,  the  longer  you 
listen  the  better  you  hear.  A  certain  special  training  is 
required,  and  then  gradually  a  new  quality  is  perceived — we 
must  give  the  process  a  new  name — "  sound  filtering/'  The 
Albert  Hall  and  the  Crystal  Palace  are  great  Sound-filters. 
From  this  point  of  view,  which  it  requires  some  delicate  and 
attentive  ear-culture  to  appreciate,  new  delights  are  born 
from  the  defective  space  conditions  usually  complained  of. 
I  have  heard  the  voice  of  Madame  Lemmens-Sherrington  in 
the  extreme  distance  at  the  Crystal  Palace,  when  she  was 
exerting  herself  to  the  utmost,  and  it  sounded  like  a  voice 
from  heaven,  full  of  unearthly,  far-away  sweetness ;  the 
same  intensity  and  volume  in  a  small  room  would  have  been 
intolerable.  I  have  heard  Bottesini  on  the  double-bass  in 
the  open  air  with  similar  effect. 

Listen  to  an  orchestra  or  quartet,  however  fine,  in  a 
moderate-sized  room ;  there  is  the  catgut,  the  rosin,  the 
scrape,  the  bite  of  horse-hair  on  strings,  the  earthly  cannot 
be  completely  got  rid  of,  but  space  will  filter  all  that,  and 
leave  nothing  but  a  kind  of  spiritual  disembodied  sound,  like 
the  tones  of  those  plugged  pipes  in  the  organ  that  seem  to 
steal  out  of  some  remote  cloud-land  with  a  certain  veiled 
sweetness  that  makes  us  hold  our  breath. 

Since  I  have  learned  to  listen  to  these  peculiar  effects  in 
all  their  strange  gradations,  a  new  class  of  musical  impres- 

13 


194  HEARING  MUSIC. 

sions  has  been  revealed  to  me,  and  I  have  become  miu.-li 
reconciled  to  hearing  music  in  vast  spaces.  I  do  not  go 
there  for  the  kind  of  normal  impressions,  for  the  direct  study, 
for  the  strong,  immediate  impact  gained  from  music  in  a 
moderately-sized  room — I  lose  much  of  all  that — but  I  gain 
a  number  of  new  abnormal  effects,  which  also  have  a  power 
over  certain  hidden  depths  and  distant  fastnesses  of  the 
emotional  region. 

Music   has   a  vast  future  before  it.     We  are  only  now 
beginning  to  find  out  some   of  its   uses.      With  the   one 

exception  of   its  obvious   and  admitted  helpful- 
14G. 
BENEFICENCE  ness,   as  an   adjunct   of  religious   worship,  as  a 

vehicle  for  and  incentive  of  religious  feeling,  I 
had  almost  said  that  we  had  as  yet  discovered  none  of  its 
uses.  It  has  been  the  toy  of  the  rich,  it  has  often  been  a 
source  of  mere  degradation  to  both  rich  and  poor,  it  has 
been  treated  as  mere  jingle  and  noise — supplying  a  rhythm 
for  the  dance,  a  kind  of  Terpsichorean  tom-tom — or  serving 
to  start  a  Bacchanalian  chorus — the  chief  feature  of  which 
has  certainly  not  been  the  music.  And  yet  those  who  have 
their  eyes  and  ears  open,  may  read  in  these  primitive  uses 
whilst  they  run  the  hints  of  music's  future  destiny  as  a 
vast  civiliser,  recreator,  health-giver,  work-inspirer,  and 
purifier  of  man's  life.  The  horse  knows  what  he  owes  to 
his  bells.  The  factory  girls  have  been  instinctively  forced 
into  singing,  finding  in  it  a  solace  and  assistance  in  work. 


MUSIC  AS  A  RESTORATIVE.  195 

And  for  music,  the  health-giver,  what  an  untrodden  field 
is  there  !  Have  we  never  known  an  invalid  forget  pain 
and  weariness  under  the  stimulus  of  music?  Have  you 
never  seen  a  pale  cheek  flush  up,  a  dull  eye  sparkle,  an 
alertness  and  vigour  take  possession  of  the  \vhole  frame, 
and  animation  succeed  to  apathy?  What  does  all  this 
mean  ?  It  means  a  truth  that  we  have  not  fully  grasped, 
a  truth  pregnant  with  vast  results  to  body  and  mind.  It 
means  that  music  attacks  the  nervous  system  directly, 
reaches  and  rouses  where  physic  and  change  of  air  can 
neither  reach  nor  rouse. 

Music  will  some  day  become  a  powerful  and  acknowledged 

therapeutic.     And  it  is  one  especially  appropriate  to  this 

excited  age.     Half  our  diseases,  some  physicians 

MUSIC  AS  A  say  all  our  diseases,  come  from  disorder  of  the 

RESTORATIVE.  TT  MI  />    ,  1  •       1  1 

nerves.  How  many  ills  ot  the  mind  precede 
the  ills  of  the  body !  Boredom  makes  more  patients  than 
fever,  want  of  interest  and  excitement,  stagnation  of  the 
emotional  life,  or  the  fatigue  of  over-wrought  emotion, 
lies  at  the  root  of  half  the  ill-health  of  our  young  men 
and  women.  Can  we  doubt  the  power  of  music  to  break 
up  that  stagnation?  Or,  again,  can  we  doubt  its  power 
to  soothe?  to  recreate  an  over-strained  emotional  life,  by 
bending  the  bow  the  other  way?  There  .are  moods  of 
exhausted  feeling  in  which  certain  kinds  of  music  would 
act  like  poison,  just  as  whip  and  spur  which  encourage

the  racer  at  first,  tire  him  to  death  at  last.  There  are  other 
kinds  of  music  which  soothe,  and,  if  I  may  use  the  word, 
lubricate  the  worn  ways  of  the  nervous  centres.  You  will 
ask  what  music  is  good  for  that?  We  reply,  judgment  and 
common-sense,  and,  above  all,  sympathy,  affection al  and 
musical  sympathy,  will  partly  be  your  guide,  but  experience 
must  decide.  Let  some  friend  well  versed  in  the  divine 
art  sit  at  the  piano,  and  let  the  tired  one  lie  on  a  couch 
and  prescribe  for  herself  or  for  himself.  This  will  happen  : 
"  Do  not  play  that  Tannhduser  overture  just  now,  it 
wears  me  out,  I  cannot  bear  it " ;  or,  "  Yes — sing  that 
'Du  bist  die  Huh/  and  after  that  I  must  hear  MENDELS- 
SOHN'S '  Notturno,'  out  of  the  Midsummer  Night's  Dream  "  ; 
and  then — and  then — what  must  come  next  must  be  left 
to  the  tact  and  quick  sympathy  of  the  musician.  I  have 
known  cases  where  an  hour  of  this  treatment  did  more  good 
than  bottlesf  ul  of  bark  or  pailsful  of  globules ;  but  I  do  not 
wish  to  over-state  the  case.  I  merely  plead  for  an  unrecog- 
nised truth,  and  I  point  to  a  NEW  VOCATION — the  vocation 
of  the  Musical  Healer. 

How  many  a  girl  might  turn  her  at  present  uncared-for 

and  generally  useless    musical  abilities  to  this  gentle  and 

tender  human  use.     Let  her  try.     At  the   end 

THE  MUSICAL  of   the  seance,   let    her   and   her    patient   note 

the  abatement  of  the  head-ache  brought  about 

directly  by  the  counter  excitement  of  a  nerve-current  set 


THE  MUSICAL  HEALER.  197 

up  by  music.  Let  her  friend  admit  that  she  has  suffered 
less  during  that  hour, — the  mind  having  heen  completely 
called  off  from  the  contemplation  of  a  special  pain,  aiid 
the  pain  meanwhile  having  passed  or  abated.  There  are 
cases  chiefly  connected  with  disorders  of  the  spine,  cases  of 
apathy,  where  music  is  almost  the  only  thing  which  seems 
to  stir  the  torpid  nerves  and  set  up  a  commotion,  quickening 
the  heart  and  flushing  the  cheek.  Then,  I  say,  let  music 
open  the  shut  gate,  and  let  health  come  in  that  way, 
ceelestis  janitor  aulae.  But  I  want,  before  I  pass,  to  fix 
my  musical  healer  upon  the  reader's  mind.  She  is  gentle, 
she  is  glowing  with  health,  but  not  boisterous ;  she  has 
a  quick  sympathy  for  pain ;  she  has  a  cool,  soft  hand  that 
does  the  hot  brow  good ;  she  rather  moves  than  walks  : 
the  sound  of  her  foot-fall  is  seldom  heard.  Oh,  Alma ! 
the  fostering  one,  the  healing  presence,  you  are  in  many 
households,  but  you  hardly  know  your  powers;  the  sick 
bless  you;  they  love  to  hear  your  voice;  but  days  and 
weeks  pass,  and  you  never  exercise  your  gifts  for  them. 
You  are  a  beautiful  musician,  but  your  music  would  not 
make  you  the  healer  without  your  tact  in  applying  it,  your 
sympathy,  your  quick  judgment,  your  watchfulness  of  effect, 
your  faculty  of  giving  yourself  when  you  sing  and  when 
you  play.  Tt  is  the  union  of  musical  talent  with  personal 
qualities  like  yours,  that  will  give  you  grace  to  apply  the 
medicine  of  music  to  disease. 

Have    you    ever    thought   of   that?     You  have   played 


198  HEARING  MUSIC. 

casually  to  the  weary,  the  idle,  or  even  the  sick,  but  you 
have  not  with  reflection  played  to  refresh,  to  stimulate,  or 
to  soothe ;  and  you  cannot  do  this  all  at  once. 

1.  You  must  have  the  idea  of  doing  it :  that  is,  you  must 
conceive  of  music  as  a  therapeutic  art. 

2.  You  must  gain   a  certain  easy  command   of  a  wide 
range  of  compositions  that  you  may  select  your  remedies 
wisely. 

3.  You  must  take  care  to  establish  between  yourself  and 
your   patients   that  kindly  rapport  which  will    predispose 
them  to  listen  to  you ;  it  must  be  the  hand  of  something 
like  a  friend  upon  the  white  keys  or  upon  the  strings  of  a 
zither,  an  instrument  of  heavenly  soothing  qualities  as  of 
harps  in  the  wind  at  sunset.     It  must  be  the  voice  of  some- 
thing like  a  friend  ;  the  voice  that  has  said  with  no  feigned 
earnestness,  but  with  the  wide,  warm  love  of  a  Christ-like 
nature,  "  I  wish  I  could  do  you  good."     Such  a  voice  will 
sing  well  and  pleasantly,  and  bring  peace. 

4.  Self- training,    judgment,    and     experience    generally. 
The  music-healer  must  indeed  have  gifts  of  mind,  but  hers 
will  be  almost  as  much  a  vocation  to  be  learnt  as  that  of 
nursing  itself.     She  must  study  different  kinds  of  tempera- 
ment and  disease,  watch  and  write  down  and  remember  the 
effect    which   certain   pieces   or    kinds   of  music  have   on 
certain    temperaments.      But    the   fascination    of  the  new 
calling  would  lie  in  the  delight  of  its  exercise,  the  variety 
and  endless  excitement  and  surprises  of  its  results,  the  inces- 


"MUSIC  AND  MORALS"   AGAIN.  199 

snnt  study  of  character,  the  constant  self-training  and  culti- 
vation of  sympathy  for  a  definite  and  immediate  end,  and 
in  the  intense  happiness  of  feeling  that  upon  the  waves  of 
heavenly  melody  and  harmony  which  lifted  up  your  own 
soul,  another's  pain  and  distress  were  floating  away,  and 
that  you  had  been  the  active  agent  in  procuring  this  pleasure, 
this  relief,  this  recovery. 

Let  some  pen  more  competent  than  mine  expand  this  new 
doctrine  of  "  music  considered  as  a  therapeutic/'  If  it 
found  support  from  any  well-accredited  medical  authority, 
with  what  faith  and  favour  would  it  be  received  by 
thousands  of  sufferers !  with  what  alacrity  would  spring 
up  right  and  left  our  musical  healers,  coveting  and  exercis- 
ing earnestly  the  best  gifts  of  character  and  training  !  It 
would  not  be  long  before  we  had  a  hand-book  on  the  sub- 
ject, with  suggestions  for  a  course  of  treatment  based  on 
actual  experience. 

Music  is  not  only  a  body  healer ;  it  is  a  mind  regulator. 

149.       The  great  educational  function  of  music  remains 

"MUSIC  AND  aimost   to  be   discovered.      The   future   mission

AGAIN.  of  music  for  the  million  is  the  DISCIPLINE 
OF  EMOTION. 

What  is  the  ruin  of  art?     Ill-regulated  emotion. 

What  is  the  ruin  of  life  ?     Again,  ill-regulated  emotion. 

What  mars  happiness  ?  What  destroys  manliness  ?  What 
sullies  womanhood  ?  What  checks  enterprise  ?  What  spoils 


200  HEARING  MUSIC. 

success  ?  Constantly  the  same — ill-regulated  emotion.  The 
tongue  is  a  fire,  an  uncontrolled  and  passionate  outburst 
swallows  up  many  virtues,  and  blots  out  weeks  of  kindness. 

There  is  one  thing  more  important  than  knowing  self;  it  is 
governing  self.  There  is  one  thing  better  than  crushing 
impulse ;  it  is  using  impulse.  The  life  of  the  ascetic  is  half 
true,  the  life  of  the  voluptuary  is  the  other  half  true.  The 
stoic  may  be  said  to  be  blind  at  least  of  one  eye.  The  cynic 
is  very  nearly  blind  of  both,  since  the  power  and  the 
passion  and  the  splendid  uses  of  existence  are  hidden  from 
him,  and  all  these  go  wrong  in  various  ways,  from  abusing, 
misusing,  or  neglecting  the  emotional  life. 

The  Greek  was  not  far  wrong  when  he  laid  such  stress  on 
gymnastics  and  music.  Of  music,  indeed,  in  its  modern, 
150.  exhaustive,  and  subtle  developments,  as  the 
™£°s*c™»' language  of  the  emotions,  he  knew  nothing; 
DISCIPLINE,  but  his  faint  guess  was  with  a  certain  fine  and 
unerring  instinct  in  the  right  direction;  shame  upon  us 
that,  in  the  blaze  of  modern  music,  we  have  almost  missed 
its  deepest  meaning  !  The  Greek  at  least  understood  how 
sound  regulated  motion,  which  is,  after  all,  only  the 
physical  expression  of  emotion ;  not  a  procession,  not  a 
social  gathering,  not  a  gymnasium,  nay,  not  even  an  im- 
portant oration,  was  thought  complete  without  the  intro- 
duction of  musical  sound,  and  that  not  as  a  mere  jingle  or 
pastime,  out  to  regulate  the  order,  the  variety,  the  intensity 


THE  GREEKS'  "MUSICAL"   DISCIPLINE.     201 

of  bodily  motions,  actions,  and  words,  so  that  throughout 
there  might  be  an  elaborate  discipline  carried  on  through 
musical  sound,  a  discipline  which,  thus  learned  at  the 
schools,  met  the  Greek  again  at  every  turn  in  his  social  and 
political  life,  and  ended  by  making  his  earth-life  that  rounded 
model  of  physical  and  intellectual  harmony,  and  perfection 
which  has  made  at  once  the  despair  and  wonder  of  sculptors, 
poets,  and  philosophers  of  all  ages. 

And  we  living  in  the  full  development  of  this  divine  art 
of  Music,  put  it  to  less  practical  uses  than  the  Greek,  who 
never  got  beyond  music  as  a  rhythmic  and  melodic  regulator 
of  dancing,  feasting,  and  oratory  ! 

It  remains  for  us  to  take  up  the  pregnant  hint,  and  claim 
modern  music  as  the  great  organ  of  emotional  culture  and 
emotional  discipline.  This  practical  view  of  the  unique  and 
perfect  functions  of  the  musical  art  is,  I  think,  sufficiently 
new  to  require  a  little  further  explanation. 

"  How,"  it  will  be  asked,  "  apart  from  mere  pleasure — 
pleasure,  if  you  will,  of  a  harmless  and  elevating  kind — am 
I  a  bit  better  for  the  hearing  of  music  ?  " 

In  answering  this  question,  I  leave  out  the  effect  pro- 
duced on  bodily  health  through  the  agitation  of  the  nervous 
centres  by  musical  sound,  as  dwelt  upon  above.  I  will  come 
to  close  quarters  again  with  Music  and  Morals,  and  I  will 
show  how  hearing  music  in  the  right  way  gets  up,  as  it 
were,  the  steam  power  of  emotion,  collects  it,  concentrates 


202  HEARING  MUSIC. 

it,  and  then  puts  it  through  such  innumerable  stages  of 
discipline,  that  the  very  force  of  emotion  which,  allowed 
to  run  wild,  brings  ruin  into  life,  grows,  through  the  right 
hearing  of  great  and  skilful  music,  docile,  controlled, 
indefinitely  plastic,  or  at  the  call  of  the  will,  resistless  in 
nJght. 

Music,  in  short,  is  bound,  when  properly  used  and  under- 
stood, to  train  us  in  the  exercise  of  our  emotions,  as  the 
gymnasium  trains  us  in  the  exercise  of  our  limbs.  The 
Greek  understood  both  these  uses,  we  probably  understand 
neither. 

First,  then,  music  rouses  the  emotions.     Inward  activities

music  rouses  and  sustains  emotion. 

But,  secondly,  music  disciplines  and  controls  emotion. 

That  is  the  explanation  of  the  art  of  music,  as  distin- 
guished from  the  mere  power  of  the  musical  sound.  You 
can  rouse  with  a  stroke ;  but  to  guide,  to  moderate,  to  con-

scheme  involving  appropriate  relations  and  proportions  of 
force,  and  various  mobility — for  this  you  require  the  subtle 
machinery  of  an  art,  and  the  direct  machinery  for  stirring 
up  and  regulating  emotion,  is  the  wonderful  vibratory 
mechanism  created  by  the  art  of  music. 

Those  who  wish  to  see  how,  as  the  hand-maid  to  thought, 
music  steps  in  to  elaborate  and  control  emotion,  I  will  refer 
152.  to  my  analysis  of  Elijah,  in  Music  and  Morals ; 
,(g^^^T^_but  I  wish  to  give  here  a  short  example  of  the 
our  WORDS."  wav  jn  whicn  a  train  of  abstract  emotion,  capable 
of  being  fitted  to  different  ideas,  or  capable  of  underlying 
more  than  one  series  of  mental  events  (so  long  as  the  rela- 
tions of  them  be  similar  and  parallel),  can  be  roused  and 
developed  in  a  fixed  artistic  form  by  music.  My  present 
limits  will  not  allow  me  to  take  one  of  the  great  symphonies 
of  BEETHOVEN  or  MENDELSSOHN  for  this.  I  will  select  a 
"  Lied  ohne  Worte  "  ;  let  us  take,  for  instance,  No.  10,  the 
fourth  Lied  of  the  Second  Book.  I  will  mention  the  bars 
by  their  numbers,  instead  of  using  technical  terms,  such  as 
a  key  of  D  or  F,  subdominant,  tonic,  &c.  It  is  difficult  to 
describe  mental  states  apart  from  particular  thoughts,  but  as 
far  as  possible  we  will  try  to  do  so,  and  so  express  the 
consciousness  of  a  state  of  mind  which  might  be  equally 
appropriate  to  several  separate  and  distinct,  though  similar 
and  parallel  trains  of  thought. 

Understand  what  I  mean  by  similar  and  parallel  trains  of

thought.     Let  me  even  appeal  to  the  eye,  and  put  my  similar 
thoughts  in  parallel  columns,  thus  :  — 

I.  Man  losing  his  temper.  I.  Sea  ruffled  with  wind. 

IL  Man  lost  his  temper  II.  Sea  convulsed. 

III.  Smashes  the  furniture.  IIL  Thunder  and  lightning. 

IV.  Is  appeased  hy  wife.  IV.  Blue  sky,  wind  drops. 

V.  All  is  forgiven  and  forgotten.  V   Sun  breaks  out,  sea  calnu 

One,  and  the  same  train  of  emotion,  or  general  cast  of 
feeling  may  fitly  underlie  such  two  progressive  scenes;  but 
the  events  must  in  every  case  be  similar  in  tone,  and  run 
parallel  ;  only  in  this  sense  does  music,  as  it  is  sometimes 
loosely  said,  mean  all  sorts  of  things  to  different  people.

and  holds  his  breath  at  a  passing  thought  of  some  agitating 
possibility  (7,  8,  9,  10),  the  flash  of  suspense  passes  off, 
lowering  back  the  tone  of  mind  to  its  first  state  ;  that  state, 
instead  of  subsiding  as  before,  passes  into  a  reflex  sort  of 
reasoning  upon  itself,  as  though  one  said  (15,  16,  17,  2  18),

revelation,  I  float  out  upon  the  tide  of  triumph.  Now  I 
rest,  bathed  in  tranquil  peace,  and  perfect  satisfaction  (31, 
32,  £33),  I  prolong  the  dream."  But  already  the  ecstatic 
glow  has  cooled  (£33,  34,  35,  36),  a  faint  touch  of  earth 
bitterness,  a  misgiving  (D  sharp)  has  crept  in  (37,  38,  39, 
40,  41,  42),  and  is  confirmed  until  the  vision  of  bliss  is 
almost  obliterated,  and  the  emotion  is  in  danger  of  sinking 
back  at  once  to  its  first  condition  of  morbid  restlessness, 
but  that  would  be  monotonous  (45) ;  at  this  point  it  is, 
therefore,  caught  by  new  reflex  action  of  the  feelings,  and 
a  struggle  takes  place  (46,  47,  48,  49,  50,  51),  represented 
by  the  opening  subject  struggling  up  in  the  bass,  checked, 
then  struggling  up  in  the  treble,  checked  at  sf,  and  then 
cresc.,  struggling  up  (51)  once  more.  Then  there  is  a 
pause,  emotion  is  at  a  standstill,  and  at  last  grows  almost 
tepid  and  indifferent ;  dropping  at  57,  p  and  dim.,  almost 
listless,  when  at  60  the  struggle  recommences  with  fresh 
violence,  the  great  effort  of  the  mind  to  cast  out  the  restless, 
passionate  broodings  of  the  first  page  (60  to  71),  produces  a 
storm  of  conflicting  emotions,  in  which  now  one  side,  now 
another  seems  uppermost,  till  at  last  the  mind,  trembling 
on  the  morbid  verge,  passes  over  the  line  with  a  kind  of 
wilful  and  helpless  self-surrender ;  but  this  time  the  experi- 
ences through  which  it  has  passed  make  it  impossible  quite 
to  repeat  the  morbid  and  restless  series,  and  (72)  only  half 
the  first  subject  is  given,  the  emotion  is  hampered,  it  does 
not  run  easily,  it  cannot  get  on,  then  (76)  the  same  phrase 


206  HEARING  MUSIC, 

over  again,  piu  f,  with  growing  impatience,  a  change  of 
some  sort  is  evidently  at  hand  (81),  the  old  subject  is 
tossed  away  as  worthless  and  unfit  for  the  purpose,  as  the 
spirit  feels  itself  breathed  upon  once  more,  and  held  by 
some  new  force,  through  a  series  of  bars  (81  to  87),  until 
expectancy  is  crowned,  and  with  a  crescendo  of  ascending 
octaves,  which  makes  us  fairly  hold  our  breath,  whilst  the 
action  of  the  pulse  is  rapidly  quickened,  suddenly, — but  this 
time  on  a  higher  pitch,  and  with  quite  bewildering  power 
of  effect — the  glory  breaks  again  upon  the  soul,  and  we 
seem  "rapt  from  the  fickle  and  the  frail/'  and  caught  up 
into  that  splendid  air  of  joy  and  bounding  triumph.  The 
poor  shaken  and  earth-worn  spirit  is  thus  held  for  a  little 
space  in  Paradise.  It  is  its  last  gleam  of  perfect  peace. 
Already  at  103,  the  vision  has  well-nigh  faded  out;  at 
111  the  light  of  common  day  has  been  fairly  reached,  and 
the  perilous  struggle  between  morbid  brooding  and  noble 
endurance  is  in  danger  of  recommencing.  Four  times,  at 
119,  123,  125,  and  126,  the  morbid  passage  reminding  us  of 
the  opening  phrase,  knocks  (ff]  passionately  for  admittance, 
and  is  sternly  negatived  by  the  bass.  At  129,  130,  131, 
there  is  a  very  natural  pause  of  brief  exhaustion  zip.  At 
132  the  emotion  is  stirred,  but  this  time  less  strongly ;  we 
feel  that  a  new  and  more  normal  life  is  now  going  to  open 
out,  into  which  indeed  we  are  not  permitted  to  enter,  for 
the  Lied  draws  to  its  close.  The  vision  of  triumph  has  had 
its  own  chastening  and  purifying  effect,  although  the 


TRAINING  OF  ABSTRACT  EMOTION.          207 

triumph  oi'  joy  is  evidently  not  near,  still  the  restless  aud 
passionate  mood  of  anxious  brooding,  which  so  unfits  for 
the  life  that  has  still  to  be  lived  out,  has  also  passed ;  the 
last  unemphatic  memory  of  it  occurs  138,  not  even  half  the 
first  subject  as  before,  is  repeated  only  one  bar  of  it,  and 
the  emotion  is  then  left  unimpassioned  and  suspended  on 
a  long  D,  the  same  chord  for  six  bars,  without  change  in 
treble  or  bass,  serving  to  close  the  piece,  and  leaving  the 
mind  in  a  self-contained  and  reconciled,  if  not  a  happy 
mood,  ready  now  to  enter  without  harrowing  pre-occupation 
upon  the  more  ordinary  phases  and  pursuits  of  life. 

Now  if  music  does  really  rouse  and  then  take  in  hand  and 

rule  at  its  will,  and  thereby  teach  us  to  rule  the  emotions, 

154.       it  is  obvious  that  we  are,  when  we  hear  music

so  the  study  of  music  trains  the  emotions  in  the  abstract. 
If  you  want  to  touch  and  train  this  emotional  life,  music  is 
your  all-powerful  ally. 

The  time  is  not  distant  when  this  great  truth  will  be 
understood  and  practised  in  connection  with  our  toiling 
masses — our  artisans,  our  poor,  our  labourers,  our  degraded 
denizens  of  back  streets,  cellars,  and  foul  alleys.  There 
are  millions  whose  only  use  of  the  emotional  life  ia  base,

undisciplined,  and  degraded.  Pleasure  with  many  means 
crime — restraint,  the  real  hand-maid  of  pleasure,  is  un- 
known ;  system,  order,  harmony  in  their  feelings,  habits  of 
self-control,  checking  the  impulses,  moderating  and  econo- 
mizing the  feelings,  guiding  them  to  powerful  purposes  and 
wise  ends  and  wholesome  joys — of  all  this  our  masses  are 
chiefly  ignorant ;  yet  if  what  I  have  maintained  be  true,  all 
this  music  would  mightily  help  to  teach  and  to  give. 

I  have  known  the  oratorio  of  the  Messiah  draw  the  lowest

for  once  put  through  such  a  noble  and  long- 
sustained  exercise  as  that,  could  be  otherwise  than  bene- 
ficial? If  such  performances  of  both  sacred  and  secular 
music  were  more  frequent,  we  should  have  less  drunkenness, 
less  wife-beating,  less  spending  of  summer  gains,  less  pauper- 
ism in  winter.  People  get  drunk  because  they  have  nothing 
else  to  do ;  they  beat  their  wives  because  their  minds  are 
narrow,  their  tastes  brutal,  their  emotions,  in  a  word,  ill- 
regulated;  they  spend  their  wages  because  they  have  no  self- 
control,  and  dawdle  in  public-houses,  where  money  must  be 
spent,  simply  in  the  absence  of  all  other  resources ;  and  they 
starve  in  winter  because  they  have  not  acquired  the  habit 
of  steady  work,  which  is  impossible  without  steady  and

wholesome  recreation, — or  that  steady  thrift  and  self-control 
which  is  impossible  apart  from  disciplined  emotion. 

The  question  of  music  for  the  people  will  some  day  become 
a  great  government  question.  A  few  thousands  spent  on 
promoting  bands,  cheap  and  good,  accessible  and  respectable, 
would  save  the  country  millions  in  poor-rates.  I  do  not  say 
that  mnsic  will  ever  shut  up  all  our  prisons  and  workhouses, 
but  I  venture  to  believe  that  as  a  chief  and  sovereign  means 
of  rousing,  satisfying,  and  recreating  the  emotions,  it  would 
go  far  to  diminish  the  number  of  paupers  and  criminals. 
It  would  help  them  to  save,  it  would  keep  them  from  drink, 
it  would  recreate  them  wholesomely,  and  teach  them  to 
govern  their  feelings — to  use,  and  not  invariably  abuse,  their 
emotions. 

One  Saturday  afternoon  1  stood  outside  a  public  house, 
and  saw  the  groups  of  men  standing  round  the  door.     Those

or  three  milliners'  "  Hands "  stood  still.     And  what  was  it 
all  about  ?     I  blush  for  my  country !     A  wretched  cornet

with  a  harp,  no  two  strings  of  which  were  in  tune,  the 
harpist  trying  wildly  to  follow  "  The  last  rose  of  summer " 
with  but  two  chords,  and  always  in  with  the  wrong  one. 
The  weather  was  bitterly  cold :  the  men's  hands  were  in 
their  pockets,  the  girls  shivered,  but  they  were  all  taking 
their  solace.  This  was  the  best  music  they  could  get :  it 
seemed  to  soothe  and  refresh  them.  Oh,  that  I  could  have 
led  those  people  to  some  near  winter  pavilion,  or  even  a  cold 
garden,  where  they  could  have  walked  about  and  heard 
a  popular  selection  of  tunes,  an  overture,  anything,  by 
a  common  but  excellent  German  band.  What  good  that 
would  have  done  them  !  How  they  would  have  enjoyed  it  ! 
And  supposing  that  every  Saturday  they  could  look  forward 
to  it,  admission  twopence  apiece,  the  men  would  be  there 
with  their  wives  and  children ;  they  would  spend  less  on  the 
whole  family  than  they  would  have  squandered  on  themselves 
in  one  drunken  afternoon.  They  could  meet  their  friends, 
have  their  chat  and  glass  of  ale,  or  cup  of  coffee,  in  the 
winter  garden ;  they  would  go  home  sober ;  and  being 
satisfied,  recreated,  having  had  their  exercise  and  company, 
would  be  more  likely  to  go  to  bed  early  than  to  get  drunk 
late.  Surely  all  this  is  better  than  boozing  in  public-houses. 
Oh !  what  a  vast,  what  a  beneficent  future  has  music  in 
the  time  to  come !  Let  its  true  power  and  use  be  once 
understood;  let  some  one  man  who  loves  the  people,  and  is 
willing  to  consult  their  tastes  without  pandering  to  them, 
open  a  promenade  for  the  lower  stratum  of  the  population, 


GIVE  THE  PEOPLE  MUSIQ.  211 

at  a  low  price,  on  Saturday  afternoon,  and  let  us  see  the 
result.  Let  the  musical  part  be  under  some  fit  and 
intelligent  musical  dictator,  and  let  some  able  and  sympa- 
thetic administrator,  intimately  and  wisely  in  sympathy  with 
(he  masses — a  Miss  OCTAVIA  HILL — organize  the  refresh- 
ments, the  admissions  by  payment,  the  general  distribution 
of  tickets,  passes,  advertisements,  accommodation,  &c.  Let 
this  be  tried  fairly — at  first,  of  course,  with  an  outlay  of 
charitable  funds — and  then  I  prophesy  four  things  : — 

1.  It  will  soon  be  self-supporting. 

2.  It  will  have  a  definite  and  marked  influence  upon  tho 
crime  and  intemperance  of  the  district. 

3.  It  will   promote   thrift,   and   increase  the   sum,  now 
lamentably  small,  of  the  people's  wholesome  pleasures. 

4.  It  will  become  a  national  institution,  and  spread   in 
a  short  time   throughout  the  length   and  breadth   of  the 
land. 

Then  shall  music,  ceasing  to  be  the  luxury  of  the  rich  and 
the  degradation  of  the  poor,  open  the  golden  gates  of  a  wider 
and  a  happier  realm  of  recreation  for  the  masses.  In  its 
wake  might  follow,  under  similar  management,  a  regene- 
rated and  popular  drama,  pictorial  exhibitions,  short  and 
systematic  lectures  to  groups  in  separate  alcoves,  electrical 
experiments,  the  microscope,  the  telescope,  and  a  thousand 
other  elevating  and  instructive  seances — to  each  seance  one

MT   VIOLIN. 


T  would  be  strange  if  1  had  not  a  good  deal  to  say 
about  the  violin.     The  toy  of  my  childhood — the 
solace  of  my  manhood — what  it  will  be  to  my 
old  age,  should  I  ever  come  to  that,  I  cannot 
say.     It  can  never  be  less  than  a  happy  memory, 
and  in  the  hands  of  others — for  I  cannot  suppose  I  shall 
ever  take  it  up  again — a  recurrent  delight. 

The  second  time  I  was  invited  to  fill  the  position  of 
Friday  evening  lecturer  at  the  Royal  Institution,  in 
February  1880,  I  took  for  my  subject,  "Old  Violins/'' 


216     ON  A   NIGHT  AT  THE  EOTAL  INSTITUTION. 

I  had  not  thought  much  about  the  violin  for  several  years, 

but  this  sudden  return  to  my  old  love  re- 
159. 

LATENT  kindled  my  enthusiasm.  Numberless  fragments 
KNOWLEDGE.  of  yiolia  lore  that  j  knew  witilout  having 

learned,  facts  that  I  supposed  were  familiar  to  everyone,  but 
which  I  found  few  even  suspected;  views  which  seemed  to 
me  obvious,  but  which  to  others  appeared  fanciful,  seemed  to 
crowd  upon  my  mind,  and  my  great  difficulty  was  to  know 
what  to  select,  not  how  many,  but  how  few  things  I  could 
say  in  my  hour. 

I  had  noticed  that  very  great  men  at  the  Royal  Institu- 
tion floundered  about  for  half-an-hour  over  an  introduction, 

laboured  under  a  fatal  incapacity  to  begin,  and 
GOOD  only  towards  the  end  of  the  hour,  when  it  was 

time  to  leave  off,  really  got  under  weigh.  I 
think  it  was  MR.  B  RAM  WELL  (since  knighted),  the  engineer, 
next  whom  I  happened  to  sit  at  dinner  one  night,  who 
said  to  me,  "  If  you  lecture  at  the  Royal  Institution, 
don't  beat  about  the  bush,  begin  at  once."  I  planned  my 
lecture  for  three  quarters  of  an  hour,  giving  myself  the  odd 
quarter  for  illustration  and  digression.  First  quarter,  the 
Construction;  second  quarter,  the  History;  third  quarter, 
the  Sound  of  the  violin.  I  allowed  my  mind  to  brood  over 
each  division,  and  made  fragmentary  notes  on  occasion. 
I  did  not  so  much  want  to  acquire  information  as  to  arrange 
what  I  knew — give  it  point,  edge,  and  a  setting. 


PREPARATION  FOR  THE  ROYAL  INSTITUTION.    217 

I  went  down  and  had  a  chat  with  MR.  HILL,  of  Wardour 
Street,  who  always  seemed  to  me  quite  one  of  the  old  fiddle- 
.„.  makers  redivivus.  The  sources  of  violin  History

EOYAL  ENGEL,  &c.  I  had  used  up  some  of  these  in  my 
'  section  on  violins  in  Music  and  Morals,  and  as 
regards  the  Sound  I  thought  I  could  rely  on  my  own  per- 
ception and  experience.  For  two  months  before  my  lecture 
I  lived  much  with  great  fiddles,  and  I  had  my  own  Cremona 
always  with  me,  MR.  AMHERST'S  very  tender  and  delightful 
Nicolas  Amati,  as  well  as  his  venerable  Gaspar  violin,  and 
MR.  ENTHOVEN'S  famous  Maggini.  I  took  these  down  to 
the  Isle  of  Wight,  got  them  into  condition,  played  upon 
them  every  day,  compared  them,  handled  them,  thought 
about  them.  They  kept  me  in  the  violin  atmosphere,  above 
all  they  kept  my  eye  in.  If  you  leave  off  looking  at  violins 
you  soon  get  out  of  practice,  you  fail  to  see  the  subtle 
differences,  you  get  like  a  tea-taster  off  his  palate.  To 
know  fiddles  and  judge  them  you  must  be  always  looking  at 
them.  For  a  time,  at  least,  I  got  my  eye  in  by  dwelling  on 
the  best  models.  I  lost  no  opportunity  of  seeing  great 
fiddles  for  the  next  two  months;  the  DUKE  OF  EDINBURGH 
showed  me  his ;  MR.  ADAM  showed  me  his,  and  allowed  me 
to  see  and  handle  the  Dolphin  Strad.  I  carefully  avoided 
looking  at  any  inferior  violin,  so  that  my  eye  might  be 
saturated  with  nothing  but  the  curves  and  peculiarities  of 
the  great  makers. 


218     ON  A   NIGHT  AT  THE  EOYAL  INSTITUTION. 

The  collection  with  which   I   was   able  to  decorate  the 
semicircular  table  of  the   Royal   Institution   on  the  night 

of  my  lecture,  was,  I  should  think,  as  a  collec- 
1C2 
A  RARE     tion,  unique.     I  had  about  twenty  of  the  finest 

N'  fiddles  in  the  world,  representing  the  chief  makers 
from  DUIFFOPRUGCAR  to  BERGONZI,  arranged  in  front  of  me. 
The  DUKE  OF  LEIXSTER'S  colossal  Gaspar  bass,  now  in  the 
South  Kensington  Museum,  lay  on  the  floor  between  me 
and  the  audience.  Various  fantastic  viols  lent  me  by  the 
South  Kensington  stood  on  the  right  and  left  of  me,  and 
behind  me  was  a  yellow  screen  on  which  I  inscribed,  with 
a  piece  of  coarse  charcoal,  the  ground  plan  of  the  great 
square  in  Cremona,  showing  the  houses  of  STRADIVARIUS,  the 
GUARNERII,  and  AMATI,  all  close  to  one  another.  Another 
screen  behind  me  reached  the  whole  length  of  the  theatre 
facing  the  audience,  and  represented  the  violin  tribe  and  old 
viols  great  and  small.  A  long  roll  diagram  with  the  names 
and  dates  of  the  chief  violin  makers  of  Italy,  France,  and 
Germany  ran  at  the  top  from  end  to  end  of  the  wall. 

The  theatre  was  crowded.     I  touched  from  time  to  time 

a  few  of  the  instruments  to  illustrate  peculiarities  of  tone. 

The    exquisite   sweetness   and   freshness    of  the 

Dolphin  "  Strad."  excited  most  admiration,  and

at  the  close  of  the  lecture  people  crowded  to 
the  table  to  see,  and,  if  possible,  handle  my  gems.  I  dared 
not  leave  my  post ;  my  object  was  to  get  all  the  fiddles 


PACKING    UP.  219 

into  their  cases  rapidly — to  allow  them  to  be  handled  was 
no  part  of  my  programme,  nor  had  I  any  permission  for 
this  from  their  owners.  Before  ever  my  curious  hearers 
could  get  at  the  table,  the  Dolphin  "  Strad."  had  left  the 
theatre,  and  the  DUKE  OF  EDINBURGH'S  violins,  one  of 
which  belonged  to  the  EMPEROR  OF  BUSSIA,  were  both  in 
their  cases. 

•  •  •  •  • 

For  a  few  precious  days  I  had  the  guardianship  of  most 
of  these  gems.  It  was  an  anxious  time.  Some  I  kept  in 
my  bedroom,  others  in  my  study  adjoining  it,  with  locked 
doors ;  and  even  then  I  awoke  several  times  each  night, 
fancying  something  was  wrong,  and  once,  to  satisfy  rny- 
self,  I  got  up  about  three  o'clock  in  the  morning  and  went 
to  look  at  them  in  their  cases.  They  were  all  resting 
quietly,  more  quietly  than  I  could  rest.  When  all  the 
instruments  were  safe  back  in  the  hands  of  their  respective 
owners,  after  the  first  pang  at  parting,  I  heaved  a  deep 
sigh  of  relief.  The  Times  printed  a  short  summary  of 
the  lecture,  but  I  wrote  it  out  afterwards  at  length  for 
Good  Words  and  I  here  give  it  in  extenso  substantially 
as  it  was  delivered. 


220  OLD   VIOLINS.

OLD   VIOLINS. 

THE  Construction,   the  History,  the  Sound  of  the   violin, 
would  make  a  romantic  work  in  three  volumes  as  sensa- 
tional  as,   and  far  more  instructive  than,  most 
novels.       The  very   pine-wood    smells  good,  to 

THE   WOOD. 

begin  with.  The  forests  of  the  Southern  Tyrol, 
which  now  teem  with  saplings,  when  the  old  violins  were 
made,  from  1520  to  1750,  still  abounded  in  those  ancient 
trees,  so  eagerly  and  often  vainly  sought  out  by  modern 
builders,  and  which  the  old  viol-makers  found  to  possess 
the  finest  acoustic  properties. 

The  mighty  timbers  were  felled  in  late  summer.  They 
came  in  loose  floating  rafts  from  the  banks  of  the  Garda ; 
they  floated  down  the  Mincio  to  Mantua.  Brescia  was  iu 
the  midst  of  them.  From  Como  they  found  their  way  to 
Milan,  and  from  Lake  Maggiore  direct,  via  the  Ticino  and 
the  Po,  to  Cremona. 

What  market  days  were  those !  What  a  timber  feast 
to  select  from ;  and  what  cunning  lovers  and  testers  of 
wood  were  the  old  viol-makers,  the  fathers  of  the  violin  ! 
The  rough  heaps  of  pine,  pear,  lemon,  and  ash,  beloved  of 
the  Brescians — of  maple  and  sycamore,  preferred  by  the 
Cremonese — lay  steaming  dry  and  hard  in  a  few  hours 
beneath  the  sun  of  the  southern  Alps. 


THE   WOOD.— HOW  TO  SELECT  IT.  221 

Before  a  beam  was  bought,  the  master  passed  his  hand 
over  the  surface.     He  could  tell  by  touch  the  density  of  its 

fibre.     Then   he   would  take  two  equal  slips  of 
166. 

now  TO  deal  and  weigh  them,  and  judge  of  their  porous- 
ness. The  very  appearance  of  the  wood  would 
guide  him  to  its  probable  vibrational  powers.  Then  he 
would,  perchance,  before  leaving  the  market,  cut  strips 
of  equal  length,  and  elicit  their  relative  intensities  by 
striking  their  tongues.  He  would  often  select  for  a  definite 
purpose,  looking  for  a  soft,  porous  piece,  or  a  specially 
hard  and  close-fibred  grain — a  certain  appearance  he  would 
instinctively  associate  with  rare  acoustic  properties.  The 
seller  would  be  eager  to  find  the  pieces,  useless  to  other 
customers,  invaluable  to  an  ANDREAS  AMATI,  for  he  was  sure 
that  the  viol-maker  would  buy  what  suited  him  at  a  long 
price.  After  the  lapse  of  nearly  two  centuries,  we  can  trace 
such  favourite  beams  by  peculiar  stains,  freckles,  and  grain- 
ings.  When,  after  cutting  up  a  dozen  trees,  once  in  two  or 
three  years  a  piece  of  fine  acoustic  wood  was  found,  it  was 
kept  for  the  master's  best  work.  The  same  pine-beam  will 
crop  up  in  the  bellies  of  Stradiv-arius  at  an  interval  of 
years.  Another  can  be  traced  in  the  violins  of  JOSEPH 
GUAIINEBIUS,  and  after  his  death  CARLO  BERGONZI  got  hold 
cf  the  remnants  of  it,  and  we  detect  it  by  a  certain  stain 
in  the  fibre. 

The  anxiety  to  retain  every  particle  of  a  precious  piece 


222  OLD   VIOLINS. 

of  wood  is  seen  in  the  subtle  and   delicate  patching   and 

repatching  of  backs  and  bellies.     The  seams  are 
166. 

RARE      only  discoverable  by  a  microscope,  so  perfect  is 
PROPERTIES.  the    cabinet    work       How    different    from   the 

modern  maker  at  Madrid,  whom  TARISIO  relates  as  having 
to  repair  a  damaged  Stradivarius,  and,  finding  the  belly 
cracked,  sent  it  home  with  a  brand  new  one  of  his  own 
manufacture ! 

The  properties  of  fine  violin  wood  are  very  mysterious. 
Only  to  be  surrounded  by  a  selection  of  fine  violins  is  an 
experience  which  cannot  be  forgotten.  Sit  in  the  room, 
with  them  with  your  eyes  shut,  and,  although  you  may 
not  touch  one  of  them,  you  will  soon  be  aware  of  ghostly 
presences. 

When  I  was  preparing  this  Royal  Institution  lecture,  I 
sat  alone  in  my  study  the  night  before,  surrounded  by 

that  matchless  collection  of  instruments  which  it 
167. 
A  RARE     was  my  good  fortune  to  exhibit  the  next  evening 

N'  in  Albemarle  Street,  and  the  chief  features  of 
which  I  desire  here  to  place  on  record.  Such  a  series  of 
types,  from  1520  to  1740,  has  seldom  been  seen  together. 
The  violins  weighed  but  a  few  ounces  apiece,  and  were 
worth  thousands  of  pounds  in  value.  My  doors  were  locked ; 
no  one  but  myself  had  access  to  that  treasure  house ;  the 
room  was  kept  to  an  even  temperature  night  and  day,  and 
011  the  floor  in  along  row,  placed  chronologically.,  lay  these 


A  BARE  COLLECTION.  223 

mystic  arrangements  in  pine  and  sycamore,  which  were 
known  to  imprison  the  true  souls  of  Brescia  and  Cremona. 

First  a  Duiffoprugcar  of  fabulous  antiquity,  about  1530, 
lent  by  MB.  HILL  ;  a  Gaspar  di  Salo  tenor  of  old  Brescia, 
lent  by  MR.  HART;  a  Maggini, DE  BERIOT'S  favourite  maker 
(also  Brescia),  lent  by  MR.  ENTHOVEN;  an  Andreas  Guar- 
nerius  (my  own) ;  Nicolas  Amati  (Cremona),  MR.  TYSSEN 
AMHERST,  M.P. ;  a  violin  of  the  Steiner  (German)  school, 
CAPTAIN  CHAMPION;  a  Stradivarius,  the  property  of  the 
late  EMPEROR  ALEXANDER  II.  of  Russia,  lent  me  by  His 
Royal  Highness  the  DUKE  OP  EDINBURGH  ;  another  fine 
Stradivarius,  also  lent  me  by  His  Royal  Highness;  a  fine 
Joseph  Guarnerius  (Cremona),  lent  by  MR.  HART  ;  my  own 
labelled  Stradivarius,  formerly  the  property  of  COLONEL 
NEWBERRY  ;  a  magnificent  Venetian  violoncello,  a  Montag- 
nana  in  exquisite  condition;  a  noble  Gaspar  double-bass, 
found  in  the  bedroom  of  the  late  TARISIO,  along  with  his 
dead  body  and  the  Messie  violin  and  other  priceless  gems. 

On  the  following  night,  the  South  Kensington  added  to 
my  store  DRAGONETTI'S  monster  double-bass,  some  exquisite 
ancient  viols  of  the  fifteenth  and  sixteenth  centuries,  and 
MR.  ADAMS  lent  me  the  Dolphin  Stradivarius  for  which  he 
gave  £600. 

In  the  silence  of  the  night  the  room  seemed  full  of  whis- 
pers and  hollow  rustlings.  I  could  not  cough  or  move 
without  these  ghostly  voices  answering  me,  as  from  the 
catacombs  of  the  sixteenth  and  seventeenth  centuries.  Even. 


224  OLD   VIOLINS. 

the  old  seasoned  backs  and  bellies  of  unstrung  violins  are 
full  of  the  strangest  echoes,  and  MR.  HILL,  the  violin-maker^ 
tells  me  that  as  he  sits  in  his  work-room,  where  old  violin 
carcases  are  piled  in  hundreds  on  shelves  and  cupboards 
pell-mell,  ribs,  bellies,  and  backs,  he  constantly  hears  them 
muttering  and  humming  to  themselves,  in  answer  to  his 
tools,  the  stroke  of  his  hamm2r,  the  sound  of  his  voice. 

Let  us  now  look  at  the  violin  anatomically.  It  is  a 
miracle  of  construction,  and  as  it  can  be  taken  to  pieces,  put 

together,  patched,  and  indefinitely  repaired,  it  is 
168. 

VIOLIN  almost  indestructible.  It  is,  as  one  may  say,  as 
light  as  a  feather  and  as  strong  as  a  horse.  It  is 
composed  of  fifty-eight  or  seventy  pieces  of  wood.  Wood 
about  as  thick  as  a  half-crown,  by  exquisite  adjustments 
of  parts  and  distribution  of  strain,  resists  for  several  centuries 
an  enormous  pressure.  The  Belly  of  soft  deal,  the  Back  of 
hard  sycamore,  are  united  by  six  sycamore  ribs,  supported 
by  twelve  blocks  with  linings. 

It  appears  that  the  quick  vibrations  of  the  hard  wood, 
married  to  the  slower  sound-waves  of  the  soft,  produce  the 
mellow  but  reedy  timbre  of  the  good  violin.  If  all  the  wood 
were  hard,  you  would  get  the  tone  light  and  metallic ;  if  all 
soft,  it  would  be  muffled  and  tubby. 

There  is  every  conceivable  variety  of  fibre  both  in  hard  and 
soft  wood.  The  thickness  of  back  and  belly  is  not  uniform; 
each  should  be  thicker  towards  the  middle.  But  how  thick, 


THE  SOUND  BAR.  225 

and  shaved  thin  in  what  proportions  towards  the  sides  ? 
The  cunning  workman  alone  knows.  As  a  rule,  if  the 
wood  be  hard  he  will  cut  it  thin;  if  soft,  thick;  but 
how  thin  and  how  thick,  and  exactly  where,  is  nowhere 
writ  down,  nor  can  be,  because  nowhere  for  handy  refer- 
ence are  recorded  the  densities  of  all  pine  and  pear  and 
sycamore  and  maple  planks  that  have  or  shall  come  into 
the  maker's  hands. 

The    Sound-bar    is    a     strip     of    pine    wood     running 

obliquely  under  the  left  foot  of  the  bridge.     It   not   only 

strengthens  the  belly  for  the  prodigious  pressure 

J.UJ* 

THE  of  the  four  strings,  whose  direction  it  is  made 
**  to  follow,  for  vibrational  reasons,  but  it  is  the 
nervous  system  of  the  violin.  It  has  to  be  cut  and  adjusted 
to  the  whole  framework;  a  slight  mistake  in  position,  a 
looseness,  an  inequality  or  roughness  of  finish,  will  produce 
that  hollow  teeth-on-edge  growl  called  the  "wolf." 

It  takes  the  greatest  cunning  and  a  life  of  practical 
study  to  know  how  long,  how  thick,  and  exactly  where 
the  sound-bar  should  be  in  each  instrument.  The  health 
and  morale  of  many  an  old  violin  has  been  impaired  by 
its  nervous  system  being  ignorantly  tampered  with.  Every 
old  violin,  with  the  exception  of  the  "  Pucelle/'  has  had 
its  sound-bar  replaced,  or  it  would  never  have  endured 
the  increased  tightness  of  strings  brought  in  with  our 
modern  pitch.  Many  good  forgeries  have  thus  been 

15 


226  OLD   VIOLINS. 

exposed,  for  in  taking  the  reputed  Stradivarius  to  pieces, 
the  rough  clumsy  work  inside,  contrasting  with  the  ex- 
quisite finish  of  the  old  masters,  betrays  at  once  the 
coarseness  of  a  body  that  never  really  held  the  soul  of 
a  Cremona. 

The  Sound-post,  a  little  pine  prop  like  a  short  bit  of 
cedar  pencil,  is  the  soul  of  the  violin.  It  is  placed  up- 
right inside,  about  one-eighth  of  an  inch  to  the 
TOE  back  of  the  right  foot  of  the  bridge,  and  through 
'T'  it  pass  all  the  heart-throbs  or  vibrations  gene- 
rated between  the  back  and  the  belly.  There  the  short 
waves  and  the  long  waves  meet  and  mingle.  It  is  the 
material  throbbing  centre  of  that  pulsating  air  column, 
defined  by  the  walls  of  the  violin,  but  propagating  those 
mystic  sound-waves  that  ripple  forth  in  sweetness  upon 
ten  thousand  ears. 

Days  and  weeks  may  be  spent  on-  the  adjustment  of  this 
tiny  sound-post.  Its  position  exhausts  the  patience  of  the 
repairer,  and  makes  the  joy  or  the  misery  of  the  player. 
As  a  rough  general  rule,  the  high-built  violin  will  take  it 
nearer  the  bridge  than  the  low-built,  and  a  few  experiments 
will  at  once  show  the  relation  of  the  "  soul "  to  tightness, 
mellowness,  or  intensity  of  sound.  For  the  amateur  there 
is  but  one  motto,  "  Leave  well  alone." 

The  prodigious  strain  of  the  strings  is  resisted  first  by  the

sound-post,  and  back*  Many  people,  on  observing  the 
obvious  join  between  the  n^ck  and  the  head  of  old  violins, 
fancy  that  the  head  is  not  the  original.  It  as  the  neck  that 
is  new.  All  the  necks  of  old  violins  have  thus  been 
lengthened,  and  the  old  heads  refixed,  for  the  simple  reason 
that  CORELLI'S  finger-board  will  not"  do  for  PAGANINI,  and 
mightier  execution  requires  an  ampler  field  for  its  eccentric 
excursions. 

The  Scroll,  or  head,  fitted  with  its  four  simple  screws  of 

ebony,  box,  or  rosewood,  is  the  physiognomy  of  the  violin. 

At    first    all  fiddle-heads   look  alike — as   do  all 

pug-dogs,  or  all  negroes,  and,  indeed,  England. 

THE    SCROLL.  r 

Wales,  Italy,  Holland,  and  most  other  countries 
have  their  general  faces,  so  have  violins, — but  a  practised 
eye  sees  the  difference  at  a  glance.  Look  for  half-an-hour 
every  day  at  a  late  Joseph  Guarnerius,  an  early  Nicolas 
Amati,  and  a  grand  pattern  Strad.,  and  you  will  be  surprised 
that  you  could  ever  have  confounded  their  forms.  What  is 
called  the  "  throwing "  of  the  scroll  betrays  the  master's 
style  like  handwriting,  and  he  lays  down  his  type  in  every 
curve,  groove,  and  outline.  A  keen  eye  can  almost  see  the 
favourite  tool  he  worked  with,  and  how  his  hand  went.

228  OLD   VIOLINS. 

These  subtleties  are  like  the  painter's  "touch,"  they  can 
hardly  be  imitated  so  as  to  deceive  one  who  has  mastered 
the  individual  work  of  the  great  makers. 

The  ebony  finger-board  must  be  nicely  fitted,  as  also  the 
neck,  to  the  hand  of  the  player,  on  its  even  smoothness  and 
true  curve  depends  the  correct  stopping  of  the 
TIIE  FINGER-  notes.  You  cannot,  for  instance,  stop  fifths  in 
KD'  tune  on  a  rough  or  uneven  finger-board.  The 
button  to  which  the  tail-piece  is  fastened  is  full  of  style, 
and  not,  like  the  pegs,  a  thing  to  be  dropped  and  changed 
at  will ;  it  is  a  critical  part  of  the  violin,  takes  a  good  third 
of  the  leverage  of  the  whole  strain,  is  fixed  like  a  vice, 
rooted  in  the  very  adamant  of  the  wood,  carefully  finished, 
and  cut  round,  pointed,  or  flat,  according  to  the  taste  of 
the  maker. 

The  Purfling,  more  or  less  deeply  embedded,  emphasizes 

the   outline  of  the  violin.      It  is  composed  of  three  thin 

strips  of  wood,  ebony,  sometimes  whalebone,  the 

J.  i  ^. 

THE  centre  of  two  white  strips;  it  is  often  more  or 
'  less  embedded,  and  betrays  the  workman's  taste 
and  skill.  The  double  purfling  and  purfling  in  eccentric 
patterns  of  some  of  the  old  violins  is  very  quaint,  but  a 
doubtful  adjunct  to  the  tone.  But,  strange  to  say,  prior  to 
1600,  appearances  were  more  thought  of  than  tone.  The 
old  guitars  and  viols  are  often  so  profusely  carved  or  inlaid 


THE  VARNISH.  229 

with  tortoiseshell,  ivory,  and  silver,  that  they  have  but  little 
sound,  and  that  bad.  I  do  not  think  that  this  has  ever 
been  noticed  before,  but  it  is  undoubtedly  a  fact  that  atten- 
tion to  tone  only  dates  from  the  rise  of  the  violin  proper 
in  the  sixteenth  century,  and  is,  in  fact,  coincident  with 
the  rise  of  the  art  of  modern  music. 

I  come  now  to  the  Cremona  varnish.     What  is  it  ?    About 

1760  it  disappeared,  and  never  reappeared.     All  the  Cre- 

monas  have  it.     Was  it  a  gum  or  an  oil,  or  a 

distillation  from  some  plant,  or  some   chemical 

THE  VAKNISD. 

once  largely  in  use  and  superseded,  as  the  old 
oil  lamps  have  gone  out  before  gas  and  paraffine?  How 
was  it  mixed  ?  Is  the  recipe  lost  ?  No  one  seems  to  be 
able  to  answer  these  questions  definitely.  There  it  lies 
like  sunlit  water,  mellow,  soft,  rich ;  varying  in  colour 
— golden,  orange,  or  pale  red  tint  on  the  Guarnerius ! 
rich  gold,  deep  orange,  or  light  red  on  the  Stradivarius 
back — and  when  it  rubs  softly  away  rather  than  chips  off 
hardly,  like  the  German  and  French  imitations,  it  leaves 
the  wood  seasoned,  impregnated,  and  fit  to  resist  heat,  cold, 
and  the  all-destroying  worm  for  ages.  MR.  CHARLES 
READS  gives  one  account  of  the  matter.  He  thinks  the 
wood,  cut  in  winter,  varnished  in  the  hot  summer  months, 
was  first  bathed  several  times  in  oil;  thus,  he  says, 
were  the  "  pores  of  the  wood  filled,  and  the  grain  shown 
up."  The  oil  held  in  solution  some  clear  gum.  "Then 


230  OLD  VIOLINS. 

upon  this  oil  varnish,  when  dry,  was  laid  some  heterogeneous 
varnish,  namely  a  solution  in  spirit  of  some  sovereign,  high- 
coloured,  pellucid,  and,  above  all,  tender  gum."  These  gums 
were  reddish  yellow  and  yellowish  red,  and  are  accredited 
with  colouring  the  varnish.  On  the  other  hand,  it  must  be 
stated  that,  although  the  difficulties  in  the  amber  theory  are 
great,  Mr.  PERKINS,  the  eminent  chemist,  has  discovered 
amber  in  the  varnish  of  JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS,  and  he  believes 
the  colouring  to  be  derived  from  a  herb  common  through- 
out Piedmont,  and,  following  out  his  conviction,  MR. 
PERKINS  has  made  a  varnish  which  certainly  does  resemble 
very  closely  the  Cremonese  hue  and  gloss.  DOD,  who  died 
in  1830,  professed  to  have  got  the  Cremona  recipe,  and 
whilst  employing  JOHN  LOTT  and  BERNARD  FENDT  to  make 
his  violins,  always  varnished  them  himself;  and,  indeed,  his 
varnish  is  very  superior,  and  his  violins  are  highly  prized ; 
but  perhaps  in  a  general  description  like  this  to  discuss 
further  the  varnish  theory  would  be  superfluous. 

The  Bridge  of  the  violin  is  to  many  a  true  Asses'  Bridge ; 

you  may  try  and  try  again,  and  its  true  position  will  still 

be   represented  by   an   unknown  x.     It   is   but

of  the  finger-board  and  lifts  the  strain  of  the  four  strings. 
The  bridge  is  movable ;  but  it  is  so  important  and  all- 
essential  to  the  propagation  of  any  sound  at  all,  that  it 
may  be  called  the  wife  of  the  violin.  All  old  violins  have 
had  many  bridges  in  their  time,  but  there  is  no  reason 
why  the  union,  if  happy,  should  not  last  for  forty  or  fifty 
years.  A  perfectly  harmonious  marriage  is  as  rare  between 
violins  and  their  bridges  as  it  is  between  men  and  women, 
though  in  either  case  there  is  a  considerable  margin  for  the 
gradual  adjustment  of  temperaments.  Although  the  old 
violin  is  very  capricious  in  his  choice,  and  often  remains  a 
widowrer  for  years,  he  does  not  object  to  elderly  bridges,  and 
when  he  finds  one  he  can  get  on  with,  will  obstinately  resent 
any  rash  interference  with  the  harmony  of  his  domestic 
arrangements. 

This  is  a  point  not  nearly  enough  considered  even  by 

wise  violin  doctors  and  repairers.     The  heartless  substitu-

companion.  I  do  not  believe  in  bridges  being  worn  out. 
After  a  year  or  two  the  hard  box-fibre  yields  very  little 
under  the  cutting  of  the  strings;  there  is  a  considerable 
margin  for  the  shifting  of  the  strings,  and  no  string  but  the 
first  will  materially  grind.  Rather  than  change  so  precious 
a  thing  as  a  congenial  partner,  glue,  mend,  patch,  repair  her, 
just  as  you  would  her  priceless  old  husband ;  if  he  is  in  the 
prime  of  life  at  about  one  hundred  and  fifty,  she  may  well 
be  a  little  made  up  at  sixty  or  seventy.  Thirty  years  ago 
my  Stradivarius,  1712,  grand  pattern,  came  by  gift  into 
my  possession.  I  soon  found  it  did  not  get  on  with  its 
bridge — a  new,  sappy,  crude,  thick  thing,  which  seemed 
to  choke  and  turn  sour  its  mellow  vibrations.  About  that 
time  I  received  the  present  of  a  very  old  bridge  from  the 
violin  of  F.  CRAMER.  It  was  delicate,  exquisitely  finished, 
evidently  very  old.  I  thought  its  build  too  slight,  but  clapped 
it  on  at  once,  and  the  old  violin  waked  as  out  of  a  long  sleep, 
like  a  giant  refreshed  with  wine.  It  was  then  some  time 
before  I  found  exactly  the  right  place,  and  for  several  years, 
on  and  off,  I  fidgeted  about  with  the  bridge.  One  day,  iu 
shifting  it,  I  snapped  it ;  but  after  trying  other  bridges,  I 
glued  the  old  one  together,  and  once  more  the  violin  found 
its  old  sweetness  and  solace.  Years  passed,  I  left  off  playing, 
the  Strad.  lay  neglected,  got  damp,  and  its  joints  loosened. 
I  lent  it  to  a  cunning  doctor;  he  "fixed  it  up"  again,  but 
sent  it  back  with  a  new  bridge,  and  sounding — well,  like  files 
and  vinegar !  I  recovered  the  old  bridge  that  he  declared

only  in  his  one  hundred  arid  seventy-first  year,  he  received 
his  lost  wife  with  effusion,  and  I  think  the  harmony  made 
by  the  two  was  never  more  perfect  than  it  is  now.  Truly

A  -word  about  violin  strings.     The  positive  thickness  of 
the  strings  depends  upon  the   temperament  and   build   o£ 

the  violin,  providing  that  the  player's  fingers  are 

178. 

VIOLIN  equal  to  thick  or  thin  strings.  Thick  strings 
will  mellow  the  screaminess  of  a  Stainer — 
elicit  the  full  tone  of  a  Joseph  Guarnerius  or  grand  Strad., 
whilst  the  older  violins  of  Brescia,  and  even  the  sweet 
Nicolas  Amati,  will  work  better  with  thinner  strings; 
but  in  such  matters  the  player  must  come  to  the  best 
compromise  he  can  with  his  fingers  and  his  fiddle,  for 
the  finger  will  often  desire  a  thin  string  when  the  fiddle  cries 
out  for  a  thick  one.  New  violins  as  a  rule  will  take  thicker 
strings  than  the  fine  old  sensitives  of  the  sixteenth  or 
seventeenth  centuries.  Of  the  English,  French,  German, 
and  Italian  strings,  the  Italian  are  the  best ;  and  of  the 
Italian,  the  Roman  hard  and  brilliant,  a  little  rough,  and 
Neapolitan  smooth,  soft,  and  pale  are  preferred.  Paduans 
are  strong,  but  frequently  false.  Veronese  are  softer  and 
deeper  in  colour.  The  Germans  now  rank  next,  and  the 
white  smooth  Saxon  strings  are  good  substitutes  for,  but  no 
rivals  of,  the  Italians.  The  French  firsts  are  brittle,  the 


234  OLD   VIOLINS. 

Italian  strings  sound  well,  and  the  French  patent  fourth 
silver  string,  perfectly  smooth  and  shining,  is  preferred  by 
some  soloists  to  the  old  covered  fourth.  The  English  strings, 
of  a  dirty  green  and  yellow  colour,  are  very  strong,  and  good 
enough  for  hack  work  in  the  orchestra.  The  best  and 
strongest  strings  are  made  from  the  intestines  of  spring 
lambs  killed  in  September,  and  the  superiority  of  the  Italian 
over  others  is  explained  by  the  climate,  for  in  Italy  the  sun 
does  what  has  to  be  done  artificially  in  more  northern 
latitudes.

STRINGS.     at  high  prices.     In  string  selection  the   objects 

are  three: — 

1.  To    suit  the   constitution   of  your   instrument,    and 
choose  that   thickness  and   quality   of    string    which    will 
develop    tone    Avith    the     greatest     ease,    roundness,    and 
freedom. 

2.  To  choose  strings  which  will  give  good  fifths— a  matter 
sometimes   a  little   dependent   on   the  shape  of  your  own 
fingers  and  the  cut  of  your  finger-board,  but  also   controlled 
by  the  relative  thickness  of  your  strings. 

3.  To  avoid  false  strings — an  epidemic  which  rages  in- 
continently amongst  E  violin   strings — SPOHR'S   recipe   for 
detection  was  to  hold  the  string  between  the  fingers  and

thumbs,  and  if  when  he  set  it  vibrating  from  one  end  to  the 
other  only  two  lines  appeared,  he  decided  that  it  was  true ;  if 
a  third,  it  was  deemed  false.  Once  on,  however,  there  can 
never  be  any  doubt. 

It  is  only  necessary  to  glance  at  the  enormous  variety 
of  shapes  that  the  viol  tribe  has  assumed,  both  before 

and  after  the   creation  of  the  violin,  to  judge 

180. 

VIOLIN      of  the   inexhaustible  dominion  which  the   con- 

FASCINATION.  ,.  ,  •       j  .1         1 

ception  seems  to  have  exercised  over  the  human 
mind.  The  collector  who  cannot  play,  and  the  player  who 
cannot  collect,  are  alike  victims  of  this  mania  for  violins. 
Of  what  interest  can  they  be  to  the  collector,  who  keeps 
dozens  of  them,  unstrung  and  unmended,  in  cupboards  and 
cabinets,  and  shows  them  about  to  his  bewildered  guests 
like  old  pots  or  enamels  ? 

Look  at  a  fine  specimen  or  two,  on  and  off,  when  you 
have  the  chance,  and  the  mystery  may  possibly  dawn  upon 
you  too. 

There,  in  a  small  compass,  lies  before  you  such  a  wonder 
of  simplicity,  subtlety,  variety,  and  strength  as  perhaps  no 
other  object  of  equal  dimensions  can  possess.  The  eye  is 
arrested  by  the  amber  gloss  and  glow  of  the  varnish ;  the 
infinite  grace  of  the  multitudinous  curves;  the  surface,  which 
is  nowhere  flat,  but  ever  in  flowing  lines,  sunlit  hollows  of 
miniature  hills  and  vales,  irregular,  like  the  fine  surface  of  a 
perfectly  healthy  human  body;  its  gentle  mounds  and 


236  OLD   VIOLINS. 

depressions  would  almost  make  us  believe  that  there  is  a 
whole  underlying  system  of  muscle — a  very  living  organism, 
to  account  for  such  subtle  yet  harmonious  irregularity  of 
surface.  It  is  positively  alive  with  swelling  and  undulating 
grace. 

Then  the  eye  follows  with  unabating  ardour  the  outline — 
dipping  in  here  or  bulging  there — in  segments  of  what  look 
like  an  oval  or  a  circle,  but  which  are  never  any  part  of  an 
oval  or  a  circle — but  something  drawn  unmechanically  like  a 
Greek  frieze — after  the  vision  of  an  inward  grace. 

Its  voice  may  be  as  fair  as  its  form  and  finish ;  yet  un- 
strung and  silent,  more  truly  can  it  be  said  of  a  violin  than 
of  any  human  creature,  that  "  it  is  a  thing  of  beauty  and  a 
joy  for  ever/'  for  its  beauty  grows  with  the  mellowness  of 
age ;  its  voice  is  sweeter  as  the  centuries  roll  on,  and  its 
physical  frame  appears  to  be  almost  indestructible. 

And  the  player — who  is  not  always  a  judge  of  a  genuine 
violin,  but  goes  by  the  sound  qualities  which  suit  him — he 
naturally  adores  what  is,  within  its  limits,  scientifically  the 
most  perfect  of  all  instruments. 

The  four  strings,  of  course,  limit  and  define  its  harmonic 
resources — in  combination  and  viewed  collectively  in  the 
quartet  alone  is  it  able  to  compass  the  extended  develop- 
ments of  harmony  in  bass,  tenor,  and  treble  clef,  but  as  a 
tone-producing  instrument  it  has  no  rival.  It  possesses 
accent  combined  with  sustained  and  modified  tone.  The 
piano  has  accent,  but  little  sustained  and  no  modified  tone ; 


VIOLIN  HISTORY.  237 

the  organ  has  accent,  and  sustained,  but  in  a  very  imperfect 
sense,  modified  tone ;  the  violin  possesses  in  perfection  all 
three.  With  the  stroke  of  the  bow  comes  every  degree  of 
accent ;  with  the  drawing  and  skilful  sostenuto  of  up  and 
down  bowings  the  notes  are  indefinitely  sustained  to  a  degree 
far  exceeding  the  capacity  of  the  human  lungs  ;  whilst  every 
pulse  of  emotion  is  through  the  pressure  of  the  finger 
communicated  to  the  vibrating  string,  and  the  tone  trembles, 
shivers,  thrills,  or  assumes  a  hard,  rigid  quality,  passing  at 
will  from  the  variety  of  a  whisper  to  a  very  roar  or  scream 
of  agony  or  delight. 

Can  the  soul  of  the  musician  fail  to  yield  loving  or  utter 
allegiance  to  the  sovereign  power  of  the  violin,  which  is  so 
willing  and  ideal  a  minister  of  his  subtlest  inspirations — equal 
to  the  human  voice  in  sensibility  and  expression,  and  far 
superior  to  it  in  compass,  execution,  variety,  and  durability  ? 

The  violin  is  not  an  invention,  it  is  a  growth.  It  is  the 
survival  of  the  fittest.  The  undeveloped  elements  of  the 

genus  Viol,  out  of  which  grew  the  species  Violin, 
181. 
VIOLIN      are  to  be  found  latent  in  the  rebek,  the  crowth, 

and  the  rotta.  In  the  struggle  for  existence 
each  succumbed,  leaving  only  its  useful  and  vital  elements 
to  be  recombined. 

The  rebek  bequeathed  its  rounded  form  pierced  in  the 
belly  with  two  sound-holes,  the  bridge,  tail-piece,  screw- 
box,  doubtless  a  sound-post,  and  that  odd  crook  of  a  violin- 


238  OLD   VIOLINS. 

bow  often  seen  in  the  hands  of  stone  angels  in  cathedrals  of 
the  fourteenth  century. 

The  crowth  gives  the  all-important  hint  of  the  two  vibrat- 
ing boards  joined  by  ribs;  whilst  from  the  rotta,  or  guitar 
tribe,  comes  the  lower  end,  and  the  upper  end  comes  from 
the  rebek — the  elongated  neck  separate  from  the  body,  the 
frets,  which  for  one  hundred  and  fifty  years  delayed  the 
advent  of  the  violin,  and  the  two  concave  side-curves  so 
needful  for  the  manipulation  of  the  bow.  Music  and  Morals 
contains  diagrams  illustrating  the  genesis  of  the  violin. 

This  Viol — of  no  particular  size  or  settled  shape,  or 
rather  of  all  shapes  and  sizes,  usually  with  a  flat  back  and 
round  belly — was  made  in  great  profusion  in  the  thirteenth 
and  fourteenth  centuries.  Anyone  who  will  glance  at  the 
case  of  ancient  viols  in  the  South  Kensington  Museum  will 
be  surprised  at  the  fancy  and  fertility  of  form  displayed. 

There  was  the  Knee   Viol,   the  Bass  Viol,  the  Viol  di 

Gamba,  the  Violone,  and  the  Viol  d'Amore.     Some  of  these 

182.       were  inlaid  with  tortoisesheli  and  ivory,  others 

ELizA^TnAN  eloborately  carved  and  over-purfled — facts  most 

VIOLIN,  interesting  to  the  connoisseur,  and  marking  a 
period  when  cabinet-work  was  at  its  zenith  and  musical 
sound  in  its  infancy.  Sound  was  the  carver's  humble 
servant.  The  well-known  violin  given  by  QUEEN  ELIZABETH 
to  the  EARL  OF  LEICESTER,  riddled  through  and  through 
like  Ceylonese  furniture  or  a  Chinese  ivory  junk,  is  quite

absurd  as  a  sound  vehicle.  13  y  and  by  the  carver  and  fine 
cabinet-worker  would  have  to  place  all  the  treasures  of  their 
art  at  the  disposal  of  music,  and  would  not  be  allowed  one 
join,  or  purfle,  or  pattern  inimical  to  tone.  I  shall  develop 
these  hints  later. 

The  variety  and  number  of  strings  in  these  old  Viols  is 
often  childish.     It  looks  like   (what  it  was)   playing  with 

newly-discovered   resources — the   real   wealth  of 
183. 
THE  KCMBEE  which  it  took  two  hundred  years  more  to  learn. 

s'  If  in  bowed  instruments  you  have  more  strings 
than  fingers  the  hand  with  difficulty  overlays  them — of 
course  in  the  guitar  tribe  the  work  is  divided  between  ten 
fingers  instead  of  four.  In  the  Viol  d' Am  ore  an  odd 
attempt  was  made  to  improve  the  timbre  by  a  set  of  steel 
wires  tuned  sympathetically,  and  running  beneath  the  gut 
strings.  It  took  two  hundred  years  to  convince  people  that 
the  timbre  lay  with  the  wood,  not  the  wires;  nor  could  the 
old  masters  see  that  tone  would  only  arrive  with  an  extended 
study  in  the  properties  of  wood  and  a  radical  change  of  model. 

I  showed  some  years  ago  in  the  Contemporary  Review 
what  it  is  difficult  to  trace  step  by  step,  but  what  we  know 

must  have   been  the  history  of  the  violin  tribe 
184 
VIOLIN     in   its  earlier  stages.     I   placed   the  lesson  for

the    eye — showing    how    the    smaller   viois    or 
violettes  of  the   seventeenth  century  fell  into  the  violins, 


240  OLD   VIOLINS. 

the  larger  ones  into  the  Tenor,  and  the  Viol  di  Gambas 
into  the  Violoncello.  The  double-bass,  a  genuine  Viol, 
and  the  only  one  which  retains  its  flat  back,  was  made 
extensively  by  GASPAR  DI  SALO,  and  has  been  entirely 
adopted  by  the  modern  orchestra;  indeed  -whilst  innumerable 
other  large  viols  are  merely  preserved  as  curiosities,  the 
double-bass  retains  its  ancient  type,  and  in  the  BEETHOVEN 
and  WAGNERIAN  orchestra  exercises  an  influence  and  promi- 
nence second  only  to  the  violin  itself. 

As  we  look  intently  at  the  confused  nebula?  of  sixteenth- 
century  viols,  we  notice  the  modest  constellation  of  the 
violins  slowly  detaching  itself  from  that  host  of  tubby  stars 
which  it  was  soon  destined  to  supersede  for  ever.  The 
rise  of  the  violin  tribe — by  which  of  course  I  mean 
the  violin,  tenor,  violoncello,  and  double  bass — is,  in  fact, 
coincident  with  the  rise  of  modern  music.  A  definite  art 
required  a  definite  instrument — more  mechanical,  more 
constant,  more  reliable  than  the  human  voice. 

Between  CARISSIMI,  1570,  and  MONTEVEIIDE,  1672,  the 

foundations  of  the  art  of  modern  music  were  laid  by  the 

185.       discovery  of  the  perfect  cadence  and  the  modern

about  two  hundred  years  seemed  to  leave  nothing  new  to

schools,  and  the  exigencies  of  the  new  musical 
art.  The  Procrustean  bed  upon  which  the  poor  viols  of 
the  period  were  now  stretched  forms  one  of  the  most 
interesting  and  instructive  episodes  in  the  histpry  of  the 
art.  Viol  di  Gambas  were  converted  into  violoncellos, 
the  viollettes  enlarged  and  patched  into  violins,  viols  cut 
down  —  sadly,  brutally  cut  down  —  into  tenors.  No  lover 
of  the  art  could  help  dropping  a  tear  over  a  match- 
less specimen  of  LINARELLI  in  1400-1500,  exhibited  at 
South  Kensington,  which  had  been  so  cut  down  ;  and  I 
could  point  to  one  or  two  viols  now  passing  as  Amati 
tenors  which  have  received  similar  treatment  and  strut  in 
borrowed  plumes.  The  cabinet  work  is  often  so  fine  that 
only  an  experienced  eye  with  the  aid  of  a  microscope  can 
discern  the  joins  and  refittings  beneath  the  new  wash  of 
dirty-brown  varnish  habitually  used  to  conceal  the  deed. 
But  all  this  only  proves  the  imperative  fitness  of  a  new 
combination.  "We  have  at  last  arrived  at  the  modern  violin, 
and  the  reason  of  its  natural  supremacy.  Its  right  to 
survive  is  clearly  to  be  found  in  its  perfect  ministry  to

242  OLD  VIOLINS. 

the  art  of  modern  music.  I  have  dwelt  upon  its  compass, 
which  is  to  all  intents  and  purposes  unlimited,  and  its  other 
especial  merits  are  not  far  to  seek. 

The  number  and  the  tension  of  the  strings  is  the  happy 
mean  between  the  one  or  two  strings  of  the  Japanese  or 

Persian  fiddle  and  the  many-stringed  viol.     Add 
187. 

FOUR  a  fifth  string  to  the  violin  and  the  tension  is 
not  only  too  great,  but  unnecessary,  for  the  E 
string  will  yield  sound  as  shrill  as  the  human  ear  can  bear; 
add  a  string  on  the  other  side,  and  the  tension  will  be  too 
feeble  to  yield  a  good  quality  of  sound.  And  similar 
remarks  may  apply  to  the  tenor,  violoncello,  and  double- 
bass  ;  each  is  sufficient  and  complete,  and  where  it  ends  its 
companion  steps  in  to  continue  the  varied  function. 

Each  is  distinct  and  full  of  character ;  the  charm  of 
variety  is  constitutionally  involved.  In  each  the  strings  are 
of  different  thicknesses,  with  different  tensions,  acting  upon 
different  vibrating  surfaces,  enclosing  different-sized  columns 
of  air. 

We  pause  for  a  moment  with  feelings  of  profound  satis- 
faction and  survey  the  violin  kingdom  of  the  past.  This 
fourfold  valuable  selection — this  crowning  of  violin,  tenor, 
violoncello,  and  double-bass — has  not  been  the  work  of  any 
one  man  or  age,  or  even  country  ;  it  is  the  inexorable, 
empirical,  yet  logic-al  outcome  or  evolution  of  thousands  of 
experiments  made  in  France,  Germany,  and  Italy,  by 


THE  ITALIAN  SCHOOLS,  1520-17  GO.  243 

hundreds  of  workers,  extending  over  centuries  of  time,  and 
resulting  in  the  survival  of  the  fittest. 

Although  DUIFFOPRUGCAR  was  certainly  not  an  Italian, 
yet,  coming  from  the  Tyrol,  he  settled  at  Bologna,  after- 
188.       "wards  migrating  to  Lyons,  in  France,  where  he

DUIFFOPRUGCAR  ever  made  violins,  but  there  is  no  reason  for 
doubting  that  PALESTRINA  played  on  a  Duiffoprugcar  violin, 
which  is  said  to  have  borne  this  couplet  :  — 

Viva  fui  in  sylvis,  sum  dura  occisa  securi 
Dum  vixi  tacui  mortua  dulce  cauo. 

There  is,  besides,  a  large-sized  violin  bearing  date  1539,  said 
to  be  the  only  extant  specimen;  but  lately,  MR.  HILL 
obtained  from  Lyons  a  very  excellent  and  perfect  specimen, 
which  he  believed  to  be  an  undoubted  Duiffoprugcar,  and 
which  I  exhibited  at  the  Royal  Institution.  It  is  quaint, 
undecided,  and  antique  in  outline,  the  S's  curiously  cut,  and 
the  back  over-purfled.  When  opened  it  was  found  backed 
with  old  canvas  and  oddly  primitive  in  construction.  It 
ought  to  be  put  under  a  glass-case  in  the  South  Kensington 
Museum.  Indeed  it  is  incredible,  but  true,  that  not  a  single 
museum  in  Europe  that  I  know  of  has  thought  it  worth 
while  to  procure  specimens  of  the  violin  art  from  DUIFFO- 
TRUGCAR  to  BERGONZI.

But  it  is  not  to  Bologna  or  Lyons,  but  to  Brescia,  that 
we  must  look  for  the  rise  of  the  first  great  violin  school. 

Note  first  GASPAR  DI  SALO,  who  worked  between  1550 

and    1612.      It   has   been   my   privilege   to  live   for  some

CASPAR   DI 

SALO.  from  the  old  viol  type,  which  GASPAR  doubtless 
continued  to  make.  The  head  is  charmingly  long  and  queer 
and  antique.  The  idea  of  putting  character  and  great  finish 
into  the  scroll  belongs  to  a  later  period.  Human  and 
animal  heads  were  no  doubt  common  enough  in  the  place  of 
a  scroll ;  but  they  belong  to  the  carving,  cabinet-decoration, 
ovcr-purfling  period,  when  tone  was  second  to  ornament. 

As  the  great  tone  period  approached,  carving  for  the  sake 
of  carving   was   abandoned ;    ornament   was  kept   simple, 

subordinate,  but  full  of  finish  and  avowedly  the 
190. 
VIOLIN      mark   of  sign-manual.      The  exquisite,   yet   un- 

N0'  pretending  and  simple,  scrolls  of  AMATI  and 
STRADIVARIUS  arose  along  with  the  rise  of  violin  tone.  But 
why  such  finish,  such  evident  intention  to  be  noticed,  such 
distinct  cachet  and  appeal  to  the  eye?  I  think  this  is  the 
natural  explanation.  As  the  art  of  violin-playing  improved, 
violinists  took  to  holding  their  fiddles  well  up,  and  to 
playing  without  notes;  the  head  of  the  violin  was  thus 


VIOLIN  CARVING.  245 

the  first  thing  which  caught  the  eye ;  whereas  before  there 
is  every  reason  to  believe  that  the  old  viol  players  held  their 
instruments  down,  like  bad  orchestral  players  now,  with 
violin  scroll  or  head  almost  between  their  knees  and  unseen. 
That  head  might,  indeed,  be  a  finely-carved  human  head ; 
but,  if  so,  it  could  only  be  seen  as  an  ornament  when  the 
violin  was  hanging  up ;  it  could  only  be  seen,  if  at  all, 
upside  down  when  the  violin  was  being  played.  Look  at  all 
old  violins;  they  are  rubbed  by  the  beard  on  both  sides. 
Now  we  never  place  the  chin  on  the  off-side — always  on  the 
in-side ;  but  if  a  man  has  to  crouch  in  dim  churches  over 
flickering  oil  lamps  and  scrape  old  chaunts,  he  will  get 
slovenly,  his  violin-head  will  droop  between  his  knees,  and 
his  chin  will  most  naturally  slip  over  the  tail-piece  and  lie 
on  the  off-side,  whilst  his  ear  reposes  on  the  tail-piece,  and 
the  top  of  his  violin  has  a  tendency  to  disappear  over  his 
left  shoulder  ! 

Compare  this  old  slovenly  method — inimical  to  tone,  to 
style,  to  execution,  and  to  grace — which  buried  the  scroll — 
with  the  noble,  upright  pose  of  JOACHIM  or  NERUDA  when 
playing,  where  the  scroll  is  constantly  thrown  up,  as  if  itself 
addressing  the  audience,  and  instead  of  looking  upside-down 
or  ungraceful,  as  would  a  human  or  animal  head  in  that 
position,  comes  out  towards  you  like  the  prow  of  an 
ancient  galley,  and  impresses  upon  the  eye,  with  every 
motion  of  the  player's  wrist,  its  fine  verve  and  individual 
character. 


246  OLD   VIOLINS. 

GASPAR  DI  SALO  may  almost  be  said  to  have  invented

GASPAR 

DESCRIBED,  doned  in  later  life,  is  surprising  in  tone,  con- 
sidering its  build,  which  is  generally  supposed  to  favour 
a  smothered  and  tubby  sound.  Although  the  first  and 
fourth  strings  are  rather  rough,  the  whole  is  very  sonorous 
and  fresh,  and  the  D  and  A  strings  very  rich  and  pure. 
We  must  not  look  for  the  finish  of  the  Amatis  at  this 
early  period.  The  build  of  this  early  Gaspar  is  round  and 
full,  both  in  back  and  belly,  and  the  chisel  has  gone  wrong 
more  than  once  in  the  back  grooving,  whilst  the  purfling  is 
not  good.  Probably  one  and  the  same  cunning  workman 
has  repaired  the  purfling  in  places,  patched  the  head,  and 
positively  mosaiced  the  worn-out  screw-box,  and,  alas ! 
carried  a  brown  varnish  over  several  parts  of  the  instrument, 
through  which  the  rich  golden  tints  of  GASPAU  still  peep, 
and  almost  dazzle  the  eye.  Still,  whoever  has  put  on  the 
new  neck  has  worshipped  at  the  shrine  of  old  GASPAR  ;  he 
has  made  his  purfling  a  little  too  good,  left  a  little  too  much 
of  his  glue  and  his  brown  varnish  ;  but  his  patched  head  is 
such  a  masterpiece,  such  care  and  labour  to  keep  every  line 
of  CASPAR — except  on  one  side  of  the  screw-box,  where  about 
two  inches  of  line  is  new — but  the  join  so  good  as  only 
to  be  seen  under  a  microscope. 

All  this,  when  one  lives  with  a  fiddle,  one  gets  to  notice

and  to  love,  whilst  the  uninitiated,  standing  by  in  bewilder- 
ment, may  well  feel  tempted  to  order  the  violin  and  the 
connoisseur  off  to  the  nearest  lunatic  asylum. 

MAGGINI  (GIOVANNI  PAOLO),  1590-1640,  of  Brescia,  fol- 
lowed GASPAR,  but  carried  farther  the  art  of  rich,  clear  tone. 
It  is  the  glory  of  the  Brescians  to  have  hit  upon 
this  secret,  lost  as  soon  as  found,  that  for  tone 

G.  F    MAGGINI. 

— good  round  tone— the  belly  and  back  must 
be  brought  down  flatter  upon  ribs  of  diminished  height. 
MAGGINI'S  violins,  though  lacking  in  some  of  the  quaint 
grace  of  GASPAR  (especially  his  double-basses),  approach  the 
perfected  Cremona  model  of  the  later  rather  than  the  earlier 
days ;  his  scroll  is  grooved  and  finished ;  his  sound-holes  are 
still  the  long  black-letter  SS ;  the  varnish  rich  brown  or 
yellow.  He  is  often  confounded  with  BARAK  NORMAN,  or, 
still  worse,  with  any  obscure  German  imitator  who  has 
chosen  to  a  little  over-purfle  and  inlay  his  back.  The 
Brescians  MARIANI,  VENTURINI,  BUDIANI,  MATEO  BENTE, 
cannot  further  be  alluded  to  here ;  in  time  they  will  all  be 
treasured  more  as  antiquities  than  as  tone  masters. 

The  hotter  suns  and  splendid   river   supplying  the  fine

the  churches  but  also  throughout  the  palaces  of  Italy. 
We  must  ever  view  that  central  square  of  Cremona,  where 
stood  the  Church  of  St.  Dominic,  with  feelings  of  the 
deepest  interest.  Standing  opposite  the  fa9ade  on  our 
right  hand  lies  the  house  of  the  AMATI  ;  there  worked 
ANDREW,  the  founder  of  the  school,  making,  in  1550,  close 
copies  of  the  Brescians,  GASPAR  and  MAGGINI. 

There    were    the    boys,     ANTHONY    and    JEROME,    who 

afterwards    made    jointly   those    violins    so   much    sought 

after ;  but  oddly  enough  reverted  to  the  tubbier 

94'       model,  and  over-grooved  the  sides  of  their  bellies 

TILS  JLMAT1. 

and  backs,  thinning  their  tone,  until  the  genius 
of  JEROME  discerned  the  error  and  reverted  to  the  Brescian 
type. 

Here  was  born  the  great  NICOLAS  AMATI,  1596-1G84, 
who  struck  out  his  own  model,  flattened,  and  in  his  best 
time  scarcely  retaining  a  trace  of  the  vicious  side-groove  of 
the  earlier  Amatis. 

On  the  same  work-bench,  as  students  in  the  school  of  the 
immortal  NICOLAS,  sat  ANDREW  GUARNERIUS  and  the  incom- 
parable STRADIVARIUS,  finishing  t"heir  master's  violins  and 
copying  for  years  his  various  models  with  supreme  skill  and 
docility. 

Almost  next   door,   probably  on  the   death  of  NICOLAS 
AMATI,  SIKADIVARIUS  set  up  Iris   shop,   opposite  the  west 


THE  GUAENEHII  AND.  STRADIVARIUS.       249 

front  of  tlie   big  church;   there  for  fifty  years   more   he 
195.        worked  with  uninterrupted  assiduity;  and  next 

KERn^o"  door  to  him  the  familJ  of  the  GUARNEIUI  had 
STRADIVARIUS.  their  work-rooms,  and  in  that  little  square  were 
all  the  finest  violins  made  in  the  short  space  of  about  one 
hundred  and  fifty  years.  The  body  of  STRADIVARIUS  lies 
in  ^the  Church  of  the  Rosary,  not  a  stone's-throw  from 
his  own  house ;  and  so  these  great  men  died,  and  were 
buried,  working  in  friendly  rivalry,  and  leaving  their  echoes 
to  roll  from  pole  to  pole. 

I  have  a  delicate  ANDREW  GUARNERIUS  of  1665,  which 
shows  admirably  the  transition  between  the  full  form  of  the 
earlier  Amatis  and  the  superior  flat  model  of  NICOLAS 
AMATI. 

It  was  made,  doubtless,  under  the  eye  of  NICOLAS,  and 
perhaps  criticised  by  STRADIVARIUS,  who  probably  worked  at 
the  same  bench  and  shared  ANDREW'S  glue-pot. 

In  my  ANDREW  GUARNERIUS  the  drooping  Brescian 
corners  have  vanished,  and  the  lower  angles  are  turned 
up  sharp ;  but  the  middle  lengths  fail  to  attain  the 
pleasantly  balanced  curves  and  the  graceful  upper  width 
and  freedom  of  MR.  AMHERST'S  later  Nicolas  Amati,  of 
1676,  a  true  gem,  despite  the  apparent  plainness  of  the 
back. 

ANDREW  GUARNERIUS  has  also  quite  got  rid  of  the  rough, 
coarse,  thick  Brescian  S,  which  was  always  ugly  and  too 
wide,  and  in  its  place  the  eye  is  rejoiced  to  find  a  lovely 


250  OLD  VIOLINS. 

and  delicately  rounded  S,  unlike  at  top  and  bottom,  but 
only  a  shade  less  graceful  than  the  freehand  \vriting  of 
NICOLAS  himself. 

The  great  NICOLAS    (1596-16P4)    began  to   change   his 
model,  reverting  to  the  later  Brescian  in  all  but  his  sound- 
holes  and  two  curves,  about  1625.     His  violins

THE  GREAT  increased  in  size,  and  would  have  increased  in 
power,  had  it  not  been  for  a  remnant  of  the 
early  Amati  side-grooving,  which  is  said  to  thin  the  tone. 
The  dip  from  the  foot  of  the  bridge  is  thought  to  be 
too  great,  but  the  upper  part  of  the  grand  pattern  is 
truly  noble.  Some  of  his  scrolls  have  been  criticised  as 
too  small  and  contracted,  but  there  is  nothing  of  this  in  a 
1676  specimen  before  me;  and  although  the  corners  are 
pointed  and  highly  elegant,  there  is  nothing  weak ;  yet  the 
whole  is  full  of  feminine  grace. 

The  varnish,  when  not  as  is  usual  rubbed  off,  inclines 
to  light  orange  with  clear  golden  tints.  The  tone  is  so 
sweet  and  sensitive  that  it  seems  to  leap  forth  before  the 
bow  has  touched  the  strings,  and  goes  on  like  a  bell  long 
after  the  bow  has  left  them.  To  a  fine  Joseph  Guarnerius 
you  have  sometimes  to  lay  siege  and  then  you  are  re- 
warded, but  the  Nicolas  Amati  is  won  almost  before  it 
is  wooed. 

The   incomparable   ANTONIUS  STKADIVARIUS,  or  STIIADI- 


STRADIVABIUS.  251 

VARI,  lived  between  1644-1737.  His  latest  known  violin 
bears  date  1736,  and  mentions  his  age,  ninety- 
two.  He  worked  without  haste  and  without

rest.  His  life  was  interrupted  only  by  the  siege 
of  Cremona  in  1702.  But  his  art  knew  no  politics,  and  the 
foreign  courts  of  Spain  and  France  were  quite  as  eager  to 
get  his  violins  as  the  G  OVERNOR  OF  CREMONA,  or  the  DUKE 
OF  MODENA. 

Up  to  about  1668  he  was  simply  the  apprentice  of 
NICOLAS  ;  we  find  scrolls  and  sound-holes  cut  by  the  pupil 
on  the  master's  violins.  He  even  made  and  labelled  for 
NICOLAS. 

In  1668  he  leaves  his  master's  shop  and  sets  up  for  him- 
self. But  for  thirty  years  this  consummate  student,  whilst 
making  every  conceivable  experiment  with  lutes,  guitars, 
and  violins,  practically  copied  closely  the  best  models  of 
NICOLAS  AMATI. 

Still  we  notice  that  from  1686-1694  his  sound-holes 
begin  to  recline,  his  form  grows  flatter,  his  curves  extended, 
his  corners  tossed  up  and  pointed,  the  scroll  bolder,  varnish 
inclining  away  from  the  browns  and  light  orange  to  the  rich 
yellows  and  light  reds.  Notice  the  way  in  which  his  pur- 
fling  at  the  corners,  like  a  little  curved  wasp's  sting, 
follows  no  outline  of  the  violin,  and  is  not  in  the  middle  of 
the  angle,  but  points  freely  towards  the  corner  of  the  angle. 
What  chic  !  as  the  French  say. 

In  1687  the  master  makes  his  long  pattern — not  really 


252  OLD   VIOLINS. 

longer,  but  looking  longer  because  of  the  contracted  sides. 
The  Spanish  Quatuor,  inlaid  with  ivory,  illustrates  the 
fancy  and  skill  of  the  workman — as  did  also  an  exquisitely 
carved  lute  by  STRADIVARIUS,  exhibited  at  the  South  Ken- 
sington Museum. 

It  was  not  until  STRADIVARIUS  had  entered  upon  his  fifty- 
sixth  year  that  he  attained  his  zenith  and  fixed  his  model, 
known  as  the  grand  pattern. 

Between  1700  and  1725  those  extraordinary  creations 
passed  from  his  chisel,  even  as  the  master-pieces  on  canvas 
passed  from  the  brush  of  RAPHAEL. 

The  finest  of  these  specimens — like  that  possessed  by  MR. 
ADAMS,  the  Dolphin,  and  by  MR.  HART,  the  Belts  Strad. — 
fetch  from  £300  to  £1,000. 

To  try  and  describe  these  instruments  is  like  trying  to 

describe  the  pastes,  glazes,    and    blues    of  Nankin   China. 

Beneath   the   tangible   points   of  outline,  scroll,

A  SPECIMEN  character,  and  variety  of  thickness  and  modifica- 
tion of  form,  dependent  on  qualities  of  wood 
known  to  the  master,  there  lie  still  the  intangible  things 
which  will  hardly  bear  describing,  even  when  the  violin  is 
under  the  eye — one  might  almost  say  under  the  micro- 
scope. A  rough  attempt  by  contrast  may  be  made  in 
detail.  Take  but  one  detail  for  the  benefit  of  the  general 
reader,  the  inner  side,  curves  and  angles  of  the  middle 
boughts. 


THE  END   OF  STBADIVAEIUS.  253 

In  GASPAR  and  MAGGINI  those  curves  are  drooping  at 
the  corners,  longish  and  undecided  in  character ;  in  DUIFFO- 
PRUGCAR  it  amounts  almost  to  a  wriggle.  NICOLAS  AMATI 
balances  the  top  and  bottom  of  his  hollow  curve  with  a 
certain  mastery,  but  it  still  has  a  long  oval  sweep,  with 
a  definite  relation  of  balance  between  the  top  and  the  bottom 
angle.  Having  mastered  this  sweep,  STRADIVARIUS  begins 
to  play  with  his  curves  and  angles.  He  feels  strong  enough 
to  trifle,  like  a  skilled  acrobat,  with  the  balance.  He 
lessens  the  oval,  and  tosses  up  his  lower  corner  with  a 
curious  little  crook  at  the  bottom ;  the  top  angle  towers 
proudly  and  smoothly  above  it,  yet  it  is  always  graceful — 
delicious  from  its  sense  of  freedom,  almost  insolent  in  its 
strength  and  self-confidence.  There  is  a  touch  about 
STRADIVARIUS  here  as  elsewhere ;  it  is  that  which  separates 
the  great  masters  everywhere  from  their  pupils — RAPHAEL 
from  GIULIO  ROMANO,  PAGANINI  from  SIVORI,  STRADIVARIUS 
from  CARLO  BERGONZI.  The  freedom  of  STRADIVARIUS 
becomes  license  in  CARLO  BERGONZI  and  over-boldness  in 
JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS  ;  for,  although  the  connection  between 
JOSEPH  and  STRADIVARIUS  has  been  questioned,  to  my  mind 
it  is  sufficiently  clear. 

Although  STRADIVARIUS  made  down  to  the  last  year  of 

his  life,  still  after  1730,  feeling  his   hand  and 

IHE  END  OF  sight  beginning  to  fail,  he   seldom   signed   his

of  him  as  he  lived  and  moved  and  had  his  being  at 
Cremona  in  1730,  Piazza  Domeuico.  Old  POLLEDRO, 
late  chapel-master  at  Turin,  describes  "  ANTONIUS,  the 
lute-maker,"  as  an  intimate  friend  of  his  master.  He 
was  high  and  thin,  and  looked  like  one  worn  with  mnch 
thought  and  incessant  industry.  In  summer  he  wore  a 
white  cotton  night-cap,  and  in  winter  orie  of  some  woollen 
material.  He  was  never  seen  without  his  apron  of  white 
leather,  and  every  day  was  to  him  exactly  like  every  other  day. 
His  mind  was  always  riveted  upon  his  one  pursuit,  and  he 
seemed  neither  to  know  nor  to  desire  the  least  change  of 
occupation.  His  violins  sold  for  four  golden  livres  apiece, 
and  were  considered  the  best  in  Italy;  and  as  he  never 
spent  anything  except  upon  the  necessaries  of  life  and 
his  own  trade,  he  saved  a  good  deal  of  money,  and  the 
simple-minded  Cremonese  used  to  make  jokes  about  his 
thriftiness,  and  the  proverb  passed,  "  As  rich  as  STRADI- 
VARIUS." 

A  traveller  who  lately  visited  his  house,  still  standing  in 
the  square  of  Cremona,  remarked  that  it  was  heated  through 
with  the  sun  like  an  oven.  He  said  you  might  sit  and  sweat 
there  as  in  a  Turkish  bath.  That  was  hovr  the  Cremona 
makers  dried  their  wood,  and  so  it  was  their  oils  distilled 
slowly  and  remained  always  at  a  high  temperature,  their 
varnish  weltered  and  soaked  into  the  pine  bellies  and  syca- 
more backs  beneath  the  tropical  heat  of  those  seventeenth 
century  summers !

200. 
THE  GREAT  his  sons,  PETER,  brother  of  JOSEPH  (son),  PETER 

OP  MANTUA,  son  of  "  JOSEPH  Filius  ANDREW." 
The  loud  and  rich  tone  of  the  later  Joseph  del  Gesu 
violins  makes  him  the  formidable  rival  of  STRADIVARIUS. 
PAGANINI  preferred  his  Joseph,  now  in  the  Municipal  Palace 
of  Genoa,  to  all  others. 

Who  was  JOSEPH'S  master?  The  idea  that  JOSEPH,  or 
anyone  who  lived  either  in  AMATI'S  or  GUARNERIUS'S 
house — AMATI  on  the  right,  GUARNERIUS  on  the  left  of 
STRADIVARIUS,  in  the  same  square  at  Cremona — was  en- 
tirely unaffected  by  the  great  man's  influence,  has  always 
seemed  to  me  absurd.  That  influence  has  been  denied  as 
vehemently  in  late  years  as  it  used  to  be  formerly  taken 
for  granted.  Still,  the  great  JOSEPH  is  claimed  as  the 
pupil  of  JOSEPH,  son  of  ANDREW — that  ANDREW  who  sat  by 
the  side  of  STRADIVARIUS  in  NICOLAS  AMATI'S  workshop. 
With  this  I  find  no  fault ;  but  if  the  influence  of  STRADI- 
VARIUS cannot  be  seen  in  the  earlier  Josephs,  the  later 
Josephs  show  undoubted  signs  of  the  master,  who  between 
1700  and  1730  had  eclipsed  all  his  predecessors.  In  some 
details  JOSEPH'S  undoubted  reversion  to  Brescian  influence, 
and  that  early,  is  interesting — the  flat  model,  the  long 
sound -holes,  and,  it  must  be  added,  often  the  rough  work. 


256  OLD  VIOLINS. 

Still,  in  JOSEPH'S  middle  period  there  occurs  that  very 
high  finish  which  reminds  one  of  STRADIVARIUS.  The 
elegance  of  the  Strad.  scroll  is  never  attained,  perhaps 
not  even  aimed  at.  The  Josephs  of  about  1740  are  most  in 
request.  They  are  large  and  massively  made,  the  wood  of 
finest  acoustic  property,  the  Brescian  sound-hole  toned  down 
and  rounded  more  like  STRADIVARIUS.  A  fine  genuine 
violin  of  this  period  will  not  go  for  less  than  two  hundred 
guineas,  and  four  hundred  would  not  be  an  out-and-out 
price.  Tbe  GUARNERIUS  head  or  scroll  is  often  quaint  and 
full  of  self-assertion.  The  violin  has  the  strongest  make, 
temper,  and  stamp  ;  the  fourth  string  is  often  as  rich  as  a 
trumpet.  His  last  period  is  troubled  by  certain  inferior 
violins  called  prison  fiddles.  The  tale  runs  that  JOSEPH  was 
imprisoned  for  some  political  offence,  and  was  supplied  with 
refuse  wood  by  the  gaoler's  daughter.  The  prison  fiddle  is  a 
boon  to  forgers  ;  their  bad  fiddles  pass  freely  for  interesting 
"  prison  JOSEPHS." 

With   CARLO   BERGONZI   (1718-1755)    and    GUADAGNINI 

(1710-1750)  the  great  Cremona  school  comes  to  an  end.

OF    THE  . 

CKEMONESE  of  a  dying  art,  and  the  passion  for  vigour  and 

finish  has  also  departed.     If  I  have  in  the  above 

remarks    omitted    great    names    like    HUGE RI us,     CAPPA, 

ALBANI,  MONTAGNANA  (Cremona  and  Venice),  it  is  because

I  am  dealing  with  characteristics  more  than  wirh  men,  and 
have  used  my  men,  not  in  catalogue,  but  as  landmarks  in 
art.  As  the  greatest  masters  grow  rare,  the  secondary  stars 
cannot  fail  to  rise  annually  in  value. 

The  violin,  although  it  culminated,  is  not  exhausted  at 
Cremona ;  but  it  would  lead  me  into  a  new  branch  of  my 
202.  subject  to  deal  with  the  other  schools.  These, 
^jcMOGNA1'  a^ter  a^»  are  kut  reflections,  more  or  less  pale  or 
BOMB,  perfect,  -of  the  incomparable  Cremonese  masters. 
Florence,  Bologna  and  Rome  (1680-1760)  may  be  briefly 
summarised  under  the  names  of  GABRIELLI,  F.;  TONONI,  B.; 
and  TECHLEB,  R.  Venice  (1690-1764)  claims  D.  MOR- 
TAGNANA  (famous  for  his  violoncellos),  and  SANCTUS  SERA- 
PHINO.  Naples  (1680-1800)  boasts  of  the  families  of 
TESTORE,  the  GAGLIANO,  and  GRANCINO.  Milan  owns  to 
C.  F.  LANDOLPHUS,  a  very  capital  maker,  rapidly  rising  in 
estimation  (1750).  He  was  a  pupil  of  JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS, 
and  beware  of  his  clever  imitations;  beware  still  more  of 
those  vulgar  red  imitations  (from  which  even  Gillott's 
collection  was  not  quite  free),  perpetrated  on  many  a 
passable  LANDOLPHUS,  to  make  him  look  like  a  GUARNERIUS 
DEL  GESTT. 

Passing  to  the  French  school  (1610-1880)  we  note  the 
fathers  of  it — MEDARD  (1610),  BOQUAY  and  PIERAY  (1700- 
1730),  DE  COMBRE  (1730-1760),  and,  greatest  of  all,

their  violins  improve  every  year.  To  the  late 
M.  VUILLAUME  is  due  the  merit  of  almost  recreating  a 
taste  for  fine  violin  patterns,  not  only  by  his  diligent 
research  and  collection,  but  by  his  admirable  studies  in 
the  workshop  and  attention  to  detail.  CHANOT  and  GAND 
are  also  excellent  devotees  of  the  lost  art.  The  awful 
Mirecourt  laboratory  sends  forth  annually  waggon-loads  of 
Cremonas,  boiled,  cleaned,  rubbed,  and  otherwise  withered 
with  apparent  age.  They  smell  as  badly  as  they  sound. 
The  immortal  LUPOT  —  greatest  of  French  masters  —  did  not 
boil  and  dry  in  ovens  and  cook  with  acids  his  woods  ;  he 
copied  fair  and  varnished  full,  and  time  is  now  doing  for 
him  what  it  will  never  do  for  the  revolting  shams  of  Mire- 
court.  In  fifty  years  LUPOT  will  rank  little  below 
STRADIVARIUS  himself  in  tone  ;  his  roughness  of  timbre  is 
even  now  rapidly  mellowing,  and  his  sweet  brilliancy  is 
rather  suggestive  of  the  clear  ringing  sweetness  of  the 
Strad.  than  the  loud  rich  roundness  of  the  JOSEPH  DEL  GESU. 

In  passing  to  the  German  School  (1621-1800,  &c.),  the 

two  M.  ALBANIS  of  Botzen  —  one  M.  of   Gratz

THE  ENGLISH  SCHOOL.  259 

England,  there  is  but  one  German  name  paramount.  It  is 
JACOBUS  STEINER  (1680  and  onwards) — he  was  unhappily 
deeply  infected  with  round  viol  '  tub '  model  with  the  worst  of 
side  scoops.  After  visiting  Cremona  his  form  improved,  but 
never  attained  to  the  late  MAGGINI,  much  less  to  the  later 
NICOLAS  type.  His  workmanship  at  the  best  is  superb  ;  his 
varnish  green  yellow  or  green  brown — often  spoiled  by  being 
rewashed  and  oiled  by  modern  cooks — his  tone  piercing,  not 
to  say  screaming;  but  in  every  way  STEINER  is  so  strong 
and  so  full  of  character  that  his  very  defects  were  idolised ; 
he  fascinated  his  age,  and  his  mistakes  corrupted  the  violin 
model  in  England  and  retarded  the  progress  of  Cremonese 
form  here  for  about  one  hundred  years. 

Passing  to  the  English  School,  we  have  to  note  that 
(like  the  French),  the  Brescian  and  Cremona  makers  were 

at  first  copied  up  to  the  days  of  BARAK  NORMAN 
THE  ENGLISH  (1688-1740),  when,  the  French  remaining  true 

to  Cremona,  the  STEINER  mania  seized  upon 
England ;  but  although  DUKE  (1768)  and  others  leaned 
much  to  the  STEINER  model,  there  certainly  never  was 
a  time  in  England  when  the  Italian  school  had  not  its 
eager  copyists,  and  our  BANKS  (BENJAMIN)  1727 — 95,  may 
even  be  called  the  English  AM  ATI.  During  the  last  half 
of  the  seventeenth  and  the  first  half  of  the  eighteenth 
centuries  the  DUKE  mania  in  England  raged  so  furiously 
that  hardly  a  respectable  kitchen  in  the  land,  not  to  speak

of  the  beer-shop,  was  without  its  Duke  violin.  The  DUKE 
label  was  as  recklessly  forged  here  as  the  STEINER  label  in 
Germany.  A  fine  DUKE  will  always  fetch  money  ;  but  fine 
DUKES  are  not  very  common,  although  the  market  is  choked 
with  the  name. 

With  regret  I  now  quit  what  I  hope  has  been  an  instruc- 
tive as  well  as  an  interesting  field  of  observation.  The 
prospect  opens  before  me  as  I  close,  and  I  feel  positively 
oppressed  with  the  number  of  really  good  names  I  have 
been  unable  even  to  allude  to  consistently  with  my  pre- 
scribed limits.  The  Cremona  Sound,  the  Cremona  Con- 
noisseur, the  Forger,  the  Fiddle  Market,  are  still  so 
many  untouched  chapters,  and  each  of  the  violin  schools 
here  rapidly  summarised  would  amply  repay  separate  atten- 
tion. 

Perhaps  the  following  mems.  may  be  useful  to  the  general 
reader,  and  I  note  them  briefly  in  conclusion..

the  presence  of  a  very  interesting  but  mixed  collection  of 
violins.  This  was  my  dream  at  South  Kensington. 


IV. 

A    SOUTH    KENSINGTON    DREAM. 

IN  the  clear  light  through  the  diaphonous  cabinets  entirely 
composed  of  plate-glass,  at  the  South  Kensington  Museum, 

such  violins  and  specimens  of  the  Viol  tribe  were 

208. 

BEHIND  to  be  seen  exhibited  in  the  year  1872,  as  in  all 
probability  were  never  before  brought  together  at 
any  one  time.  In  a  space  of  a  few  square  yards,  I  could 
lose  my  way  for  hours.  I  pause,  for  instance,  at  a  case  full 
of  strange,  uncouth,  and  yet  elaborately  finished  viols  called 
Viols  di  Gamba,  Viols  di  Bardone,  Viols  d'Amore ;  I  am 
carried  back  to  a  time  when  the  violin  proper  was  still  in 
obscurity,  when  CASPAR  DI  SALO  (1560-1610)  was  struggling 
into  notice  with  his  thin-sided  and  tubby-stomached  violins 
proper,  which  look  to  us  so  graceless,  and  yet  which  in 
reality  sounded  those  notes  of  progress  which  were  shortly 
afterwards  caught  up  by  his  pupil,  MAGGINI,  until  they 
swelled  into  the  sweet  tones  of  the  AMATIS,  and  the  full, 
powerful  sound  torrents  of  STRADIVARIUS  and  the  GUARNERII.

Turning  from  the  dusky  varnish  and  uncouth  shapes  of 

the  ancient  viols,  my  eye  is  caught  by  the  sharp  and  delicate 

outline,  and  the  polished  agate   splendour   of  a

has  been  quickly  traversed,  not  so  much  that 
viols  ceased  to  be  made  in  1720  as  that  the  violin  of 
that  date  could  not  possibly  have  been  made  in  the  1620 
period,  from  which  we  have  just  emerged.  Then  my 
curiosity  is  excited  for  a  moment  by  one  of  those  graceful 
pear-shaped  lutes  so  common  in  sentimental  pictures. 
It  is  also  by  the  great  STRADIVARIUS.  His,  and  all 
other  lutes,  have  long  since  gone  out  —  at  best  they 
were  poor  things  ;  yet  this  specimen,  exquisitely  carved 
with  a  rich,  heavy,  full-lipped  Italian  face,  as  a  head  —  a 
splendid  Satyr  and  Dryad  curling  around  the  neck,  and 
every  detail  of  grooving  and  purfling  as  perfect  as  in  one  of 
the  great  violins  worth  300  guineas  —  all  this  tells  of  an 
age  when  beneath  Italian  skies,  on  Venetian  balconies,  or 
from  black,  loose-curtained  gondolas,  the  sound  of  the  lute 
struck  by  fair  or  chivalrous  fingers  constantly  floated  over 
the  shallow  lagoons  of  the  Adriatic,  and  was,  doubtless,  of 
all  others,  the  sound  most  loved  of  knights  and  ladies. 

But  I  must  pause  on  the  threshold.     I  shall  return  to

SKETCH  OF  VIOLIN  PROGRESS.  267 

nexion  with  this  violin  meditation  I  desire  to  recall  to  the 
reader,  at  the  risk  of  being  accused  of  repetition,  several 
facts  and  details  which  -will  show  how  large  and  important 
a  part  the  violin  has  played  in  the  development  of  the 
musical  art,  and  if,  in  again  alluding  to  the  rise  and  progress 
of  the  violin,  I  shall  seem  to  omit  anything  of  importance, 
I  must  refer  my  readers  to  my  preceding  Royal  Institu- 
tion lecture  and  a  chapter  on  STRADIVARIUS,  in  Music  and 
Morals,  where  I  have  dwelt  at  some  length  upon  the 
general  construction  of  the  violin. 

The  violin,  as  I  have  already  pointed  out,  had  to  wait  upon 
time.  Its  destinies,  like  those  of  music,  up  to  a  certain 
211.  point,  were  unprcgressive — after  that  point,  let  us 
8KvEioCuN°P  say  1530»  its  triumphal  march  to  1730  was  rapid 
PEOJEESS.  and  irresistible.  Yet  it  is  curious  to  notice  how 
slowly  the  great  obstacles  to  its  perfection  were  surmounted. 
Something  like  a  viol  seems  to  have  been  in  existence  for 
centuries  before  the  model  attained  to  anything  like  its 
present  shape,  yet  until  it  attained  that  shape  no  real 
progress  from  barbarous  scraping  and  weak  tubby  sounds 
towards  real  music  was  possible.  It  is  true  that  the 
instrument  kept  pace  with  the  development  of  music, 
which  was  at  first  slow  enough.  The  oblong  box,  with  one 
or  more  strings,  and  an  almost  flat  bridge,  could  yield 
nothing  but  rasping  and  twanging  discord.  Yet  it  was  not 
until  melody  was  wedded  to  an  improved  notation  that  the 


268  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DEE  AM. 

merits  of  curved  bridges  and  scooped-out  violin  sides  became 
obvious.  Without  these  it  is,  of  course,  next  to  impossible 
to  play  on  one  string  without  sounding  the  others. 

Then  for   how   many   years   did  the  odious  guitar  frets 

last !     Several  old  viols  in  the  South  Kensington  Museum 

212.       have   them    still ;    indeed,   we   believe   that   the 

FRETS  AND  mamifacture   of  them   was   not  extinct  even  in 

FINGER- 
BOARDS,     the   middle    of    the   eighteenth    century.       But 

what  limitations  they  imposed  upon  the  player;  how  they 
cramped  his  art;  how  they  made  him  lean  upon  props  which 
every  violinist  now  scorns,  even  to  learn  his  art  by ;  above 
all,  how  they  defeated  the  innate  and  subtle  perfection  of  the 
violin  by  preventing  the  player  from  taking  quarter-tones,  or 
gliding  up  through  imperceptible  intervals;  all  which  fine 
and  thrilling  qualities  belong  to  the  perfectly  smooth  and 
unmarked  finger-board  alone.  What  an  indescribable  charm 
has  that  smooth  ebony  plate  for  the  true  artist !  We  have 
heard  people  describe  their  raptures  upon  surveying  the  cool 
ivory  and  ebony  keys  of  a  grand  piano ;  but  such  raptures 
are  poor  compared  with  those  of  the  violin  lover  as  he  takes 
up  his  instrument  and  looks  through  the  four  strings  at  the 
black  ebony  finger-board  upon  which  absolutely  nothing  is 
visible,  and  yet  which  is  ready  at  any  moment  to  measure  for 
him  to  a  hair's  breadth  the  intervals  of  his  delight.  The 
mystery  is  hidden,  and  yet  to  the  cunning  player  it  is  an 
open  secret — effects  of  which  he  has  often  proved  the

potency  sleep  along  that  inclined  plane — myriads  of  swift 
notes  are  ready  to  rush  forth  and  greet  him,  as  his  fingers 
slide  up  and  down  it.  Weird  harmonics  will  steal  forth  at 
certain  spots  over  which  his  finger  broods  without  pressure, 
yet  with  a  sensitive  and  thrilling  touch  as  though  feeling 
stronger  contact  too  close  for  the  bell- like  sweetness  desired, 
and  seeking  rather  to  draw  it  forth  by  the  magic  of  some 
electric  sympathy.  Yet  there  is  no  hint  or  trace  of  the  true 
intervals  upon  the  smooth  finger-board :  like  the  opening 
and  shutting  of  a  door  with  a  glimpse  into  Paradise ;  like 
the  myriad  tints  upon  broken  water  vanishing  into  the  dark 
transparent  monotint,  when  the  light  on  the  wave  is  gone ; 
so  the  ebony  board,  lately  the  arbiter  of  such  changeful 
melodies,  sleeps  silent,  expressionless,  the  instant  the  busy 
fingers  are  still.  But  what  foul  orgies  of  sound  lie  also 
within  its  range  when  tampered  with,  used  ignorantly,  or 
abused.  What  false  and  hateful  intervals,  what  gross 
screams,  what  wicked  capabilities  of  perverting  sound  ! 

Well,  half  the  violin's  powers  for  delight  or  pain,  for  good 

or  evil,  were  for  centuries  destroyed  by  the  use  of  frets.    The 

abolition  of  frets  is  not  only  the  emancipation,  it

THE  VIOL    is  the  creation,  of  the  violin  finger-board.     Then, 

'    again,  how  long  was  it  before  it  became  evident 

that  for  all  practical  purposes  four  strings,  and  only  four, 

were  quite  as  many  as  could  be  strung  upon  any  instrument 

of  the  viol  tribe  with  due  regard  to  tone,  and  pitch,  and  con-

venience.  Take  a  violin  and  add  a  fifth  string  to  the  bass  ; 
you  must  stretch  it  too  loosely  for  an  effective  resonance, 
or  add  one  to  the  treble,  aud  it  is  superfluous  as  well  as 
inconvenient — superfluous  because  we  can  get  on  the  E 
string  notes  as  shrill  as  the  human  ear  can  recognise,  and 
inconvenient  because  any  string  tuned  a  fifth  above  the  E 
string,  would  be  always  snapping,  and  would  probably  by 
its  horrible  tension  at  last  pull  the  bridge  through  the  belly. 
No  one  can  walk  through  the  permanent  collection  of 
ancient  stringed  instruments  at  the  South  Kensington 
Museum  without  realising  the  point  of  these  observations. 
Yet  Viols  di  Gamba  were  made  habitually  with  six  strings, 
stupidly  tuned  at  intervals  of  a  third,  tension  low,  sound 
tubby;  instead  of  four  strings  tuned  in  fifths,  high  tension, 
sound  bright.  And  at  one  time  almost  any  number  of 
strings  more  were  added  by  the  caprice  of  makers,  or  the 
senseless  fancy  of  virtuosi.  One  limited  use  of  several 
strings,  and  one  only,  commends  itself  to  us  in  instruments 
of  the  Viol  da  Braccio,  or  large  tenor  make,  namely,  the 
production  .of  arpeggios.  Some  years  ago  a  gentleman 
in  M.  JULLIEN'S  band  played  beautifully  on  a  viol  of  this 
kind.  He  called  it,  if  we  remember  rightly,  by  the  old 
name  of  Viol  d'Amore.  The  effect  produced  was  exceedingly 
soft  and  lovely.  The  movement  consisted  of  successions  of 
sweeping  and  beautifully  harmonised  arpeggios,  effective 
beyond  anything  that  could  be  produced  in  that  style  on 
four  strings.  He  played  upon  six,  if  not  more. 


SYMPATHETIC   WIRES.  271 

Another   quite    extinct   device    consists    of  a   series    of 

sympathetic   steel    wire   strings   stretched  underneath   the 

bridge    or    on    one    side  of   it,   in   some    cases 

Zx4s 

SYMPATHETIC  through  it,  from  neck  to  tail-piece,  and  tuned 
to  the  same  notes  as  the  normal  gut  strings 
above  them.  When  these  last  were  struck  the  steel 
strings  vibrated,  harmonically  as  well  as  normally,  and 
must  have  produced  a  kind  of  mixture  as  when  a  piano  is 
played  without  dampers,  or  with  a  loud  pedal  down,  or,  as 
when  a  carillon  is  set  agoing,  and  the  notes  run  into  each 
other  because  there  is  nothing  to  check  their  vibrations. 
Some  sensuous  effects  unknown  to  us  were  doubtless  pro- 
duced in  this  way  ;  but  everything  which  tends  to  promote 
an  unregulated  echo  is  destructive  of  music  proper,  just  as 
much  as  a  sound-board  which  keeps  echoing  a  speaker's 
voice  is  to  that  extent  destructive  of  speech  proper. 
Such  devices,  or  "  conceits/'  as  the  old  writers  would  say, 
invariably  disappear  from  musical  instruments  and  orchestras 
as  sounds  grow  more  and  more  out  of  noise  through  the 
discipline  of  Art  into  music. 

But  to  return  to  our  violin.     What  was  to  determine  the 
shape  and  size  of  basses,  viols,  and  violins  ?     The  question 

was  fully  illustrated  in   the  loan  exhibition   of 
215.  J 

THE       which  I  am  speaking.     For  some  time  it  seemed 

as  if  nothing  but  the   caprice  of  amateurs  and 
lute-makers  was  to  be  consulted.     All  attempts  to  classify 


272  A  SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DREAM. 

the  number  and  shapes  of  the  viol  tribe,  up  to  at  least 
1600,  must  fail.  Some  idea  of  the  infinite  variety  of  these 
instruments — a  variety  which  continued  long  after  the 
modern  quartett  of  instruments  (two  violins,  tenor,  and 
violoncello)  had  been  established — may  be  gathered  by 
the  slight  sketches  of  outlines  which  I  have  culled  in  the 
South  Kensington  Museum.  But  as  music  acquired  form, 
science,  and  precision,  musical  instruments  followed  suit. 
It  is  not  too  much  to  affirm  that  the  madrigal  created 
the  modern  string  quartett.  The  singing  schools  soon 
divided  the  voice  into  the  usual  four  divisions.  The 
madrigals  of  the  Elizabethan  Age  brought  these  four 
divisions  into  the  most  sharply  defined  perfection.  At  first 
the  crowd  of  viols  stood  like  humble  lackeys  in  the  ante- 
chambers of  the  vocal  art,  and  were  only  called  in  to  assist 
the  singers,  the  player  standing  over  the  singer  and  playing 
the  notes  in  unison  with  him.  It  was  soon  found  that 
each  voice  ought  to  have  its  appropriate  viol — the  treble 
voice  a  treble  viol,  or  what  we  should  call  a  violin;  the 
tenor  and  counter-tenor  would  be  accompanied  by  a  violin 
or  viola,  or  two  violas  of  different  sizes  ;  and  the  bass  would 
be  helped  through  by  one  of  those  Viols  di  Gamba — the 
violoncello  of  the  period  of  which  the  South  Kensington 
Museum  can  boast  some  splendid  specimens.  Here,  then, 
we  have  the  elements  at  least  of  the  modern  quartett,  but 
in  a  sadly  servile  condition.  But  now  and  then  it  would 
happen  that  a  voice  was  absent,  and  then  the  voice,  instead

of  being  attended  by,  would  be  replaced  by,  an  instrument. 
At  last  it  appeared  that  the  four  instruments  could  play  the

uncommonly  done,  as  early  as  Elizabeth's  time.  We  have 
Madrigals  of  five  and  six  parts  apart  for  Violas  and  Voices,

published,  in  1600,  Songs  or  Ayres  with  Tablature  for  the 
Lute  Orpherion,  with  the  Viol  di  Gamba.  In  1605 
instrumental  music  had  already  become  very  independent, 
for  TOBIAS  HUME  published  Musical  Concertes  for  two  base 
viols,  expressing  five  parts,  with  pleasant  reports  one  from 
the  other,  and  for  two  Theorbo  viols,  and  also  for  the  Theorbj 
viole,  with  two  treble  viola,  or  two  with  one-  treble,  all 
which  shows  that  the  viol  tribe  could  by  this  time  walk 
very  well  alone,  and,  what  is  more  important,  that  the 
treble  viol  was  steadily  advancing  in  public  favour. 

TESTATOR,  called  IL  VECCHIO,  of  Milan,  about  1590,  is 

said  by  some  to  have  been  the  first  maker  of  the  violin,  but

French  bands,  and  then  cautiously  crossed  the 
Channel  and  began  to  bid  for  public  favour  as  the  fiddle, 
or  the  little  violin,  in  England.  It  was  greeted  with  the 
greatest  contempt.  Why,  forsooth,  was  the  peaceable  rum- 
bling of  the  old  viols  to  be  screamed  down  by  this  impudent

and  airy  little  impostor  ?  The  author  of  Mustek's  Monument 
raises  almost  the  last  scream  against  the  king  of  instru- 
ments ;  it  was  to  be  found  everywhere,  and  he  could  not  bear 
to  see  the  big  Theorbo  lutes  and  lumpy  viols  "  overtoped  (in 
His  Majesty's  band — CHARLES  II.)  by  squaling,  scoulding 
fiddlers."  As  for  their  music,  he  calls  it  merely  "high- 
prized  noise."  But  the  old  masters  had  hit  upon  a  model 
which  was  not  to  be  put  down  in  a  hurry  when  they  drew 
the  outline  of  the  first  violins.  When  old  viols  first  came  to 
be  cut  down,  the  proportions  were  naturally  found  to  be  all 
wrong  for  an  instrument  of  a  smaller  size;  no  doubt  the 
great  bulginess  of  the  early  violins  by  GASPARD,  DUIFFO- 
PRUGCAR,  1515,  and  even  those  of  CASPAR  DI  SALO  (1560- 
1610),  where  the  contour  is  wonderfully  in  advance  of  the 
age,  but  where  the  rise  of  the  belly  is  carried  right  up 
pumpkin-wise  to  the  sides,  results  from  the  model  suggested 
by  simply  cutting  down  the  bulging  old  tenors.  Yet,  even 
in  this  form  the  superior  handiness  and  sprightliness  of  the 
violin  shape  and  tone  soon  commended  itself  to  the  players 
and  the  public  alike.  The  following  little  verse  gives  a 
correct  account  of  the  matter  : — 

In  former  days  we  had  the  Viol  in, 
Ere  the  true  instrument  had  come  about ; 

But  now  we  say  since  this  all  ears  doth  win, 
The  Violin  hath  put  the  Viol  out.

tate and  contemporary,  with  whom  his  relations  are  only

too  well  known  through  LORD  MACAULAY'S  history, 
Louis  XIV.,  had  twenty-four  fiddlers  (Les  petits  violons  du 
Roi)  to  play  to  him  during  his  meals.  The  French  king 
indulged  himself  in  the  same  festive  manner.  And  it  is 
doubtless  from  the  Restoration  (1660)  that  the  violin  began 
to  put  the  viol  oat,  and  take  its  place  along  with  its  brethren 
the  tenor,  violoncello,  and  contrebasse,  until  cabinet  music 
blossomed  into  the  modern  quartett  form  in  which  it  has 
long  since  reigned  without  a  rival. 

A  few  great  names  connected  with  the  progress  and 
perfection  of  the  violin  must  be  noted.  As  early  as  1449, 
JOAN  KERLINO,  or  CARLINO,  founded  a  great 
RARE  OLD  Lute  School  at  Brescia.  There  was  a  finely- 
formed  viol  reputed  to  be  his  in  the  South 
Kensington  Loan  Collection,  No.  114,  about  1452:  its 
perfect  finish  and  preservation  make  it  almost  unique. 
VENTURI  LINELLI,  or  Linaro,  made  viols  at  Venice  in  1520, 
but  the  specimen,  No.  134,  in  the  South  Kensington,  dated 
1563,  was  without  grace  or  any  fine  sense  of  proportion — 
we  should  say  far  inferior  to  the  earlier  BRESCIAN  CARLINO 
in  everything  except  wonderful  preservation ;  but  then  it 
is  a  hundred  years  later,  and  ought  to  have  been  better  in 
every  respect.  Although  it  is  believed  that  TESTATOR,  of 
Milan,  first  made  what  he  named  a  violin,  yet  BRESCIA  was 
undoubtedly  the  first  great  school  of  lutists  and  viclin- 
makers,  and  GASPAR  m  SALO,  of  Brescia  (1560-1610),  was 

18  * 


276  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DEE  AM. 

the  first  man  who  really  conceived  of  the  violin  as  an 
instrument  worthy  of  a  distinct  individuality,  and  not 
merely  a  bulgy  viol  cut  down.  In  this  maker  the  pumpkin- 
bellies  of  DUIFFOPRUGCAR  (1515)  have  considerably  dimi- 
nished; the  instrument  has  been  somewhat  drawn  out  in 
length,  a  well-defined  scoop  appears  on  either  side  of  the 
/  /'s,  the  middle  is  still  high  and  barrel-like,  the  varnish  is 
fine,  thick,  and  brown — no  tinge  of  the  mellow  red  and 
orange  colours  so  lovely  in  the  later  Cremonese  makers. 
The  tone  of  CASPAR'S  first  and  second  strings  is  lively, 
bright,  and  piercing,  "  a  dry  golden  sound,"  as  DR.  FOSTER 
calls  it ;  the  third  string  weak,  but  sweetly  soft  j  the  fourth 
round  and  very  fine.  Compared  with  the  later  prodigies  of 
Cremona,  the  workmanship  lacks  finish  and  delicacy,  but 
the  cutting  is  bold  and  original,  the  wood  is  strong,  and  the 
//holes  are  straight  and  parallel — one  of  the  distinctive 
marks  of  the  Brescian  school — the  purfling,  or  inlaid  border 
that  marks  the  inner  edge  of  all  violins,  is  finely  placed 
and  double,  another  distinctive  mark  of  the  same  school. 

JEAN  PAUL  MAGGINI  (1590-1640),  (not  SANTO  MAGGINI 
of  the  18th  century),  probably  a  pupil  of  CASPAR  DI  SALO'S 
did  all  that  could  be  done  with  his  master's  model,  but  the 
sceptre  had  in  reality  passed  to  Cremona,  when  ANDREAS 
AMATI  (1530?-1580?)  began  to  make  violins.  His  violins 
are  small,  his  tone  sweet  but  not  powerful.  His  sons, 
ANTONY  and  JEROME,  who  made  violins  together,  excelled 


STORY  OF  JACOBUS  STAINER.  277 

'him;  and  his  grandson,  NICOLAS  AMATI,  brought  his  father's 
model  to  still  greater  perfection.  He  is  considered  the  great 
man  of  the  family.  Of  JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS  and  of  STRADI- 
VARIUS,  it  is  not  our  purpose  to  speak  at  any  length  here. 
The  first,  whose  violins  are  distinguished  for  power  above 
all  the  AMATIS,  but  who  does  not  equal  the  great  STRADI- 
VARIUS  in  perfection  of  model  and  finish,  and  equality  of 
tone,  probably  stands  next  to  him  in  the  estimation  of  most 
violinists.  They  often  say  "  If  we  cannot  get  a  Stradivarius, 
give  us  a  Joseph  Guarnerius." 

There  is  one  other  maker  who,  at  one  time,  enjoyed  in 

England  at  least  a  reputation  almost  equal  to  the  Cremonese 

218.        makers,  and  that  is  JACOB   STAINER.     In  1644, 

THE  STORY  joying  C0me  from  the  Tyrol,  he  worked  under 

OP   JACOBUS 

STAINER.  the  AMATIS  at  Cremona.  One  of  them  — 
NICOLAS  or  ANTHONY,  I  cannot  quite  make  out  which — 
offered  him  a  daugher  in  marriage,  which  he  appears  to 
have  declined.  He  had,  for  reasons  it  is  needless  here  to 
specify,  already  committed  himself  to  MARGARETHA  HOLZ- 
HIMMER,  whom  he  married  on  his  return  to  Absom.  She 
was  a  peasant  girl,  and  made  him  an  uncongenial  wife. 
Before  his  marriage  he  made  some  of  his  finest  violins ; 
his  work  is  equal  in  finish  to  the  best  Amatis — the  belly 
is  modelled  higher  than  the  back,  the  edges  are  strong 
and  round,  the  purfling  is  nearer  to  the  edges  than  in  the 
Amatis,  and  very  narrow,  the  //  are  beautifully  cut  and

shorter,  the  upper  and  under  turns  being  perfectly  round, 
the  neck  and  scroll  very  regular  and  smooth.  These  early 
instruments  are  rarely  to  be  found;  the  genuine  labels  are 
written ;  in  the  Tyrolese  forgeries  they  are  often  printed. 

As  his  family  increased  his  work  began  to  suffer ;  he 
grew  slovenly  and  rapid,  and  the  violins  of  this  middle 
period  are  very  inferior.  Before  long,  however,  his  merits 
were  recognised ;  his  violins  sold  well,  and  this  seems  to 
have  put  him  once  more  upon  his  metal ;  for  he  again  began 
to  work  with  great  care,  and  made  splendid  fiddles.  At 
the  close  of  his  working  life  he  made  sixteen  splendid  violins, 
twelve  of  which  he  sent  as  trophies  of  his  genius  to  the 
twelve  Electors,  and  the  remaining  four  to  the  Emperor. 
These  are  known  as  Stainer- Electors.  But  the  end  was 
near,  for,  either  through  love  or  loss  of  money,  he  went  mad 
and  died  soon  afterwards.  STAINER' s  tone  is  pure  and  silvery, 
and  has  a  certain  piercing  quality  :  it  has  not  the  roundness 
of  GUARNERIUS,  nor  the  sweetness  of  the  Amati,  nor  the  even 
breadth  and  power  of  the  Stradivarius,  but  its  quality  is 
peculiar  and,  in  the  finest  specimens,  full  of  charm  and 
character.

different,  the  belly  being  slightly  depressed,  deserves 
special  notice,  and  of  all  his  pupils  stands  first.  England 
can  boast  of  some  good  makers.  RICHARD  DUKE'S  violins 
were  all  the  rage  last  century  in  this  country  before 
the  merits  of  the  Cremonas  were  thoroughly  understood. 
Probably  STAINER  and  DUKE,  whose  instruments  are  some- 
what on  the  same  model,  were  the  most  acceptable  and 
popular  violin-makers  for  the  English  market  until  towards 
the  end  of  the  last  century,  when  the  Cremonas  began  to 
find  their  way  over  here,  alas  !  in  too  great  numbers,  for 
most  of  them  were  spurious,  and  swamped  everything  else. 
BENJAMIN  BANKS,  who  was  born  and  died  in  the  last  cen- 
tury, is  by  many  considered  to  be  the.  finest  of  the  English 
makers.  His  violoncellos  are  much  sought  after  still. 
WILLIAM  FORSTER,  who  flourished  in  the  middle  of  the  last 
century,  was  one,  the  greatest,  of  a  family  of  highly 
esteemed  makers  ;  and  BERNHARDT  FENDT,  who  settled  in  this 
country,  and  died  only  in  1832,  was  a  clever  maker,  whose 
imitations  of  old  violins  were  good  enough  to  take  in  the 
judges  at  the  South  Kensington,  in  1872,  as  I  shall  presently 
show. 

It  is  in  the  presence  of  a  fine  historical  collection  like

230  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DREAM. 

with  its  almost  living  curves,  and  its  clear  sweet  notes. 
The  progression  has  been  from  the  large  round  viol  model, 
the  hump-back  and  the  pot-belly,  to  the  small  flat  model, 
with  gentle  arc  in  back  and  belly,  softened  away  with 
curves  of  delicious  grace  and  smoothness  to  the  edges  of 
the  purfling.  The  four  corners  of  the  side  curves  have  also 
become  full  of  distinctive  character ;  they  are  no  longer 
stumpy  in  outline  as  though  they  had  difficulty  in  getting 
away  from  the  thick  bulge  of  the  sides,  but  they  are  carried 
down  in  the  Amatis  with  a  clean  and  gentle  sweep.  The 
Stradivarius  corners  are  still  more  full  of  character :  they 
do  not  hang  down  so  much  as  the  Amatis,  they  are  cut 
out  with  great  purity  and  almost  lifted  up  with  a  kind  of 
balanced  elasticity.  No  one  ever  laid  in  purfling  like 
STRADIVARIUS.  The  purfling  consists  of  three  thread-like 
pieces  of  wood,  two  of  ebony,  the  centre  one  of  sycamore, 
inlaid  near  the  edge  and  following  the  lines  of  the  violin  in 
the  back  and  belly.  It  is  of  no  use  beyond  giving  finish  to 
•what  is  really  an  exquisite  work  of  Art.  Every  part  of 
a  Stradivarius  violin  is  an  unhurried  labour  of  love,  and 
the  purfling  is  full  of  significance;  not  only  does  it  test 
the  fine  and  delicate  handling  of  the  workman,  but  it  calls 
attention  to  the  outlines  of  his  instrument — outlines  which 
are  drawn  with  all  the  balanced  freedom  and  grace  of  a 
Greek  frieze.  But  the  royal  purfling  of  STRADIVARIUS  bears 
his  sign-manual  especially  in  the  treatment  of  the  angles, 
in  the  slender  string-like  points  into  which  it  runs — it

seems  to  shoot  suddenly  into  the  corners  with  a  peculiar 
bend.  Up  to  this  point  it  has  rigidly  followed  the  outline 
of  the  instrument;  but  on  entering  the  corners  it  forms 
a  graceful  twist  of  its  own,  like  a  wasp's  sting,  calling 
special  attention,  as  it  were,  to  the  delicately-finished  angles, 
and  making  a  curve  in  harmonious  contrast  with  them. 
This  subtle  thought  is  peculiar  to  STRADIVARIUS  and  his 
close  copyists,  and  serves  to  illustrate  the  grand  and  original 
freedom  of  his  outlines.  The  two  //'s,  or  sound-holes,  are 
drawn  with  the  same  originality,  and  with  a  certain  severe 
grace  and  temperate  beauty.  Let  the  eye  run  over  the 
grotesque  wriggling  holes  of  the  old  Viols  di  Gamba,  the 
vulgar  slits,  the  senseless  punctures,  the  crude  experiments 
of  every  possible  description  as  illustrated  in  my  plate ;  let 
us  glance  at  the  straight,  stiff  Maggini  //'s,  and  then 
glance  back  at  the  perfect  wave  of  the  /  in  the  Stradi- 
varius  violin,  cut  as  with  the  chisel  of  a  great  artist  at  a 
single  sitting,  with  an  ardour  and  love  of  its  beauty,  and 
its  bend  that,  after  180  years,  is  as  infectious  as  ever, 
making  the  delight  of  connoisseurs  and  the  despair  of 
forgers  and  all  other  copyists.  But  nowhere  is  the  master 
more  distinctive  than  in  the  fluting  of  his  scroll,  and  the 
set  and  modelling  of  his  heads.  Perhaps  it  never  occurred 
to  our  readers  that  there  was  much  difference  between  one 
fiddle-head  and  another;  yet  a  Stradivarius  in  known  from 
a  Stainer,  for  instance,  by  his  head,  as  surely  as  you  can 
tell  a  Greek  from  a  Jewish  face.  Take  up  your  Stradi- 


282  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DREAM. 

varius,  hold  it  straight  out  against  the  light  with  its  belly 
towards  you,  and  note  the  commanding  outline  of  the 
head,  full  front.  The  two  sides  of  the  scroll  seem  to  be 
almost  in  motion,  like  curling  wood  thrown  off  by  a  revol- 
ving centrebit  or  a  plane  in  action.  The  two  points  seem 
a  little  lifted  up  with  incomparable  energy  and  strength, 
and  lightly  balanced  with  each  other.  The  dip  of  the  head, 
relieved  by  the  fine  fluting,  is  powerful  but  not  heavy ; 
and  in  the  finest  Stradivarius  and  Joseph  Guarnerius 
patterns,  reminds  one  of  a  lion's  face  in  repose,  only  the 
Stradivarius  is  invariably  more  graceful  and  beautiful  in 
its  majesty  where  the  Guarnerius  is  strong,  with  a  sort 
of  rough  and  massive  grandeur.  But  turn  from  either  of 
these  full-fronted  heads  to  lesser  magnates,  and  what  a 
falling  off  is  there  — some  are  what  we  may  call  pot-bellied 
heads;  others  brutal,  snub,  bull-dog  heads;  others  lean  and 
poor ;  others  simply  coarse  and  stupid ;  others  cut  mechani- 
cally without  character,  or  top-heavy,  poor  and  thin- flanked 
near  the  neck ;  others  without  any  sense  of  proportion, 
the  two  sides  of  the  scroll  uneven,  one  dipping  down  lop- 
eared,  and  the  other  turning  up  like  a  nez  retrousse,  and 
so  on,  until  the  eye  comes  back  and  rests  upon  the  perfect 
and  dignified  charms  of  the  Stradivarius  head.  It  will  bear 
inspection — look  at  it  sideways,  mark  the  throw  of  the 
scroll ;  was  there  any  carving  of  GIBBONS  or  the  Belgians, 
any  trailing  vine-stem,  any  circling  ivy  cut  in  rich  oak,  more 
finely  felt  in  its  sensitive  edges,  its  harmonious  sweep,  its

delicate  tendril- curves,  than  the  Stradivarius  maple-scroll, 
with  its  smooth  flesh-like  flutings,  its  soft  clean  edge  and 
circular  bends  which,  like  the  convolvulus  or  jessamine 
coil,  is  never  any  part  of  a  true  circle?  And  then 
look  at  the  varnish  lying  like  a  sheet  of  thin  jasper  on 
the  back  and  belly,  at  once  shielding  these  from  decay, 
whilst  revealing  century  after  century  the  transparent 
filaments  of  the  mottled  maple  or  sycamore,  and  the  sym- 
metrical deal  crossed  between  the  fibres  with  millions  of 
tiny  rays  which  show  where  lie  the  dessicated  cells  now 
hollow  and  fit  for  perfect  resonance  through  which  the  sap 
once  flowed.  The  rich,  almost  orange-coloured,  varnish,  is 
as  good  as  a  magnifying  glass :  through  it  we  can  at  this 
day  judge  of  the  loving  selection  made  of  the  choicest 
timber,  and  the  infinite  care  bestowed  upon  its  prepara- 
tion, the  tempering  as  well  as  the  carving  of  it. 

We  seek  in  vain  for  the  conditions  under  which  the  great 
violins  were  produced.   Even  if  we  had  the  love,  the  patience, 

and    the    inspiration    for  the  work,   the    work 
221. 
LOST       itself  would    never    pay — it   would  never  fetch 

8'  the  price  of  the  labour  and  time  bestowed  upon 
it.  The  instrument  itself,  simple  as  it  looks,  is  to  be 
composed  of  no  less  than  seventy-one  pieces.  Sycamore  or 
maple  must  be  got  for  the  back,  sides,  neck,  and  circle. 
Soft  deal  for  the  belly,  bass  bar,  sound  post,  and  six  internal 
blocks;  ebony  for  the  finger-board  and  tail-piece;  white 


284  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DEE  AM. 

and  ebony  for  the  purfling.  The  wood  must  be  cut  only  in 
December  and  January,  and  only  that  part  must  be  used 
which  has  been  exposed  to  the  sun.  You  may  cut  up 
planks  and  planks  before  you  find  a  piece  suitable  for  a 
really  fine  back  or  belly.  Witness  the  grain  of  a 
Stradivarius  or  Amati  violin  ;  mark  the  almost  pictorially 
beautiful  health  and  evenness  of  its  wavy  lines,  free  from 
all  knots,  irregularity  of  growth,  studded  with  symmetrical 
and  billowy  veins,  where  the  rich  sap  once  flowed.  And 
when  the  wood  is  cut  it  must  be  tempered  and  dried,  not 
with  artificial  warmth,  but  with  the  slow  and  penetrating 
influence  of  a  dry,  warm  Cremona  climate.  For  no  cus- 
tomer, for  no  market,  can  the  process  be  hurried.  And  the 
application  of  the  varnish  required  corresponding  care.  It 
was  to  be  perfectly  wedded  to  the  rare  wood — a  companion- 
ship destined  to  last  for  ages — to  outlast  so  many  generations 
of  men  and  women,  was  not  to  be  enterprised  or  undertaken 
lightly.  In  the  spring,  when  the  air  got  clear  and  bright  and 
the  storms  were  past,  the  subtle  gums  and  oils  were  mixed 
slowly  and  deliberately  :  hours  to  stand,  hours  to  settle, 
hours  for  perfect  fusing  and  amalgamation  of  parts ;  clear 
white  light  gleaming  from  roads  strewn  with  the  dazzling 
marble  dust  of  Lombardy ;  clear  blue  sky,  warm  dry  air, 
and  the  skill  of  an  alchemist,  these  were  the  conditions  for 
mixing  the  incomparable  Cremona  varnish.  So  deliberately 
was  it  prepared  and  laid  on,  just  when  the  wood  was  fit  to 
receive  it — laid  on  in  three  coats  in  such  a  manner  as 


GOOD  AND  BAD  FIDDLES.  285 

to  sink  into  the  dessicated  pores,  and  become  a  part  of  the 
wood,  as  the  aromatic  herbs  and  juices  become  a  part  of  the 
flesh  that  is  embalmed  for  a  thousand  years.  All  through 
the  summer  did  that  matchless  varnish,  which  some  say 
contained  ground  amber,  and  which  at  any  rate  was  charged 
with  subtle  secrets,  sink  and  soak  into  the  sycamore  and 
deal  plates,  until  now,  when  age  has  rubbed  away  its  clear 
and  agate  crust  in  many  places,  the  violin  is  found  no  longer 
to  need  that  protection,  for  the  wood  itself  seems  to  have 
become  petrified  into  clear  agate,  and  is  capable  throughout 
its  myriad  pores  and  fibres  of  resisting  the  worm,  and  even 
damp  and  the  other  ravaging  influences  of  ordinary  decay. 

The  old  varnishes  have  been  closely  imitated  by  M.  VUIL- 
LAUME,  and  other  clever  makers,  but  a  good  judge  can  tell 

the  genuine  from  the  false.     It  has  often  been

GOOD  AND  maintained  that  the  dryness  of  the  wood  gave 
a'  the  fine  quality  of  tone  desired  ;  and  the  French 
makers  have  accordingly  baked  the  wood  of  their  new 
violins;  but  although  the  tone  has  been  thus  to  some 
extent  permaturely  mellowed,  there  is  every  reason  to 
fear  that  the  baked  fiddles,  like  some  old  fiddles  made 
of  too  slight  wood  and  cut  too  thin,  have  a  tendency  to 
get  "  played  out " ;  that  is,  after  attaining  tone  they  lose 
tone.  Age,  no  doubt,  improves  wood,  and  the  constant 
vibration  of  playing  tends,  it  is  said,  to  shake  into  hollows 
the  pores  of  the  wood,  and  expel  the  particles  of  dried  sap

in  dust.  But  the  grand  secret  after  all  lay  in  the  manufac- 
ture of  the  original  instrument,  in  the  shape,  in  the  prepa- 
ration of  the  wood  before  the  parts  were  fixed  together, 
in  the  varnish  and  general  adjustments  of  the  interior.  The 
violin,  as  it  comes  from  the  hands  of  the  great  makers,  as 
I  shall  presently  illustrate,  was  always  fine.  Age  and 
playing  cannot  make  a  good  fiddle  out  of  a  bad  one,  although 
age  and  playing  doubtless  improves  good  fiddles.  There  are 
hosts  of  instruments  a  hundred  years  old  which  are,  and 
always  will  be,  bad  to  the  last  degree. 

Much  has  been  said  about  the  capricious  shape  of  the 

violin.       Some   professors   have   maintained    that   two   flat 

223.        boards  for  back  and  belly  would  be  better  than

it  has  been  adopted,  but  the  present  form  of  a  slightly 
curved  belly  and  back — the  Stradivarius  pattern,  I  must 
reiterate — is  the  result  of  centuries  of  experiment,  and  it 
has  held  its  own,  and  seems  likely  to  do  so,  against  the  most 
modern  and  scientific  patterns,  of  which  there  have  been 
many.  The  fact  is,  that  in  the  perfection  of  each  technical 
trade  there  is  something  which  escapes  analysis.  The 
last  handful  of  refined  tin  or  Drontheim  copper  thrown

tain  temperature,  or  presents  a  certain  appearance — that 
is  indispensable  to  the  rich  true  tone  of  the  bell.  Yet  the 
proportions  were  fixed  before.  Yes  !  but  that  handful,  under 
the  circumstances,  was  yet  needful.  So  with  the  violin  :  a 
certain  curve,  a  block  inside  placed  instinctively  a  hundredth 
of  an  inch  one  way  or  the  other,  a  slight  hollow,  a  gentle 
rise,  things  which  can  hardly  be  weighed  and  measured, 
because,  with  each  separate  specimen  on  the  same  model, 
there  are  differences — whoever  saw  two  Stradivarius  violins 
alike? — and  differences,  however  small,  change  the  subtle 
relations  of  different  parts.  These  are  things  which  baffle 
rule  and  measurement,  and  make  it  impossible  to  produce 
Stradivarius  tone  to  order.  Nor  have  more  ambitious 
attempts  to  change  those  measurements  succeeded  better, 
even  when  Stradivarius  measurements  have  been  rightly 
adopted.  Some  of  us  may  have  heard  of  a  late  experiment 
in  France,  where  a  scientific  violin  and  a  Stradivarius  were 
played  out  of  sight  to  a  select  body  of  judges,  and  the  judges 
were  fairly  puzzled  to  tell  which  was  which ;  hence  it  was 
inferred  that  there  was  no  difference.  As  well  tell  a  man 
who  has  been  tasting  port  and  sherry  alternately  several 
times  with  his  eyes  shut  that  there  is  no  difference  between 
these  wines  because  his  sense  of  taste  is  not  proof  against 
a  certain  test  invented  to  confuse  him.  The  ear  is  as  delicate 
and  as  easily  perturbed  as  the  palate. 

But  the  real  answer  to  such  modern  rivals  of  STRADI-

VARIUS  is  that  no  one  will  play  upon  them  who  can  get  the 
genuine  article.  The  extreme  difficulty  of  getting 
DEAB  TO  a  really  fine  old  violin  would  in  itself  create  a 
demand  for  any  cheap  instrument  which  could 
yield  even  a  fair  equivalent  in  quality.  But  as  regards 
quality,  the  secret  is  one  affecting  the  player  quite  as 
much  as  the  listener.  A  good  player  can  bring  a  good 
sound  out  of  almost  anything,  but  he  feels  the  difference. 
A  good  whip  can  drive  almost  any  horse  somehow  and 
get  along.  But  there  are  endearing  qualities  in  the 
rare  old  violins  that  cannot  be  described.  They  answer 
to  your  lightest  touch ;  they  can  be  ridden  without  saddle, 
and  driven  without  bit  or  bridle  ;  they  seem  to  vibrate 
in  advance,  and  anticipate  your  most  delicate  shades  of 
emotion.  The  coarse  fiddles  you  never  can  get  to  under- 
stand you,  the  medium  is  too  gross;  you  can  thrash  the 
sound  out  of  them,  and  others  who  know  not  what  you  want 
to  get  or  to  experience  are  well  satisfied ;  but  you  are  not. 

You  find  in  the  Cremona  an  echo  of  the  human  soul  itself.

equal,  but  not  excel.  Indeed,  it  seems  that  the  more  genius, 
the  more  time,  the  more  love,  the  more  absorption,  the  more 
experience  have  gone  to  the  making  of  a  violin,  the  more  it 
has  become  assimilated  to  the  soul  of  a  man.  We  are  ever- 
more taking  out  of  these  noble  old  violins,  the  great 
inexhaustible  souls  that  STRADIVARIUS  and  the  AMATIS  spent 
their  lives  in  pouring  into  them.  The  violin  is  like  the  earth 
itself,  you  can  only  get  out  of  it  so  much  of  agricultural 
wealth  as  has  been  put  into  it. 

And  now  we   may  well  shudder  at   the  dreadful  things 

which  have  been  done  in  the  direction  of  systematic  forgeries 

of  all  kinds.     Germany  is  to   blame  for  a  vast  number  of 

coarse   and   impudent  fiddles   labelled  with  and 

libelling  the  names  of  GUARNERIUS,  the  AMATIS.

and  even  STRADIVARIUS,  and  worth  from  one 
pound  to  thirty  shillings  a-piece.  But  the  most  dangerous 
of  all  forgeries  are  the  French  forgeries  at  the  close  of 
last  century  by  the  firm  of  LUPOT,  and  the  more  modern 
ones  by  VUILLAUME — on  the  whole  the  best  maker  of 
the  present  century.  These  violins  are  calculated  to 
deceive  all  but  the  best  judges.  The  most  shameful 
of  all  practices  is  one  of  which  our  own  countrymen 
cannot  altogether  be  acquitted.  A  fine  violin  has  often 
been  taken  to  pieces  and  two  or  even  three  others  made 
out  of  its  parts.  The  genuine  back,  or  head,  or  belly, 
or  even  sides  being  relied  on  to  do  duty  for  the  spuriousness

of  tlie  rest,  aiid  the  whole  violin  has  often  passed  as  a  genuine 
instrument  and  fetched  a  high  price.  This  infamous  device 
has  led  to  the  destruction  of  many  a  really  grand  old  violin. 
It  is  a  bitter  and  heartless  mockery  to  see  some  noble  head 
and  neck  on  a  vile  belly,  or  to  find  a  royal  GUARNERIUS  back 
mated  to  a  wretched  modern  French  or  English  set  of  ribs 
and  belly.  Yet  the  demand  for  Cremonas  has  become  of 
late  so  extensive  that  we  tremble  to  think  what  the  fate  of 
the  few  remaining  complete  violins  may  be  when  once  they 
come,  as  come  they  must,  from  time  to  time,  into  the  open 
market. 

And  now  a  word  about  violin  bows.      It  is,   no  doubt, 

possible  to  play  upon  a  violin  with  a  tobacco-pipe,  or  almost 

anything  that  sets  the  strings  in  vibration,  but 

a  good  well-balanced   bow  is   the  indispensable

magic  wand  required  before  the  magician  can 
produce  his  more  subtle  and  amazing  effects.  Up  to  the 
middle  of  the  seventeenth  century,  in  1650,  the  violin  bow 
was  short  and  clumsy,  something  like  our  double  bass  bows, 
only  without  any  clasp  to  keep  the  horse-hair  flat,  or  screw 
to  pull  it  tight.  CORELLI,  in  the  seventeenth  century,  played 
with  an  awkward  bow,  much  curved,  with  hardly  any  elas- 
ticity, and  ill  adapted  to  produce  those  finely  gradated  effects 
in  which  violinists  now  delight.  The  only  idea  of  expression 
these  old  masters  seem  to  have  had,  was  that  of  playing  a 
passage  first  loud  and  then  soft.  TARTINI  (1730),  whose 


VIOLIN  BOWS.  291 

romantic  genius  cliafed  against  the  old  stiff  style,  much 
improved  the  bow,  making  it  thinner,  longer,  more  elastic, 
and,  above  all,  giving  it  the  curve  backwards  instead  o£ 
forwards,  a  peculiarity  which  violin  bows  have  since  retained. 
It  was  not,  however,  until  the  middle  of  the  eighteenth 
century,  that  TOURTE,  at  Paris,  devoted  himself  to  the  final 
improvement  of  the  bow.  He  is  said  to  have  introduced  the 
button  and  screw,  to  have  abolished  the  useless  prolongation 
of  the  point,  and  given  the  violin  bow  that  length  and  sweep 
which  was  afterwards  brought  to  such  perfection,  and  which 
enabled  PAGANINI  and  his  followers  to  effect  a  revolution  in 
the  art  of  violin  playing.  My  plate  will  give  at  a  glance 
the  principal  improvements  in  the  violin  bow. 

It  is  doubtful  whether  any  bow-maker  has  surpassed  our 
own  EDWARD  DODD,  who,  like  so  many  of  the  great  violin- 
makers,  was  very  long-lived,  and  died  in  1810  in  Salisbury 
Court,  Fleet  Street,  aged,  it  is  said,  105  years.  The  usual 
length  of  a  modern  violin  bow  is  about  twenty-nine  inches 
from  top  to  toe. 

In  noticing  the  progress  of  the  violin,  it  is  not  possible 
entirely  to  separate  its  history  from  that  of  some  who  have 
played  upon  it.     Players  and  instruments  have 
ABODT      acted  and  re-acted  upon  one  another  in  a  remark- 
able way.    Nor  does  the  violin  owe  a  trifling  debt 
to  amateurs.     They  have  brought  it  into  notice ;  they  have 
kept    it   there;    tbey  have  paid   the  makers;    they  have

292  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DREAM. 

encouraged  the  professionals.  From  the  earliest  times, 
the  viol  tribe  has  had  a  strange  fascination  for  amateurs, 
and  a  very  curious  list  might  be  made  out  of  its  unpro- 
fessional votaries.  STEPHENS,  in  his  Essays  and  Characters, 
1615,  observes  that  a  fiddler  is,  when  he  plays  well,  a 
delight  only  to  those  who  have  their  hearing ;  but  is,  when 
he  plays  ill,  a  delight  only  for  those  who  have  not  their 
hearing.  But  we  demur  to  this  last  statement:  for  the 
fiddler  is  always  a  delight  unto  himself.  The  bad  player 
from  the  first  is  never  deterred  from  his  absorbing  pur- 
suit by  the  horrible  sounds  which  he  produces.  He  may 
tire  of  the  flute,  cornet,  or  piano ;  but  the  variety  of  screams 
and  scratches  that  can  be  got  out  of  rosined  horse-hair 
rubbed  upon  catgut,  at  once  establishes  the  violin  supreme 
in  variety  and  attraction.  SALOMAN  once  said  to  GEORGE 
III.,  whilst  instructing  that  monarch  in  the  subtle  art, 
"  Fiddlers  may  be  divided  into  three  classes.  To  the  first 
belong  those  who  cannot  play  at  all;  to  the  second,  those 
who  play  badly;  and  to  the  third,  those  who  play  well. 
You,  sire,  have  already  reached  the  second";  which  re- 
minds one  of  HAYDN'S  reply  to  another  royal  personage  who 
was  anxious  to  know  what  the  composer  thought  of  his  per- 
formance, "  Vy,  sir,  your  Highness  plays  like  a  Prince  !  " 

But  fiddlers  did  not  all  at  once  become  the  companions  of 
princes.  Their  music  used  to  be  called  simply  "  noyse." 
Mulligrub,  in  the  Dutch  Courtesan,  says,  "  Oh,  wife  1  oh, 
wife  !  oh,  Jack !  how  does  thy  mother  ?  Is  there  any 


THE   CLERGY  AS  FIDDLERS.  293 

fiddlers   in   the   house  ? "     Mrs.    Mulligrub    replies,    "  Yes ; 
Mr.  Creakes's  noyse/' 

Yet  though  from  the  earliest  times  up  to  the  great 
Cremona  period,  the  small  viol  was  associated  almost  exclu- 
sively with  routs,  pot-houses,  or  at  best  dancing-parties,  the 
clergy  may  claim  the  merit  of  having  been  true  to  it  from 
the  first. 

The  clergyman  of  EDWARD  II/s  time,  when  he  went  out 

into  society  took,  in  addition  to  his  kerchief  and  his  comb, 

his  "  rowbyble,"  otherwise  called  rebella  or  viella.

THE  CLERGY  The  old  viols  were  much  used  in  churches,  and

although  it  was  some  time  betore  the  new- 
fangled violin  was  admitted  into  the  sanctuary,  yet  the 
Brescian  and  Cremonese  models  soon  forced  an  entrance ; 
and  I  have  in  my  possession  a  genuine  GUARNERIUS  which 
has  unfortunately  been  cut  down  in  the  ribs,  and  still 
retains  the  mark  where  a  hook  has  been  fastened  into  the 
back  to  fasten  the  chain  which  went  round  the  player's 
neck,  and  supported  the  violin  whenever  he  had  occasion  in 
processions  to  drop  suddenly  on  his  knees  at  the  elevation 
of  the  Host.  OURY  pointed  out  to  me  the  little  round  hole 
in  the  back,  since  carefully  plugged.  BOURDALOUE,  the 
celebrated  French  preacher,  found  the  violin  indispensable 
to  the  composition  of  some  of  his  sermons.  He  used  to 
say  that  he  often  got  too  depressed  to  treat  his  subjects 
with  the  necessary  vigour  and  variety.  He  would  then 


294  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DEE  AM. 

resort  to  exercise  and  to  a  good  stiff  practice  on  his  violin, 
and  would  find  himself  completely  restored  by  the  process. 
I  am  told  that  DR.  NEWMAN  (now  Cardinal)  is  an  excellent 
violinist.  After  this  we  may  think  the  poet  COWPER  a  little 
hard  on  another  reverend  fiddler — the  excellent  CHARLES 
WESLEY,  who,  at  the  close  of  some  laborious  day,  would 
often  resort  to  his  violin. 

With  wire  and  catgut  he  concludes  the  day, 

is  a  sharp  line  which  the  kind-hearted  poet  is  said  to  have 
regretted  in  his  later  years. 

A  more  graceful  comment  was  called  forth  from  DEAN 
SWIFT,  when  in  his  presence  a  lady's  mantle  or  mantua 
caught  fire  and  injured  a  gentleman's  violin  that  happened 
to  be  lying  near  it : 

"Mantua,  VJE!  miserae  nimium  vicina  Cremona\  " 


The  rise  of  the  violin  in  England  was  greatly  indebted  to 

royal  patronage.     QUEEN  ELIZABETH   was  not  only  in  the 

habit  of  dancing  to  it,  but  presented  a  quaint 

KINGS  AND  but   splendidly  carved  specimen   of  the  iustru-

ment   to    the    EARL    OF    LEICESTER,    preserved 

in  the  South  Kensington  Museum,  in  the  loan  collection, 
numbered  125.  In  1613,  ten  of  the  king's  violinists  received 
one  pound  a-piece  for  performing  at  the  Court  masque.

instructors  of  music  to  PRINCE  HENRY  afterwards  HENRY 
VI.,  had  annuities  of  one  hundred  marks  each.  CHARLES  I. 
was  a  great  patron  of  music,  and  took  lessons  from  MR. 
COPERARIO,  a  line  player  on  the  Viol  di  Gamba.  In  the 
accounts  of  JAMES  I.,  we  find  a  charge  of  forty  pounds  for 
a  set  of  viols  for  the  king.  This  king  did  himself  the  honour 
to  incorporate  the  musicians  of  London,  when  they  had  for 
arms,  "  Azure,  a  swan  argent  within  a  tressure  counter-flure ; 
or,  in  a  chief,  gules,  a  rose  between  lions ;  or,  for  crest,  the 
celestial  sign  Lyra."  And  CHARLES  I.,  in  his  eleventh  year, 
granted  a  charter  to  NICHOLAS  LANIERE  and  others,  styling 
them  "  Marshell  Wardens  and  Cominalty,  of  the  Arts  and 
Science  of  Musick  in  Westminster,  in  the  county  of  Middle- 
sex." But  CHARLES  II.  did  most  for  the  violin  by  giving 
it  the  preference  over  all  the  old  viols  in  his  private  band. 
PEPYS,  in  his  Diary,  lets  us  perceive  the  pride  and  solace 
he  took  in  his  violin.  "21st  November,  1660.  At  night 
to  my  viallin.  The  first  time  I  have  played  on  it  since 
come  to  this  house,  in  my  dining-roome,  and  afterwards 
to  my  lute  there ;  and  I  took  much  pleasure  to  have  the 
neighbours  come  forth  in  the  yard  to  hear  me.  December

and  singing,  I  to  bed,  and  left  my  wife  to  do

296  A    SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DREAM. 

It  is  hardly  necessary  to  observe  that  the  Church  and 
the  aristocracy  now  vied  with  each  other  in  promoting  the 
interest  of  music,  and  especially  in  their  grandes  passions 
for  the  violin.  Amongst  the  exhibitors  at  the  South 
Kensington  I  find  the  names  of  several  clergy,  and  the 
Dukes  of  EDINBURGH  and  of  LEINSTER,  with  many  other 
illustrious  noblemen,  who  have  not  been  slow  in  bringing 
together  several  splendid  instruments  for  exhibition,  some 
of  which  I  shall  have  occasion  to  allude  to  presently. 

A  great  deal  has  lately  been   said   about   the   propriety 

of  ladies  playing  the  violin.     Some  people  seem  to  think  it 

quite  a  novelty,  but  the  practice  in  England  at 

SSvl« 

LADIES  AS  least  is  old  enough.  On  the  painted  roof  of 
VIOLINISTS.  Peterborough  Cathedral,  said  to  be  not  later  than 
1194,  is  depicted  a  female  figure  seated  and  holding  on  her 
lap  a  sort  of  viol  with  four  strings  and  four  sound-holes : 
her  left  hand  grasps  the  head,  whilst  she  draws  a  bow 
across  the  strings  with  her  right.  Amongst  the  royal 
accounts,  November  2,  1495,  we  read,  "  To  a  woman  who 
singeth  with  a  fidell,  2s. ;  the  queen's  male  '  fideler  '  of  the 
period,  Feb.  17,  1497,  was  paid  '  in  rewarde/  £1  6s.  8d." 

Poor  ANNE  OF  CLEVES,  after  her  divorce  from  HENRY 
VIII.,  amused  herself  sometimes  by  playing  on  a  sort 
of  viol  with  six  strings  and  frets,  but  no  distinct  finger- 
board. From  a  ballad  in  CHARLES  I.'s  reign,  I  find  that 
the  art  of  viol  playing  was  not  uncommon  amongst 


LADIES  AS    VIOLINISTS.  297 

ladies  ;  and  amongst  the  accomplishments  of  a  lady,  we 
read  that — 

She  sings  and  she  plays 
And  she  knows  all  the  keys 
Of  the  viol  de  Gamha  and  lute. 

In  more  modern  times  ladies  have  excelled  on  the  violin. 
MOZART  wrote  a  sonata  for  REGINA  SCHLICK,  born  at  Mantua, 
1764.  LOUISE  GAUTHEROT,  a  Frenchwoman,  was  also  dis- 
tinguished for  her  concertos  played  at  the  London  Oratorio 
Concerts,  1789-90.  LUIGA  GERBINI,  a  pupil  of  the  cele- 
brated VIOTTI,  played  solos  at  Lisbon  in  1799,  and  afterwards 
visited  London  in  1801.  SIGNORA  PARAVICINI,  another  of 
VIOTTI'S  pupils,  was  a  favourite  of  JOSEPHINE,  the  wife  of 
BUONAPARTE.  She  afterwards  grew  so  poor  as  to  be  obliged 
to  part  with  most  of  her  wardrobe,  but  was  charitably  helped 
by  some  generous  Italians  at  Milan.  In  1827  she  was  much 
admired,  and  in  the  words  of  a  poet — 

Flourished  her  bow  and  showed  how  fame  was  won. 

She  played  at  Bologna  as  late  as  1832.  The  names  of 
MESDAMES  KRAHMEN,  SCHULTZ,  ELEONORA  NEUMANN,  and 
FILIPOWICZ,  will  be  familiar  to  some  of  our  readers,  whilst 
few  living  musicians  will  need  to  be  reminded  of  MDLLE. 
SOPHIE  HUMLER  and  MADAME  NORMAN-NEUUDA. 

It  was,  I  believe,  once  maintained  that  the  arm  of  a 
lean  was  more  fit  for  a  lady  than  a  bow  arm ;  but  that 
prejudice  has  now  happily  vanished.  Indeed  nothing  can 


298  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DREAM. 

be  more  appropriate  in  a  lady's  hands  than  a  violin 
properly  held  and  properly  played.  If  she  have  a  good 
arm  it  is  shown  to  the  best  advantage ;  if  she  have  a  pretty 
hand  and  tapering  fingers,  and  a  slender  wrist,  all  these 
are  thrown  into  the  most  graceful  positions  by  the  action 
of  bowing  and  fingering. 

Her  arms,  shoulders,  and  hands,  her  head  and  neck,  and 
indeed  her  whole  body,  have  but  to  follow  sympathetically 
the  undulating  and  delicate  curves  of  the  violin  itself.  A 
beautiful  woman  holding  a  beautiful  violin  is  one  of  the 
most  beautiful  sights  in  the  world.  There  are  refinements 
of  sentiment  and  of  execution,  which  a  woman's  sensitive 
hand  is  peculiarly  fitted  to  render ;  in  delicacy  of  touch  and 
finely  gradated  effects  she  is  unsurpassed,  and  although 
usually  deficient  in  roundness  of  tone,  yet  both  in  rapidity 
of  execution  and  in  fine  feeling,  have  we  not  lately  seen 
in  the  case  of  MADAME  NORMAN-NERUDA  quid  famina 
possit  \ 

Some  of  our  readers  may  be  interested  to  know  the  names

two  figures  being  always  written  in  MS.,  a  common  practice 
with  the  old  makers,  who  sometimes  even  wrote  the  whole 
label  proprid  manu.  The  forgeries,  on  the  other  hand,  have 
often  the  whole  label  printed.  LINDLEY,  the  great  violon- 
cello player,  seems  to  have  been  strangely  partial  to  English 
makers.  He  made  his  debut  on  a  THOMAS  SMITH,  whose 
instruments  average  from  five  to  eight  pounds ;  and  for 
nearly  forty  years  he  played  at  the  Italian  Opera  on  a  WIL- 
LIAM FORSTER,  which  he  surnamed  "The  Eclipse."  SIGNOK 
PIATTI  owns  a  splendid  STAINER  tenor,  lately  exhibited  in  the 
South  Kensington  Museum.  DE  BERIOT,  oddly  enough, 
chose,  for  many  years,  to  play  on  a  MARIANI,  of  Brescia, 
(1570-1620),  by  no  means  one  of  the  first  makers;  indeed, 
he  lived  before  the  splendid  Cremonese  period,  and  followed 
the  models  of  MAGGINI.  OLE  BULL  possessed  a  remarkably 
fine  MAGGINI,  with  Caryatides,  said  to  be  by  BENVENUTO 
CELLINI.  In  1861,  M.  VIEUXTEMPS  used  a  LORENZO  STORIONI 
(about  1782).  This  maker  was  the  last  of  the  old  Cremonese 
school.  He  made" on  the  model  of  JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS,  and 
his  tone  was  much  admired.  M.  JOACHIM,  I  believe,  plays 
habitually  on  a  fine  STRADIVARIUS.  PROFESSOR  ELLA  informs 
me  that  MOLIQUE,  PIATTI,  AUER,  and  others  have  made  their 
debut  upon  inferior  instruments,  and  only  acquired  their  full 
reputation  when  later  they  became  possessed  of  fine  violins. 
Many  aspirants  to  fame  have  had  to  thank  the  Professor  .for 


300  A  SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DEE  AM. 

the  loan  of  his  GUARNERIUS  and  STRADIVARIUS  at  the  Musical 
Union  Concerts.  But  it  must  be  remembered  that  most 
violinists  have  several  instruments  with  different  qualities, 
suitable  for  different  occasions,  and,  like  other  men,  they 
are  liable  to  part  with  their  instruments  and  acquire 
others. 

I  will  now  ask  the  reader  to  look  with  me  a  little  more 

closely   at   that   Loan   Collection   of   1872    in    the    South 

233.        Kensington   Museum,  which  I  have   from   time 


to  time  referred  to  in  the   course   of  this  pro- 

TIIE  LOAN 


A  CBITICISM 
ON  THE  LOAN 

COLLECTION,  tracted  meditation.  That  exhibition,  though  now 
closed,  has  an  interest  and  significance  for  all  lovers  of  violins 
far  beyond  the  limits  of  a  few  show-months.  The  instru- 
ments are  most  of  them  more  or  less  historical.  Each  is 
known  to  a  large  circle  of  admirers ;  some  have  a  world- 
wide reputation,  whilst  a  few  have  been  puffed  into  notice 
and  clearly  over-rated.  Under  these  circumstances,  in  the 
interests  of  Art,  I  shall  not  hesitate  to  place  on  record  some 
judgments  upon  them  which,  I  trust,  may  have  more  than 
an  ephemeral  value. 

Let  us  once  more  approach  these  fascinating  glass-cases, 
determined  to  see  all  that  can  be  seen,  and  lay  it  to  heart. 
At  first  the  eager  student  will  probably  be  disappointed. 
They  all  look  to  him  so  much  alike;  is  there  really  the 
difference  between  £20  and  £600  in  the  instruments  before 
him?  I  remember  that  my  first  visit  to  the  Italian 


CRITICISM  ON  THE  LOAN  COLLECTION.      301 

picture-galleries  filled  me  with  the  same  feeling  of  puzzled 
disappointment.  The  pictures  I  liked  were  seldom  the 
best;  all  the  browns  were  much  alike,  and  one  old  master 
seemed  little  different  from  another ;  above  all,  a  fine  copy 
looked  quite  as  good  as,  or  rather  better  than,  the  original. 
It  is  only  after  looking,  and  looking  for  months,  for  years, 
that  the  old  painters  reveal  themselves ;  and  it  is  only  by 
examining  and  brooding  over  violins  that  the  characteristics 
of  each  master  slowly  come  out  beyond  a  shadow  of  a 
doubt,  until  we  may  be  said  to  know  a  good  fiddle  when  we 
see  it. 

Let  us  examine  first,  one  case  containing  three  violins, 

lent  by  M.   VUILLAUME,  which  is   in  some  respects  more 

interesting  than   all  the  rest  put  together.      It

contains  the  unique  "Messie  "  STRADIVARIUS  (91): 

THE  MESSIE. 

its  history  is.  romantic.  It  was  finished  in  1716, 
and  until  a  few  years  ago  had  never  been  played  on  at 
all.  It  was  bought  in  1760  by  the  COUNT  Cozio  DE 
SALABUE,  who  never  played  it,  but  kept  it  spotless,  like 
some  rare  jewel,  till  his  death.  His  heirs  sold  it  to 
LUIGI  TARISIO,  who  kept  it  jealously  without  allowing  any- 
one even  to  see  it.  At  his  death,  in  1854,  it  was  hidden 
away  in  the  "  Ferme  de  la  Croix,"  near  the  little  village  of 
Fontanelle,  Navarre.  There  M.  VUILLAUME  rediscovered 
it  in  January  1855,  and  upon  breaking  its  silence  for  the 
first  time  discovered  that  it  possessed  all  the  finest  qualities 


302  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  LEE  AM. 

of  the  finest  STRADIVARIUS  violins,  although  it  had  never 
been  played  upon  until  then. 

\Ye  stand  reverently  before  it — fresh  from  the  great 
master's  hand,  as  though  finished  yesterday — it  is  for  the 
first  time  unveiled  in  all  its  intact  glory  to  the  gaze  of  thou- 
sands to  whom  for  years  it  has  been  a  kind  of  myth.  It  is 
as  though  the  ivory  Minerva  of  PHIDIAS  that  stood  once 
in  the  Parthenon,  should  be  discovered  hidden  away  with 
the  utmost  care  in  some  deep,  dry,  and  hermetically  sealed 
sepulchre  of  the  East,  and  brought  over  scathless  to  be  set 
up  amidst  the  Elgin  fragments,  the  only  perfect  relic  of  them 
all.  So  stands  this  matchless  new  violin  amidst  its  time- 
worn,  rubbed,  and  fractured  brethren. 

It  is  of  the  grand  pattern,  and  yet,  as  in  Milan  Cathedral, 
beauty  rather  than  power  is  its  distinguishing  characteristic; 
it  is  massive  without  looking  massive ;  its  strength  is  hidden 
beneath  its  grace.  The  back  is  in  two  parts,  the  wood  very 
choice.  The  fine  graining  of  the  flat  belly  is  remarkable. 
The  holes  are  delicately  cut,  the  left  /  a  shade  lower  than 
the  right — a  practice  so  common  that  it  must  have  been 
intentional  with  STRADIVARIUS — his  fine  eye  not  tolerating 
even  there  the  suspicion  of  mechanical  work.  "We  see  in  this 
violin  alone  what  the  perfect  STRADIVARIUS  corners  were ;  in 
every  other  known  specimen  the  varnish  and  the  wood  are 
both  rubbed.  In  the  "  Messiah  "  they  are  untouched  and 
clean-looking,  wondrously  sharp  and  wide-awake,  yet  without 
vulgarity,  and  of  a  perfect  finish. 


THE  MESSIE.  303 

The  case  and  neatness  of  the  purfiing,  which  has,  of  course, 
never  been  repaired,  is  incomparable,  and  over  the  whole 
instrument  lies  a  thick,  rich,  red-brown  varnish,  wondrous 
to  behold ;  the  washing  of  it  is  level  and  lavish,  and  unworn 
by  time  or  use.  The  brush  seems  to  have  left  it  about 
a  week — it  is  hanging  up  in  the  warm  workshop  at  Cremona, 
and  has  just  dried  with  all  the  glitter  fresh  upon  it.  The 
neck  has  been  skilfully  lengthened  by  M.  VUILLAUME  ;  but 
in  order  to  avoid  touching  the  fabric  he  has  inserted  a  piece 
of  wood  flat  between  the  heel  and  the  rib  instead  of  cutting 
into  the  internal  block  :  the  usual  method  adopted  in  length- 
ening the  old  fiddle  necks  for  modern  use. 

The  head  is  light  and  graceful  rather  than  heavy  or  power- 
ful, the  scroll  thrown  off  like  a  ribbon  lightly  curled  around 
the  finger  and  drawn  in ;  one  side  of  the  scroll  is  slightly 
lower  than  the  other,  the  fluting  smooth,  with  a  surface  like 
that  of  clear  and  still  water,  and  the  lines  of  the  scroll  are 
picked  out  with  a  thick  rim  of  brown  paint  or  varnish  that 
serves  to  accentuate  the  outlines  of  the  head  just  as  purfling 
calls  attention  to  the  contour  of  the  back  and  belly.  In 
every  other  violin  this  black  head-rim  has  been  almost 
entirely  effaced,  but  in  the  "  Messiah  ''  it  remains  to  show 
us  the  maker's  intention.  He  meant  you  to  take  up  his 
violin  and  to  see  at  a  glance  its  whole  outline,  traced  and 
emphasized  by  a  sharp  purfling  carried  out  in  the  head  by 
a  deep  rim  of  black  varnish.  This  brooding  over  the  beauty 
of  curves,  this  anxiety  that  they  should  be  manifest  to  all 


304  A 

men,  is  most  instructive  and  touching ;  neither  the  purfling 
nor  the  black  paint  added  to  the  tone,  or  even  the  preser- 
vation of  the  instrument,  it  was  the  art  instinct  of  the  old 
makers  piercing  the  manufacture. 

By  the  side  of  the  "  Messie  "  hangs  the  "  Pucelle  "  violin 

of  STRADIVARIUS.     It,  also,  has  a  history.     It  bears  a  label 

1709;    it    has  been   very   little   played   on;    it 

^OO. 

THE  came  to  Paris  in  1840 ;  it  passed  into  the  hands 
of  M.  LEROY,  banquier,  and  at  his  death  went 
to  his  heir,  M.  GLANDAZ.  It  is  of  the  grand  pattern ; 
purfling  repaired  under  the  left  or  chin  side ;  the  f's  boldly 
cut  and  coarser  than  in  the  "Messiah/'  and  it  seems  to 
lack  the  absolute  sense  of  proportion  between  the  top 
and  bottom,  which  gives  to  the  ' '  Messiah "  its  regal 
breadth  and  freedom  of  outline.  The  head  is  powerful, 
though  less  happy  than  some  others ;  it  bears  remains  of 
the  black  paint  on  the  scroll ;  the  varnish  is  thick  and  rich 
in  colour,  browner  and  yellower  than  in  the  "  Messiah/' 
which  is  reddish.  The  back  is  in  two  parts,  and  the  belly 
rises  in  excess  of  the  "  Messiah."  A  STRADIVARIUS  violin, 
lent  by  M.  E.  LECOMTE  (87),  is  finer  than  the  "  Pucelle/' 
although  the  head  is  doubtful — probably  an  old  French  head 
— in  other  respects  it  is  a  masterpiece.  One  of  the  late

without  being  properly  carried  out.  93,  in  the  "  Messie "

"Messie"  as  a  lion  to  a  race-horse;  the  wood  of  the  belly 
is  splendid,  so  is  the  work  throughout,  but  the  conception 
is  all  for  power  and  breadth,  and  the  workman's  tools  were 
probably  inferior  to  those  of  STRADIVARIUS.  94,  dated  1735,

1734. 

There  are  no  less  than  five  basses  once  the  property  of

DRAGONETTI'S  him  to  the  DUKE  OF  LEINSTER,  which  would 

require  a  ladder  to  climb  up  to  its  head,  stands 
alone,  like  the  Pyramid  of  Cheops,  looking  down  upon  a 
race  of  pigmies ;  but  besides  size  and  ugliness  it  has  no 
special  qualities.  109  is  one  of  the  finest  Bergonzis  I

miniature  violins  for  children,  all  fine  and  all  genuine. 
Two  are  by  STRADIVARIUS,  one  by  JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS,  and 
one  an  AMATI.  They  are  the  exquisite  bantams  of  the  craft. 
We  must  pass  over  several  interesting  specimens,  but  before 
we  leave  these  cases  we  must  note  a  few  sad  sights. 

First,  the  QUEEN'S  AMATI  has  been  dreadfully  cut  down : 

it  bears  a  raised  pattern  all  round  the  belly,  the  old  edge  is 

gone,  and  the  purfling  has  doubtless  been  injured,

but  not  so  badly.  Strange  to  say,  147,  doubtless  a  NICHOLAS 
AMATI,  hung — although  the  error  was  pointed  out;  to  the

end  of  the  Exhibition — urder  the  name  of  a  MAGGINI  viola  ! 
A  KLOTZ  tenor,  belonging  to  the  DUKE  OF  EDINBURGH,  was 
called  a  STAINER,  and  hung  as  such.  As  it  is  an  obvions 
KLOTZ,  and  as  this,  too,  was  pointed  out,  it  should  have  been 
removed,  especially  as  other  violins,  e.g.  a  spurious  BERGONZI 
(110),  sent  in  by  MR.  J.  W.  JOYCE,  was  judiciously  removed 
after  being  hung.  It  is  curious  that  the  most  glaring 
blot  of  all  in  this  remarkable  collection  should  have  been 
suffered  to  remain  to  the  close  of  the  Exhibition  without 
a  word  of  apology  or  explanation  long  after  the  spurious 
instrument  had  been  fully  exposed,  and  its  history  given 
in  detail.  I  allude  to  the  famous  so-called  MAGGIXI 
violin,  sent  up  by  MR.  J.  W.  JOYCE,  and  hung  by  the 
judges. 

This  violin  (No.  112),  is  now  well  known  not  to  have 
been  made  by  MAGGINI  200  years  ago,  but  to  have  been 
copied  by  BERNHARD  FENDT,  about  forty  years  ago.  It 
was  bought  by  worthy  MR.  STANHARD,  who  fiddled  on 
it  much  in  the  Portsmouth  Theatre.  His  widow  adver- 
tised it  in  the  Clerkenwell  News,  and  it  was  sold  for  a 
few  pounds  to  MR.  NASH,  a  barber  in  the  Commercial 
Road.  It  then  passed  into  the  hands  of  REV.  THOMAS 
MAWKES.  At  last  it  got  into  the  possession  of  MR.  J. 
W.  JOYCE,  and  was  offered  with  another  spurious  instru- 
ment as  a  MAGGINI  violin  to  the  South  Kensington 
Museum  Loan  Exhibition.  And  there  it  hung,  rejoicing 
in  its  ill-gotten  fame,  like  a  second  Claimant,  in  the  teeth

of  constant  exposure  and  derision.  "Where  the  deception 
rests,  it  is  not  for  me  to  say.  These  statements,  which  I 
have  repeated  in  print  several  times,  have  been  received  in 
perfect  silence  by  all  parties  concerned;  and  until  that 
silence  of  living  witnesses  is  broken  we  must  in  honour 
acquit  everybody  of  fraud,  and  suppose  that  they  have  all 
been  taken  in ;  but  the  story  is  highly  instructive,  as 
showing  the  care  required  in  passing  judgment  on  old 
violins,  and,  I  may  add,  the  extreme  unwillingness  of  self- 
elected  connoisseurs  to  admit  that  they  have  been  taken  in. 

I    now  part  with  our  "old  violins "  with  feelings  not 

unmingled    with    regret;    the  very  sums    of  money  given 

for    them    bear    witness    to    their    strange   in- 

definite   value  and  importance.      The  owner   of

the  "Messie"  refused  600  guineas  for  that 
unique  gem,  whilst  800  and  even  1,000  guineas  have  been 
offered  by  some  who  could  not  get  their  favourites  for  less. 

And  what  is  it  that  we  pay  for  ?  A  little  wood,  varnish, 
paint — a  few  shillings  would  buy  all  the  materials;  the 
simplest  mechanical  knowledge  is  sufficient  to  cut  up  and 
put  together  the  common  fiddle,  which  is  now  sold  for  ten  or 
fifteen  shillings,  and  looks  to  the  novice  so  much  more 
desirable  than  the  "  Messie,"  or  "  Pucelle,"  though  not 
unlike  them.  Then  what  do  we  pay  for  ?  We  pay  for  what 
no  money  can  produce  again ;  we  pay  for  conditions  that 
have  passed  away ;  we  pay  for  the  inspiration  of  a  matchless

workman,  and  a  subtle  soul  infused  into  elements  which  seem 
beggarly,  but  have  become  priceless ;  we  pay  for  the  concen- 
trated experience  of  not  one  life,  but  many,  put  into  a  curve 
or  a  fluting — for  a  few  thin  plates  of  wood  fixed  together 
with  an  instinct  that  is  dead,  but  that  ere  it  died  made  those 
slips  of  wood  almost  immortal.  There  is  no  reason  why  the 
violin  should  ever  wear  out.  It  grows  old  with  its  perpetual 
youth.  It  sings  over  the  grave  of  many  generations.  Time, 
that  sometimes  robs  it  of  a  little  varnish,  has  no  power  over 
its  anointed  fabric — it  need  never  be  battered.  The  Joan 
Carlino  viol  is  320  years  old,  and  still  almost  without  a 
scratch.  I  wish  to  believe  it  genuine.  The  hard  perennial 
substance  steeped  in  the  silicate-like  varnish,  has  well-nigh 
turned  to  stone,  but  without  losing  a  single  quality  of  sweet- 
ness or  resonance.  The  violin  is  the  only  fossil  which  still 
lives,  and  lives  with  a  fulness  of  life  and  freshness  that 
contrasts  mysteriously  enough  with  the  failing,  sickly,  and 
withering  generations  of  man.  Even  should  mishaps  bruise 
or  break  its  beauty,  it  can  be  endlessly  restored — it  is  never 
fit  for  death ;  it  survives  a  thousand  calamities ;  nay,  even 
when  cut  up,  dismembered,  its  several  parts  scattered 
through  a  dozen  workshops  and  through  500  years,  live 
on  with  a  kind  of  metempsychosis  in  new  forms,  and 
still  cling  strangely  to  their  individuality,  so  that  men, 
taking  up  a  patchwork  violin,  say — it  is  fine,  the  front  is 
poor,  the  head  is  tame ;  but  then,  see,  here  is  a  Stradivarius 
back. 


310  A   SOUTH  KENSINGTON  DREAM. 

Thus  human  in  its  power  and  pathos,  and  superhuman  in 
its  immortal  fabric,  the  violin  reigns  the  prince  of  all  instru- 
ments, and  in  the  hands  of  a  PAGANINI,  an  ERNST,  or  a 
JOACHIM,  the  joy  and  wonder  of  the  civilised  world. 

Note  on  the  Plate.  It  is  next  to  impossible  to  draw  a  violin  outline. 
The  diagram  does  not  profess  to  be  quite  accurate.  Even  photography 
seems  to  fail,  as  it  cannot  render  truly  the  all-important  variations  of 
surface.  The  difference  between  a  Guarnerius  and  a  Stradivarius  would 
hardly  be  appreciable  in  outline  to  an  untrained  eye.  I  have  omitted  to 
give  more  than  one  head  scroll,  because  of  the  subtlety ;  and  I  have  left 
out  the  double  bass,  because  of  its  size.  The  "  Kits  "  are  almost 
dummies,  used  chiefly  by  dancing  masters.

Yet  there  is  a  caprice  in  memory ;  one  is  taken  and 
another  left.  As  I  write,  CARLYLE'S  house  in  Cheyne  Row  is 
a"bout  to  be  sold — some  say  demolished.  I  had  great  diffi- 
culty, a  few  years  ago,  in  discovering  MAZZINI'S  house  in  the 
Fulham  Road.  Germany  is  thought  to  be  more  careful  of 
such  associations.  I  certainly  notice  the  alacrity  with  which 
statues  of  her  poets,  councillors,  and  musicians,  are  placed  in 
five  town  squares  and  parks ;  but  only  the  other  day,  when  I

was  at  Leipsic,  I  was  struck  by  a  singular  case  of  oblivion 
and  neglect.  I  inquired  at  Leipsic  for  the  house  in  which 
MENDELSSOHN  had  lived  and  died.  At  last  I  found  it.  My 
search  was  not  so  prolonged  or  so  interesting  as  in  the  case 
of  the  house  of  STRADIVARIUS  at  Cremona. 

I  found  the  house   to   be   No.   21    Konig-strasse.     The 

memorial  tablet  mentioned  by  BAEDEKER  was  gone.    I  made 

24i.         many  fruitless  inquiries.     Good   MR.    REUTER, 


i  VISIT      w|10  iived  there,  at  once  left  his  office  in  the 
MENDELS- 
SOHN'S HOUSE,  yard,    and  took   me   into   the  rooms  where   so 

much  of  the  loveliest  music  was  conceived  and  written 
between  1835-1847.  The  spacious  flat  of  nine  rooms  all 
belonged  to  FELIX  MENDELSSOHN.  MR.  REUTER  showed  me 
the  large  reception-room,  and  then  took  me  into  the  sitting- 
room  and  bed-room,  in  which  last  the  composer  died.  It  is 
a  little  room,  and  those  who  remember  the  account  of  his 
death,  and  the  numbers  of  people  who  seem  to  have  been 
in  and  out  of  the  room,  can  see  at  a  glance  how  natural 
this  was  —  supposing  the  sitting-room  adjoining  to  have 
been  full  of  friends.  The  court-yard,  now  used  for  bales 
of  merchandise,  and  paved,  was  a  garden  in  MENDELSSOHN'S 
time,  and  he  lived  in  the  back  of  the  house,  and  latterly 
almost  in  two  rooms,  because  of  the  quiet  of  the  place. 
The  B,EUTERS  have  had  the  fabric  restored,  and  partitions 
removed,  so  that  the  house  is  substantially  as  MENDELSSOHN 
left  it;  but  the  bustle  and  commerce  of  Leipsic  has  enor-

the  place  knows  him  no  more. 

The  world  seems  to  have  little  need  of  the  best  of  us

STRADIVARIUS — he  is  more  alive  now  in  the  hearts  of  men 
than  ever  he  was  at  Cremona. 

After  200  years,  every  trace  of  his  handiwork  is  eagerly 
sought  out.  Bits  of  it  are  thankfully,  and  not  always 
honestly,  secured.  Time  only  increases  our  interest  in

imitators.  The  rumour  of  a  new  STRADIVARIUS  is  like  the 
rumour  of  a  new  RAPHAEL — the  civilised  world  competes  for 
the  prize,  and  the  sums  which  have  been  given  for  one  of 
his  violins — enormous  as  they  may  seem  for  a  few  thin 
strips  of  wood  varnished  and  glued  together — are  probably 
nothing  to  the  sums  that  a  fine  example  of  the  master  will 
fetch  in  the  course  of  the  next  hundred  years.  Yet  this 
man  sold  his  violins  for  four  pounds  apiece,  and  a  consign- 
ment of  STRADIVARIUS  violins  sent  to  London  in  the  last 
century  were  sent  back  to  Italy  again,  and  no  one  seemed 
willing  to  buy  them,  even  at  that  moderate  figure.  I  suppose 
in  these  days  the  city  of  Cremona  is  known  to  the  outside 
world  chiefly  as  the  residence  of  STRADIVARIUS.  I  will  now 
relate  what  befell  me  when  I  made  a  pilgrimage  to  that 
city  in  the  year  1880  to  seek  for  the  house  of  ANTONIUS 
STRADIVARIUS. 


VI. 

STEADIVAEIUS    OF    CEEMONA  —  HIS    HOUSE. 

FOR  years  I  had  said  to  myself,  I  will  go  and  see  this  house 
at    Cremona.        The  violin   is    the    king  of   instruments. 
STRADIVARIUS  is  the  king  of  violin-makers.     In 
short  space  of  about  130  years,  from  1600 


'  to   1730,  all  the   greatest   violins   in   the   world 
were  made.     They  sold  the  best  of  them  for  10  golden  louis, 


MY  THOUGHTS  AT  BKESCIA.  315 

they  sell  the  best  of  them  for  from  300  to  1,000  guineas. 
I  was  at  Brescia.  There,  before  1600,  worked  the  fathers 
of  the  violin — the  men  who  began  to  get  rid,  one  after 
another,  of  those  lets  and  hindrances  to  tone,  of  those  tubby 
shapes  and  faulty  proportions  which  belong  to  the  ancient 
Viol  tribe.  The  names  of  MAGGINI  and  GASPAB  m  SALO  are 
for  ever  associated  with  those  early  experiments  and  with 
Brescia.  They  paved  the  way.  They  struck  the  types, 
violin,  viola,  violoncello,  and  double-bass  out  of  the  host 
of  nondescript  viols,  Viol  da  Gamba,  Viole  d'Amore,  Violetti, 
&c.  &c.  They  decided  upon  the  survival  of  the  fittest — on 
what  has  actually  survived — they  paved  the  way  for  Cremona. 
Yet  at  Brescia  their  houses  are  unknown,  there  are  no  relics 
of  them.  Their  only  relics  are  in  the  hands  of  a  few 
amateurs  and  a  few  museums.  MB.  TYSSEN-AMHERST  has 
perhaps  the  finest  known  Gaspar  violin ;  the  Gaspar  basses 
are  more  numerous.  DRAGONETTI'S  monster  Gaspar  is  in  the 
South  Kensington — the  only  instrument  by  any  decent  violin- 
maker  that  is  now  in  that  museum.  MR.  ENTHOVEN  has 
perhaps  the  finest  known  Maggini.  And  so  the  Brescian 
school,  full  of  unique  significance  as  it  was,  died  and  was 
buried,  but  not  before  it  had  yielded  up  its  secrets  to  the 
AMATIS  and  GUARNERII  who  settled  at  Cremona.  In  the 
great  square  of  St.  Domenico  the  AMATI  set  up  their  shop  ; 
later,  next  door  to  them,  worked  the  GUARNERII.  About 
1760,  the  young  man  named  ANTONIUS  STRADIVARI,  or 
STRADIVARIUS,  became,  as  we  have  seen,  the  devoted  pupil 


31G    STEADIVARIUS  OF  CREMONA— HIS  HOUSE. 

of  NICOLAS,  the  greatest  of  the  AMATI.  ANDREW  GUAR- 
NERIUS  worked  in  the  same  room  with  him.  ANTHONY 
copied  NICOLAS'S  work  as  closely  as  he  could;  for  more 
than  twenty  years  he  did  little  but  copy. 

These  three  names  —  AMATI,  the  GUARNERII,  STRADI- 
VARIUS — there  be  none  like  them ;  these  three  shops, 
almost  next  door  to  each  other,  opposite  the  big  church 
of  St.  Dominic — there  never  were,  nor  will  be,  three 
such  shops.  In  them  were  made,  in  long  quiet  years  of 
peaceful,  sunny  labour,  in  steady  and  friendly  rivalry,  all  the 
great  violins  in  the  world — the  Joseph  Guarnerius  on  which 
PAGANINI  played,  now  in  the  town-hall  at  Genoa ;  the  Stradi- 
varius  on  which  ERNST,  and  now  MADAME  NORMAN-NERUDA, 
plays ;  PIATTI'S  violoncello ;  JOACHIM'S  and  WILHELMJ'S 
"  Strads."  And  the  charm  of  these  Brescian  and  Cremonese 
schools  lies  here,  that  in  those  days  violin-making  was  a 
living,  growing  art,  as  Gothic  architecture  once  was.  Each 
maker  was  a  discoverer  with  the  enthusiasm  and  excitement 
of  the  unknown  upon  him,  working  out  problems  of  tone, 
studying  form,  material,  method,  technique,  with  a  view  to 
new  effects;  spending  a  life-time  over  it.  I  have  already 
shown  at  length  how  with  STRADIVARIUS  the  art  culminated, 
all  was  done  that  could  be  done ;  tone,  sweetness,  power, 
sensibility,  sonority,  all  was  won;  and  then  the  decline 
set  in,  love  waxed  cold,  and  men  could  no  more  reproduce 
the  old  work  than  they  could  paint  the  old  pictures,  or 
carve  the  old  statues,  or  build  the  old  cathedrals 


NOT  KNOWN.  317 

So  I  said  to  myself  at  Brescia,  I  will  go  and  see  where 
the  great  STRADIVARIUS  lived  for  ninety-three  years,  and 
loved  and  laboured  with  such  absorbed  and  steadfast  earnest- 
ness and  such  wondrous  cunning,  that  for  180  years  hardly 
a  capital  of  the  civilised  world  has  ceased  to  do  homage  to 
his  power,  a  power  that  is  felt  and  loved  ever  more  and  more, 
and  looked  forward  to  year  by  year,  as,  with  the  return 
of  JOACHIM,  SARASATE,  NORMAN-NERUDA,  WILHELMJ,  the 
mighty  soul  of  STRADIVARIUS  again  speaks  to  thousands, 
and  with  one  touch  of  nature  makes  the  whole  world  kin. 

Everyone,  I  said,  will  know  the  house  of  STRADIVARIUS  at 

Cremona ;    not   even  the   magnificent   cathedral,   with    its

known  to  the  outside  world  by  nothing  else. 

So  I  got  into  a  cab  at  the  station. 

"Drive,"  said  I,  "to  the  casa  of  ANTONIUS  STRADIVARI. '' 

"  What  casa?"  said  the  man;  "I  do  not  know  the  name/' 

"  Not  know  the  name  of  STRADIVARIUS,  the  great  violin- 
maker  !  " 

"  I  don't  think  he  lives  here;  they  don't  make  violins  at 
Cremona." 

"  Perhaps  not,"  said  I,  a  little  nettled,  "  but  they  used  to. 
STRADIVARIUS,  and  JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS,  and  the  AMATI 
made  them." 

"  Upon   my  oath   and   the  holy  name  of  the  Virgin^  I

assure  you,  Siguor,  they  never  made  any  violins  at  Cremona ; 
you  are  mistaken." 

The  driver's  temper  was  giving  way,  so  was  mine. 

"  Per  Bacco  ! "  said  I,  as  I  thought  under  the  circum- 
stances I  might  swear  by  a  heathen  god ;  "  drive  to  the 
cathedral !  " 

So  he  drove. 

The  splendour  of  those  red  marble  lions  couchant,  sup- 
porting the  marble  columns  both  of  the  cathedral  porch  and 
of  the  adjacent  baptistery,  the  exquisite  terra- 

TO  THE  cotta  work  and  double  colonnaded  facade,  and 
the  great  Campanile,  at  any  other  time  would 
have  tempted  me  to  linger,  but  not  now.  I  entered  and 
cast  but  a  languid  eye  upon  the  rich  and  ancient  tapestries 
and  profuse  decoration  in  mosaic  and  fresco  which  cover 
every  inch  of  the  interior.  The  sacristan  was  lighting  a 
few  candles  in  the  darkness  over  the  high  altar.  I  made 
towards  him;  he  came  down.  . 

"  Can  you  tell  me  where  STRADIVARIUS  is  buried  ?  "  said 
I,  thinking  it  might  be  better  to  begin  at  the  other  end 
this  time. 

"  Oh,  Signor,"  he  said  with  a  smile,  "  thank  the  blessed 
saints  and  all  the  martyrs,  STRADIVARIUS  is  not  dead;  the 
avocat  is  alive  and  in  good  health  !  •" 

"  Ah,  well/'  said  I,  "  but  where  would  he  be  buried  if 
he  were  dead  ?  " 


THE  CITIZENS  OF  CREMONA.  319 

"  You  mean,  where  is  the  family  sepulchre  ?  I  should 
think  it  would  be  in  the  Campo  Santo  :  it  is  not  here.  But 
I  can  show  you  the  house  of  STRADIVARI  the  avocat,  it  is 
number  three  in  the  Corso  Porta  Roma,"  and  he  politely 
came  out  of  the  cathedral  and  showed  me  the  way. 

I  shall  now  get  on  the  scent.  This  advocate  is  no  doubt 
a  descendant ;  he  will  be  able  to  tell  me  all  that  is  known. 
I  rang  at  the  bell.  Alas  !  the  advocate  was  out  of  town,  gone 
to  Milan,  so  were  all  the  family. 

I  got  into  another  cab. 

"  Do  you  know  the  Piazza  of  Domenico  ?  "  I  said,  this 

time  approaching  the  subject  warily. 
THE  CITIZENS     "  There  is  no  such  place,  Signer."     This  fairly 

OF  CEEMOKA.       ,  j 

staggered  me. 

"  "Well,"  I  said,  "  I  know  the  church  has  been  pulled  down, 
but  can  you  show  me  where  it  stood  ?  " 

"Ah! "  said  the  man,  "yes;  they  call  it  now  the  Piazza 
Roma." 

"  'Tis  this  abominable  centralising  spirit/'  I  growled  to 
myself ;  f '  this  conceited  new  country,  this  pert  Italia  Una ; 
can  they  not  leave  Tuscany  alone  ?  Piazza  Roma  !  forsooth, 
what  has  Roma  got  to  do  with  Cremona  ?  I  don't  mind 
yonder  VIA  GARIBALDI,  for  he  did  as  much  for  the  north  as 
for  the  south ;  and  VICTOR  EMANUEL  may  have  his  statue 
here  too,  for  he  was  a  gallant  Piedmontese ;  but  why  is  Rome 
to  come  in  and  rub  out  the  square  sacred  to  St.  Dominic, 


320     STEADIVARIUS  OF  CEEMONA—HIS  HOUSE. 

and  destroy  the  very  name  dear  to  the  memories  and  sacred 
to  the  sepulchres  of  the  AMATI  and  of  STRADIVARIUS  ?  " 

"  Drive/'  I  said,  "  to  that  square/'  and  he  drove. 

Then  I  stopped,  and  stood  up  in  the  carriage,  and  accosted 
my  man  much  as  follows  :  "  My  friend,  do  you  not  know 
that  in  this  ancient  square  of  St.  Dominic  lived  and  worked 
those  great  violin-makers  who  have  made  your  city  famous 
throughout  the  world,  and  that  here  somewhere  is  still  the 
house  of  the  greatest  of  them,  STRADIVARI  us?  Can  you 
not  show  me  that  house?" 

"  Signor/'  said  the  man,  not  wishing  to  appear  ignorant, 
"I  think  that  the  person  you  mean  who  made  violins  is  dead. 
He  died  some  years  ago ;  I  don't  know  his  house,  but  here 
is  a  man  passing/' 

"  Pst !  stop  him  !  "  I  cried  ;  so  he  stopped  him. 

"  We  seek/'  I  said,  "  the  house  of  the  great  STRADI- 
VARIUS." 

"  Indeed/'  replied  this  citizen  of  Cremona,  tf  I  have  heard 
of  him,  but  I  fear  he  is  dead.  He  made  fiddles — old  fiddles. 
Pst !  "  said  the  man,  stopping  another  passer-by.  "  Do  you 
know  anything  of  one  STRADIVARIFS,  who  made  fiddles — old 
fiddles?" 

I  was  still  standing  up  in  my  carriage,  and  we  now  had 
quite  a  little  crowd  round  us.  They  were  all  Cremonese. 
Some  had  heard  of  the  advocate  STRADIVARI,  no  one  knew 
anything  of  the  immortal  ANTONIUS  STRADIVARIUS  of  Cre- 
mona, although  scarce  150  years  ag'o  his  body  had  beeu  laid 


THE   CITIZENS  OF  CREMONA.  321 

in  the  little  chapel  of  the  Rosary  (since  pulled  down  with 
the  church),  in  all  probability  was  still  lying  but  a  short 
stone's-throw  off'  the  little  group  that  stood  round  my 
carriage ;  yet,  not  a  soul  knew  his  name. 

At  last  one  man  stepped  forward  and  said,  "  Sir,  if  STRADI- 
VARIUS  has  been  dead  some  time,  and  you  seek  his  relics, 
the  antiquary  round  the  corner  might  have  heard  of  him/' 
This  was  all  I  could  gather. 

"  A  thousand  thanks  !  ''  I  lifted  my  hat,  the  little  crowd 
lifted  theirs. 

"  Drive/'  I  said,  "  to  the  antiquary  !  " 

He  drove ;  the  antiquary  was  out,  but  his  wife  directed  us 
to  a  certain  house  in  a  side  street  not  far  from  the  square 
of  St.  Dominic.  1  drew  up  in  front  of  that  house.  Two 
men  looked  out  of  one  window,  three  girls  looked  out  of 
another. 

"Is  this,"  I  shouted,  "  the  house  of  STRADIVARIUS?" 

"  No,  the  advocate " 

"  Stop,"  I  cried,  "  do  not  speak  of  him  ;  I  seek  not  the 
advocate — I  know  where  he  lives — I  seek  the  house  of  the 
great  STRADIVARI  us"  (I  turned  to  the  girls),  "a.  maker  of 
violins !  " 

"  He  doesn't  live  here,  he 's  dead.  lie  doesn't  make 
violins/'  they  said,  laughing. 

Then  another  roguish  maiden,  with  eyes  full  of  mischief: 
"  Yes,  this  is  his  house  ;  he  used  to  live  here ;  he  died 

here." 

2.1 


322    STRADIVARIUS   OF  CREMONA.— HIS  HOUSE. 

"  Then,  may  I  come  up  ?  I  want  to  see  that  room  where 
he  died." 

Another  young  lady  here  put  her  head  out :  two  of  them 
were  for  letting  me  come  up,  and  the  others  seemed  neu- 
tral. 

"Look  here!"  said  an  elderly  grey-headed  man  at  another 
window ;  "  If  the  gentleman  wants  anything,  I  will  come 
down — wait.  I  know,"  said  he,  "  whom  you  seek — do  not 
attend  to  these  light-headed  girls — you  seek  the  house  of 
STRADIVARIUS,  who  made  the  famous  violins ;  he  died  more 
than  a  hundred  years  ago ;  his  house  is  still  on  the  Piazza, 
nearly  opposite  where  the  old  church  of  St.  Dominic  stands. 
It  is  not  here,  but  this  is  the  interesting  manufactory  of 
SIGNOR  CERITO;  we  will  show  it  you,  too,  if  you  have  time." 

"  I  pray  you/'  said  I,  "  as  my  time  is  short,  tell  me  where 
is  the  casa  of  the  great  STRADIVARI." 

"  Signer,  it  is  No.  2  Piazza  Roma." 

"  I  thank  you  from  my  heart,"  I  said  with  a  sigh  of 
iu  finite  relief  and  a  low  bow  to  all  the  heads  out  of  the  win- 
dows. Then  to  my  coachman,  "  Drive/'  I  said,  "  to  No.  2 
Piazza  lloma."  He  drove. 

A  bright  boy  of  the  middle  classes,  well  dressed  and 
polite,  opened  the  door. 

248.  "  Tell  me,"  I  said  ;  "  I  would  see  the  rooms

let  you  come  up ;  there  is  nothing  much  to  see ;  he  died 
here." 

I  entered  the  narrow  passage  ;  beyond  it  there  was  a  little 
square  court-yard  paved  with  old  flagstones.  To  the  left, 
a  narrow  dark  staircase  led  up  to  the  second  story.  I  could 
no  longer  doubt  that  I  was  in  the  house  of  STRADIVARIUS — 
indeed,  the  only  traditional  direction  I  had  come  to  Cremona 
with  was  "in  the  Square  of  St.  Dominico,  opposite  the 
Fagade,"  and  this  house  was  quite  near  enough  to  correspond 
to  that  description.  At  the  top  of  the  first  flight,  a  beauti- 
ful Italian  girl  made  her  appearance — the  boy  said  she  was 
his  sister — then  an  elder  brother,  then  another  boy.  This 
was  all  the  family  I  saw — it  was  enough ;  they  were 
evidently  intelligent  tradespeople,  and  knew  enough  for 
my  purpose.  The  young  man  said,  "  The  Professor " 

"  Who  is  the  Professor  ?  "  I  asked. 

"The  Professor  STKADIVARIUS,"  he  answered,  "who 
made  violins  —  but  ever  so  long  ago  —  inhabited  these 
rooms,  and  he  died  here,  but  we  cannot  tell  which  room 
he  died  in." 

"  It  matters  not,"  said  I ;  "  where  did  he  work  ?" 

"  Do  you  really  want  to  see  where  he  made  the  violins  ? 
We  never  go  up  there — it  is  very  dirty — but  if  you  will 
see,  you  must  ascend." 

I  went  first,  followed  by  the  little  family,  who  evidently 
thought  me  quite  eccentric,  but  were  extremely  polite 

Higher  and  higher ;  at  last  we  came  to  the  top  of  the  house 

21   * 


324    STRADIVARIUS  OF  CREMONA.— HIS  HOUSE. 

"  It's  higlier  still,"  said  the  boy,  and  he  pointed  to 
a  little  decayed  ladder  which  at  a  glance  I  could  see  was 
only  used  for  certain  fowls  to  roost  on.  It  was  very 
dirty :  but  the  boy  went  up,  and  I  followed ;  even  the 
pretty  sister  gathered  up  her  skirts  daintily  and  joined  us  ; 
the  young  man  came  last.  Through  a  trap-door  covered 
with  cobwebs  I  soon  emerged  on  to  a  sort  of  loft  about 
twelve  feet  square.  It  was  still  soundly  roofed  with  tiles 
and  fine  old  beams  and  rafters.  It  was  entirely  exposed  to 
light  and  air  on  the  north  and  the  west,  like  an  open  barn, 
but  walled  on  the  south,  with  two  windows,  and  walled  on 
the  east ;  heavy  rafters  went  all  round,  supported  on  solid 
upright  beams.  "  Here,"  said  my  host,  "  is  where  the  Pro- 
fessor made  the  violins." 

I  thought  of  the  gorgeous  studios  in  which  our  modern 

artists  and  sculptors  think  it  necessary  to  work.     I  looked 

249.        round,    and    I    saw    all    the    conditions    which 

J?™Ar^;     STRADIVARIUS  required  to  produce  those  beautiful

WORKSHOP.  creations — miracles  of  carving,  design,  and  subtle 
cabinet-work — which  are  still  the  delight  of  collectors  who 
seldom  hear  them,  of  players  who  find  in  them  a  soul  of 
matchless  sensibility,  of  makers  who  copy  endlessly  without 
ever  being  able  to  reproduce  them,  and  of  the  whole  musical 
world  which  has  long  hung  spell-bound  upon  their  magical 
vibrations. 

I   looked,    and  looked   again.      The   genial    and    kindly 


STRAD1VARIU&S   WORKSHOP.  325 

Italian  family  standing  there  with  me  observed  that  I 
was  absorbed  and  serious,  and,  with  the  kindest  courtesy, 
kept  silent.  And  I  saw  out  upon  the  north  the  wide 
blue  sky,  and  upon  the  west  the  wide  blue  sky  just  mel- 
lowing to  a  rich  purple,  and  flaked  here  and  there  with 
orange  streaks  prophetic  of  sunset.  Whenever  STRADIVARIUS 
looked  up  from  his  work — if  he  looked  north,  his  eye  fell  on 
the  old  towers  of  St.  Marcellino  and  St.  Omobono;  if  he 
looked  west,  the  cathedral,  with  its  tall  campanile,  rose  dark 
against  the  sky — and  what  a  sky ! — full  of  clear  sun  in  the 
morning,  full  of  pure  heat  all  day,  and  bathed  with  ineffable 
tints  in  the  cool  of  the  evening,  when  the  light  lay  low 
upon  vinery  and  hanging  garden,  or  spangled  with  ruddy 
gold  the  eaves,  the  roofs,  and  frescoed  walls  of  the  houses. 

Yes,  after  all,  the  conditions  were  good — good  for  distil- 
ling the  rare  gams  in  the  natural  heat ;  good  for  soaking  the 
oil  and  varnish  into  the  backs  and  bellies  and  ribs  of  maple 
and  deal ;  good  for  drying  leisurely  day  by  day  every 
polished  and  moulded  surface  and  smooth  strip  as  it  hung  up 
against  the  open  blue  sky,  winnowed  by  the  light  winds  as 
they  rose  and  fell  with  spicy  odours  from  the  distant  Alps. 

Here,  up  in  the  high  air,  with  the  sun  his  helper,  the 
light  his  minister,  the  blessed  soft  airs  his  journeymen, 
what  time  the  workaday  noise  of  the  city  rose,  and  the 
sound  of  Matins  and  Vespers  was  in  his  ears,  through  the 
long  warm  summer  days  worked  STRADIVAKIUS,  drew  in

free  hand  his  scrolls,  rounded  and  chiselled  with  a  loving 
eye  those  surfaces  which  resemble  nothing  so  much  as  the 
gentle  and  undulating  curves  and  satiny  texture  of  a  smooth 
human  body.  From  this  high  laboratory,  where  the  master 
seemed  so  far  above  the  earth,  so  near  to  Heaven,  I  said 
it  was  meet  that  such  melodious  and  seraphic  ministers 
should  descend  to  be  the  delight  and  solace  of  our  sad  and 
discordant  world.  Here  was  shaped  the  "  Pucelle " ;  here 
was  conceived  the  graceful,  sweet,  and  ringing  "Dolphin" 
Strad. ;  here,  too,  was  formed  and  perfected  that  wondrous 
violin  which,  in  the  hands  of  ERNST,  and  never  since,  drew 
tears  and  laughter  from  enchanted  multitudes,  until  it  was 
difficult  to  believe  that  the  spirits  of  the  dead  were  not 
employing  its  pathetic  vibrations  to  convey  to  mortals  the 
expression  of  their  infinite  longings  and  ineffable  aspirations. 

I  suppose  my  eyes  were  raised  involuntarily  as  I  stood 

facing   the   north,  looking   over   a  wilderness   of   roofs   to 

the   great   churches    beyond.     The   young  man 

SSDQf 

A  NAIL  IN   evidently  thought   I  was   looking  at  the  thick 

A   BF  AM 

beam  that  supported  the  roof  on  that  side.  He 
climbed  up  so  as  to  touch  it,  and  felt  along  the  inside. 
"Here,"  he  said,  "the  Professor  hung  up  his  violins.  You 
can  see  how  old  and  worn  is  the  beam  ;  and  here  and  there 
is  a  crooked  rusty  nail  on  which  the  violins  hung." 

A  sudden  thought  worthy  of  a  Vandal  seized  me :  "  I  will 
possess  one  of  those   nails."     I   at  once  invented   several 


"ADDIO/"  327 

excuses  for  myself,  some  of  them  very  good  ones.  1st.  No 
one  else  cared  for  the  nail.  2nd.  It  would  simply  rot  there 
and  be  lost.  3rd.  Probably  no  one  would  ever  notice  it 
again  if  left.  4th.  No  one  would  miss  it.  5th,  STEADI- 
VAUIUS  would  not  want  it  again.  6th.  I  wanted  it  myself. 
This  last  was  the  best  excuse  I  could  think  of.  So  I  said  to 
the  young  man,  "Whilst  you  are  up  there,  do  you  know,  I 
should  very  much  value  one  of  those  old  nails;  could  you 
get  it  for  me  ?  " 

"Certainly,"  said  he,  "if  you  want  it;  but  it  is  so  very 
old  and  rotten,  I  can't  draw  it ;  it  is  sure  to  break." 

"Never  mind,"  said  I.  He  did  not  mind.  The  nail  did 
break,  and  I  got  all  of  it  that  .STRADIVARIUS  ever  used  to 
hang  his  fiddles  on. 

My  mission  was  accomplished.     I  looked  round  upon  that 
simple,  kindly,  picturesque  Italian  family — the  young  man, 
his  two  young  brothers,  the  pretty  sister. 

"What    shall    I    say  to   thank   you    for   your 
"ADDIO!"  J 

kindness  to  me  ?  " 

"Nothing,"  said  the  young  man,  laughing;  "we  don't 
want  anything :  we  are  glad  if  you  are  pleased ;  people 
don't  often  come  to  see  the  house — -just  one  or  two  have 
been  at  long  intervals." 

"At  least,"  I  said,  "let  me  give  these  nice  little  boys 
something  to  buy  toys  with,  for  they  opened  the  door  and 
have  been  such  good  little  guides;"  and  I  placed  a  few 


328    STRADIVARIUS  OF  CREMONA.— HIS  HOUSE. 

francs  in  the  hands  of  the  astonished  little  fellows,  who 
seemed  doubtful;  but  the  pretty  sister  laughed,  and  they 
took  the  francs  with  many  joyful  salutations. 

As  1  went  down-stairs,  I  met  the  grey-headed  man  who 
had  told  me  of  the  house  coming  up.  He  had  actually,  with 
true  Italian  curiosity,  come  all  the  way  to  see  if  I  had  really 
gone  there. 

"So,  so!"  he  said,  "you  have  found  the  house  where  the 
Professor  once  lived  ?  " 

"  Yes,"  I  said ;  "  I  have  seen  the  house  of  STRADIVARIUS. 
Addio!" 


VIOLINS  AND    VIOLINISTS.  329 


VI. 

INTERLUDE 

ON    SOME   OLD   VIOLIN   PLAYERS. 

WHETHER    violins    are    due  to  violinists,    or  violinists  to 

violins,  is  like  that  other  puzzle  of  whether  the  owl  was 

before  the  egg,  or  the  egg  before  the  owl.     Thus 

iSOSt 

VIOLINS  AND  mucb,  however,  is  certain :  that  until  that  special 
modification  of  the  viol  which  we  call  violin  was 
hit  upon,  there  could  not  be  a  violin  player;  so  we  may 
affirm  that,  in  a  sense,  the  violin  preceded  violinists.  It 
is  equally  certain  that  the  growth  of  part- singing,  and  the 
advancing  art  of  modern  music,  rendered  the  players  of 
stringed  instruments  impatient  with  the  tubby  tone  and 
clumsy  proportions  of  the  old  viols,  and  that,  in  order  to 
satisfy  the  increasing  demand  for  tone  and  quality,  the  viol- 
makers  tried  various  experiments,  until  at  last  they  hit  upon 
the  violin  type,  improving  their  instruments  to  order  as 


330    INTERLUDE  ON  SOME  OLD  VIOLIN  PLAYERS. 

EUAKD  and  BROADWOOD  were  forced  to  increase  the  strength, 
mechanism,  and  tone  of  their  pianos  to  meet  the  extra- 
ordinary, and  apparently  insatiable,  requirements  of  LlSZT 
and  THALBERG. 

GIOVANNI  BATTISTA  LULU,  1590,  about  whom  I  know 

little  more,  was  the  first  man  who  asserted,  by  his  excellent 

playing,  the  superiority  of  the  new  violin  over 

253>        the    old   viols.      With    LULLI    (1633-1687)    the 

LULLI. 

"  petit  violon  "  became  fashionable  at  the  French 
Court.  LULLI  was  a  cook,  but  the  COMTE  DE  NOGENT, 
hearing  him  play  in  the  kitchen,  brought  him  straight  to 
MADAME  DE  MONTPENSIER,  and  he  was  soon  afterwards 
installed  as  Court  musician  to  Louis  XIV.  The  "Petits 
Violons  du  Roi" — the  name  of  a  Court  band  organised  by 
LULLI — soon  became  famous.  LULLI  himself  was  not  only 
a  good  cook  and  fine  fiddler,  but  an  excellent  actor  and  a 
merry  fellow  to  boot. 

MOLIEUE  was  very  partial  to  him,  and  would  say  in  com- 
pany, when  the  conversation  flagged,  "  Come,  Battista, 
make  us  laugh." 

I  find  it  impossible  to  make  out  wherein  LULLI'S  violin- 
playing  excelled  that  of  his  predecessors ;  but  as  there  were 
during  his  life-time  no  two  opinions  on  that  question,  I 
must  take  it  for  granted  in  his  favour. 

With  CORELLI  (1653-1713)  I  touch  firmer  ground.     We

can  see  at  a  glance  that  he  was  contemporaneous  with  tlie 
finest  period  of  STKADIVARIUS.  As  a  contrast  to 
the  French  butterfly  LULLI,  CORELLI  was  "  un 

OORELLI. 

homme  serietix."  His  style  was  elaborate  and 
methodical;  his  music  full  of  a  fancy  and  variety  which 
even  the  stiffness  of  the  old  form  cannot  disguise.  His 
trios  form  the  basis  of  modern  chamber  music,  and 
his  concertos  laid  the  foundation  of  the  grand  violin 
style. 

He  was  the  first  maestro  who  insisted  on  his  band  all 
bowing  in  the  same  way.  The  fine  effect  thus  produced  is 
seldom,  if  ever,  heard  in  England.  We  must  go  to  Vienna 
and  Paris  to  see  that  uniform  Coup  d'archet,  which,  in  an 
orchestra,  is  as  striking  to  the  eye  as  it  is  agreeable  to  the 
ear.  COKELLI  met  HANDEL  at  the  house  of  that  famous 
patron  of  music,  CARDINAL  OTTOBONI,  at  Rome.  The  great 
violinist  took  an  odd  view  of  HANDEL'S  genius.  "My  dear 
Saxon,"  he  said  to  him,  "your  music  is  in  the  French  style, 
which  I  do  not  understand."  CORELLI'S  interview  with 
another  illustrious  professor  was  far  from  fortunate.  He 
seems  at  Naples  to  have  met  SCARLATTI  and  played  one  of 
his  adagios  in  C  major  instead  of  C  minor.  On  discovering 
his  error,  he  was  so  much  annoyed,  that  he  left  the  town 
immediately.  He  was  very  sensitive  to  rivalry,  and  had  the 
mortification — like  most  great  executive  musicians  who  go 
on  too  long — to  see  younger  artists  preferred  to  himself. 
Posterity  has  been  more  kind.  His  body  lies  close  to  that

of  EAFFAELE  in  the  Pantheon.  His  tablet  is  inscribed  with 
the  simple  but  conclusive  motto : 

"  Corelli  princeps  musicorum." 

Between  1640  and  1729  we  had  some  very  good  violin 

players  in  England.     One  BALTZAR  led  the  king's  (CHARLES 

255.        II.)  band.     His   execution   was  wonderful.     He 

BALTZAR  AND  was  a   sa(j   drunkard,  and   they  buried   him   in 

THE 

BANNISTERS.  Westminster  Abbey.  The  BANNISTERS,  father 
and  son,  in  1672,  proved  that  Englishmen  could  also  play 
the  violin.  They  started  a  concert,  "  Is.  admission,  and 
call  for  what  you  please."  The  fiddling  was  held  at  the 
"George  Tavern,"  Whitefriars.  BANNISTER  himself  did 
wonders  on  the  flageolet,  violin,  and  double-bass,  and  each 
performer  had  his  solo.  The  concerts  took  place  in  the 
dark  winter  afternoons,  and,  by  all  accounts,  the  game 
seems  to  have  been  fairly  worth  the  candle. 

TARTINI  (1692-1770)  added  that  element  of  romance  and 

fancy  to  violin  playing,  without  which,  in  my  opinion,  the 

most  classical  violinist  fails  as  a  true  exponent 

256'        of  his  instrument  or  his  art.     TARTINI'S  method 

TAETINI. 

was  elaborate  and  concise.  To  him  we  owe  that 
attention  to  exact  intonation  which  raises  the  violin  strings 
to  an  equality  with  the  sensibility  of  the  vocal  chords.  His 
observation  of  the  third  sound  which  resonates  sympatheti- 


TART1NL  333 

cally  when  the  two  upper  notes  of  a  chord  of  three  are  in 
perfect  time,  and  the  great  stress  which  he  laid  on  this, 
points  to  the  perfection  of  his  ear.  He  made  his  pupils 
listen  for  the  effect. 

"  If  you  do  not  perceive  the  third  sound,  your  thirds  and 
sixths  are  not  in  tune,"  he  would  say. 

TARTINI  lengthened  the  bow.  The  violin  bow  grew  until 
it  attained  at  last  the  PAGANINI  and  ERNST  dimensions  of 
a  yard  long.  At  first  it  resembled  more  the  chopper-like 
implement  still  used  for  grunting  on  the  double-bass.  It 
would  be  difficult  to  play  the  famous  Trille  du  Diable — the 
best  known  of  TAETINI'S  compositions,  which  still  holds  the 
concert-room — with  the  old-fashioned  bow  used  by  CORELLI 
or  HAZZE.  TARTINI'S  own  account,  though  a  little  stale,  of 
the  way  in  which  he  composed  his  famous  solo,  may  as  well 
be  quoted,  as  it  is  not  always  that  we  can  get  a  legend  first 
hand. 

"One  night,  1713,"  he  writes,  "I  dreamt  that  I  had 
made  a  compact  with  the  devil,  who  promised  to  be  at  my 
service  on  all  occasions.  Everything  I  undertook  suc- 
ceeded ;  my  wishes  were  anticipated,  and  my  desires  always 
surpassed.  At  last  I  determined  to  offer  the  devil  my 
violin,  as  I  was  anxious  to  know  what  kind  of  a  fiddler  he 
might  be.  To  my  astonishment  he  played  a  solo  so  beauti- 
ful, with  such  exquisite  taste  and  finish,  that  never  had  I 
heard  or  conceived  of  anything  so  lovely  and  marvellous. 
Overcome  with  surprise  and  delight,  I  held  my  breath,  and 


334    INTERLUDE  ON  SOME  OLD   VIOLIN  PLAYERS. 

the  effort  awoke  me.  I  seized  my  violiu  in  the  hope  of 
recalling  the  magic  strains — in  vain !  Still,  a  vague  impres- 
sion remained,  which  I  instantly  endeavoured  to  jot  down. 
My  Sonata  del  Diavolo  is  the  result.  It  is  doubtless  the 
best  of  all  my  compositions." 

Closely  allied  to  the  romantic  element  is  TARTINI'S  last 
contribution  to  the  progress  of  violin  playing,  his  power  of 
exquisite  "phrasing."  He  was  the  finest  cantabile  player 
of  his  day.  NAEDINI,  his  best  pupil,  carried  on  the  tradi- 
tion, for  in  the  "  adagio "  he  had  no  equal  after  TARTINI'S 
death.  TARTINI  died  at  Padua,  where  he  had  lived  for 
nearly  fifty  years.  He  was  a  great  philosopher,  a  great 
lover  of  books,  a  mathematician,  and  a  man  of  highly 
religious  and  philanthropic  character.  He  had  seen  CoRELLI, 
lived  long  enough  to  admire  HANDEL,  play  HAYDN,  and 
even  hear  MOZART.  He  left  many  pupils,  amongst  them 
a  lady — MDLLE.  DE  SIRMEN — who  achieved  a  European 
reputation,  and  was  by  some  preferred  to  all  his  other 
pupils. 

GIARDINI  (1716-1793)  was  famous  for  his  "embroide- 
ries." This,  I  suppose,  consisted  in  those  elegant  flourishes 
and  cadenzas  which,  in  the  hands  of  PAGANINI  and  his 
school  on  the  violin,  and  in  the  hands  of  CHOPIN  and  his 
school  on  the  piano,  received  their  latest  and  apparently 
ultimate  developments.  Towards  the  end  of  GIARDINI'S 
life,  the  great  qualities  of  the  STRADIVARI  and  GUARNERII 


BOCCHERINI.  335 

violins  were  beginning  to  assert  themselves.  The  quartets 
of  HAYDN  had  immensely  enhanced  the  dignity  of  the 
violin.  A  demand  for  tone  was  rapidly  arising,  and  GIAK- 
DINI  was  as  famous  for  the  sweep  of  his  bow  and  the 
sonority  of  his  tone,  as  for  the  delicacy  and  charm  of  his 
"  embroideries." 

BOCCHERINI,  by  the  enormous  number  of  his  composi- 
tions,  did  much   to  spread  the  taste  for   chamber  music. 
A   fragment   or  two    of  his    compositions    may 
occasionally   be   heard   at   the  Monday  Popular

Concerts.  He  was  a  favourite  with  princes,  and 
composed  nine  works  annually  for  the  Royal  Academy  of 
Madrid,  where  he  died,  aged  sixty-six,  in  1806,  three 
years  before  the  death  of  HAYDN.  The  KING  OP  SPAIN 
was  fond  of  playing  with  BOCCHERINI,  and  the  EMPEROR 
OF  AUSTRIA  occasionally  joined  them  in  a  trio.  The 
Emperor  one  day  asked  BOCCHERINI  whether  he  played 
better  than  CHARLES  IV.;  upon  which  the  diplomatic  musi- 
cian replied,  "  Sire,  CHARLES  IV.  plays  like  a  king,  but 
Your  Imperial  Highness  plays  like  an  Emperor ! "  It 
would  be  impossible  to  say  less,  but  difficult  to  say  more. 
It  was  the  truth,  the  whole  truth,  and  nothing  but  the 
truth. 

Most  people  are  agreed  that  VIOTTI    (1755-1824)    was 
the   man  who  summed  up  in  himself  the  progress  of  the 


336    INTERLUDE  ON  SOME  OLD  VIOLIN  PLATERS. 

violin  in  the  18th  century,  and  made  possible  the  startling 

258.        developments    which    are    connected    with    the 

nom,      names  of  DE  BERIOT.  and.  above  all.  with  PAGA- 

KODE, 

»E  BEKIOT.  NINI  an(j  ERNST.  VIOTTI  prolonged  further  the 
bow.  In  his  days  the  internal  bar  supporting  the  old 
violin  bellies  had  to  be  strengthened  to  bear  the  increased 
strain  of  the  gradually  rising  pitch  which  gave  such  addi- 
tional brilliancy  to  violin  tone.  His  tone  was  powerful,  his 
style  broad,  and  his  phrasing  noble. 

He  wrote  music  abounding  in  flowing  melody  and  plea- 
sant harmonies.  His  concertos  long  held  the  concert-room, 
but  were  ousted  by  RODE,  then  by  DE  BERIOT,  who,  in  his 
turn,  was  displaced  by  ERNST,  WIENIAWSKI,  and  VIEUXTEMPS. 

DE  BERIOT  had  a  very  considerable  run  of  about  fifty 
years,  for  his  music  has  only  disappeared  from  concert 
programmes  within  the  last  ten  years,  and  is  still  popular 
with  novices. 

PAGANINI'S  music  cannot  be  said  to  have  displaced  that  of 
any  concert-room  composer.  Only  a  few  of  his  concertos 
were  ever  heard  after  his  death,  generally  played  by  SIVORI, 
and  then  no  one  pretended  that  they  sounded  the  same  as 
when  PAGANINI  played  them. 

RODE,  MORI,  and  LABARRE,  were  all  pupils  of  VIOTTI. 
MORI  taught  my  old  master,  OURY,  in  his  youth,  and  OURY 
numbered  amongst  his  pupils  GEORGE  MACFARREN,  STERN- 
UALE  BENNETT,  and  the  EARL  OP  FALMOUTH,  an  excelleut 
amateur. 


KREUTZER— SPOHR— PAGANINI.  337 

I  have  now  entered  upon  the  golden  age  of  violinists. 

KREUTZER  produced  studies  for  the  violin  which  are  already 

259.        classical,  and  which,  in  my  opinion,  have  never 

KREUTZER,    been  surpassed  in  excellence,  variety,  and  even 

SPOHR,  •  ' 

PAGANINI.  gne  milsical  taste.  I  have  no  intention  here  to 
mention  all  the  celebrated  names  of  violinists  which  are, 
unfortunately,  to  modern  ears  little  but  names ;  only  those 
who  serve  as  landmarks  of  the  art  deserve,  as  it  were,  a 
bust  and  pedestal  in  the  corridor  through  which  I  am  now 
passing,  to  contemplate  at  leisure  the  great  figure  which 
stands  at  the  end  of  it — NICOLO  PAGANINI. 

I  suppose  that  SPOHR'S  violin  school  is  likely  to  hold  its 
place  as  a  comprehensive  class  book,  though  I  arn  told  that 
modern  professors  have  a  perfect  mania  for  introducing 
shorter  manuals  of  their  own  invention.  However,  no  one 
can  ignore  the  fact  that  SPOHR  did  more  than  any  of  his 
predecessors  to  overcome  the  difficulties  of  chromatic  scales, 
octave,  and  chord-playing  on  the  violin,  although  his  curious 
antipathy  to  harmonies  and  everything  that  savoured  of 
trickery  on  the  violin  left  the  field  open  to  PAGANINI. 

They  were  both  born  in  the  same  year,  1784,  and  it  is 
pleasing  to  note  PAGANINI'S  generous  appreciation  and 
sincere  respect  for  SPOHR'S  abilities,  whilst  it  would  be  diffi- 
cult to  mention  two  artists  more  diametrically  opposed  to 
each  other  in  taste,  temperament,  and  achievement.  When 
PAGANINI  burst  like  a  comet  upon  the  musical  world, 
DE  BERIOT  had  already  reaped  his  laurels  in  England, 

22 


338    INTERLUDE  ON  SOME  OLD  VIOLIN  PLAYERS. 

and,  notwithstanding  the  unique  popularity  of  PAGANINI, 
DE  BEKIOT,  by  his  compositions,  as  well  as  by  the  charm 
of  his  phrasing,  the  roundness  of  his  tone,  and  the  exquisite 
purity  of  his  taste,  retained  his  hold  over  the  musical  public 
until  his  eye-sight  began  to  fail  him,  and  his  nerve  gave 
way.  He  married  MALIBRAN,  who  was  bled  to  death  by 
the  doctors,  and  he  died  at  St.  Petersburg,  quite  blind, 
only  in  1870.  DE  BERIOT'S  name  is  intimately  associated 
with  the  great  violin  school  of  Belgium,  over  which  the 
lamented  VIEUXTEMPS  presided  so  ably  for  so  many  years. 
I  now  wish  to  concentrate  the  attention  of  my  readers 
upon  that  imposing  personality — that  strange  uncouth  figure 
•which  stands  out  unique  amongst  the  executive  musicians 
of  the  19th  century.  Nothing  like  him  seems  ever  to 
have  appeared  before — nothing  approaching  him  as  a  solo 
sensation,  except  LISZT,  has  appeared  since.  At  one  bound 
he  reached  a  goal  of  violin-playing  to  which,  after  an 
interval  of  nearly  fifty  years,  there  seems  to  be  no  beyond. 
He  sounded  the  marvellous  depths  and  resources  of  the  most 
marvellous  of  all  instruments,  and  has  apparently  left 
nothing  for  future  explorers  to  discover.

'  RODE,  and  LAFONT  seemed  to  have  explored  the 
heights  and  depths  of  the  violin,  opened  up  new  vistas 
full  of  strange,  unparalleled  mysteries,  and  gave  us  glimpses 
into  a  hell,  purgatory,  and  paradise  heyond  the  dreams 
even  of  DANTE — whose  gaunt  and  supernatural  figure 
startled  and  fascinated  the  crowds  that  thronged  about 
him,  a  solitary  man  amongst  men,  but  so  unlike  them, 
that  he  seemed  to  belong  to  another  race,  and  to  discourse 
in  the  weird  music  of  another  world — who  bowed  to  none, 
yet  was  idolised  by  all — whose  engagements  were  nego- 
tiated by  kings  and  ministers — who  could  spurn  the  prayers 
of  princes  and  grand  duchesses,  and  yet  received  honour 
at  their  hands,  and  was  alternately  decorated  by  the  Pope, 
and  anathematized  by  the  clergy ; — who  was  this  excep-

at  whose  approach  the  greatest  masters  confessed  themselves 
vanquished — who,  although  he  set  the  fashions,  infected 
whole  populations,  invented  a  new  school,  yet,  in  his  own 
peculiar  greatness,  had  no  masters,  no  equals,  and  has  left 
no  followers  ?  This  man,  who  has  stamped  so  indelible  an 
impression  of  himself  upon  the  musical  world,  whilst  his

blame  the  biographer  for  skipping  a  few  dull  and  stupid 
antecedents. 

.PAGANINI  pere  may  have  been  a  street  porter,  as  some 
pretend;  or  a  small  tradesman,  as  others,  probably  in  the 
right,  affirm.  He  was  a  sharp  man  ;  he  was  a  cruel  man ;  he 
did  overmuch  to  develop  his  son's  talents,  and  overmuch  to 
ruin  his  health,  and,  probably,  is  chargeable  with  having 
destroyed  his  mental  and  moral  equilibrium  for  life. 
NICOLO'S  mother  was  a  sweet,  amiable  woman — she  loved 
her  boy,  she  believed  in  him,  she  often  stood  between  him 
and  the  rod,  she  prayed  for  him,  and  saw  one  night  in  a 


SEVERE  EARLY  TRAINING.  341 

vision  a  celestial  being,  who  told  her  that  the  boy  would 
become  the  greatest  violinist  that  ever  lived.  How  far  this 
dream,  which  she  lost  no  time  in  communicating  to  father 
and  son,  increased  the  father's  severity,  and  fired  the  boy's 
ambition,  we  cannot  tell ;  but  the  dream  seems  to  have  been 
a  well-established  fact,  and  years  afterwards,  when  the 
mother  was  old,  and  the  son  at  his  zenith,  she  reminded  him 
of  it,  as  of  an  incident  which  had  been-  familiar  to  both  of 
them  throughout  their  lives. 

In  these  early  days  of  boyhood  were  probably  laid  the 

seeds  of  that  idiosyncrasy  of  temperament  which  became  at 

262.       once  the  glory  and  curse  of  his  life.     Little  as 

SEVERE     we  know  about  the  human  brain,  it  is  tolerably

TRAINING  certain  that  its  particles  move  in  physical  grooves 
and  acquire  methodical  arrangements,  which  correspond  to 
what  we  call  mental  qualities  and  states  of  mind.  Illness 
may  perpetuate  some,  and  modify  others.  Great  severity 
may  have  a  similar  effect;  recurrent  outward  action,  for 
instance,  may  create  intense  propensity  in  certain  directions, 
and  thus  impart  the  perseverance  of  mania  to  inward  dis- 
positions ;  the  nervous  system  at  the  same  time,  if  it  does 
not  break  down,  becomes  over-developed,  and  is  then 
endowed  with  an  almost  supernatural  sensibility.  Some- 
thing of  this  kind  appears  to  have  been  the  case  with 
PAQANTNI  ;  he  was  by  nature  very  delicate.  At  four  years 
old  he  was  nearly  buried  alive;  he  lay  for  a  whole  day 


342  PAG  AN  IN  I. 

in  a  state  of  catalepsy,  and  was  already  placed  in  his 
shroud,  when  he  revived,  but  with  a  nervous  system  which 
from  that  time  forward  showed  signs  of  a  strange  and 
unnatural  susceptibility.  By  his  own  temperament,  as 
soon  as  he  could  hold  the  violin  he  was  urged  to  an 
intense  and  dangerous  application — for  the  least  fault  he 
was  severely  beaten  by  his  father,  which  seemed  only  to 
increase  an  ardour  which  should,  for  his  own  sake,  have 
been  rather  moderated.  Precocity  was  still  further  forced 
on  by  starvation.  Had  it  not  been  for  his  mother,  he  might 
never  have  survived  this  brutal  treatment.  We  shall  see 
by-and-by  how  lovingly  he  remembered  her  in  the  midst  of 
his  triumphs. 

PAGANINI  was   born   at   Genoa    on    the    10th  February 

1784.      After  exhausting  his  father's    instruction,  he  was 

263.       taken  in   hand   by    SIGNOR    SERVETTO,    of   the 

TOE  DESPAIK  Qen0ese  theatre :    then   GIACOMO  COSTA,  chapel 

OP   HIS 

MASTERS,  master,  taught  him,  and  the  child  was  often 
seen  playing  in  the  Genoese  churches  on  a  violin  almost 
as  large  as  himself;  but,  like  MOZART  before  him,  and 
MENDELSSOHN  after  him,  NICOLO  was  the  despair  of  his 
masters,  who  were  in  turn  angry  with  his  innovations, 
and  astonished  at  his  precocious  facility.  In  his  ninth  year 
he  appeared  at  a  concert,  and  electrified  everyone  with 
variations  on  the  French  air,  La  Carmagnole.  This  triumph 
impelled  his  avaricious  father  to  discover  someone  who  could 


THE  DESPAIR   OF  HIS  MASTERS.  343 

further  teach  him ;  the  young  talent  was  to  be  pressed  and 
squeezed  to  its  utmost  limit,  in  order  to  produce  the  golden 
harvest. 

At  Parma  lived  the  celebrated  musician  HOLLA.  To 
ROLLA  was  the  boy  taken ;  but  HOLLA  was  ill.  Whilst  wait- 
ing in  the  ante-room  little  NICOLO  took  up  a  violin,  and 
played  off  at  sight  some  difficult  music  which  he  found 
lying  on  the  table.  The  invalid  composer  raised  himself  on 
his  bed  to  listen,  and  eagerly  inquired  who  the  great  master 
was  who  had  arrived,  and  was  playing  in  his  ante-room  ?  "  A 
mere  lad  ! — impossible !  "  but  on  PAGANINI'S  making  his 
appearance  as  an  humble  pupil,  ROLLA  at  once  told  him  that 
he  could  teach  him  nothing.  Thence  to  PAER,  who  was  glad 
to  make  his  difficult  charge  over  to  GHTRETTI,  and  this 
master  gave  him  three  lessons  a  week  in  harmony  and 
counterpoint.  It  is  not  clear  that  this  extraordinary  genius 
owed  much  more  to  anyone  but  himself — his  indomitable 
perseverance  and  his  incessant  study.  His  method  is  to  be 
noted.  For  ten  or  twelve  hours  he  would  try  passages  over 
and  over  again  in  different  ways  with  such  absorption  and 
intensity,  that  at  nightfall  he  would  sink  into  utter  pros- 
tration through  excessive  exhaustion  and  fatigue.  Though 
delicate,  like  MENDELSSOHN,  he  ate  at  times  ravenously, 
and  slept  soundly.  When  about  ten  he  wrote  twenty- 
four  fugues,  and  soon  afterwards  composed  some  violin 
music,  of  such  difficulty,  that  he  was  unable  at  first  to  play 
it,  until  incessant  practice  gave  him  the  mastery. 


344  PAGANINL 

In  1797  PAGANINI,  being  then  thirteen  years  old,  made  his 

first  professional  tour ;  but  not  as  a  free  agent.     His  father 

264.        took  him  through  the  chief  towns  of  Lombardy, 

^ANrf0  an(^  n0^  unnatural\y>  prescribed  the  task  and 
GAMBLING,  pocketed  the  proceeds.  But  the  young  neck  was 
already  beginning  to  chafe  against  the  yoke.  In  1798  he 
escaped,  with  his  father's  tardy  consent,  to  Lucca,  where  a 
musical  festival  in  honour  of  St.  Martin  was  going  on.  He 
there  gave  frequent  concerts,  and  was  everywhere  .met  with 
applause,  and,  what  was  more  to  the  purpose,  with  money. 
Surrounded  by  men  of  inferior  talents,  a  mere  inexperienced 
boy,  without  education,  without  knowledge  of  the  world, 
with  nothing  but  ambition  and  his  supreme  musical  genius, 
he  now  broke  wildly  away  from  all  wise  restraints,  and 
avenged  himself  upon  his  father's  severity  by  many  youth- 
ful excesses.  He  gambled — he  lost — he  was  duped  by  his 
companions;  but  he  made  money  so  fast,  that  he  soon 
owned  about  £1,000.  It  is  pleasant  to  think  that  he  at 
once  thought  of  giving  some  of  this  to  his  father  and 
mother ;  it  is  unpleasant  to  record  that  his  father  claimed, 
and  eventually  got,  almost  the  whole  sum  from  him.  But 
it  did  not  much  matter  now,  for  everything  seemed  literally 
to  turn  into  gold  beneath  those  marvellous  fingers,  and  bad 
luck  proved  nearly  as  profitable  to  him  as  good. 

By  the  time  he  had  reached  seventeen,  PAGANINI  was  a 
confirmed  gambler.      He   had    little   left    but  his    Stradi-

in  these  latter  days  we  think  nothing  of  giving  £300  for  a 
genuine  instrument  of  the  first  class.  But  the  reckless 
youth  determined  to  make  a  last  stand  for  his  violin. 
ff  Jewels,  watch,  rings,  brooches/'  to  use  his  own  words,  "  I 
had  disposed  of  all — my  thirty  francs  were  reduced  to  three. 
"With  this  small  remains  of  my  capital  I  played,  and  won 
160  francs  !  This  amount  saved  my  violin,  and  restored  my 
affairs.  From  that  time,"  he  adds,  "I  abjured  gaming,  to 
which  I  had  sacrificed  a  part  of  my  youth,  convinced  that 
a  gamester  is  an  object  of  contempt  to  all  well-regulated 
minds."  The  violin  he  narrowly  missed  losing  was  given 
him  by  PARSINI  the  painter,  who  on  one  occasion  brought, 
him  a  concerto  of  extraordinary  difficulty  to  read  at  sight, 
and,  placing  a  fine  Stradivarius  in  his  hands,  said,  "  This 
instrument  shall  be  yours  if  you  can  play  that  concerto  at 
first  sight  in  a  masterly  manner."  "  If  that  is  the  case," 
replied  PAGANINI,  "you  may  bid  adieu  to  it";  and,  playing 
it  off  at  once,  he  retained  the  violin.  Easy  come — easy  go. 
Some  years  later,  at  Leghorn,  being  again  in  great  straits, 
he  was  obliged  to  part,  for  a  time  at  least,  with  this  same 
Stradivarius;  but  this  disaster  was  only  the  means  of  pro- 
curing him  the  favourite  Guarnerius,  upon  which  he  ever 
afterwards  played.  In  his  need,  Monsieur  LIVRON,  a  dis- 


346  PAGANINI. 

tinguished  amateur,  lent  him  this  splendid  instrument,  arid 
was  so  enraptured  by  his  playing  that  he  exclaimed,  "Never 
will  I  profane  the  strings  that  your  fingers  have  touched. 
It  is  to  you  that  my  violin  belongs."  This  violin  is  still 
shown  at  Genoa  under  a  glass  case. 

At  the  age  of  seventeen  PAGANINI  appears  to  have  been 
entirely  his  own  master — weak  in  health,  nervous,  irritable, 

and  excitable  :  his  wild  and  irregular  habits  and 
266. 

A  HESPirB  pursuits  were,   at   this   critical  age,  threatening

to  hurry  him  to  an  early  grave,  when  an  event 
occurred  which,  although  but  too  characteristic  of  the 
looseness  of  Italian  manners,  probably  saved  his  life. 

Suddenly,  in  the  midst  of  new  discoveries  and  unexampled 
successes,  PAGANINI  ceased  to  play  the  violin.  He  retired 
into  the  depths  of  the  country,  and  devoted  himself  for 
three  years  to  agricultural  pursuits,  and  to  the  society  of  a 
lady  of  rank  who  had  carried  him  off  to  her  Tuscan  estate, 
and  to  the  guitar.  With  the  sole  exception  of  the  late 
REGONDI,  no  such  genius  had  ever  been  concentrated  upon 
this  limited  and  effeminate  instrument.  But  the  lady's 
taste  ran  that  way,  and  the  great  violinist  lavished  for  a 
time  the  whole  force  of  his  originality  and  skill  upon  the 
light  guitar.  He  wrote  music  for  it,  and  imitated  it  on  the 
violin,  but  seldom  touched  it  in  after  life  until  quite  the 
close,  although,  as  we  shall  presently  see,  he  was  able  to 
produce  a  prodigious  effect  upon  it  when  he  chose. 


STUDY  AND   COMPOSITION.  347 

These  years  of  country  life  and  leisure,  during  which  he  was 
delivered  from  the  pressure  of  crowds,  the  excitement  of 
public  performances,  and,  most  of  all,  the  grinding  anxieties 
of  life,  had  the  effect  of  bracing  him  up  in  health,  and 
prepared  him  for  that  reaction  towards  intense  study  and 
exhausting  toil  which  left  him  without  a  rival — the  first 
violinist  in  the  world. 

In  1804  he  returned  to  Genoa,  where  he  seems,  amongst 
other  things,  to  have  given  lessons  to  a  young  girl  of  fifteen, 
named  CATHERINE  CALCAGNO,  who  appears  to 
STUDY  AND  have  caught  something  of  his  style,  and  to  have 
>N' astonished  Italy  for  a  few  years,  but  after  1816 
we  hear  no  more  of  her.  And  now  the  neglected  violin 
was  taken  up  once  again,  but  this  time  with  maturer  powers 
and  settled  intentions.  There  is  a  strange  thoroughness 
about  PAGANINI — nothing  which  any  previous  musician 
knew  or  had  done  must  be  unknown  or  left  undone  by 
him;  there  was  to  be  no  hitting  him  between  the  joints 
of  his  armour;  no  loop-hole  of  imperfection  anywhere. 
He  now  occupied  himself  solely  with  the  study  of  his 
instrument,  and  with  composition  —  wrote  four  grand 
quartettes  for  violin,  viol,  guitar,  and  violoncello  ;  and 
bravura  rariations  with  guitar  accompaniment.  At  the  age 
of  twenty-one  (1805)  he  made  a  second  professional  tour, 
passing  through  Lucca  and  Piombino,  and  in  one  convent 
church  where  he  played  a  concerto,  the  excitement  was  so 


348  PAGANINI. 

great  that  the  monks  had  to  leave  their  seats  to  silence  the 
uproar  in  the  congregation.  It  was  at  the  end  of  this  tour 
that  NAPOLEON'S  sister,  the  PEINCESS  ELIZA,  offered  the  new 
violinist  the  direction  of  the  Court  music,  and  gave  him 
the  grade  of  captain  in  the  lloyal  Guard,  with  the  privi- 
lege of  wearing  that  officer's  brilliant  uniform  on  state 
occasions. 

Between   1805  and    1812,  whilst   in   the   service  of  the 

PRINCESS  ELIZA,  afterwards  GRAND  DUCHESS  OF  TUSCANY,

AFTER 

EFFECT,  upon  new  effects  and  combinations,  but,  at  the 
very  time  when  each  new  exploit  was  being  greeted  with 
frantic  applause,  he  betook  himself  to  an  exhaustive  study 
of  the  old  masters.  Something  he  seemed  to  be  groping 
after — some  clue  he  wished  to  find.  How  often  had  he 
thrown  over  VIOTTI,  PUGNANI,  KREUTZER,  how  often  had 
he  returned  to  their  works  1  All  were  found  utterly  in- 
adequate to  suggest  to  him  a  single  fresh  thought,  and  it 
was  nothing  short  of  a  new  world  that  he  was  bound  to 
discover. 

In  studying  the  ninth  work  of  LOCATELLI,  entitled 
L'Arte  de  Nuova  Modulazione  his  brain  was  set  suddenly 
agoing  in  the  peculiar  direction  of  his  new  aspirations. 
Every  original  genius  seeks  some  such  clue  or  point  of 
departure.  Something  in  LOCATELLI'S  method  inflamed 


PLAYING   ON  ONE  STRING,  349 

PAGANINI  with  those  conceptions  of  simultaneous  notes  struck 
in  different  parts  of  the  instrument ;  the  hitherto  unknown 
management  of  the  screws,  in  which  the  violin  was  tuned 
all  sorts  of  ways  to  reach  effects  never  heard  before  or  since  ; 
the  harmonic  flying  out  at  all  points,  the  arpeggios  and 
pizzicatos,  of  which  more  anon ;  these  which  were  in  after 
years  brought  to  such  perfection,  were  born  out  of  infinite 
study  and  practice,  under  the  stimulating  influence  of  the 
GRAND  DUCHESS  and  her  Court. 

It  is  at  this  season  of  his  life  that  PAGANINI  appears   most 

like  other  people ;  the  idol  of  the  Court,  untouched  as  yet 

by   any   definite   malady,   occupying   an   official 

£vv* 

PLATING  os  post,  and  systematically  labouring  to  perfect  a 
°'  talent  which  already  seemed  too  prodigious  to 
belong  to  any  one  man, — all  conditions  seemed  most  favour- 
able to  his  peace  and  pleasure,  could  they  have  only  lasted, 
but  this  was  not  possible.  They  continued  until  he  had 
achieved  the  last  step  in  the  ladder  of  consummate  skill,  and 
no  longer.  Probably  all  his  executive  peculiarities  were 
developed  at  this  time.  It  was  at  Florence,  for  instance  (and 
not  in  a  prison),  that  PAGANINI  first  played  upon  only  two — 
the  first  and  fourth — strings,  and  then  upon  one — the  fourth 
— string.  Being  in  love  with  a  lady  of  the  Court,  who 
reciprocated  his  attachment,  he  gave  out  that  he  would 
depict  upon  his  violin  a  Scene  Amoureuse ;  the  treble  string, 
we  presume,  was  the  lady,  and  the  fourth  string  the  f  eutle- 


350  PAG  AN  INI. 

man.  The  emotional  dialogue  was  carried  on  between  the 
two  in  a  manner  which  fairly  overcame  the  audience  with 
delight,  and  led  to  the  GRAND  DUCHESS  requesting  him  to 
try  one  string  alone  next  time.  How  he  succeeded  in  that 
exploit  is  known  to  all  the  world,  for  he  ever  afterwards 
retained  an  extreme  partiality  for  the  fourth  string. 

In  1808  he  obtained  from  the  GRAND  DUCHESS  leave  to 
travel.  His  fame  had  preceded  him.  Leghorn,  where  seven 
270.  years  before  he  had  forfeited  his  famous  Stradi- 
PROMGIOCS  varius  and  won  a  Guarnerius,  received  him  with 
FACILITY,  open  arms,  although  his  appearance  was  marked 
by  an  amusing  contretemps.  He  came  on  to  the  stage 
limping,  having  run  a  nail  into  his  heel.  At  all  times 
odd- looking,  he,  no  doubt,  looked  all  the  more  peculiar 
under  these  circumstances,  and  there  was  some  tittering 
among  the  audience.  Just  as  he  began,  the  candles  fell 
out  of  his  desk — more  laughter.  He  went  on  playing, 
the  first  string  broke — more  laughter.  He  played  the  rest 
of  the  concerto  through  on  three  strings,  but  the  laughter 
now  changed  to  vociferous  applause  at  this  feat.  The  beggarly 
elements  seemed  of  little  consequence  to  this  magician. 
One  or  more  strings,  it  was  all  the  same  to  him  ;  indeed,  it 
is  recorded,  that  he  seldom  paused  to  mend  his  strings  when 
they  broke,  which  they  not  unfrequently  did.  Whether 
from  abstraction  or  carelessness  he  would  allow  them  at 
times  to  grow  quite  ragged  on  the  finger  board,  and  his

constant  practice  of  plucking  them,  guitar-like,  with  the  left 
hand,  as  well  as  harp-like  with  the  fore-finger  of  the  right 
hand,  helped,  no  doubt,  to  wear  them  out  rapidly. 

At  Ferrara  both  he  and  his  violin  met  with  a  different 
reception.  A  singer  had  failed  him,  and  he  had  induced 

a  danseuse  who  had  a  pretty  voice  to  come  to  the 
A  NARROW  rescue.  Some  graceless  fellow  in  the  audience 

hissed  her  singing,  which  caused  PAGANINI  to 
take  a  revenge  little  suited  to  the  occasion.  In  his  last 
solo  he  imitated  the  cries  of  various  animals,  and  suddenly 
advancing  to  the  foot-lights,  caused  his  violin  to  bray  like 
an  ass,  with  the  exclamation,  "This  is  for  him  who  hissed  \" 
Instead  of  laughter,  the  pit  rose  in  fury,  and  would  have 
soon  made  short  work  of  him  and  his  violin,  had  he  not 
escaped  by  a  back  door.  It  appears  that  the  country  folk 
round  Ferrara  called  the  town's  people,  whom  they  hated, 
"  asses,"  and  were  in  the  habit  of  singing  out  "  hee-haw  ! " 
whenever  they  had  to  allude  to  them,  hence  the  angry 
reception  of  PAGANINI'S  musical  repartee. 

We  get  but  fugitive  glances  of  the  great  artist  during 
this  professional  tour,  but  it  is  too  true  that  at  Turin  he 

was  attacked  with  that  bowel  complaint  which

together.  His  distrust  of  doctors,  and  love  of  quack 
medicines,  no  doubt  made  matters  worse,  and  from  this 
time  his  strange  appearance  grew  stranger,  his  pallor  more 
livid,  his  gauntness  and  thinness  more  spectral  and  grotesque, 
whilst  greatly,  no  doubt,  in  consequence  of  suffering,  his 
face  assumed  that  look  of  eagle  sharpness,  sometimes  varied 
by  a  sardonic  grin,  or  a  look  of  almost  demoniacal  fury, 
which  artists  have  caricatured,  and  sculptors  have  tried  to 
tone  down.  Indeed,  he  must  have  been  altogether  an  ex- 
ceptional being  to  behold  in  the  flesh.  People  who  knew 
him  say  that  the  figure  which  used  still  to  be  exhibited 
at  MADAME  TUSSAUD'S,  some  twenty-five  years  ago,  was  a 
remarkable  likeness.  He  looked  like  an  indifferently  dressed 
skeleton,  with  a  long  parchment  face,  deep  dark  eyes,  full 
of  flame,  long  lank  hair,  straggling  down  over  his  shoulders. 
II is  walk  was  shambling  and  awkward,  the  bones  seem 
to  have  been  badly  strung  together,  he  appeared  as  if  he 
had  been  fixed  up  hastily  on  wires  and  the  wires  had  got 
loose.  As  he  stood,  he  settled  himself  on  one  hip,  at  a 
gaunt  angle,  and  before  he  began,  the  whole  business 
looked  so  unpromising,  that  men  wondered  how  he  could 
hold  his  violin  at  all,  much  less  play  it ! 

It  must  have  been  at  his  first  visit  to  Florence,  before 
his  appearance  was  familiar,  as  it  afterwards  became,  to  the 
inhabitants  of  that  city,  that  we  get  one  of  those  side-views 
of  the  man  which  are  more  precious  than  many  dates  and 
drier  details. 


A  MEETING.  353 

Slowly  recovering  from    illness,   PAGAN  INI    repaired    to 

Florence,  probably  in  May  of  the  year  1809.     He  must  have 

then  lived  in  almost  complete  solitude,  as  he  does

not  appear  to  have  been  recognised  there  before 

A    MEETING. 

the  month  of  October,  when  he  was  officially 
recalled  to  his  duties  by  the  late  Princess,  now  Grand 
Duchess,  at  the  Court  of  Florence. 

Those  who  have  wandered  in  spring-time  about  the 
environs  of  Florence,  know  the  indefinite  charm  there  is  in 
the  still  and  fertile  country,  without  the  walls  of  the  city. 
Outside  the  gate  of  the  Pitti,  on  the  summit  of  a  steep  hill 
stands  Fiesole,  bathed  in  clear  air  and  warm  sunshine. 
How  many  an  invalid  has  walked  up  that  winding  and  rugged 
path,  gathering,  here  and  there,  a  sweet  wild-flower,  resting 
from  time  to  time,  to  drink  in  the  delicious  air,  until  pure 
health  seemed  borne  back  to  the  feeble  frame  upon  the  soft 
and  fragrant  breeze. 

Alone,  on  a  bright  morning,  a  tall,  ungainly  figure  goes 
slowly  up  the  hill  towards  Fiesole.  He  pauses  at  times, 
he  looks  round  abstractedly.  He  is  talking  to  himself  out 
loud,  unconscious  of  anyone  near  him — he  gesticulates  wildly 
• — then  breaks  out  into  a  loud  laugh — but  stops  suddenly, 
as  he  sees  coming  down  the  hill  a  young  girl,  carrying  one 
of  those  large  baskets  full  of  flowers  so  commonly  seen  in 
the  streets  of  Florence.  She  is  beautiful  with  the  beauty 
of  the  Florentine  girls ;  the  brown  flesh-tints  mellowed 

with  reflected  light  from  the  white  road  strewn  thick  with 

23 


354  PAGANINL 

marble-dust ;  under  the  wide  straw  hat  the  free  curls  flow 
dark  and  thick,  clustering  about  her  temples,  and  lowering 
the  forehead.  Suddenly  the  large  black  eyes,  so  common 
amongst  the  Italian  peasants,  seemed  transfixed  with  some- 
thing between  wonder  and  fear,  as  they  fall  upon  the  uncouth 
figure  approaching  her.  In  another  moment,  conscious  of 
the  stranger's  intense  gaz?,  she  stands  motionless,  like  a  bird 
charmed  by  a  serpent;  then  she  trembles  involuntarily,  from 
head  to  foot.  A  strange  smila  steals  over  the  pale  and 
haggard  face  of  PAGANINI  —  was  he,  then,  conscious  of 
exercising  any  mesmeric  power  ?  At  times  he  seemed  so 
full  of  some  such  influence  that  individuals,  as  well  as 
crowds,  were  irresistibly  drawn  and  fascinated  by  his 
look. 

But  the  strange  smile  seemed  to  unloose  the  spell,  the 
startled  girl  passed  on,  and  the  solitary  artist  resumed  his 
walk  towards  Fiesole.

imminent,  the  wind  whistles,  and  howls  round 
the  deserted  promontory,  the  bare  ruin  that  has  braved  the 
storms  of  centuries  stands  up  dark  against  the  sky,  and 
seems  to  exult  in  the  fury  of  the  elements,  so  much  in 
harmony  with  its  own  wild  and  desolate  look.  But  what 


IN  THE  STORM.  855 

are  those  low  wailings?  Is  it  the  wind,  or  some  human 
being  in  anguish?  The  traveller  rushes  forward — in  a 
cavity  of  the  deep  ruin,  amongst  the  tumbled  stones, 
o'ergrown  with  moss  and  turf,  lies  a  strange  figure — a 
lonely,  haggard  man.  He  listens  to  the  wind,  and  moans 
in  answer,  as  though  in  pain.  Is  he  the  magician  who 
has  conjured  up  the  tempest,  and  is  the  scene  before  us 
all  unreal?  or  has  the  tempest  entered  into  his  soul,  and 
filled  him  with  its  own  sad  voice?  Indeed,  as  he  lies  there — 
his  pale,  almost  livid  face  distorted,  his  wet  hair  streaming 
wildly  about  his  shoulders — his  uncouth  form  writhing  with 
each  new  burst  of  the  hurricane — he  looks  the  very  imper- 
sonation of  the  storm  itself.  But,  on  being  observed,  hia 
look  becomes  fixed — the  stranger  insensibly  recoils,  and 
feels  awkwardly  the  sense  of  intrusion.  If  the  strange  man 
is  in  pain  he  wants  no  help  ;  thus  rashly  exposed  to  the 
weather,  hardly  recovered  from  his  grievous  malady,  he  may 
well  be  actually  suffering,  but  most  likely  he  is  merely 
possessed  for  the  time  by  certain  emotions  impressed  upon 
his  sensitive  and  electric  organization  by  the  tempest  from 
without.  He  is  drinking  in  the  elemental  forces  which,  by- 
and-by,  he  will  give  out  with  a  power  itself  almost  as 
elemental. 

Some  of  us  may  have  walked  in  the  soft  moonlight  under 
the  long  avenue  (Cascine)  that  runs  by  the  brink  of  the 

rushing    Arno    straight    out    of    Florence.      We    can    re-

daylight  birds  are  sometimes  aroused  by  the 
nightingales,  as  they  answer  each  other  in  notes  of  sweet- 
ness long  drawn  out,  and  tender  raptures  that  seem  to 
swoon  and  faint  into  the  still  more  tender  silences  of  the 
summer  night.  But  suddenly  the  birds'  song  is  checked — 
other  strains  of  incomparable  sweetness  arise  in  the  wood. 
The  birds  are  silent,  they  pause  and  listen:  the  notes  are 
like  theirs,  but  more  exquisite — they  are  woven  by  a  higher 
art  into  phrases  of  inspiration  beyond  even  the  nightingale's 
gift.  The  strange  whistler  ceases,  and  the  birds  resume, 
timidly,  their  song ;  again  the  unearthly  music  breaks  forth, 
and  mingles  with  theirs.  As  we  push  apart  the  bushes,  we 
discover  the  same  weird  figure  that  but  lately  lay  moaning 
in  the  storm  among  the  ruins  upon  yonder  hill. 

The  person  to  whom   we   owe,  substantially,  the    above 
glimpses,  met  this  extraordinary  man  again  in  the  streets 
of  Florence  a   few  days  later.     A  merry  party 
ON  THE     of  young  people,   laughing    and   shouting,  pass 
by  towards  the  UtFizu — we  listen  to  their  ringing 
voices,   occupied   with  themselves,  and,    youth-like,  caring 
for  nothing  at  the  time  but  their  own  gaiety,  when  sud- 
denly the  voices  fall,   the  twanging  of  the    guitar  ceases, 
a   curious   murmur   runs   through    the    merry  throng,   and 


PERSONAL   TRAITS.  357 

not  a  pleasant  murmur ;  a  tall,  pale  man,  with  eyes  on 
fire,  -and  strange,  imperious  look,  has  pushed  brusquely 
in  amongst  them.  He  seizes  the  guitar,  and,  sweeping 
its  strings  with  passion,  causes  it  to  wail  like  a  zither, 
then  peal  out  like  the  strains  of  a  military  band,  and 
finally  settle  into  the  rich  chords  and  settled  cadences  of  a 
strong  harp.  All  resistance  and  murmuring  ceases  as  the 
astonished  party  follow  him,  spell-bound.  His  cravat  flies 
loose,  his  coat-tails  wave  madly  to  and  fro,  he  gesticulates 
like  a  maniac,  and  the  irresistible  music  streams  forth 
louder,  wilder,  more  magical  than  ever — he  strides,  leaps, 
dances  forward  with  the  guitar,  which  is  no  longer  a 
guitar,  but  the  very  soul  of  NicoLO  PACANIXI.  A  few  days 
later  still  the  mystery  was  cleared  up.  PAGANINI  had  been 
officially  called  to  Florence  by  the  Grand  Duchess  to  super- 
intend the  Court  concerts,  and  the  whole  of  the  town  was 
soon  ringing  with  his  name. 

About   the    age  of    thirty,  at  which    time,  as    we   shall 

presently  narrate,  PAGANINI  became  free  never  again  to  be 

bound   by   any   official   appointment — the    great

of  his  instrument.  From  this  time  PAGANINI, 
incredible  as  it  may  appear,  seldom,  if  ever,  played,  except 
at  concerts  and  rehearsals,  and  not  always  even  at  rehearsals. 
If  he  ever  practised,  he  always  used  a  mute.  MR.  HARKIS,

left  him,  never  saw  him  take  his  violin  from  its  case.  At  the 
hotels  where  he  stopped  the  sound  of  his  instrument  was  never 
heard.  Tie  used  to  say  that  he  had  worked  enough,  and 
had  earned  his  right  to  repose;  yet,  without  an  effort,  he  con-

watched  by  the  eager  and  envious  eyes  of  critics  and  rivals. 
In  vain !  No  false  intonation,  no  note  out  of  tune,  no

were  so  true  that  they  sounded  like  one  note,  and  the  most 
enormous  intervals  with  triple  notes,  harmonics  and  guitar 
effects,  seem  to  have  been  invariably  taken  with  the  same 
precision.  In  the  words  of  a  critical  judge,  M.  FETIS,  "  his 
hand  was  a  geometrical  compass,  which  divided  the  fingcr-

board  with  mathematical  precision."  There  is  an  amusing 
story  told  of  an  Englishman,  who  followed  him  from  place 
to  place,  to  hear  him  play  in  private,  in  the  hope  of  dis- 
covering his  "  secret."  At  last,  after  many  vain  attempts, 
he  managed  to  get  lodged  in  the  next  room  to  the  groat

artist.  Looking  through  the  key-hole,  he  beheld  him  seated 
on  a  sofa,  about  to  take  his  violin  from  its  case — at  last ! 
He  raises  it  to  his  chin — but  the  bo\v  ? — is  left  in  the  case. 
The  left  hand  merely  measures  with  its  enormous  wiry 
fingers  a  few  mechanical  intervals,  and  the  instrument  is 
replaced  in  silence — not  even  then  was  a  note  to  be  heard ! 

Yet   every   detail   of  rehearsal   was   an    anxiety  to   him. 
Although  he  gave  a  prodigious  number  of  concerts,  he  was 
always  unusually  restless  and  abstracted  on  the  morning  of 
the  day  on  which  he  had  to  perform.     He  would  be  idle  fo1' 
hours  on  his  sofa — or,  at  least,  he  seemed  to  be  idle — perhaps 
the  works  were  then  being  wound  up  before  going  to  re- 
hearsal— he  would  then,  before  starting,  take  up  his  violin, 
examine   it   carefully,   especially   the    screws,   and,   having 
satisfied  himself,  replace  it  in  its  shabby-worn  case   without 
striking   a   note.     Lastly,  he  would   sort   arid  arrange  the 
orchestral  parts  of  his  solos,  and  go  off  to  rehearsal.     He 
was  very  unpunctual,  and  on  one  occasion  kept  the  whole 
band  waiting  for  an  hour,  and  was  at  last  found   sheltering 
from  the  rain  under  a  colonnade,  rather  than  take  a  cab. 
This  was  in  London.     At  the  rehearsal  there  was  always 
the  most  intense  eagerness  on  the  part  of  the  band  to  hear 
him   play,    and   when    he   came    to  oue  of   his  prodigious 
cadenzas,  the  musicians  would  rise  in  their  seats,  and  lean 
forward  to  watch  every  movement,  and  follow  every  sound. 
PAGANINI  would  then  just  play  a  few  common-place  notes, 
stop  suddenly,  and,  turning  round  to  the  band,  wave  his 


PERSONAL   TRAITS.  361 

bow,  with  a  malicious  smile,  and  say,  "  Et  ceetera, 
Messieurs ! "  If  anything  went  wrong  he  got  into  a 
paroxysm  of  fury ;  but  when  things  went  well  he  freely 
showed  his  satisfaction,  and  often  exclaimed,  "Bravissimo 
sieti  tuti  virtuosi !  "  He  could  be  very  courteous  in  his 
manner,  and  was  not  personally  unpopular  with  his  fellow- 
musicians,  who  stood  greatly  in  awe  of  him.  No  one  ever 
saw  the  principal  parts  of  his  solos,  as  he  played  by  heart, 
for  fear  of  the  music  being  copied.  The  rehearsal  over,  he 
carried  even  the  orchestral  parts  away  with  him.  He 
would  then  go  straight  home,  take  a  light  meal,  throw  him- 
self on  his  bed,  and  sleep  profoundly  until  his  carriage 
arrived  to  take  him  to  the  concert.  His  toilet  was  very 
simple,  and  took  hardly  any  time ;  his  coat  was  buttoned 
tightly  over  his  chest,  and  marked  the  more  conspicuously 
the  impossible  angles  of  his  figure ;  his  trousers  hung  loose 
for  trousers  of  the  period;  his  cravat  was  tight  about  his 
neck.  He  sweated  so  profusely  over  his  solos,  that  he 
always  carried  a  clean  shirt  in  his  violin  trunk,  and  changed 
-his  linen  once  at  least  during  the  concert.  At  concert  time 
he  usually  seemed  in  excellent  spirits.  His  first  question  on 
arriving  was  always,  "  Is  there  a  large  audience  ?  "  If  the 
room  was  full  he  would  say,  "  Excellent  people !  good, 
good !  "  If  by  any  chance  the  boxes  were  empty  he  would 
say,  "  Some  of  the  effects  will  be  lost."  He  kept  his 
audience  waiting  a  long  time,  and  he  would  sometimes  say, 
"I  have  played  better,"  or  "I  have  played  worse,"  and 


362  PAGANINI. 

occasionally  his  first  solo  would  be  more  effective  than  his 
last.  After  once  or  twice  trying  the  music  of  KREUTZER 
and  RODE  in  public,  he  decided  never  to  play  any  but  his 
own,  and  said  to  his  secretary,  Mil.  HARRIS,  "  I  have  my 
own  peculiar  style ;  in  accordance  with  this  I  regulate  my 
compositions.  I  had  much  rather  write  a  piece  in  which  I 
can  trust  myself  entirely  to  my  own  musical  impressions." 
" His  art,"  observes  M.  FEUS,  "was  an  art  born  with  him, 
the  secret  of  which  he  has  carried  to  the  grave." 

Some  have  pretended  that,  as  PAGANINI  never  cared  to 
play  except  in  public,  his  art  was  nothing  to  him  but  a 

means  of  making  money.     It  would  be,  perhaps, 

278. 

ABT  AND  nearer  the  truth  to  say  that  his  art  was  so 
entirely  himself,  that  he  did  not  require,  except 
at  seasons,  and  chiefly  for  others,  to  give  it  outward  ex- 
pression. He  needed  no  more  to  play  than  BEETHOVEN 
needed  to  hear.  Happier  than  BEETHOVEN,  he  was  not 
deprived  of  the  power  of  realising  outwardly  the  art  in 
which  he  inwardly  lived ;  but  probably  the  creations  of 
his  spirit  infinitely  outstripped  the  utmost  limits  even  of 
his  executive  powers,  until  in  his  eyes  they  seemed,  after 
all,  the  faint  and  inadequate  symbols  of  his  wild  and 
inspired  dreams.  There  are  times  when  the  deepest  feeling 
is  the  most  silent — music  may  come  to  the  aid  of  words ; 
but  there  is  a  point  at  which  music  itself  is  a  mere  beggarly 
element.  What  made  PAGANINI  so  exceptionally  great  was 


ART  AND  LIFE.  363 

the  portentous  development,  the  strength  and  independence 
of  the  emotional  fountain  within.  The  whole  of  life  was  to 
him  nothing  but  so  many  successions  of  psychological  heat 
and  cold.  Incidents  immediately  became  clothed  with  a 
psychic  atmosphere — perhaps  the  life  of  emotion  was  never 
so  completely  realised  in  itself,  and  for  itself,  as  in  the  soul- 
isolation  of  PAGANINI.  That  life,  as  far  as  it  could  be 
individually  expressed,  was  uttered  forth  by  his  violin.  On 
his  concert  bills  he  used  to  put, — 

Paganini  fara  sentire  il  suo  violino. 

What  the  tempest  had  told  him  his  violin  would  proclaim ; 
what  the  summer  night  had  whispered  was  stereotyped  in 
his  soul,  and  the  midnight  song  of  birds  came  forth  from 
the  Cremona  depths  at  his  bidding.  Nor  was  there  any 
phase  of  passion  unknown  to  him,  save,  alas !  the  phase  of 
a  pure  and  lasting  love.  His  wild  soul  had  early  consumed 
itself  with  unbridled  excesses,  and  although  in  his  maturer 
years  he  grew  more  sober  in  such  matters,  it  was  not  before 
he  had  fathomed  the  perilous  depths  of  more  than  one 
grande  passion,  and  made  himself  master  of  all  its  subtle 
expressions. 

When,  then,  we  are  told  that  he  seldom  played,  we  must 
remember  that  his  inmost  life  was  itself  one  vast  cosmos  of 
imaginary  concord  and  discord — he  was  music,  although 
only  at  times  "  the  tides  of  music's  golden  sea  "  would  burst 
forth  with  incomparable  splendour,  and  gather  a  kind  of 


364  PAGANIXI. 

concrete  existence  in  sound,  yet  to  him  his  own  inspirations 
were  as  real — perhaps  more  real — without  it.  For  music 
exists  apart  from  physical  vibrations,  nor  can  such  vibra- 
tions, however  subtle  and  varied,  express  it  wholly  as  it 
lives  in  the  creative  heart.  The  ear  of  the  soul  hears  what 
no  ear  of  sense  can  hear,  and  a  music  fairer  than  anything 
on  earth  is  often  sounding  in  the  spirit  of  the  true  musical 
seer.  Nay,  does  he  not  feel,  like  BEETHOVEN,  the  bitter 
descent  when  he  formulates  his  thoughts  upon  paper,  strikes 
the  keys,  or  sets  in  vibration  the  strings  which  after  all  are 
but  feeble'  apologies  for  the  ideal  beauty,  the  intense,  the 
subtle,  or  exalted  harmonies  of  the  inner  life  ? 

Shall  we  now  assist  at  one  of  PAGANINI'S  performances? 
How  many  descriptions  have  been  written,  and  how  inade- 
quate !      It  is  hardly  possible  to  do  more  than 
ENTKR      describe  a  few  salient  peculiarities.      But  even 
our  pale   sketch  would   be   incomplete   without 
such  an  attempt. 

Enter  PAGANINI — a  shudder  of  curiosity  and  excitement 
runs  through  the  crowded  theatre,  the  men  applaud,  the 
women  concentrate  a  double-barrel  fire  of  opera-glasses 
upon  the  tall,  ungainly  figure  that  shuffles  forward  from  the 
side  scenes  to  the  foot-lights,  with  such  an  air  of  haughti- 
ness, and  yet  so  many  mechanical  bows.  As  the  applause 
rises  again  and  again,  the  apparition  stands  still,  looks 
round,  takes  in  at  a  glance  the  vast  assembly.  Then,

seizing  his  violin,  he  hugs  it  tightly  between  his  chin  and 
chest,  and  stands  for  a  few  seconds  gazing  at  it  in  motion- 
less abstraction.  The  audience  is  now  completely  hushed, 
and  all  eyes  are  riveted  upon  one  silent  and  almost  gro- 
tesque form.  Suddenly  PAGANINI  raises  his  bow  and  dashes 
it  down  like  a  sledge-hammer  upon  the  strings.  The  open- 
ing of  the  concerto  abounds  in  solo  passages,  in  which  he 
has  to  be  left  almost  without  accompaniment ;  the  orchestra 
is  reserved  for  the  tuttis  and  slight  interludes.  PAGANINI 
now  revels  in  his  distinctive  and  astonishing  passages, 
which  hold  the  audience  breathless.  At  one  time  torrents 
of  chords  peal  forth,  as  from  some  mimic  orchestra ;  har- 
monic passages  are  thrown  off  with  the  sharpness  and 
sonority  of  the  flute  accompanied  by  the  guitar,  indepen- 
dent phrases  being  managed  by  the  left  hand  plucking  the 
strings,  whilst  the  right  is  playing  legato  passages  with  the 
bow.  The  most  difficult  intervals  are  spanned  with  ease — 
the  immense,  compass-like  fingers  glide  up  and  down  every 
part  of  the  key-board,  and  seem  to  be  in  ever  so  many  places 
at  once.  Heavy  chords  are  struck  indifferently  with  the 
point  or  heel  of  the  bow,  as  if  each  inch  of  the  magic  wand 
were  equally  under  control;  but  just  when  these  prodigious 
feats  of  skill  are  causing  the  senses  to  reel  with  something 
like  a  painful  strain,  a  low,  measured  melody  steals  forth 
and  penetrates  the  souls  of  all  present,  untilsome  of  the 
audience  break  out  into  uncontrollable  applause,  whilst 
others  are  melted  to  tears,  overpowered  by  the  thrilling 


3G6  PAGANINI. 

accents.  Then,  attenuated  as  it  were  to  a  thread — but  still 
distinctly  audible  and  resonant — the  divine  sound  would  die 
away  ;  and  suddenly  a  grotesque  flash  of  humour  would 
dart  up  from  a  lower  sphere  and  shift  the  emotional  atmo- 
sphere, as  the  great  maestro  too  soon  dashes,  with  the  im- 
petuosity of  a  whirlwind,  into  the  final  "rondo"  or  "moto 
perpetuo." 

PAGANINI  was  not  inexorable  about  encores — he  was 
always  gratified  by  applause.  After  the  concert  the  people 
often  waited  outside  to  accompany  him  to  his  hotel.  He 
seemed  delighted  with  this  kind  of  homage,  and  would  go 
out  at  such  seasons  and  mix  freely  with  them ;  but  he  was 
often  quite  inaccessible,  and  bent  upon  absolute  seclusion. 

Let  us  now  resume  the  chronological  narrative.     Towards 

the    end    of    1812,    PAGANINI    quarrelled   with    his    royal 

patroness,  the    GRAND    DUCHESS   OF    TUSCANY. 

280. 

HIS  INDE-  She  had  given  him  leave,  as  above  mentioned, 
to  wear  at  Court  the  uniform  of  captain  of  the 
body-guard,  and  one  ni^ht  he  appeared  in  the  orchestra 
attired  in  this  splendid  costume.  The  Duchess  seems  to 
have  thought  this  inappropriate,  and  sent  word  desiring 
him  to  change  his  uniform  for  an  ordinary  dress.  The 
offended  artist  declined  point-blank,  and  that  evening  threw 
up  his  appointment  and  left  the  Florentine  Court  and  all 
its  works  for  ever.  It  is  not  at  all  improbable  that  PAGA- 
NINI, who  could  now  command  any  sum  of  money,  had 


PAGANINI  AND  SPOIIR.  367 

grown  tired  of  official  duties,  which  could  no  longer  shed 
any  new  lustre  upon  him,  and  that,  longing  to  be  free,  he 
gladly  availed  himself  of  the  first  ready  pretext  for  flight. 
In  vain  his  royal  mistress  sent  after  him,  imploring  him  to 
return.  PAGANINI  was  inexorable,  and  it  was  even  whis- 
pered that  the  Duchess's  entreaties  were  prompted  by  a 
feeling  still  more  tender  than  the  love  of  music — a  feeling 
which  PAGANINI  had  ceased  to  reciprocate. 

PAGANINI  was  very  fond  of  Milan,  and  he  stayed  there 
during  the  greater  part  of  1813.  He  visited  that  city  three 
times  in  five  years,  staying  often  for  several  months,  and 
giving  in  all  thirty-seven  concerts,  most  of  them  at  the 
Scala. 

It  was  in  1814  that  he  first  made  the  acquaintance  of 
ROSSINI  at  Bologna.  The  great  composer,  like  every  other 
connoisseur,  regarded  him  with  admiration  and  astonish- 
ment, and  a  friendship  was  then  begun  which  was  strength- 
ened when  the  two  celebrities  met  in  1817  at  Rome,  and  in 
1831  at  Paris. 

PAGANINI   treated   his  fellow -musicians   and   rivals  with 

simple   and  unaffected  courtesy.     He  expressed  his  great 

281.        admiration   of    SPOHil's   violin-playing,    and    he

posed that  they  should  give  a  concert,  in  which  each 
should  play  a  solo.  "I  excused  myself,"  says  PAGANINI, 


368  PAGAN1NL 

"by  saying  that  such  experiments  are  always  impolitic, 
as  the  public  invariably  looked  upon  them  as  duels. 
LAFONT,  not  seeing  it  in  this  light,  I  was  compelled  to 
accept  the  challenge."  Commenting  upon  the  results,  he 
added  with  singular  candour  and  modesty :  "  LAFONT  pro- 
bably surpassed  me  in  tone,  but  the  applause  which  followed 
my  efforts  convinced  me  that  I  did  not  suffer  by  com- 
parison." Although  usually  anxious,  more  for  the  sake 
of  others  than  for  himself,  to  avoid  such  contests,  he 
never  declined  them ;  and  a  similar  trial  of  skill  took 
place  between  him  and  the  Polish  violinist,  LAPPJNSKF, 
in  1818,  at  Plaisance,  the  two  artists  remaining  excellent 
friends. 

At  this  time  PAGANINI'S  health  seems  to  have  been  in  an 

unusually   critical    condition.      We    have   noticed    that    he 

seldom  consulted  doctors,   and  when  he  did  so

lie  dosed  himself  immoderately  with  some  stuff  called 
"  Leroy  " ;  he  believed  that  this  could  cure  anything.  It 
usually  produced  a  powerful  agitation  in  his  nervous  system, 
and  generally  ended  in  upsetting  the  intestinal  functions. 
Sometimes  it  seems  to  have  deprived  him  of  the  power  of 
speech. 

In   1816  he  went  to  Venice,  where  he  seems  fairly  to

He,  no  doubt,  loved  money,  and  had  a  general  distrust  of 

his  friends,  but  it  is  certain  that  he  was  attached  to  his 

mother,  and  took  care  to  supply  her  with  every  comfort. 

She  writes  to  him  some  years  later  : —

The  "  amiable  companion ''  seems  to  have  been  a  canta- 
trice,  ANTONIA  BLANCH  i  DI  COMO,  with  whom  he  appears  to 
have  lived  at  one  time,  and  who  bore  him  his  only  son,  "  the 
little  Achille." 

In  the  same  year,  1817,  he  arrived  in  Rome  in  time  for 

the  Carnival,  where   he   excited    the   greatest  enthusiasm.

•VISIT  TO     met  all  the  great  people  in  Rome,  and  among 

them  M.  DE  METTERNICH,  who  did  his  utmost 
to  persuade  him  to  visit  Vienna.  From  this  time  PAGA- 
NINI  determined,  sooner  or  later,  to  visit  the  principal 
cities  in  Germany  and  France,  but  the  state  of  his  health 
was  still  very  precarious.  In  1818-19  he  gave  concerts 
at  Verona,  Plaisance,  Turin,  and  Florence,  after  which  he 
visited  Naples  for  the  first  time.  His  advent  had  been 
long  looked  for  with  feelings  of  jealous  expectation  and 
distrust.  The  chief  professors  and  musicians  of  the  place, 
who  had  never  heard  him,  were  not  very  favourably  dis- 
posed. They,  however,  gave  him  a  reception,  on  which 
occasion  a  piece  of  music  was  casually  placed  before 
him,  full  of  the  most  ingenious  difficulties  that  could  be 
devised.  PAGANINI  was  not  unaccustomed  to  this  kind  of 
trap,  and  upon  being  requested  to  play  it  at  sight,  he 
merely  glanced  at  it  and  played  it  off  with  the  greatest 
ease. 

But  he  had  even  worse   foes   than  the   professors.     He 

seems    to  have   got    into    damp    apartments    close   under 

285.        St.  Elmo,  and  his  lungs,  at  no  time  very  strong,

the  street,  where  his  friend,  CIANDELLI,  happening  to 
come  by  at  the  very  nick  of  time,  administered  a  sound 
thrashing  to  the  brutal  host  with  a  stick,  and  took  the 
invalid  artist  to  a  more  comfortable  lodging.  In  1820 
he  returned  to  his  favourite  city,  Milan,  where  he  founded 
a  musical  society,  conducted  several  concerts,  and  received 
various  crowns,  medals,  and  decorations.  In  December 
of  the  same  year  he  returned  to  Rome,  and  in  the  fol- 
lowing year,  1821,  paid  a  second  visit  to  Naples,  giving 
concerts  at  the  Fondo  and  the  Theatre  Nuovo.  At  the 
end  of  the  year  he  crossed  over  to  Sicily,  but  the  people 
of  Palermo  hardly  appreciated  him ;  and  in  1822  he  is 
again  at  Venice  and  Plaisance.  From  thence  he  would  have 
gone  straight  to  Germany,  in  accordance  with  the  proposals 
of  METTERNICII  ;  but  on  his  way  to  Pavia,  in  18.23,  he  was 
attacked  by  his  old  complaint,  and  for  some  time  it  did  net 
seem  likely  that  he  would  recover.  He  was  advised  to  go 
to  Genoa  for  rest,  and  whilst  there  he  recovered  sufficiently 
to  give  concerts  at  the  Theatre  St.  Augustine,  when  the 
prophet  in  his  own  country  for  once  attracted  enthusiastic 
crowds.  The  Milanese,  who  had  never  expected  to  see  him 
alive  again,  gave  him  an  enthusiastic  reception  at  the  Scala, 
on  the  12th  of  June  1824.  He  seems  to  have  been  still 
unable  to  tear  himself  away  from  Italy,  for  in  the  same 
month  he  returned  to  Genoa,  then  passed  to  Venice,  and  in 
1825  he  was  at  Trieste.  Then  he  proceeded,  for  the  third 
e.;  to  Naples,  and  going  over  to  Palermo,  for  the  second

time,  lie  now  met  with  a  most  astonishing  success.  He 
remained  in  Sicily  for  a  whole  year,  and  seems  in  this 
delicious  climate  to  have  recovered  his  health  sufficiently  to 
undertake  a  long  professional  tour.  He  was  then  detained 
in  Italy  for  nearly  two  years  more,  for  in  1826  he  visited 
again  Trieste,  Venice,  and  gave  five  concerts  at  Rome.  In 
1827  he  was  decorated  by  POPE  LEO  XII.  with  the  Order 
of  the  Golden  Spur.  He  then  repaired  to  Florence,  where 
a  disease  in  one  of  his  legs  stopped  his  progress  for 
several  months.  It  was  only  in  the  spring  of  1828  that 
he  went  on  to  Milan,  where  he  at  length  gave  his  fare- 
well concert,  before  starting  on  his  long-projected  visit  to 
Vienna. 

To   dwell   upon  the   reports   of  his   first   appearance  at 
Vienna   would  be  only  to   repeat   what  ha&   already   been 

said.      "The   first   note   that  he   played  on  his

many. Acted  upon,  as  by  an  electric  spark,  a  brilliant 
halo  of  glory  appeared  to  invest  his  whole  person,  he 
stood  before  us  like  a  miraculous  apparition  in  the 
domain  of  Art ! "  He  gave  concerts  in  the  capital  of 
Austria  on  the  13th,  IGth,  and  18th  of  April  1828.  The 
greatest  players  and  musicians  from  all  parts  flocked  to  hear

united  in  extolling  the  new  prodigy.  In  a  very  few  days 
Vienna  seemed  to  be  turned  upside  down — no  class  of 
people  was  unmoved  by  the  presence  of  this  extraordinary 
man.  The  newspapers  were  full  of  verses  and  articles  on 
PAGANINI.  Cravats,  coats,  gloves,  hats,  shoes,  and  even 
cigar-cases  and  snuff-boxes — everything  was  now  a  la 
Paganini.  The  fashionable  cooks  called  new  dishes  by  his 
name;  any  great  stroke  at  billiards  was  a  coup  a  la 
Paganini. 

He  stayed  several  months  at  Vienna,  but  time  did  not 
injure  his  popularity ;  his  talent  bore  the  most  critical 
inspection  all  round, — he  was  at  once  colossal  in  the  breadth 
and  majesty  of  his  effects,  and  microscopic  in  the  perfection 
and  subtlety  of  his  details.  At  the  acme  of  his  fame  he 
left  Vienna,  and  commenced  a  tour  through  Austria, 
Bohemia,  Saxony,  Poland,  Bavaria,  Prussia,  and  the 
Rhenish  Provinces.  Prague  was  the  only  city  which  failed 
to  appreciate  him.  There  was  a  stupid  rivalry,  of  which 
we  find  traces  in  the  days  of  MOZART,  between  Vienna  and 
Prague,  and  it  was  generally  understood  that  whoever 
was  applauded  at  Vienna  was  to  be  hissed  at  Prague,  and 
vice  versa.  But  on  reaching  Berlin  the  great  artist  was 
received  with  such  an  ovation,  that  he  is  said  to  have 
exclaimed,  on  his  first  appearance,  "  Here  is  my  Vienna 
public  \" 

From  this  time  to  the  end  of  his  life,  the  wildest  stories 


374  PAGANINI. 

began  to  be  circulated  about  him,  chiefly  in  the  Italian  and 
French    newspapers ;    but    the    Leipzig    Gazette 

28  /  • 

PAOANINI  du  Monde  EUyant  cannot  be  held  quite  blame- 
less, for  it  inserted  one  of  the  most  extravagant 
of  these  tales.  One  man  gravely  affirmed  that  PAGANINI'S 
miracles  of  skill  were  no  longer  to  be  wondered  at,  because 
he  had  seen  the  devil  standing  close  behind  him  moving 
his  arms  for  him.  Another  eye-witness  wrote  that  he  had 
for  some  time  observed  a  beautiful  woman  at  PAGANINI'S 
concerts;  he  went  to  the  theatre  in  the  hope  of  again 
seeing  her  on  the  occasion  of  PAGANINI'S  last  perform- 
ance. The%  master  appeared,  played  divinely;  the  house 
was  crammed,  but  where  was  the  lady  ?  Presently — ia 
one  of  the  soft  pauses — a  deep  sigh  was  heard,  it  proceeded 
from  the  beautiful  lady;  tears  were  streaming  down  her 
cheeks,  a  mysterious  person  was  seated  by  her  side,  with 
•whom  PAGANINI  exchanged  a  ghastly  smile  ;  the  lady 
and  her  cavalier  soon  rose ;  the  strange  cavalier  grasped 
her  hand — she  grew  deadly  pale ;  they  proceed  out  of  the 
theatre;  in  a  narrow  by-path  stands  a  carriage  with  coal- 
black  steeds — the  horses'  eyes  seem  on  fire — the  two  enter, 
the  carriage  vanishes — where,  apparently,  there  is  no  road 
at  all,  the  inference  of  all  which  is  that  PAGANINI  was  in 
league  with  the  devil !  It  is  strange  but  true  that  these 
absurd  legends  gained  some  credence  amongst  the  ignorant 
populace  of  Italy  and  France,  though  they  were  probably 
laughed  at  in  Germany. 


PAGANINPS  MORALS.  375 

But  other  stories  of  a  different   kind   annoyed  him  far 

more.     He  was  a  ruffian  who  had  murdered  one  mistress, 

and  decamped  with  another  man's  wife  ;  he  was 

288. 

I'S  an  escaped  convict  ;  he  was  a  political  busy-body. 


He  was  a  spy,  a  thief,  an  immoral  swindler;  he 
had  been  in  prison,  it  was  said,  for  years,  and  had  thus  learned 
his  skill  upon  one  string,  all  the  others  having  got  broken. 
It  is  necessary,  even  at  this  time  of  day,  to  give  a  distinct 
denial  to  this  last  legend.  PAGANINI'S  morals  were  not 
above,  but  they  were  not  below,  the  average  of  the  somewhat 
dissolute  state  of  society  in  which  it  was  his  misfortune  to 
have  been  born  and  bred.  He  never  committed  a  murder, 
or  fought  a  duel,  or  betrayed  a  friend,  or  left  without  provi- 
sion those  whom  he  had  given  just  claims  upon  him.  As  to 
politics,  he  knew  nothing  and  cared  nothing  for  them  ;  and 
he  never  read  the  newspapers  except  when  they  contained 
something  about  himself.  In  Paris  they  pasted  up  a  coarse 
woodcut  of  PAGANINI  chained  in  a  dungeon  about  the  walls 
&nd  hoardings  of  the  city.  PAGANINI  describes  himself  as 
having  stood  before  it  in  mute  astonishment,  until  a  crowd 
gathered  round  him,  and,  recognising  the  likeness,  mobbed 
and  hustled  him  in  the  most  inconvenient  manner.  It  was 
these  reports  that  he  afterwards  bitterly  complained  of,  and 
M.  FETIS,  at  his  request,  drew  up  a  letter,  which  was  after- 
wards published  throughout  Europe,  in  which  the  aggrieved 
violinist  vindicates  his  character  from  the  current  calumnies. 
His  protestations,  however,  were  far  from  stilling  the 


376  PAGANINI. 

rumours,  and,  wlieii  he  arrived  in  London,  some  years  later, 
there  was  no  absurd  and  extravagant  tale  about  him  that 
was  not  eagerly  caught  up  and  circulated  throughout  the 
length  and  breadth  of  the  land.  A  lesser  man  might  have 
courted  this  sort  of  notoriety,  but  PAGANINI,  who  could  do 
without  it,  was  intensely  annoyed  and  wounded.  We  cannot 
follow  the  great  violinist  in  detail  through  his  German  cam- 
paign, in  the  years  1828-29-30,  but  some  notion  of  his  way 
of  life  may  draw  his  personality  a  little  closer  to  the  reader 
ere  we  prepare  to  greet  him  on  our  own  shores.

MENT.  amazing  exertion,  and  fitful  repose — these  causes 
combined  to  produce  a  character  singular  for  its  mingled 
abstraction  and  plasticity.  At  times  he  seemed  in  the 
body,  at  other  times  out  of  the  body — sometimes  he  appeared 
to  be  only  semi-conscious  of  life ;  at  other  times  more 
intensely  conscious  than  any  dozen  people  put  together. 
Physical  causes  acted  at  times  oddly  and  instantly  upon  his 
brain;  at  others  they  found  him  like  stone.  He  was  not 
always  open  to  impressions,  which  at  certain  moments  would 
find  him  so  receptive  that  he  became  the  utter  incarnation 
of  them.  He  was  full  of  contradictions,  which  he  cared 
little  to  explain  either  to  himself  or  to  others.  He  travelled 


PAGANINl'S   TEMPERAMENT.  377 

with  the  utmost  speed  from  place  to  place ;  in  the  hottest 
weather  he  would  have  all  the  carriage  windows  closed. 
Although  latterly  his  lungs  affected  his  voice,  which  became 
thin  and  feeble,  he  delighted  to  talk  loudly  when  rattling 
over  the  roads ;  the  noise  of  the  wheels  seemed  to  excite 
him,  and  set  his  brain  going.  He  never  entered  an  inn 
on  the  road,  but  would  sit  in  his  carriage  until  the  horses 
were  ready,  or  walk  up  and  down  wrapped  in  his  great 
cloak,  and  resent  being  spoken  to.  Arrived  at  his  hotel, 
he  would  throw  all  his  doors  and  windows  open,  and  take 
what  he  called  an  air  bath ;  but  he  never  ceased  to  abuse 
the  climate  of  Germany,  and  said  that  Italy  was  the  only 
place  fit  to  live  in.  His  luggage  was  extremely  simple — • 
a  small  napkin  might  have  contained  the  whole  of  his 
wardrobe — a  coat,  a  little  linen,  and  a  hat-box — a  small 
carpet  bag,  a  shabby  trunk,  containing  his  Guarnerius 
violin,  his  jewels,  a  clean  shirt,  and  his  money — that  was 
all.  He  carried  papers  of  immense  value  in  a  red  pocket- 
book,  along  with  concert  tickets,  letters,  and  accounts. 
These  last  no  one  but  himself  could  read,  as  he  knew 
hardly  any  arithmetic,  and  calculated,  but  with  great 
accuracy,  on  some  method  of  his  own.  He  cared  little 
where  he  slept,  and  seldom  noticed  what  he  ate  or  drank. 
He  never  complained  of  the  inns — every  place  seemed  much 
alike  to  him — out  of  Italy;  he  detested  them  all  equally. 
He  seldom  noticed  scenery,  or  paid  attention  to  the 
sights  of  foreign  towns.  To  himself  he  was  the  only

important  fact  everywhere.  He  often  started  without  food 
in  the  early  morning,  and  remained  fasting  all  day.  At 
night  he  would  take  a  light  supper,  and  some  camomile 
tea,  and  sleep  soundly  until  morning.  At  times  he  ate 
ravenously.  He  remained  taciturn  for  days,  and  then  he 
would  have  ail  his  meals  sent  up  to  his  room ;  but  at 
some  hotels  he  would  dine  at  the  table  d'hote,  and  join 
freely  in  conversation.  He  lay  on  his  sofa  doing  nothing 
the  greater  part  of  every  day;  but  when  making  plans 
for  the  publication  of  his  works  or  the  founding  of  a  musi- 
cal institution,  which  at  one  time  occupied  much  of  his 
thoughts,  he  would  stride  up  and  down  his  room,  and  talk 
in  a  rapid  and  animated  manner.  After  dinner  he  habitu- 
ally sat  in  his  room  in  total  darkness  until  half-past  ten, 
when  he  went  to  bed.  Sometimes  from  sixty  to  eighty 
people,  eager  to  see  him,  would  wait  upon  him  at  his  hotel 
in  the  course  of  the  day.  When  compelled  to  see  visitors, 
he  was  polite ;  but  the  intrusion  of  strangers  fatigued  and 
annoyed  him,  and  he  often  refused  himself  to  everyone.  He 
would  bolt  his  door,  and  not  take  the  least  notice  of  any 
knocks. 

He  would  sit  for  hours  almost  motionless  in  a  kind  of 
trance,  and  apparently  absorbed  in  deep  thought;  but  he 
was  not  always  averse  to  society.  He  was  fond  of  conver- 
sing with  a  few  friends,  and  entered  into  whatever  games 
and  recreations  were  going  on  with  much  zest;  but  if  any- 
one mentioned  music,  he  would  relapse  into  a  sullen  silence, 


AT  PARIS.  37S 

or  go  off  to  some  other  part  of  the  room.  He  disliked 
dining  out ;  but  when  he  accepted  he  usually  ate  largely  of 
everything  on  the  table,  after  which  he  was  generally 
attacked  by  his  old  bowel-complaint.  At  the  time,  how- 
ever, he  would  eat  and  drink  largely  without  any  incon- 
venience. Although  he  mixed  freely  with  the  world,  like 
CHOPIN,  he  was  a  solitary  man,  and  reserved  to  the  last 
degree.  No  one  seemed  to  be  in  his  confidence.  He  had 
an  excellent  memory — yet  certain  faces  seemed  to  pass  from 
him  absolutely.  His  fidelity  to  both  his  parents  was  not 
the  least  remarkable  point  in  his  strange  character,  and 
although  ardently  attached  to  money,  he  could  be  generous 
at  the  call  of  what  he  considered  duty,  and  even  lavish 
when  charity  was  concerned — indeed,  he  frequently  gave 
concerts  for  the  benefit  of  the  poor,  remembering  the  time 
when  he  had  been  a  poor  man  himself. 

Paris,  always  eager  for  novelty,  the  self-elected  critic  of 

the  civilised  world  in  all  matters  appertaining  to  art,  was 

by  this  time  imperative  in  her  demand  to  see

of  1831,  he  set  out  for  that  fashionable  capital. 
Fame  had  preceded  him  with  every  kind  of  strange  rumour 
— he  could  not  only  play  on  one  string,  it  was  said,  but 
his  fiddle  still  gave  forth  strange  music  when  all  the  strings 
were  removed.  The  old  calumnies  revived.  The  town 
was  placarded  with  villainous  wood-cuts  of  him  in  prison — 


380  PAGANINI. 

others  represented  him  in  caricature,  playing  on  one  string. 
In  short,  expectation  was  wound  up  to  its  highest  pitch, 
when  he  suddenly  arrived,  in  bad  health,  and  immediately 
gave  a  performance  at  the  Opera-House,  on  March  9th, 
1831.  The  calm  and  judicious  veteran  of  the  Royal  Con- 
servatory of  Music  in  Belgium,  M.  FETIS,  who  knew  him 
well,  and  heard  him  often,  and  to  whose  work  I  am  so 
much  indebted  for  the  present  sketch,  can  find  no  other 
words  to  express  the  sensation  which  he  created  on  his  first 
appearance  at  Paris  than  "  universal  frenzy."  The  whole 
city  flocked  to  hear  him,  the  professors  and  virtuosi  crowded 
round  him  on  the  platform,  as  near  as  they  dared  approach, 
in  order  to  watch  him  play,  after  which  they  were  no  wiser 
than  before.  At  the  end  of  each  piece  the  whole  audience, 
it  is  said,  rose  en  masse  to  recall  him ;  the  tongue  of  envy 
forgot  to  wag,  and  rivalry  was  put  out  of  court.  It  \vas 
hoped  he  might  have  thrown  some  light  upon  certain 
prodigious  violin  studies  which  he  had  published,  and 
which  had  long  been  known  at  Paris.  No  one  could  play 
them,  or  even  conjecture  how  some  of  them  were  to  be 
played ;  nor  did  PAGANINI  reveal  the  secret,  which  lay,  no 
doubt,  partly  in  a  peculiar  way  of  tuning  the  instrument, 
as  well  as  in  a  length  and  agility  of  finger  which  he  alone 
possessed. 

About  the  middle  of  May  he  left  Paris  for  London,  and 
the   Times  newspaper,   which,   at   that   time,   hardly   ever

to   give   some   idea  of  his  first  performance  at 

PAGANINI    the  King's  Theatre.     PAGANINI,  to  save  himself

trouble,  had  agreed,  for  an  enormous  sum 
of  money,  to  let  himself  to  a  speculator  during  his  stay 
in  England,  who  made  all  arrangements  for  him  and 
took  the  proceeds.  This  plan  has  since  been  adopted  by 
several  illustrious  artists,  M.  JOACHIM  amongst  them ; 
and,  although  it  has  been  stigmatized  as  wanting  in 
dignity,  it  is  probably,  on  the  whole,  the  most  satis- 
factory to  the  artist,  though  not  always  to  the  public. 
An  attempt  was  made  to  double  the  prices  at  the  Opera- 
Ilouse,  which  raised  great  indignation :  the  prices  ultimately 
charged  were  the  usual  Opera  charges — no  more  and  no 
less — and  this  was  doubtless  thought  exorbitant  for  a  con- 
cert, although  the  solo  performer  was  supported  by  an 
orchestra  and  some  of  the  best  Opera  singers,  the  famous 
LABLACHE  amongst  them.  The  crowd  at  the  doors  on  the 
first  night  was  excessive,  and  the  pit  was  full  to  overflowing, 
but  the  boxes  were  thin.  PAGANINI  was  suffering  at  that 
time  from  the  inroads  of  his  old  complaint,  aggravated  by 
the  rapid  encroachments  of  his  last  fatal  malady,  consump- 
tion. He  appeared  contrary  to  the  advice  of  his  physicians, 
and  was  received  with  the  usual  tumult  of  applause.  From 
a  heap  of  contemporary  criticism  struggling  vainly  with  the 
difficulty  of  the  subject,  we  extract  a  few  passages  from  the 
pen  of  an  eye-witness,  which  strike  us  as  unusually  graphic. 


382  PAG  AN  IN  I. 

MR.   GARDNER,  of  Leicester,  writes :    "  At  the  hazard  of 

my  ribs,  I  placed  myself  at  the  Opera  two  hours  and  a  half 

before  the  concert  began The  concert

TUB  CRITICS  opened    with    BEETHOVE.V'S    second     symphony, 

admirably  played  by  the  Philharmonic  band, 
after  which  LABLACHE  sang  '  Largo  al  Factotum/  with 
much  applause,  and  was  encored.  A  breathless  silence, 
and  every  eye  was  watching  the  action  of  this  extra- 
ordinary violinist ;  and  as  he  glided  from  the  side  scenes 
to  the  front  of  the  stage,  an  involuntary  cheering  burst 
from  every  part  of  the  house,  many  rising  from  their 
scats  to  view  the  Spectre  during  the  thunder  of  this  un- 
precedented cheering — his  gaunt  and  extraordinary  appear- 
ance being  more  like  that  of  a  devotee  about  to  suffer 
martyrdom  than  one  to  delight  you  with  his  art.  With  the 
tip  of  his  bow  he  sent  off  the  orchestra  in  a  grand  military 
movement  with  a  force  and  vivacity  as  surprising  as  it  was 
new.  At  the  termination  of  this  introduction  he  com- 
menced with  a  soft  streaming  note  of  celestial  quality,  and 
with  three  or  four  whips  of  his  bow  elicited  points  of  sound 
that  mounted  to  the  third  heaven  and  as  bright  as  the  stars. 
....  He  has  long  legs  and  arms,  and  his  hands  in  his 
playing  often  assume  the  attitude  of  prayer,  with  the  fingers 
pointed  upwards.  It  was  curious  to  watch  the  faces  of 
LINDLEY,  DKAGONETTI,  and  the  other  great  players,  who  took 
up  places  on  the  platform  to  command  a  good  view  of  him 
during  his  performance — they  all  seem  to  have  agreed  that

the  like  had  never  been  heard  before,  and  that  in  addition  to 
his  marvellous  eccentricities  and  novel  effects,  he  had  tran- 
scended the  highest  level  of  legitimate  art  that  had  ever 
been  reached." 

It  has  often   been   asked   in   what  respects    PAGANINI'S 
playing  differed  from  that  of  other  great  violinists 

A«Jo* 

—  in  what   has   he    enriched  the   art  —  what  has

he  discovered  or  invented  ?  These  questions 
have  been  to  some  extent  answered  by  the  painstaking 
Professor  of  Music,  GUHR,  who  had  many  opportunities  of 
watching  him  closely. 

He  was  peculiar,  first,  in  his  manner  of  tuning.  Some- 
times the  first  three  strings  were  tuned  half  a  note  higher, 
the  G  string  being  a  third  lower.  Sometimes  he  tuned  his 
G  to  B  ;  with  a  single  turn  of  his  peg  he  would  change  the 
pitch  of  his  G  string,  and  never  fail  in  his  intonation.  These 
artifices  explain,  no  doubt,  many  of  his  extraordinary 
intervals. 

Secondly,  in  his  management  of  the  bow  he  has  had  many 
imitators,  though  none  have  approached  him  in  the  romantic 
variety  and  "  fiend-like  power  with  which  he  ruled  over  the 
strings/'  His  ordinary  staccato,  played  with  a  very  tight  bow, 
was  prodigiously  loud  and  firm,  like  the  strokes  of  a  hammer, 
whilst  his  method  of  dashing  the  bow  on  the  strings,  and 
letting  it  leap  through  an  infinity  of  tiny  staccato  notes 
with  unerring  precision  was  wholly  his  own  invention.

Thirdly,  his  tremolo  use  of  the  left  hand  exceeded  any- 
thing which  had  been  attempted  up  to  that  time.  This 
effect  has  been,  like  every  other  one  of  his  inimitable 
effects,  driven  to  death  by  subsequent  violinists. 

Fourth,  his  use  of  harmonics  now  universally  known  to 
violinists,  was  then  absolutely  new — formerly  only  the  open 
harmonics  had  been  used,  and  that  very  charily ;  but  PAGA- 
NINI  astonished  the  world  by  stopping  the  string  with  the 
first  finger,  and  extracting  the  harmonic  simultaneously 
with  the  fourth.  By  sliding  up  the  first  finger  together 
with  the  fourth,  he  played  entire  melodies  in  harmonics, 
and  got,  on  an  average,  about  three  octaves  out  of  each 
string;  his  use  of  double  harmonics  in  rapid  passages, 
and  such  trifles  as  four  simultaneous  A  flats,  are  stiil 
problems  which  few,  if  any  hands  but  his,  have  been  able 
to  solve. 

Lastly,  his  habit  of  plucking  the  strings,  sometimes  with 
the  right,  sometimes  with  the  left  hand,  and  producing 
those  rapid  pizzicato  runs,  on  an  accompaniment  of  a  harp 
or  guitar,  was  absolutely  new ;  beyond  these  things  it  was 
found  impossible  much  farther  to  analyse  his  playing.  His 
secret,  if  he  had  any,  died  with  him ;  his  music  does  not 
reveal  it.  Although  he  wrote  quartettes,  solos,  duetts,  and 
sonatas,  fragments  of  about  twenty-four  of  which  are  in 
existence,  only  nine  were  found  complete;  of  these  the 
Rondo  known  as  "  Clochette,1'  and  often  played  by  M. 
SIVORI,  and  "  Le  Streghc,"  are  perhaps  the  best  known.

The  celebrated  variations  on  the  "  Carnival  de  Venise w  do 
not  appear  to  have  been  published  as  he  played  them, 
though  both  ERNST  and  SIVORI  claim  to  play  the  Paganini 
Carnival.  M.  EETIS  considers  his  finest  compositions  have 
not  been  preserved — amongst  those  he  reckons  a  magnifi- 
cent concerto  played  at  Paris  in  1813,  and  a  grand  military 
sonata  for  the  fourth  string  only. 

The  rest  of  PAGANINI'S  story   is   soon  told.     Broken  in 

health,  after  an  absence  of  six  years,  he  returned  to  Italy, 

where   he   was   now  nearly   worshipped   by    his 

'    '        countrymen.      He   had   grown   immensely   rich,

and  bought  various  properties  in  Tuscany.  He 
played  at  concerts  from  time  to  time,  and  was  always  most 
generous  in  giving  his  talents  for  the  benefit  of  the  poor. 

MR.  DUBOURG,  in  his  valuable  work  on  the  violin,  asserts 
that  he  went  to  America ;  but  of  this  I  can  find  no  trace 
in  the  biography  of  M.  FETIS,  nor  in  any  other  docu- 
ments which  I  have  as  yet  come  across.  In  1835  PAGANINI 
lived  much  between  Milan  and  Genoa.  The  DUCHESS  OF 
PARMA  had  conferred  the  order  of  St.  George  on  him  in 
1834. 

In  1836  he  got  into  bad  hands.  He  lent  his  great 
name  to  the  establishment  of  a  Casino  in  Paris,  which 
failed.  He  was  obliged  to  go  to  Paris,  and  the  journey, 
no  doubt,  hastened  his  end.  His  consumption  grew  worse, 
he  could  not  bear  the  cold;  he  was  annoyed  by  the  un- 


386  PAG  AN  INI. 

scrupulous  speculators,  who  tried  to  involve  him  in  their 
own  ruin,  and  then  refused  to  bear  the  burden  with  him. 
They  even  succeeded  in  mulcting  him  in  the  sum  of 
50,000  francs,  and  he  was  actually  detained  by  legal  pro- 
ceedings until  he  had  paid  the  whole  sum. 

But  his  days  of  speculation  and  glory  were  alike  num- 
bered.    In  1839  he  was  a  dying  man.     He  struggled  with 
indomitable  energy  against  his  deadly  foe.     He  now  often 
took    up   the    guitar,  which,  in  the  spring-time 

Z«PDL 

THE  NIGHT  of  his  life,  had  been  so  intimately  associated 
with  his  first  romantic  attachment.  He  was  a 
great  admirer  of  BEETHOVEN,  and  not  long  before  his 
death  he  played  one  of  that  master's  quartettes,  his 
favourite  one,  with  astonishing  energy.  In  extreme  weak- 
ness, he  laboured  out  to  hear  a  requiem  of  CHERUBINI 
for  male  voices,  and  soon  afterwards,  with  all  his  last 
energies,  he  insisted  upon  being  conveyed  to  one  of  the 
churches  in  Marseilles,  where  he  took  part  in  a  solemn  mass 
of  BEETHOVEN.  His  voice  was  now  nearly  extinct,  and  his 
sleep,  that  greatest  of  consolations,  was  broken  up  by 
dreadful  fits  of  coughing,  his  features  began  to  sink,  and 
he  appeared  to  be  little  more  than  a  living  skeleton,  so 
excessive  and  fearful  was  his  emaciation.  Still  he  did  not 
believe  in  the  approach  of  death.  Day  by  day  he  grew 
more  restless,  and  talked  of  passing  the  winter  at  Nice,  and 
he  did  live  on  till  the  spring. 


TEE  END.  387 

On    the    night   of    May   27,   1840,   after  a  protracted 

paroxysm,    he    suddenly   became    strangely   tranquil.     He 

sank  into  a  quiet  sleep,  and  woke  refreshed  and 

calm.     The  air  was  soft  and  warm.     He  desired

them  to  open  the  windows  wide,  draw  the 
curtains  of  his  bed,  and  allow  the  moon,  just  rising  in 
the  unclouded  glory  of  an  Italian  sky,  to  flood  his  apart- 
ment. He  sat  gazing  intently  upon  it  for  some  minutes, 
and  then  again  sank  drowsily  into  a  fitful  sleep.  Rousing 
himself  once  more,  his  fine  ear  caught  the  sound  of  the 
rustling  leaves  as  they  were  gently  stirred  by  some  breath 
of  air  outside.  In  his  dying  moments  this  sound  of 
the  night  wind  in  the  trees  seemed  to  affect  him 
strangely,  and  the  summer  nights  on  the  banks  of  the 
Arno  long  ago  may  have  flashed  back  upon  his  mind,  and 
called  up  fading  memories.  But  now  the  Arno  was 
exchanged  for  the  wide  Mediterranean  Sea,  all  ablaze  with 
light.  MOZART  in  his  last  moments  pointed  to  the  score  of 
the  Requiem,  which  lay  before  him  on  his  bed,  and  his  lips 
were  moving,  to  indicate  the  effect  of  kettledrums  in  a 
particular  place,  as  he  sank  back  in  a  swoon ;  and  it  is 
recorded  of  PAGANINI  that  on  that  fair  moonlight  night  in 
May,  as  the  last  dimness  came  over  his  eyes,  he  stretched 
out  his  hand  to  grasp  his  faithful  friend  and  companion,  his 
Guarnerius  violin,  and  as  he  struck  its  chords  once  more, 
and  found  that  it  ceased  to  speak  with  its  old  magic  power, 
he  himself  sank  back  and  expired,  like  one  broken-hearted

He  left  £80,000  to  his  son,  BARON  ACHILLE  PAGANINI, 
and  about  £4<5  a  year  to  ANTONIA  BIANCHI,  with  whom  he 
had  long  since  quarrelled.  He  had  previously  provided  for 
his  mother.  His  violin  he  left  to  his  native  city,  Genoa, 
with  directions  that  no  other  artist  should  ever  play 
upon  it.

T  is  not  possible  to  write  upon  this  subject — the 
title  is  out  of  date.  The  Wagnerian  music  of  the 
future  has  become  the  music  of  the  present. 
Such  fragments  of  it  as  are  intended  to  stand  alone  or 
can  be  dissevered  from  their  dramatic  surroundings,  are 
the  acknowledged  plums  in  all  our  concert  programmes. 
Every  provincial  band  aspires  to  produce  them.  The 
operas  which  draw  best  at  both  of  the  great  London  houses 
are  WAGNER'S  operas;  and  the  London  season  of  1881,

\vith  the  Wagnerian  cycle  of  dramas  at  one  house  and 
Niebelunyen  Ring  at  the  other,  succeeded  in  keeping  almost 
every  other  opera  off  the  boards.  The  noisy  opponents 
of  a  few  years  ago  remind  me,  with  their  almost  inaudible 
groans  and  faint  praise  of  the  victor,  of  the  groans  of 
Fafner  the  dragon  or  "  Wurm,"  and  the  unwilling  tribute 
which  he  is  forced  to  pay  just  before  he  expires  to  the 
prowess  and  might  of  Siegfried. 

The  evolution  of  art  may  be  arrested,  but,  like  that  of 
nature,  it  cannot  be  stopped.  The  process  is  as  inexorable 
as  the  fall  of  the  leaf  or  the  triumphant  burst  of  spring. 
Some  of  us  die  in  the  autumn  and  others  perish  in  the 
keener  air  of  spring;  but  art  leads  forth  her  ringing  choirs 
into  the  golden  summer  land,  and  the  strong  and  young 
leap  up  at  her  call.  Beautiful  is  the  breaking  out  of  fresh 
thought,  fair  is  the  coming  of  the  new  age.  There  is  a 
wind  in  the  trees,  the  murmur  of  waters ;  a  fragrance 
streams  from  the  East,  and  I  seem  to  hear  the  morning 
stars  singing  together  and  all  the  sons  of  God  shouting 
for  joy. 


WAGNER  AND  BEETHOVEN.  393 


II. 

WAGNER. 

WAGNER  is  tlie  most  powerful  personality  that  has  appeared 

in  the  world  of  music  since    BEETHOVEN.     But  indeed  he 

seems  to  me,  in  his  wide  range  as  poet,  dramatist, 

AvCL 

WAGNER  AND  musician,  and  philosopher,   almost  alone  in  the 

BEETHOVEN.    ,   .  ,.    . 

history  or  Art. 

BEETHOVEN  was  a  musician  only.  His  glory  is  to  have 
carried  the  art  of  music  to  its  extreme  limits  of  develop- 
ment :  no  one  has  yet  gone  beyond  him. 

WAGNER  said,  "  I  have  invented  nothing."  You  cannot 
invent  metre  after  the  Greeks,  or  the  modern  drama  after 
SHAKSPERE,  or  colouring  and  perspective  after  the  Italians 
— there  is  a  point  at  which  an  art  ceases  to  grow  and  stands 
full-blown  like  a  flower. 

Most  people  admit  that  in  music,  as  in  other  arts,  that 
point  has  been  reached.  What  then  remained  ?  This, 
according  to  RICHARD  WAGNER  :  to  concentrate  into  one 
aazziing  focus  ail  the  arts,  and,  having  sounded  and  developed 
the  expressional  depth,  and  determined  the  peculiar  function 
of  each,  to  combine  them  at  length  into  one  perfect  and 
indivisible  whole. 


394  WAGNER. 

Words  seem  childishly  inadequate  to  render  all  at  once 
such  a  conception  as  this.  Slowly  we  may  master  some  of 

its  details  and  allow  them  to  orb  into   a  perfect 
299. 

UNITY  OP  whole.  If  you  stand  at  the  foot  of  one  of  the 
Alps,  you  can  seo  but  a  little  portion  of  it — 
a  hamlet,  a  sloping  patch  of  vineyard,  and  a  pine  copse 
beyond ;  but  as  you  ascend  the  winding  path  the  prospect 
opens  to  right  and  left ;  cascades  leap  by  to  lose,  themselves 
in  the  torrent  below — you  plunge  into  the  gloom  of  a 
forest  and  emerge  on  to  the  higher  meadows  and  pleasant 
scenes  of  pastoral  life — yonder  the  soil  grows  rocky,  and 
tumbled  boulders  lie  around  you — the  cloud  lifts,  and  a 
vista  of  mountains  and  valleys  is  suddenly  opened  up,  and 
pressing  forward  you  leave  far  below  the  murmurs  of  one 
world,  and  raise  your  enraptured  eyes  to  the  black  eagle, 
as  he  wheels  aloft  in  the  golden  air  beyond  the  stainless 
and  eternal  snows. 

So  when  we  are  brought  face  to  face  with  such  a  varied, 
complex,  and  immense  intelligence  as  that  of  RICHARD 
"WAGNER  we  are  apt  to  dwell  on  a  part — a  peculiarity  of  the 
music — a  turn  of  the  drama — a  melody,  a  situation,  an 
eccentricity.  But  the  secret  lies,  after  all,  in  the  unity  of 
effect.  Close  your  eyes  after  a  day  in  the  Alps,  and,  as  the 
visions  pass  before  you,  all  will  grow  clear  to  your  inner 
consciousness,  and  the  varied  scenes  you  have  realized  only 
in  succession  will  at  last  arrange  themselves  into  one  great 
and  majestic  whole. 


WAGNER   THE  BOY.  395 

"Perhaps  he  has  some  talent  for  music/*  said  the  sick 
man  as  he  heard  little  RICHARD,  then  only  seven  years  old, 

strumming  a  tune  from  Der  Freyschutz  on  the 
800. 

WAGNER  piano.  It  was  Louis  GEYER,  his  step-father; 
painter,  author,  and  actor,  then  on  his  death-bed, 
thinking  of  the  future,  planning  as  dying  men  plan,  and 
hitting  the  mark  as  they  often  hit  it,  quite  at  random. 
The  child's  vivid  temperament  and  eager,  sensitive  mind 
had  always  made  him  a  favourite  with  the  actor  and  the 
poet,  and  he  thought  of  making  a  painter  of  RICHARD,  but 
the  boy  seemed  to  have  no  turn  for  it.  His  mother,  a 
woman  full  of  life  and  imagination,  was  less  anxious  and 
more  wise.  She  let  him  grow,  and  happily  he  was  left  to 
her,  "  with  no  education/'  as  he  says,  "  but  life,  art,  and 
myself.'' 

Indeed  any  attempt  to  hasten  WAGNER'S  development,  or 
to  fix  his  career,  would  doubtless  have  failed.  From  the 
first,  the  consciousness  of  his  own  force  has  been  one  of  his 
strangest  and  strongest  peculiarities.  At  times  it  seems  to 
have  almost  intoxicated  him — at  others  it  sustained  and 
cheered  him  in  utter  loneliness ;  it  has  dominated  all  who 
have  come  in  personal  contact  with  him,  and  bent  the  minds 
and  wills  of  the  rebellious  like  reeds  before  the  wind. 

And  the  reason  is  evident.  WAGNER  was  always  prodigious 
in  his  ability.  Like  those  very  fast  trotters  that  flash  along 
the  highways  of  England  and  America,  he  has  been  in  the 
habit  of  passing  everyone  on  the  road,  and  passing  them

easily.  But  the  consciousness  of  power  bred  in  him  a 
singular  wilfulness.  At  school  he  could  learn  anything, 
but  he  would  learn  only  as  he  chose  and  what  he  chose. 
When  his  time  came  he  mastered,  with  incredible  rapidity 
and  accuracy,  Greek,  Latin,  mythology,  and  ancient  history. 
As  for  his  music-master,  he  soon  sent  him  to  the  right- 
about, telling  him  he  would  learn  music  his  ovm  way. 
Indeed  the  variety  of  influences,  and  the  rapidity  with  which 
he  absorbed  them,  one  after  the  other,  quite  unfitted  him 
for  going  into  harness  early  in  any  one  direction. 

At  the  age  of  seventeen  he  had  dipped  into  most  litera- 
tures,  ancient   and    modern  —  glanced    at   science,   learnt 
English  in  order   to    read   SHAKSPERE,   weighed 
several  schools  of  philosophy,  studied   and  dis-

missed  the  contending  theologies,  absorbed 
SCHILLER  and  worshipped  GOETHE  (then  eighty-four  years 
old),  turned  away  from  the  conventional  stage  of  KOTZEBUE 
and  IFFLAND,  tasted  politics,  .and  been  deeply  stirred  by  the 
music  of  BEETHOVEN. 

There  was  doubtless  a  great  indistinctness  about  his  aims 
at  this  time.  To  live,  to  grow,  to  feel,  to  be  filled  with  new 
emotions,  and  to  sound  his  enormous  capacities  for  receiv- 
ing impressions  and  acquiring  facts — this  had  hitherto  been 
enough ;  but  the  vexed  question  was  inevitable :  to  what 
end? 

The  artistic  temperament  could  give  but  one  answer  to 


EXPRESSION.  397 

that— "EXPRESSION  I"  Creation  itself — man — the  world, 
the  universe  is  nothing  but  that.  There  is  ever  this  im- 
perious divine  necessity  for  outward  expression.  This  is 
the  lesson  of  the  ages  and  of  the  universe — of  which  we 
see  but  a  little  speck  realized  upon  our  tiny  and  overcrowded 
planet.  But  this  burning  thought  turns  the  mind  of  man 
itself  into  a  divine  microcosm — he,  too,  begins  to  obey  in  his 
higher  activities  what  he  perceives  to  be  the  supreme  law  of 
the  divine  life.  He,  too,  must  flash  into  self-consciousness, 
and  breathe  in  form,  until  all  that  slept  in  the  silence  of 
his  heart  comes  forth  swift  and  radiant  with  the  wind  and 
fire  of  emotion,  and  stands  at  last  like  an  angel,  full  of 
wreathed  melodies  and  crowned  with  stars. 

Such  to  the  artist  soul  is  the  beloved  parable  of  earth. 
The  life  within  must  become  outward;  all  that  we  are  is 
dying  to  be  born  :  is  craving  to  realize  itself,  to  know,  to 
possess,  to  adore ! 

It  is  quite  obvious  .that  life  is  here  seized,  not  from  the 
intellectual,  but  from  the  emotional  side.  The  intellect  is 
used  to  fathom,  to  formulate,  to  economize,  and  represent,  in 
their  most  impressive  forms,  the  feelings  which  would 
otherwise  be  wasted  and  mis-spent ;  but  the  intellect,  which 
has  played  so  important  a  part  in  WAGNER'S  system,  is 
always  the  second,  never  the  first  factor,  and  its  function 
has  been  to  analyze  the  various  expressional  media  of  the 
past  and  present,  and  to  create  some  form  or  combination, 
more  exhaustive  and  powerful  than  all  the  rest.

WAGNER  was  willing  to  be  led;  but  be  could  not  heh> 

feeling  that  an  artist  now  is  the  heir  of  all  the  ages,  that 

now  for  the  first  time  he  can  stand  and  gauge 

THE  ARTS  the  creations  of  the  past  in  poetry,  painting, 
drama,  and  music,  and  ask  himself,  how  far, 
through  these,  has  the  inner  world  of  the  mind  found 
utterance.  WAGNER  had  the  unconscious  but  inflexible 
hardihood  to  take  up  each  art  in  turn,  weigh  it,  and 
find  it  wanting.  Each  fell  short  of  the  whole  reality  in 
some  respect.  Painting  leaves  out  motion  and  solidarity, 
sculpture  possesses  solidarity  without  motion,  and  usually 
without  colour.  Poetry  without  drama  appeals  to  the 
senses  chiefly  through  the  imagination;  in  itself  it  has 
neither  sound,  colour,  nor  solidarity.  The  spoken  drama 
lacks  the  intensity  which  it  is  the  unique  function  of  musi- 
cal sound  to  give ;  whilst  mere  pantomime,  whether  of  dance 
or  drama,  lacks  the  indefinite  power  of  sound  as  well  as  the 
definite  suggestion  of  words;  and,  lastly,  musical  sound 
alone  provokes  the  eternal  <f  why  ? "  which  can  only  be 
answered  by  associating  the  emotion  raised  with  thought, 
for  music  alone  is  without  solidarity,  colour,  or  thought, 
whilst  possessing  motion  and  sound  in  the  highest  perfec- 
tion. 

It  will  be  said,  "Yes,  but  each  art  is  complete  in  itself." 
True,  but  not  complete  as  a  means  of  expressing  thought 
and  feeling.  You  urge,  "  But  the  power  of  art  lies  often  in 
its  suggestiveness.  I  read  a  poem  and  shut  my  eyes,  and 


INDIVIDUALISM  OF  SHAKSPERE.  399 

the  vision  is  more  splendid  than  anything  that  could  be 
presented  outwardly."  Yes,  indirectly,  because  you  have 
imagination;  the  vision  was  beautiful,  but  its  quality 
depended  on  you,  not  on  the  art.  Art  is  for  expres- 
sion, and  that  art  is  best  which  expresses  most.  Do  not 
confuse  the  effects  of  imagination  and  association  with 
the  effects  of  art.  A  barrel-organ  or  a  daub  may  serve 
to  set  a-going  imagination  and  memory,  but  art  has  to 
do  with  expression,  and  is  defective  qua  art  just  where 
it  begins  to  make  these  demands  upon  imagination  and 
memory. 

Those  who  have  traced  WAGNER'S  career  from  boyhood 

know  how  patiently  he  has  questioned  every  art,  how  pas- 

303.        sionately  he  has  surrendered  himself  to  it,  for  a 

INDIVIDUAL-  tjme  .  how  willinsr  he  would  have  been  to  rest, 

ISM    OF 

SUAKSPEKE  how  inexorably  experience  and  feeling  have  urged 
him  on  until,  like  the  hardy  navigators  of  old,  he  broke  at 
last  into  a  new  and  undiscovered  ocean.  At  the  age  of 
eleven  he  had  read  SHAKSPERE.  Surely  dramatic  expres- 
sion of  thought  and  feeling  could  go  no  farther.  But  he 
would  test  it  as  a  form  of  art  by  experiment,  and  see  how 
it  worked.  He  immediately  constructed  a  drama,  horrible 
and  thorough — a  cross  between  Hamlet  and  King  Lear. 
Forty-two  characters  suffered  death  in  the  first  four  acts, 
so  that  in  the  fifth,  in  order  to  people  his  stage  at  all, 
most  of  them  had  to  reappear  as  ghosts.  The  Shakspercan 


400  WAGNER. 

method   was  closely  adhered  to,  and  for  several  years  he 
continued  to  brood  over  it  lovingly. 

Here  was  a  form  intensely  individual,  self-conscious — in 
which  man  explored  the  depths  of  his  own  nature.  On  that 
rough  wooden  stage  of  the  Globe  Theatre  so  vivid  were 
the  characters,  so  rapid  and  complex  the  feelings,  so  perfect 
and  expressive  the  pantomime,  that  the  want  of  stage- 
trappings  and  accessories  was  hardly  felt.  Still,  it  was  a 
restrained  expression;  it  was  too  mosaic;  the  individuals 
lacked  an  universal  element  in  which  to  live  and  move  and 
have  their  being :  we  sit  fascinated  and  bewildered  with  the 
subtle  analysis  and  changing  episodes ;  but  the  characters 
do  not  run  up  into  universal  types,  they  are  too  entirely 
absorbed  by  their  own  thoughts  and  feelings.  The  contest 
here  is  not  with  Fate  and  Time,  as  on  the  Greek  stage,  but 
with  Self  and  Society. 

Excited  but  oppressed  by  the  complex  inner  life  of  the 

Shaksperean  drama,  WAGNER  still  felt  the  need  of  wedding 

the  personal  life  to  some  larger  ideal  types,  and

THE  GEEEK  intensifying  the  emotional  element  by  the  intro- 
duction of  musical  sound.  Then  the  cramped 
wooden  stage  of  the  Globe  Theatre  vanished,  and  in  its 
place  rose  the  marble  amphitheatre,  open  to  the  sky, 
embedded  in  the  southern  slope  of  the  Athenian  Acropolis. 
In  the  classical  drama  nothing  was  individual — the  whole 
life  of  Greece  was  there,  but  all  was  summed  up  in  large

and  simple  types.  The  actors  speak  through  fixed  masks. 
All  fine  inflexion  is  lost — all  change  of  facial  expression 
sacrificed  to  massive  groupings  and  stately  poses,  regulated 
by  the  shrill  pipe  and  the  meagre  harp.  But  still  there  is  in 
the  dramas  of  .^ESCHYLUS,  EURIPIDES,  and  SOPHOCLES  a  breadth 
of  expression  which  enables  the  soul  to  shake  itself  free  from 
its  accidental  surroundings  and  enter  into  general  sympathy 
with  the  wider  life  of  humanity.  It  is  this  escape  into  the 
ideal  which  the  modern  self-conscious  spirit  most  needs : 
this  merging  of  discordant  self  in  the  universal  harmony 
which  drew  WAGNER  towards  the  theatre  of  the  Greeks. 
There  we  start  from  the  gods,  the  ideal  representatives  of 
human  thought  and  emotion.  Zeus  is  in  Agamemnon,  Ares 
in  Achilles,  Artemis  in  Iphigenia,  Aphrodite  in  Phaedra ; 
and  there  is  something  prophetic  and  sublime  in  the  sponta- 
neous growth  of  these  types  beneath  the  human  touch,  until 
they  transcend  the  gods  and  conquer  Olympus  itself.  Cas- 
sandra is  greater  than  the  gods  in  her  consciousness  of 
injustice — Prometheus  is  sublime  in  his  god-like  defiance 
of  fate — Antigone  triumphs  through  voluntary  sacrifice — 
it  is  the  inexorable  progress  of  the  human  conscience  towards 
a  higher  Olympus,  a  purer  deity — men  come  from  gods,  but 
excel  the  gods ;  then  follows  the  inevitable  decline,  "  the 
dusk  of  the  gods,"  and,  lastly,  the  assertion  of  man's  divinity 
and  the  rehabilitation  through  man  of  the  divine  idea. 

This  thought  Christianity  should  eternally  present;  but

in  order  to  restore  the  balance  and  reassert  the  place  and 
dignity  of  the  down-trodden  senses.  That  protest,  in  the 
teeth  of  our  modern  religious  narrowness,  will  continue 
to  be  popular  until  the  reconciliation  between  the  old  and 
the  new  world-spirit  is  reached  in  a  higher,  freer  life, 
recognizing  and  making  room  for  the  development  in  due 
balance  of  every  part  of  human  nature.  The  Greek  view 
of  life  may  not  be  adequate,  but  it  had  elements  which 
M-e  want;  and  to  study  art  we  must  still  go  to  Athens. 
"Within  his  limits  the  Greek  remains  our  supreme  standard. 

For  what  the  Greek  was,  and  for  what  he  saw,  his  theatre 
found  an  almost  perfect  art-form.  The  dance  or  science  of 
pantomimic  motion  was  part  of  his  daily  education.  His  body 
was  trained  in  the  Palaestra,  or  gymnasium,  and  his  life  was 
one  of  constant  drill  to  enable  him  to  take  part  in  the  games 
and  national  festivals.  The  elastic  tongue  of  HOMER  had 
been  enriched  and  fired  by  a  hundred  poets  before  the  full 
development  of  the  Greek  drama,  and  hymns  and  songs,  set 
to  rhythmic  and  choral  melodies  of  every  character  and 
variety,  supplied  him  with  ready  emotional  utterance  upon 
all  occasions.  Add  to  this  the  profound  enthusiasm  which 
still  accompanied  the  ancient  rites,  the  Delphic  oracles  and

which  were  woven  into  one  harmonious  whole  by  ^SCHYLUS 
— poet,  warrior,  stage  manager,  and  religious  devotee. 

The  soul  of  the  Greek  drama,  freed  from  accidental  asso- 
ciations, must  now  be  melted  down  in  the  new  crucible. 

WAGNER  found  there  an  intense  earnestness  of 
306. 

GREEK  purpose — the  devout  portrayal  of  a  few  funda- 
mental types — the  large  clear  outline  like  the 
frieze  of  the  Parthenon — a  simple  plot  and  well-developed 
phases  of  feeling  as  pronounced  and  trenchant  as  the 
rhythmic  motions  of  the  dramatis  persona ;  and  lastly  he 
found — what  he  found  not  in  SIIAKSPERE — the  Greek 
chorus.  This  gave  its  binding  intensity  to  the  whole 
drama — this  provided  the  universal  element  in  which  the 
actors  lived  and  moved  and  had  their  being.  The  chorus 
ever  in  motion — a  band  of  youths  or  maidens,  priests  or 
supernatural  beings,  fluid  and  expressive,  like  the  emotions 
of  the  vast  and  earnest  assembly ; — the  chorus  bore  aloft 
a  wail  over  the  agonies  of  Philoctetes — a  plaint  for  Iphigenia 
— a  questioning  of  the  gods  for  Cassandra;  it  enveloped  the 
stage  with  floods  of  passionate  declamation  ;  it  rushed,  it 
pointed,  it  swayed,  it  sighed  and  whispered  in  broken  pathe- 
tic accents ;  it  was  like  the  sobbing  of  the  sea  on  a  rocky 
strand— the  sound  of  the  waves  in  Ionian  caves — the  wild 
sweep  of  the  tempest  answering  back  man's  passionate  plaint, 
and  fitting  the  simple  feelings  of  the  great  types  on  the 
stage  with  an  almost  elemental  intensity  of  expression.  The 

26  * 


4.04  WAGNER. 

mysterious  variety  of  Greek  metres,  the  varied  spasmodic 
rhythms,  can  only  be  understood  when  the  vision  of  the 
Greek  chorus  rises  before  us  in  its  eager  bursts  of  appropriate 
but  fitful  activity.  That  changing  chant,  that  harsh  ringing 
progression  of  notes  on  the  Greek  scales  of  which  Grego- 
riaus  are  still  the  Christian  relics — we  should  not  call  it 
music,  it  was  not  melody,  much  less  harmony,  but  it  was 
sound  inflexions  marvellously  used  to  drill  declamation, 
posture,  and  pantomime.  The  soul  of  it  has  transmigrated 
in  these  latter  days — it  has  become  the  Wagnerian 
orchestra. 

Turn    back    now,   for    a    moment,    to   the    Shaksperean 

drama.     Chorus,  musical  sound,  band,  song,  all  the  voices 

of  universal  nature  environing  man — appalling, 

THE  INDI-    consoling,  inspiring  him — have  vanished.     A  new 

VIDUAL   IN      . 

THE  inner-world,  unknown  to  the  Greeks,  has  taken 
their  place,  and  man  is  absorbed  with  himself. 
Yet  without  that  universal  voice  which  he  can  make  his 
own,  how  he  shrinks,  dwarfed  by  his  narrow  individuality ; 
no  longer  a  part  of  the  great  whole  and  soul  of  things; 
nature  no  longer  his  mother,  the  winds  no  more  his 
friends,  the  sea  no  more  his  comforter !  The  ideal  atmo- 
sphere of  the  Greek  chorus  is  missed ;  the  power  of 
music,  however  rudimentary,  is  absent;  SHAKSPERE  seems 
to  have  felt  it;  it  passes  over  his  sublime  creations 
as  an  invocation  to  Music  in  Twelfth  Night,  or  in  Ophelia's 


UNION  OF  THE  ARTS.  405 

plaintive  song.  And  this  is  the  point  of  contact  between 
the  old  drama  of  ^ESCHYLUS  and  the  new  drama  of  SHAK- 
SPERE  ;  the  two  stand  for  ever  for  the  opposite  poles  of 
dramatic  art — the  universal  type,  the  individual  life — and 
both  are  necessary.  The  individual  is  naturally  evolved 
from  the  universal,  but  once  evolved  and  developed  it  must 
be  restored  to  the  universal  and  be  glorified  by  it. 

At   this   crisis,   in  his   quest   after   a  perfect    art-form, 
WAGNER    found    himself    confronted     with    BEETHOVEN'S 

music.      He    did  not  believe  that    drama   could

UNION  OF    be  carried  farther   than  ^ESCHYLUS,  SOPHOCLES, 

and  SHAKSPERE,  or  music  any  farther  than 
BEETHOVEN;  but  he  did  conceive  the  project  of  leading  the 
whole  stream  of  the  Beethovenian  music  into  the  channels 
of  Shaksperean  drama.  The  Greek  chorus  might  have  been 
inadequate  to  the  simple  types  of  Greek  tragedy,  but  modern 
life,  with  its  self-conscious  spirituality,  its  questions,  its 
doubts,  its  hopes,  and  its  immense  aspirations — this  seemed 
to  require  quite  a  new  element  of  expression.  The  voice  of 
this  inner  life  had  been  preparing  for  four  hundred  years ; 
when  it  was  ready  it  turned  out  to  be  no  inflexible  mask, 
through  which  a  human  voice  might  speak,  nor  even  a 
mobile  chorus,  but  a  splendid  and  complex  organ  of  expres- 
sion, fitted  so  closely  about  the  soul  of  man,  as  to  become 
the  very  ^olian  harp  upon  which  the  breath  of  his  life  could 
freely  play. 


406  WAGNER. 

In  the  great  world- laboratory  of  Art,  Waguer  found 
already  all  that  he  required.  There  was,  as  he  remarked, 
nothing  left  for  him  to  invent ;  the  arts  of  poetry,  music, 
painting,  and  pantomime  had  been  explored  separately  and 
perfected;  nay,  one  step  more  had  been  made — the  arts 
had  actually  been  combined  at  different  times  in  different 
ways.  Music  with  pantomime  and  poem  by  the  Greeks ; 
music  with  pantomime,  drama,  painting,  and  every  conceiv- 
able effect  of  stage  scenery  and  costume,  as  in  modern  opera; 
music  and  words,  as  in  oratorio  or  the  cantata.  But  in  Greece 
music  was  wholly  undeveloped  as  an  art;  acting  had  never 
sounded  the  depths  of  individual  life  and  expression.  The 
Shaksperean  drama  left  out  music.  The  cantata  and 
oratorio  omitted  pantomime  and  painting  ;  whilst  modern 
opera  presented  a  meretricious  and  maimed  combination  of 
the  arts  resulting  from  a  radically  defective  form. 

With  a  surprising  vigour  of  intellect,  WAGNER  has  analysed 
the  situation,  and  explained  exactly  why  he  felt  dissatisfied 
with  the  best  operatic  efforts  of  the  past,  and  why  he  seeks 
to  supersede  opera  with  the  "  musical  drama/' 

I   think   his   critical  results  may  be  briefly  summed  up 

thus : — In  the  musical  drama,  poetry,  music,  scenery,  and 

309.        acting  are  to  be  so  blended  as  that  each  shall 

VTAGNEK'S  jiave  jtg   own  appropriate  share,   and   no  more. 

THEORY 

SUMMED  UP.  as   a  medium    of  expression.     The   acting  must 
not  be  cramped  by  the  music,  as  in  common  opera,  where 


ITALIAN  OPERA   ANALYSED.  407 

a  man  has  to  stand  on  one  toe  till  he  has  done  his  roulade, 
or  pauses  in  the  dead  of  night  to  shout  out  a  song  about 
"  Hush  !  we  shall  be  discovered ! "  when  there  is  not  a 
moment  to  spare.  The  music  must  not  be  spoiled  for 
the  acting,  as  in  ballet  and  pantomime,  where  acting  is 
overstrained  to  express  what  the  sister  arts  of  poetry 
and  music  are  better  fitted  to  convey.  And  poetry,  which 
after  all  supplies  the  definite  basis  and  answers  the 
inevitable  "  why  ?  "  must  not  be  sacrificed,  as  in  our  opera 
libretti,  to  the  demands  of  singers  for  aria  and  sccna,  whilst 
the  scenery  must  only  attempt  effects  and  situations  which 
can  be  made  to  look  real.  The  object  of  the  grand  musical 
drama  is,  in  fact,  to  present  a  true  picture  of  human  feeling 
with  the  utmost  fulness  and  intensity,  freed  from  every 
conventional  expression  by  the  happy  union  of  all  the  arts, 
giving  to  each  only  what  it  is  able  to  deal  with — but  thus 
dealing  with  everything,  leaving  nothing  to  the  imagina- 
tion. The  WAGNERIAN  drama  completely  exhausts  the 
situation. 

Filled  with  this  magnificent  conception,  WAGNER  looked 

out   upon    the   world  of  modern  opera — and  what  did  he 

310.       see?     First,  he  noticed  that  the  opera  had  made 

ITALIAN         false  start.      It  sprang,  not  from  the  earnest 

OPERA 

ANALYSED.  fceling  of  the  miracle  plays,  but  from  the 
indolent  desire  of  the  luxurious  Italian  nobles  to  listen 
to  the  delicious  popular  melodies  in  a  refined  form.  The 


408  WAGNER. 

spontaneous  street  action  (which  may  to  this  day  be 
admired  in  Naples  or  Florence)  was  exchanged  for  a  sort 
of  drawing-room  stage  and  poets  were  hired  to  re-set 
the  Italian  melodies,  as  MOORE  re-set  the  Irish  melodies, 
for  ears  polite.  This  new  aristocratic  mongrel  art  had 
nothing  to  do  with  the  real  drama.  METASTASIO  himself 
was  only  an  Italian  Mil.  CHORLEY — the  very  humble  servant 
of  everybody's  tunes;  but  these  tunes  had  to  be  strung 
together,  so  the  recitative,  used  for  centuries  in  church,  was 
borrowed ;  then  the  product  was  naturally  a  little  dull,  so 
the  whole  had  to  be  whipped  up  with  a  dance ;  hence  the 
ballet,  and  there  you  have  the  three  fixed  points  of  the 
opera — aria,  recitative,  and  ballet — which  to  this  day  deter- 
mine the  form  of  modern  opera.  Thus  opera,  whilst  it  had 
no  connection  with  the  real  drama,  did  not  even  spring  from 
the  best  musical  elements.  "  From  the  prosperity  of  opera 
in  Italy,"  says  WAGNER,  "  the  art-student  will  date  the 

decline  of  music  in  that  country No  one  who  has 

any  conception  of  the  grandeur  and  ineffable  depth  of  the 
earlier  Italian  church  music — PALESTRINA'S  '  Stabat  Mater/ 
for  instance — will  ever  dream  of  maintaining  that  Italian 
opera  can  be  looked  upon  as  the  legitimate  daughter  of  that 
wondrous  mother."* 

As  ear-tickling,    and   not  truth  of   expression,  was  the 
chief  thing,  and  as  there  was  nothing  much  to  be  expressed, 


Music  of  the  Future  :  Letter  to  F  Yillot,  p.  10.

the  arias  got  wider  and  wider  of  the  words,  arid  at  last  the 
words  became  mere  pegs,  and  the  music  totally  irrelevant — 
as  who  should  dance  a  jig  over  a  grave. 

GLUCK'S  reform  consisted  in  making  the  operatic  tunes 
once  more  true  to  the  words ;  but  the  improvement  touched 
811.  the  sentiment  only,  without  reaching  the  defective 
THEUINCORRI  ^orm'  ^a  France  the  form  was  slightly  redeemed 
GIBLE  OPERA,  by  the  superior  libretti  and  more  elaborate 
pantomime ;  whilst  in  Germany  opera  arrived  as  a  finished 
foreign  production,  and  MOZART  and  others  had  to  go  to 
Italy  to  learn  it.  "In  expressing  my  highest  admiration  of 
the  exquisite  beauty  of  our  great  masters,"  says  WAGNER, 
"I  did  not  detract  from  their  fame  in  showing  that  the  cause 
of  their  weaknesses  lay  in  the  faultiness  of  the  genre."* 
And  the  defect  of  genre  lay  chiefly  in  the  immolation  of 
the  libretto  to  the  exigences  of  fixed  aria,  scena,  and  recita- 
tive. The  drama,  which  has  to  be  stretched  upon  that 
Procrustean  bed,  must  necessarily  become  disjointed  and 
lifeless  in  the  process.  ROSSINI  retarded  the  progress  of 
the  musical  drama  for  at  least  fifty  years  through  the  abso- 
lute triumph  of  melody,  in  the  most  fascinating  abundance, 
over  the  resources  of  the  orchestra  and  the  inspirations  of 
the  poet.

string  of  beads,  each  bead  being  a  glittering  and  intoxi- 
cating tune.  Dramatic  and  poetic  truth — all  that  makes  a

and  musician  alike  had  felt  this.  GOETHE  and  SCHILLER 
both  found  the  operatic  form,  and  even  the  existing  stage, 
so  uncongenial,  that  they  took  to  writing  narrative  and

followed  in  this  by  BYRON,  TENNYSON,  BROWNING,  and 
SWINBURNE.  BEETHOVEN  wrote  but  one  opera,  Fidelia,  in 
which  the  breadth  of  the  overture,  or  overtures,  seems  to 
accuse  the  narrowness  of  the  dramatic  form,  although  the 
libretto  of  Fidelio  is  very  good,  as  times  go.  MENDELSSOHN 
and  SCHUMANN  could  never  find  a  suitable  libretto. 

The  conclusion  of  all  this  is  obvious.   The  perfect  medium 

which  was  to  combine  the  apparently  unmanageable   arts 

was  yet  to  come,  and  WAGNER  proposed  to  him- 

312. 

THE  MCSICAL  self  the  task  of  harnessing  these  fiery  steeds  to 
his  triumphal  car,  and  driving  them  all  together. 
He  must  choose  his  own  subject,  with  a  simple  plot  and  a 
few  strong  passions  and  great  situations.  He  must  write 
his  own  drama,  which,  without  being  either  orthodox  verse 
or  fixed  metre,  would  aim  in  its  mobile  and  alliterative 
pathos  at  following  the  varied  inflexions  of  natural  feeling. 
He  must  arrange  his  own  scenery,  perfect  in  detail,  and 
within  the  limits  of  stage  possibility ;  and  finally  he  must 


WAGNERS  MASTERS.  411 

compose  his   own  music  and   drill  his  band,   chorus,   and 
characters. 

To  his  prophetic  vision  the  old  opera  form  of  aria,  scena, 
and  recitative  has  disappeared.  The  orchestra  in  a  wondrous 
fashion  floods  the  soul  with  an  emotion  appropriate  to  the 
situation.  The  drama  itself  advances  unshackled  by  any 
musical  exigency;  the  music  flows  on  continuously,  not 
imposing  a  form,  but  taking  its  form  from  the  emotion  of 
the  sentences  as  they  follow  each  other.  Snatches  there 
are  here  and  there  of  exquisite  melody,  broken  up  by  part- 
singing,  with  a  wild  burst  of  chorus  when  needful  to  fulfil 
the  dramatic  occasion ;  but  never  must  action  be  delayed, 
never  must  emotion  be  belied,  never  truth  sacrificed :  only 
at  times,  when  the  expressional  power  of  words  ceases,  the 
music  will  fulfil,  deepen,  combine,  and  sometimes  lift  the 
drama  almost  out  of  itself.  Then  the  spectator  is  raised 
into  a  sphere  of  ecstatic  contemplation;  the  pageantry 
passes  before  his  eyes  as  in  a  dream,  whilst  his  soul  lives 
and  moves  only  in  the  ideal  sphere  of  the  varied  and 
intense  passions  which  are  being  played  out  before  him. 

"Whilst  these  perceptions  and  aims  were  slowly  maturing 

in  him,  WAGNER  found  himself  constantly  at  war  with  his 

age  and  his  surroundings.     At  sixteen,  he  had

him  radiant  forms  and  flaming  ministers.  MOZART  tauglit 
him  that  exquisite  certainty  of  touch  which  selects  exactly 
the  right  notes  to  express  a  given  musical  idea.  WEBER 
taught  him  the  secret  of  pure  melody,  how  to  stamp  with 
an  indelible  type  a  given  character,  as  in  the  return  of 
the  Samiel  motive  in  Der  Freyschutz ;  he  also  perceived 
in  that  opera  the  superiority  of  legend  and  popular  myth, 
as  on  the  Greek  stage,  to  present  the  universal  and  eternal 
aspects  of  human  life  in  their  most  pronounced  and 
ideal  forms.  BEETHOVEN  supplied  him  with  the  mighty 
orchestra,  capable  of  holding  in  suspension  an  immense 
crowd  of  emotions,  and  of  manipulating  the  interior  and 
complex  feelings  with  the  instantaneous  and  infallible 
power  of  a  magician's  Avand.  SCHUBERT  taught  him  the 
freedom  of  song — CHOPIK  the  magic  elasticity  of  chords — 
SPOHR  the  subtle  properties  of  the  chromatic  scale — and 
even  MEYERBEER  revealed  to  him  the  possibility  of  stage 
effect  through  the  Grand  Opera.  SHAKSPERE,  GOETHE, 
and  SCHILLER  suggested  the  kind  of  language  in  which 
such  dramas  as  Lohengrin  and  Rheingold  might  be  written ; 
whilst  MADAME  SCHRODER  DEVRIENT  revealed  to  him  what 
a  woman  might  accomplish  in  the  stage  presentation  of 
ideal  passion  with  such  a  part  as  Elsa  in  Lohengrin,  or 
Brunnhilde  in  Walkiire. 

But  the  immediate  result  of  this,  as  I  have  said,  was  not 
promising.  Contrary  to  the  advice  of  his  friends,  he  had 
thrown  himself,  heart  and  soul,  into  the  studv  of  music  as  a 


WAGNER  AT  TWENTY.  413 

profession.  Under  the  Cantor  Weinlig,  at  Leipsic,  and 
whilst  at  the  University,  he  produced  an  overture  and 
symphony,  which  were  played,  and  not  unfavourably  re- 
ceived, at  the  Gewandhaus ;  but  his  early  work,  with 
here  and  there  an  exceptional  trait  in  harmony,  was 
nothing  but  a  pale  copy  of  MOZART,  as  may  be  seen 
from  a  poor  little  piano  sonata  lately  republished  by 
BREITKOPF. 

His  health  now  broke  down.  He  was  twenty  years 
old  (1833),  and.  he  went  to  his  brother,  a  professor  of 

music  at  Wurzburg,  where  he  stayed  a  year,  at 
•WAGNER  AT  the  end  of  which  time  he  was  appointed  musical 

director  at  the  Magdeburg  theatre,  where,  under 
the  combined  influence  of  WEBER  and  BEETHOVEN,  he  pro- 
duced two  operas — The  Fairies,  and  The  Novice  of  Palermo 
— neither  of  which  succeeded.  He  left  his  place  in  disgust, 
and  obtained  another  post  at  the  Konigsberg  theatre.  There 
he  married  an  actress — a  good  creature,  who,  without  being 
much  to  blame,  does  not  seem  to  have  materially  increased 
his  happiness,  but  who  decidedly  shared  the  opinion  of  his 
friends  that  the  composition  of  "  pot-boilers  "  was  superior 
to  the  pursuit  of  the  Ideal.  The  Ideal,  however,  haunted 
WAGNER,  and — Poverty.

Baltic,  and  there,  as  chef  d' or chest  re  at  the  theatre,  he

really  appears  to  have  enjoyed  studying  the  operas  of 
MEHUL,  SPONTINI,  AUBER;  for,  whilst  suffering 
what  he  describes  as  a  dull,  gnawing  paiu  at 

RIEXZL 

the  frequent  irrelevance  of  the  sentiment  to  the 
music,  the  nobler  correspondences  and  beautiful  inspirations 
gave  him  far-off  glimpses  of  that  musical  drama  to  which  he 
even  now  dimly  aspired. 

In  the  midst  of  his  routine  duties  BULWER'S  novel, 
Rienzi,  struck  his  imagination.  There,  as  on  a  large  and 
classic  stage,  was  portrayed  that  eternal  revolt  of  the 
human  spirit  against  tyranny,  routine,  selfishness,  and 
corruption,  of  which  the  Polish  insurrection  of  1831  and 
the  Revolution  of  July  were  the  modern  echoes.  Rienzi,  a 
tribune  of  the  people,  dreaming  of  the  old  austere  Republic, 
in  the  midst  of  corrupt  Papal  Rome — a  noble  heart,  a 
powerful  will  at  war  \uth  a  brutal  and  vulgar  age,  sup- 
ported, cheered  by  the  enthusiasm  of  a  devoted  and  patriotic 
sister— raised  by  a  wave  of  popularity  to  the  highest  summit 
of  human  power,  then  hurled  down  by  the  Papal  anathema, 
betrayed  by  a  mean  and  cowering  aristocracy,  banished  by 
the  mob  that  had  so  lately  hailed  him  as  a  deliverer,  and 
at  last  falling  by  a  treacherous  hand  upon  the  charred  and 
crumbling  ashes  of  his  own  homestead,  the  last  great 
tribune  of  Rome  ! — here  was  a  subject  with  immense  out- 
lines, full  of  situations  in  which  the  greatest  breadth  might 
be  joined  to  the  most  detailed  inflexions  of  feeling.  In  it 
WAGNER,  whilst  not  departing  avowedly  from  the  form  of 


WAG  NEK  A  MOB   ORATOR.  415 

the  grand  opera  then  in  vogue  at  Paris,  has  in  fact  burst  the 
boundaries.  Rienzi  is  already  the  work  of  an  independent 
master — it  is,  at  least,  prophetic  of  Lohengrin  and  Tristan, 
whilst  comparing  favourably  in  pure  melody  and  sensa- 
tional effects  with  any  of  the  current  operas.  What  rush, 
triumph,  aspiration  about  the  large  outlines  and  tramping 
measures  of  the  overture — what  elan  and  rugged  dignity  in 
the  choruses — what  elevation  in  Rienzi's  prayer,  "  God  of 
Light!"  —  what  fervour  and  inexhaustible  faith  in  the 
phrase,  "  Thou  hast  placed  me  as  a  pilot  on  a  treacherous 
and  rocky  strand  " — what  imagery,  as  of  vast  buildings  and 
ranged  towers  dimly  seen  athwart  the  dull  red  dawn,  in  the 
music  of  "  Scatter  the  night  that  reigns  above  this  city/' 
and  what  chastened  exaltation,  free  from  all  Italian  flourish 
or  ornament,  of  "  Rise,  thou  blessed  sun,  and  bring  with 
thee  resplendent  liberty  !  " 

But  in  1839,  which  saw  the  text  and  the  completion  of 
the  two  first  acts,  we  are  far  indeed  from  the  production  of 
Rienzi ;  it  struck,  however,  the  key-note  of  a  most  impor- 
tant and  little-understood  phase  in  WAGNER'S  career — the 
political  phase. 

Musicians,  poets,  and  artists  are  not,  as  a  rule,  politicians. 

Their  world   is   the  inner  world — the   world  of

R'  special  age  or   clime,  but   is   eternal   and   uni- 
versal.    GOETHE  and  BEETHOVEN  cared  little  for  revolutions, 


4 1C  WAGNER. 

and  have  even  been  deemed  wanting  in  patriotism.  But 
WAGNER  was  a  hot  politician.  He  was  at  one  time  a 
mob  orator,  and  was  seduced  by  his  illustrious  friend 
ROCKEL,  who  was  afterwards  put  in  prison,  to  throw  him- 
self at  Dresden  into  the  rise  of  Saxony  and  the  agita- 
tions of  1848.  He  was  proscribed  and  banished  from 
German  soil,  and  years  afterwards  when  he  had,  if  not 
recanted,  at  all  events  acquiesced  in  things  as  they  were,  he 
was  obliged  to  fly  from  Munich,  warned  by  the  friendly 
king  that  his  life  was  in  danger.  The  title  of  but  one  of  his 
numerous  semi-political  pamphlets,  Art  and  the  Revolution, 
gives  us  the  real  clue  to  all  this.  People  have  accused 
WAGNER  of  time-serving  and  change  in  politics,  but  the 
fact  was  that  he  favoured  social  revolution  because  he 
thought  it  needful  to  art  revolution.  Conventionality  and 
stagnation  in  art  seemed  to  him  the  natural  outcome  of 
conventionality  and  stagnation  in  society  ;  the  world  must 
be  recalled  to  feeling  and  reality  before  art  could  again 
become  the  ideal  life  of  the  people,  as  it  was  once  in 
Greece.  But  when,  through  royal  patronage  later  on,  all 
impediment  to  the  free  development  of  his  art-work  disap- 
peared, his  revolutionary  tendencies  also  disappeared.  He, 
too,  was,  first  and  foremost,  Artist,  and  he  came  to  realise 
his  vocation,  which  had  to  do  with  Art,  and  with  "  the 
Revolution  ''  only  in  so  far  as  it  affected  "  Art." 

But,  in  fact,  no   ardent  soul  could  escape  the  romantic

and  revolutionary  contagion  that  swept  over   France,  Ger- 

317.        many,   and   even   England,    between    1830    and1

been  lifted  from   her   oppressed   bosom — but  then,  like   a 
•wayward  child,  she  burst  into  all  kinds  of  excesses. 

The  atheism  of  the  first  revolution,  the  brutality  of 
NAPOLEON  BUONAPARTF/S  administration,  the  dulness  of 
Louis  PHILIPPE'S,  the  revived  taste  for  Greek  art  combined 
•with  the  inflexible  dogmatism  of  the  Papal  creed — all  these 
conspired  to  fill  the  ardent  youth  of  the  period  with  a  deep 
revolt  against  things  as  they  were.  With  this  came  a 
settled  longing  for  a  return  of  some  sort  to  nature  and 
freedom,  and  a  vague  but  intense  aspiration  towards  the 
ideal  and  immaterial  world,  which  in  other  times  might 
have  taken  the  form  of  a  religious  revolution,  b.ut  in  1830 
broke  out  in  what  has  been  called  "  Romanticism  "  in  Art. 
It  was  seen  in  the  writings  of  MAZZINI  and  the  mutterings 
of  Italian  freedom ;  in  the  insatiable  and  varied  develop- 
ments of  MADAME  SAND'S  genius,  in  the  wild  and  pathetic 
cries  of  ALFRED  DE  MUSSET,  in  the  sentimeutalism  of 
LAMARTINE,  in  the  vast  scorn  and  bitter  invective  of  HUGO, 
in  the  heart-broken  submission  of  LACORDAIRE,  and  in  the 
despair  of  DE  LAMMENAIS.  BYRON,  SHELLEY,  and  TENNY- 
SON caught  both  the  most  earthly  and  the  most  heavenly 
echoes  of  the  romantic  movement  in  England  ;  whilst  its 
inner  life  and  genius  have  found,  after  all,  their  most  subtle

expression  in  the  music  of  BEETHOVEN,  MENDELSSOHN, 
•SCHUMANN,  BERLIOZ,  CHOPIN,  WAGNER,  LISZT,  and  RUBIN- 
STEIN. 

«'  It  seems,  indeed,"  writes  WAGNER,  in  one  of  those  veins  of  flashing 
perception  in  which  he  so  abounds,  "that  human  sentiment,  as  if 
intensified  by  the  pressure  of  conventional  civilization,  had  sought  an 
outlet  for  asserting  itself  according  to  its  own  laws  of  expression.  The 
astounding  popularity  of  music  in  our  time  proves  the  correctness  of  the 
supposition  that  the  modern  development  of  this  art  has  met  an  innate 
desire  of  the  human  spirit."* 


WAGNER  had  left  Magdeburg  for  Riga,  but  he  soon  came 
to  the  end  of  his  tether  there.     A  stupid  little  provincial 

town    was    not    likely    to    become    then    what

WAGNER'S  WAGNER  has  made   Bayreuth   since — the   stage 

for  turning  upside  down  the  art-theories  of  the 
civilized  world.  Pushed  by  what  he  calls  "  despair,"  with- 
out money  and  without  friends,  but  with  that  settled 
faith  in  himself  which  has  made  him  independent  of  both 
until  it  has  won  both,  the  obscure  chef  d'orchestre  resolved 
to  go  to  Paris  and  storm  the  Grand  Opera,  then  at 
the  feet  of  ROSSINI  and  that  strange,  unscrupulous  bric-a- 
brac  composer,  MEYERBEER  !  The  small  vessel  in  which  he 
sailed  was  blown  about  the  Baltic  for  three  weeks,  put  into 
many  desolate  coast-nooks,  and  nearly  wrecked.  After 
many  hardships,  shared  with  the  rough  and  often  starving

crew,  the  lonely  musician  arrived  in  London  (1840),  with 
his  head  full  of  Paris  and  the  Grand  Opera,  and  with  Rienzi 
in  his  carpet  bag. 

Whilst  here  he  playfully  seized  the  musical  motive  of  the 
English  people.  It  lay,  he  said,  in  the  five  consecutive 
ascending  notes  (after  the  first  three)  of  "  Rule  Britannia"  : 
there  was  expressed  the  whole  breadth  and  downright  bluff 
(<  go  "  of  the  British  nation.  He  threw  "  Rule  Britannia  " 
into  an  overture,  and  sent  it  by  post  to  SIR  GEORGE  SMART, 
then  omnipotent  musical  professor  in  London;  but  the 
postage  being  insufficient,  the  MS.  was  not  taken  in,  and  at 
this  moment  is  probably  lying  in  some  dim  archive  of  the 
Post  Office,  "  left  till  called  for." 

Crossing  to  Dieppe,  he  met  the  crafty  and  clever  MEYER- 
BEER, who  instantly  saw  the  man  he  had  to  deal  with,  and 
probably  conceived  in  a  moment  that  policy  of 

oil). 

WAGNER  AND  apparent    support   but    probable   intrigue    which 
R  made  him  throughout  life  WAGNER'S   pet  aver- 
sion. 

It  has  been  unwarrantably  asserted  that  WAGNER  hated 
the  Jews  because  of  MEYERBEER  and  MENDELSSOHN,  and  hated 
MEYERBEER  and  MENDELSSOHN  because  they  were  success- 
ful; but  WAGNER'S  dearest  friends  have  been  Jews;  he  only 
objected  to  what  he  considered  the  low  level  of  their  art 
theories;  and  if  he  hated  MEYERBEER  and  MENDELSSOHN — 
two  men  also  at  loggerheads,  by  the  way — it  was  not  simply

because  they  had  the  ear  of  Europe,  but  because  they  and 
their  friends  kept  everyone  else  out  of  the  field,  whilst 
MEYERBEER  debased  musical  art  to  the  level  of  the  vulgarest 
sensation,  and  MENDELSSOHN  never  rose  in  WAGNER'S 
opinion  above  the  plane  of  a  drawing-room  prophet,  whilst 
creating  an  elegant  and  pseudo-classic  standard  of  excellence 
to  which  everyone  soon  learned  to  bow  down. 

In  this  opinion  I  shall  never  concur.  MENDELSSOHN  has 
been  to  me  as  much  a  revelator  of  the  beautiful  as  WAGNER 
has  been  of  the  sublime.  Nothing  is  more  painful  to  me  than 
the  bitter  opposition  between  the  friends  of  MENDELSSOHN 
and  WAGNER.  These  two  great  spirits  were  probably  as 
antipathetic  as  MOORE  and  WORDSWOTH  ;  but  although 
WAGNER  is  the  inexorable  and  colossal  development  in  art 
since  BEETHOVEN,  MENDELSSOHN  reigns  for  ever  in  a  sweet 
wayside  temple  of  his  own,  full  of  bright  dreams  and  visions, 
incense  and  ringing  songs.  And  partly  is  he  so  sweet 
because,  unburthened  with  any  sense  of  a  message  to  utter, 
a  mission  to  develop,  he  sings  like  a  child  in  the  valleys  of 
asphodel,  weaving  bright  chaplets  of  spring  flowers  for  the 
whole  world,  looking  upon  the  mystery  of  grief  and  pain 
with  wide  eyes  of  sympathy,  and  at  last  succumbing  to  it 
himself,  but  not  understanding  it,  with  a  song  of  tender 
surprise  upon  his  lips. 

WAGNER  passed  two  terrible  years,  1840-4.2,  in  Paris. 
MEYERBEER  had  given  him  introductions,  and  introduced 


WAGNER  IN  PARIS.  421 

him  later  to  M.  JOLY,  a  stage-director  at  Paris,  whom  he 
must  have  known  to  be  on  the  point  of  bank- 

320. 

WAGNER  IN  ruptcy,  and  who  suspended  the  rehearsal  of  the 
Novice  of  Palermo  at  the  last  moment.  But  this 
was  but  the  end  of  a  series  of  checks.  He  wrote  an  overture 
to  Faust.  His  good  friend  and  faithful  ally,  SCHLESINGER, 
editor  of  the  Gazette  Musicale,  got  it  rehearsed  at  the 
Conservatoire.  It  sounded  quite  too  strange  and  bizarre  to 
those  ears  polite,  and  was  instantly  snuffed  out. 

He  submitted  a  libretto,  "Love  Forbidden,"  to  a  theatrical 
manager,  but  it  had  not  a  chance,  and  dropped.  SCHLE- 
SINGER  now  employed  him  to  write,  and  he  wrote  articles 
and  novels,  and  so  kept  body  and  soul  together.  No  one 
would  listen  to  his  music,  but  he  was  not  a  bad  hack,  and 
was  hired  for  a  few  francs  to  arrange  Halevy's  "  Queen  of 
Cyprus  "for  the  piano,  and  the  latest  tunes  of  DONIZETTI 
and  BELLINI  for  piano  and  cornet  a  piston. 

At  night  he  stole  into  the  Grand  Opera,  and  there,  as  he 
tells  us,  felt  quite  certain  that  his  own  works  would  one  day 
supersede  the  popular  efforts  of  ROSSINI  and  MEYEKBEEU. 
He  does  not  seem  to  have  been  dejected  like  a  lesser  soul; 
in  what  the  French  called  his  immense  orgueil,  he  was  sorry 
for  their  want  of  appreciation,  but  never  dreamed  of  altering 
his  ideas  to  suit  them.  "  Je  me  flattais,"  says  the  unpaid 
musical  hack,  "d'imposer  les  miennes."  Meanwhile  the 
splendid  band  of  the  Conservatoire,  under  HABENECK,  con- 
soled him,  and  on  the  Boulevards  he  often  met  and  chatted 


422  WAGNER. 

with  AUBER,  for  whom  he  had  a  sincere  respect  and  admira- 
tion. AUBER  was  at  least  a  conscientious  musician  of  genius, 
who  knew  his  business,  and  did  not  debase  what  was  at  no 
time  a  very  exalted  but  still  a  legitimate  branch  of  his  art, 
the  opera  comique;  and,  besides,  AUBER  was  a  bon  comarade, 
and  liked  WAGNER,  probably  without  understanding  him. 

After  months   of    drudgery,  and   chiefly  penny-a-liniug 

for  the    Gazette    Musicale,    WAGNER    felt    the    imperious 

321.       necessity  for  a  return  to  his  own  art.     He  took  a 


THE  FLYING  \{^\\Q  cottage  outside  Paris,  hired  a  piano,   and 

DUTCHMAN, 

1841.  shut  himself  up.  He  had  done  for  a  time,  at 
least,  with  the  mean,  frivolous,  coarse  world  of  Paris  —  he 
did  not  miss  his  friends,  he  did  not  mind  his  poverty.  He 
was  again  on  the  wild  Norwegian  coast,  beaten  about  with 
storms,  and  listening  to  the  weird  tales  of  mariners,  as  in 
broken  and  abrupt  utterances,  or  with  bated  breath,  they 
confided  to  him  the  legend  common  in  one  form  or  other 
to  sea-faring  folk  in  all  parts  of  the  world  —  the  legend  of 
the  Flying  Dutchman.  The  tale  sprang  from  the  lives  and 
c.d  ventures  of  those  daring  navigators  of  the  fifteenth  and 
sixteenth  centuries,  and  reflects  the  desperate  struggle  with 
the  elements,  the  insatiable  thirst  for  the  discovery  of  new 
lands  athwart  unknown  seas;  and  it  seems  to  embody  for 
ever  the  avenging  vision  of  men  who,  resolved  to  win,  had 
so  often  dared  and  lost  all.  A  famous  captain,  mad  to 
double  the  Cape  of  Storms,  beaten  back  again  and  again, 


THE  FLYING  DUTCHMAN,  18-11.  423 

at  length  swears  a  mighty  oath  to  persevere  throughout 
eternity.  The  devil  takes  him  at  his  word.  The  captain 
doubles  the  Cape,  but  is  doomed  to  roam  the  seas  for  ever 
from  pole  to  pole — as  the  Wandering  Jew  to  tread  the  earth 
— his  phantom  vessel  the  terror  of  all  mariners,  and  the 
dreadful  herald  of  shipwreck.  Here  was  a  legend  which 
needed  but  one  inspired  touch  of  love  to  make  it  a  grand 
epitome  of  sea-faring  life,  with  its  hard  toils,  its  forlorn 
hopes,  and  its  tender  and  ineffably  sweet  respites.  The 
accursed  doom  of  the  Flying  Dutchman  can  be  lifted  by 
human  love  alone.  The  captain,  driven  by  an  irrepressible 
longing  for  rest,  may  land  once  in  seven  years,  and  if  he 
can  find  a  woman  who  will  promise  to  be  his  and  remain 
faithful  to  him  for  one  term  of  seven  years,  his  trial  will  be 
over — he  will  be  saved. 

The  legend  thus  humanized  becomes  the  vehicle  for  the 
expression  of  those  intense  yet  simple  feelings  and  situations 
which  popular  myth,  according  to  WAGNER,  has  the  property 
of  condensing  into  universal  types.  Immense  unhappiness, 
drawn  by  magnetic  attraction  to  immense  love,  tried  by 
heartrending  doubt  and  uncertainty,  and  crowned  with 
fidelity  and  triumphant  love,  the  whole  embodied  in  a  clear, 
simple  story,  summed  up  in  a  few  situations  of  terrible 
strength  and  inexorable  truth, — such  is  WAGNER'S  conception 
of  the  drama  of  the  Flying  Dutchman  with  its  "  damna- 
tion "  motive  belonging  to  the  captain,  and  its  "  salvation ' 
motive  given  to  the  bride — its  sailor's  subject — its  pilot's 


424  WAGNER. 

song — its  spinning-wheel  home-melody — and  its  stormy  "  Ho  I 
e  ho  1 "  chorus.  The  whole  drama  is  shadowed  forth  in  the 
magic  and  tempestuous  overture,  and  stands  out  as  this  com- 
poser's first  straightforward  desertion  of  history  proper,  and 
adoption  of  myth  as  the  special  medium  of  the  new  Musical 
Drama. 

Six  weeks  of  ceaseless  labour,  which  to  WAGNER  were 
weeks  of  spontaneous  and  joyful  production,  sufficed  to  com- 
plete the  music  of  the  Flying  Dutchman.  The  immediate 
result  in  Paris  was  ludicrous.  The  music  was  instantly 
judged  to  be  absurd,  and  WAGNER  was  forced  to  sell  the 
libretto,  which  was  handed  over  to  a  Frenchman,  one  M.  P. 
FOUCHE,  who  could  write  music.  It  appeared,  with  that 
gentleman's  approved  setting,  under  the  title  of  Le  Vais- 
seau  Fantome. 

This  was  enough  !  No  lower  depth  could  well  be  reached, 
and  WAGNER  was  preparing  to  leave  Paris  to  the  tender 
mercies  of  ROSSINI,  MEYERBEER,  and  M.  P.  FOUCHE,  when 
news  reached  him  from  Germany  that  Rienzi,  flouted  in  the 
capital  of  taste,  had  been  accepted  in  Berlin  and  Dresden ! 

It  was  the  spring  of  1842,  and  it  was  also  the  rapid  and 

wondrous  turn  of  the   tide  for   WAGNER.     He   hurried  to 

322.       Dresden,  to  find  the  rehearsals  of  Rienzi  already 

advanced.     The  opera   was  produced   with  that

first  appreciation  of  an  important  but  long-neglected  truth, 


EIENZI,  1842.—TANNRAUSER,  1845.  425 

and  WAGNER,  having  become  the  favourite  of  the  Crown 
Prince,  was  elected  Kapellmeister  at  Dresden,  and  found 
himself  for  the  first  time  famous.  Some  might  now  have 
rested  on  their  laurels,  but  to  WAGNER'S  imperious  develop- 
ment Rienzi  was  already  a  thing  of  the  past.  He  had 
drunk  of  the  crystalline  waters  of  popular  myth,  and  was 
still  thirsty.  The  Flying  Dutchman  had  opened  up  a  new 
world  to  him,  more  real  because  more  exhaustive  of  human 
feelings  and  character  than  the  imperfect  types  and  broken 
episodes  of  real  history.  He  seemed  to  stand  where  the 
fresh  springs  of  inspiration  welled  up  from  a  virgin  soil ; 
he  listened  to  the  child-like  voices  of  primitive  peoples, 
inspired  from  the  simple  heart  of  Nature,  and  babbling 
eternal  verities  without  knowing  it.  Legend  was  the  rough 
ore — the  plastic  element  he  could  seize  and  remould,  as 
^ESCHYLUS  remoulded  Prometheus,  or  SOPHOCLES  GEdipus, 
adding  philosophic  analysis  and  the  rich  adornments  of 
poetic  fancy  and  artistic  form. 

The  legend   of   Tannhduser  now   engrossed    him.      The 

drama  was  soon  conceived  and  written.     There  he  summed 

up,   in   a   few    glowing    scenes,  the    opposition

to  give  to  that  stormy  impulse  which  at  last  poured  its 


420  WAGNER. 

long  pent-up  torrent  over  Europe.  The  deep  revolt  still 
stares  us  in  the  face  from  the  Italian  canvases,  as  we  look 
at  the  sensuous  figures  of  RAPHAEL  or  TITIAN — the  free 
types  of  fair  breathing  life,  surrounded  with  the  hard 
aureole  of  the  artificial  saint,  or  limned  as  in  mockery,  like 
the  dreams  of  a  pagan  world  upon  the  walls  of  the  Vatican. 

Tannhauser,  a  Tlmringian  knight,  taking  refuge  with 
Venus,  no  longer  the  beneficent  Holda,  joy  of  gods  and  men, 
but  turned  by  the  excesses  of  the  ascetic  spirit  into  a  malign 
witch,  and  banished  to  the  bowels  of  the  earth  in  the 
Venusberg — Tannhauser,  with  a  touch  eternally  true  to 
nature,  bursting  the  fetters  of  an  unruly  sensual  life,  and 
sighing  for  a  healthier  activity — Tannhauser  seeing  for 
a  moment  only,  in  the  pure  love  of  woman,  the  reconcilia- 
tion of  the  senses  with  the  spirit,  a  reconciliation  made  for 
ever  impossible  by  the  stupid  bigotry  of  a  false  form  of 
religion,  but  which  is  ultimately  sealed  and  accomplished 
by  love  and  death  in  heaven; — this  is  the  human  and 
sublime  parable  of  the  drama,  wrought  out  with  the  fervour 
of  a  religious  devotee,  and  epitomized  in  that  prodigious 
overture  wherein  the  dirge  of  the  Church  mingles  with  the 
free  and  impassioned  song  of  the  minstrel  knight,  and 
clashes  wildly  with  the  voluptuous  echoes  of  the  fatal 
Venusberg. 

WAGNER'S  progress  was  now  checked  by  that  storm  of 
invective  which  burst  out  all  over  the  art  world  of  Germany 
— not  on  account  of  Runzi,  but  in  consequence  of  the 


LOHENGRIN,  1847.  48.7 

Flying  Dutchman,  and  especially  of  Tannhduser.  The  reason 
is  simple.  The  power  of  Rienzi,  the  audacity  of  its  senti- 
ment, the  simplicity  of  its  outline,  and  the  realism  of  its 
mise  en  scene,  together  with  a  general  respect  for  the  old 
opera  forms,  ensured  it  a  hearing  which  resulted  in  a  legiti- 
mate triumph.  But  in  Tannhduser  the  new  path  was  already 
struck  out,  which  singers,  band,  audience,  critics,  and  com- 
posers, in  a  body,  refused  to  tread — in  short,  aria,  recitative, 
and  ballet  were  dethroned,  and  suddenly  found  themselves 
servants  where  they  had  been  masters. 

In  1843,  the  Flying  Dutchman  was  produced  at  Dresden, 

and  failed.     Rienzi  was  still  revived  with  success.     WAGNER 

now   sent    the    Dutchman    and    Tannhduser    to 

various  theatres.     The  former  was  tried  at  Berlin 

FAILURES. 

in  1844,  and  failed.  SPOIIR  had  the  intelligence 
to  take  it  up  at  Cassel,  and  wrote  a  friendly  and  appre- 
ciative letter  to  WAGNER;  but  the  MS.  scores  were,  as  a 
rule,  returned  by  the  other  theatres,  and  the  new  operas 
seemed  to  react  on  the  earlier  success,  for  at  Hamburgh 
Rienzi  failed. 

Meanwhile,  failure,  together  with  the  close  sympathy  of 
a  few  devoted  friends,  convincing  him   that  he 

O«£O. 

LOHENGRIN,  was  more  right  than  ever,  WAGNER  now  threw 

•I  QAf 

himself  into  the  completion  of  that  work  which  is 
perhaps  of  the  whole  his  most  perfect,  as  it  certainly  is  his 


428  WAGNEE. 

most  popular  creation,  Lohengrin.  The  superb  acting  and 
singing  of  MDLLES.  TITIENS,  NILSSON,  and  ALBANI,  will  be 
fresh  in  the  minds  of  many  readers.  The  choruses  in 
England  have  never  yet  been  up  to  the  mark,  but  the  band 
under  SIR  MICHAEL  COSTA,  at  its  best,  rendered  the 
wondrous  prelude  to  perfection. 

The  whole  of  Lohengrin  is  in  that  prelude.  The  descent 
of  the  Knight  of  the  Swan  from  the  jasper  shrines  of  the 
sacred  palace  of  Montsalvat,  hidden  away  in  a  distant 
forest  land — his  holy  mission  to  rescue  Elsa  from  her  false 
accusers — his  high  and  chivalric  love — his  dignified  trouble 
at  being  urged  by  her  to  reveal  his  name,  that  insatiable 
feminine  curiosity  which  wrecks  the  whole — the  darker 
scenes  of  treachery  by  which  Elsa  is  goaded  on  to  press 
her  fatal  inquiry — the  magnificent  climax  of  the  first  act — 
the  sense  of  weird  mystery  that  hangs  about  the  appearance 
and  re-appearance  of  the  swan,  and  the  final  departure  of 
the  glittering  Knight  of  the  Sangraal — allegory  of  heavenly 
devotion  stooping  to  lift  up  human  love  and  dashed  with 
earth's  bitterness  in  the  attempt ; — to  those  who  understand 
the  pathos,  delicacy,  and  full  intensity  of  the  Lohengrin 
prelude,  this  and  more  will  become  as  vivid  as  art  and 
emotion  can  make  it.  Lohengrin  in  its  elevation,  alike  in 
its  pain,  its  sacrifice,  and  its  peace,  is  the  necessary  reaction 
from  that  wreck  of  sensual  passion  and  religious  despair  so 
vividly  grasped  in  the  scenes  of  the  Venusberg,  in  the 
pilgrim  chant  and  the  wayside  crucifix  of  Tannh'duser. 


NEGLECT  AND  EXILE,  1S47-57.  429 

Lohengrin  was  finished  in  1847,  but  the  political   events 

of  the  next  few  years  brought  WAGNER'S  career  in  Germany 

326.       to  an  abrupt  conclusion.     His  growing  dissatis- 

NEGLECT    faction  with  society  coincided,  unconsciously  no 

1847-57.    doubt,  with  the  failure  of  his   operas  after  that 

first  dawn  of  success.     He  now  devoted  himself  to  criticism 

and   politics.      He   read    SCHOPENHAUER,   whose    pessimist 

philosophy  did  not  tend  to  soothe  his  perturbed  spirit ;  and 

during  the  next  ten  years,  from  1847  to  1857,  he  spoke  to  the 

world  from  different  places  of  exile  in  that  series  of  political 

and  sesthetical  pamphlets  to  which  I  have  before  alluded. 

In  1855,  owing  to  the  earnest  advocacy  of  such  friends 
as  M.  FERDINAND  PRAEGER,  who  for  thirty  years,  through 

evil  report  and  good  report,  had   never   ceased 
327. 

LONDON,  to  support  WAGNER,  the  Philharmonic  Society 
invited  him  over  to  London,  and  whilst  here 
he  conducted  eight  concerts.  Pie  was  not  popular;  he 
was  surprised  to  find  that  the  band  thought  it  unneces- 
sary to  rehearse,  and  the  band  was  surprised  that  he 
should  require  so  much  rehearsal.  But  he  drove  the  band 
in  spite  of  itself,  and  the  band  hated  him.  They  said  he 
murdered  BEETHOVEN  with  his  baton,  because  of  the  free- 
dom and  inspiration  of  his  readings.  MENDELSSOHN'S 
Scotch  symphony  had  been  deliberately  crushed — or  it  was 
the  only  thing  that  went — according  to  which  paper  you 
happened  to  read.  He  did  not  care  for  the  press,  and  he 


430  WAGNER. 

was  not  much  surprised  that  the  press  did  not  care  for  him. 
The  unfailing  musical  intelligence  of  the  Queen  and  Prince 
Albert  was  the  one  ray  of  sunlight  in  this  his  second  visit 
to  our  inhospitable  land,  but  the  power  of  the  man  could  not 
be  hid,  even  from  his  enemies  ;  his  culture  astonished  the 
half-educated  musicians  by  whom  he  was  surrounded,  his 
brilliant  originality  impressed  even  his  own  friends,  who 
saw  him  struggling  through  an  imperfect  acquaintance 
with  French  and  English  to  make  himself  understood. 
One  evening,  alone  in  company  with  M.  SAINTON,  HECTOR 
BERLIOZ,  and  FERDINAND  PRAEGER,  WAGNER  surprised  them 
all  by  suddenly  launching  out  on  art,  music,  and  philosophy. 
BERLIOZ  was  an  elegant  speaker,  accustomed  to  lead  easily, 
but  WAGNER,  with  his  torrent  of  broken  French  and  his 
rush  of  molten  ideas,  silenced,  bewildered,  delighted,  and 
astonished  them  all.  BERLIOZ  is  gone,  but  that  night  still 
lives  in  the  memory  of  those  who  were  present  who  survive, 
and  from  whose  lips  I  have  the  incident. 

Thus  WAGNER  passed  through  England  for  a  second  time, 
leaving  behind  him  a  vague  impression  of  power  and  eccen- 
tricity, the  first  of  which  the  musical  press  did  its  best  to 
kill,  whilst  fanning  the  second  into  a  devouring  flame  which 
swallowed  up  WAGNER'S  reputation.  Notwithstanding  the 
exertions  of  a  few  devoted  believers,  twenty-one  years  flitted 
by,  and  little  enough  was  heard  of  RICHARD  WAGNER  in 
this  country  until,  owing  to  the  increasing  agitation  of  a 
younger  school  of  musicians,  foremost  among  whom  we 


VON  BULOW'S  INFLUENCE.  431 

must  name  MR.  EDWARD  DANNREUTHER  and  MR.  WALTER 
BACIIE,  the  Flying  Dutchman  was  at  last  indifferently  pro-* 
duced  at  Covent  Garden.  I  well  remember  the  occasion. 
ILMA  DI  MURSKA  played  Senta  admirably  well,  though  too 
old  for  the  part ;  and,  notwithstanding  the  efforts  of  MR. 
SANTLEY,  the  recitative  music  was  nearly  unintelligible, 
owing  to  want  of  intelligence  on  the  part  of  the  band. 
The  whole  thing  was  clumsily  put  on  the  stage,  and  Senta's 
solos  and  the  choruses  alone  pleased. 

In  1874  HER  HANS  VON  BULOW,  pupil  of  LISZT  and  great 
exponent  of  WAGNER'S  music,  came  over,  and  by  his  wonder- 

328.  ful   playing,    aided    steadily    by    the   periodical 
VON  BULOW'B  WAGNERIAN  and  LISZT  concerts  given  by  MESSRS.

zeal  to  produce  WAGNER'S  works,  and  how  his  efforts  were 


432  WAGNER. 

at  last  crowned  with  success  all  over  Germany  in  1849-50. 
•It  was  a  popular  triumph.  I  remember  old  CIPRIANI 
POTTER,  the  friend  of  BEETHOVEN,  saying  to  me  at  the 
time  when  the  English  papers  teemed  with  the  usual 
twaddle  about  WAGNER'S  music  being  intelligible  only  to 
the  few,  "  It  is  all  very  well  to  talk  this  stuff  here,  but 
in  Germany  it  is  the  people,  the  common  people,  who 
crowd  to  the  theatre  when  Tannhduser  and  Lohengrin  are 
given."  I  have  noticed  the  same  at  the  Covent  Garden 
concerts  j  it  was  always  the  pit  and  gallery  who  called  for 
the  WAGNER  nights,  whilst  the  opera  which  had  the  great 
run  with  CARL  ROSA'S  English  Company  was  the  Flying 
Dutchman,  whilst  Tannhciuser  and  Lohengrin  at  both  houses 
were  invariably  the  crowded  nights. 

In  1861  the  .Parisians   showed  their   taste   and   chic  by 
whistling  Tannhduser  off  the  stage. 

In  1863  WAGNER  appeared  at  Vienna,  Prague,  Leipsic, 

St.  Petersburg,  Moscow,  Pesth,  and  conducted  concerts  with 

g30        brilliant   success.     In   1864  his  constant  friend, 

TOE        the  Crown  Prince,  now  Ludwig  II.  of  Bavaria, 

TETRALOGIB 

MEISTER.    summoned  him  to  Munich,  where  the  new  operas 

of  Tristan  in  1865,  and  Meistersinger  in  1868, 

Dis  Rheingold  in   1869,  and  Die   Walkilre  in  1870,  were 

successively   given    with   ever-increasing    appreciation   and 

annlause. 

The  Meistersinger,  through  which  there  runs  a  strongly 


THE  TETBALOGIE  NE1STER.— TRISTAN.      433 

comic  vein,  deals  with  the  contrast  between  the  old  stiff 
forms  of  minstrelsy  by  rule  and  the  spontaneous  revolt  of 
a  free,  musical,  and  poetical  genius,  and  the  work  forms  a 
humorous  and  almost  Shaksperean  pendant  to  the  great  and 
solemn  minstrelsy  which  fills  the  centre  of  Tannhcluser.  In 
WAGNER  s  opinion  it  is  the  opera  most  likely  to  find  favour 
with  an  English  audience,  a  point  since  established  by  the 
German  opera  performances  under  RICHTER. 

Tristan  and  Iseult,  in  which  the  drama  and  analysis  of 
passion — love  and  death — is  wrought  up  to  its  highest  pitch, 
was  thrown  off  between  the  two  first  and  two  last  great 
sections  of  the  Tetralogie,  and  the  Tctralogie,  itself  planned 
twenty  years  ago  and  produced  at  Bayreuth  in  1876, 
seemed  the  last  most  daring  and  complete  manifesta- 
tion of  WAGNER'S  dramatic,  poetic,  and  musical  genius, 
until  Parsifal  revealed  still  greater  heights  and  depths  in 
1882. 

The  purpose  and  power  of  that  great  cycle  of  Scandi- 
navian and  German  myths,  unrolled  in  the  four  colossal 
dramas  of  Rheingold,  Walkure,  Siegfried,  and  Goiter  dam- 
merung,  would  carry  me  far  beyond  the  limits  of  a  biograph- 
ical chapter.  Both  the  Ring  and  the  Parsifal  I  dwell  upon 
at  some  length  in  my  account  of  the  performances  at 
Bayreuth  of  1876,  and  the  memorial  performances  of 
1883. 


I  will  now  give  a  sketch  of  the  general  impression  that 

28 


434  WAGNER. 

WAGNER  made  upon  me  and   upon  others  with   whom  he 

came   in    contact,    and   I    shall    conclude   these 
331. 
WAGNER'S    biographical    pages    with    a   notice    of   his    last 

days  in  Venice  and  his  funeral  at  Bayreuth. 
WAGNER  offended  a  great  many  people  in  the  course  of 
his  life,  but  then  a  great  many  people  offended  WAGNER. 
Those  who  hated  him  lied  about  him  unscrupulously, 
but  not  even  his  worst  enemies  ever  accused  WAGNER 
of  lying  about  them.  He  was  an  egotist  in  the  sense 
that  he  believed  in  himself;  but,  then,  one  must  re- 
member that  in  his  own  estimation  for  more  than  forty 
years,  RICHARD  WAGNER  had  been  the  greatest  figure  in 
the  musical  world,  and  that  it  took  quite  thirty  years  of  his 
life  to  convince  the  world  of  that  fact  which  now,  for  about 
a  couple  of  years,  we  have  had  proclaimed  by  all  the  news- 
papers of  Europe.  If  in  general  company  his  manner  was 
reserved,  and  even  a  little  acrid,  was  there  not  a  cause  ? 
Such  a  man,  with  an  immense  consciousness  of  power,  meet- 
ing with  marvellous  neglect,  and  trampled  upon,  but  never 
crushed,  by  penury,  misfortune,  and  the  bitterest  persecu- 
tion and  ridicule,  naturally  becomes  an  egotist,  and  is  apt 
to  play  the  king  in  disguise,  and  behave,  even  in  the  midst 
of  insult,  as  if  he  expected  all  men  to  bow  down  before 
him ;  and  then  as  naturally,  when  at  last  they  do  bow  down 
in  the  most  abject  of  attitudes,  he  feels  a  little  inclined  to 
kick  them. 

When  I  remember  that  about  forty  years  ago  Rienzi,  and 


WAGNERS  EGOTISM.  435 

the  Flying  Dutchman,  followed  by  Tannhduser  and  Lohen- 
grin, were  finished,  that  the  master — then  truly  of  the 
future — was  patronised  here,  snubbed  there,  and  supported 
himself  by  arranging  tunes  for  the  cornet-a-piston  and 
piano  —  that  he  starved  a  little,  was  banished  for  his 
opinions,  nearly  shipwrecked,  and  altogether  unable  to  get 
anybody  except  FERDINAND  PRAEGER,  LISZT  (perhaps  M. . 
SAINTON  and  half-a-dozen  intimes,  some  of  them  as  un- 
recognised as  himself)  to  believe  in  him  at  all — why,  if 
there  ever  was  a  training  for  egotism,  that  was !  In  fact, 
for  nearly  half  a  century  there  was  no  one  to  believe 
in  RICHARD  WAGNER  except  RICHARD  WAGNER.  Then, 
by-and-by,  the  crowned  heads,  and,  what  was  more  to 
the  point,  the  heads  of  opera-houses,  came  round,  and  we 
had  bowing  and  scraping  on  all  sides;  an-d  connoisseurs 
arrived,  cap  in  hand,  to  interview  the  great  man,  and  tell 
him  to  his  face  "  RICHARD  WAGNER,  we  deem  you  one  of 
the  greatest  musicians  that  ever  lived."  "  Bah !  "  says 
WAGNER,  "  I  told  you  that  forty  years  ago ;  I  can  do  with- 
out you  now  ! "  "  Oh,  fie !  what  a  vain  man  !  "  said  your 
offended  aristocrat.  I  never  thought  RICHARD  WAGNER 
vain.  I  knew  him  to  be  irritable — so  are  other  people,  who 
only  resemble  him  in  that.  I  knew  him  to  be  impatient  of 
interruption — so  is  your  banking-clerk  when  stopped  in  the 
middle  of  a  column  of  figures.  I  knew  him  to  be  proud — so 
are  many  who  have  nothing  to  be  proud  of;  and  from  the 
first  moment  that  I  heard,  now  twenty  years  ago,  the  pre-

lude  to  Lohengrin,  and  read  a  few  of  his  letters  on  art,  I 
also  knew  RICHARD  WAGNER  to  be  the  greatest  composer  and 
the  most  impressive  art-personality  then  alive  in  the  world. 

WAGNER'S  was  certainly  one  of  the  strongest  and  most 
independent  natures   I  ever   came   across.      The    ordinary 

motives  which  move  men  had  no  power  with  him. 
332. 
WAS  WAGNER  He  cared  neither  for  money  nor  for  rank,  nor  for 

the  opinions  of  his  contemporaries.  He  has  been 
charged  with  a  childish  love  of  display,  and  it  is  true  that 
from  the  simplest  and  most  retiring  life  he  would  suddenly 
pass  to  the  most  splendid  and  imposing  scale  of  living ;  as 
when  on  one  occasion  he  entered  Heidelberg  in  a  carriage 
drawn  by  four  horses  with  outriders.  He  was  fond  of  beau- 
tiful surroundings,  and  he  would  dress  expensively ;  but  in 
these  peculiarities  anyone  who  understood  WAGNER  would 
easily  see,  that  his  excitable  and  artistic  temperament  found 
in  these  contrasts  and  accessories  the  stimulus  most  favour- 
able to  his  ceaseless  and  buoyant  productivity,  rather  than 
the  mere  freaks  of  personal  vanity. 

Athough   the    most    intimate   friend   of   the    KING    OP 
BAVARIA,  he   was  not   a   man   whom  princes   could  order 

about   or   control.      I   remember  very   well  his

self  of  the  privilege  of  visiting  Her  Majesty  at  Windsor. 
WAGNER  never  forgot  that  the  QUEEN  and  PRINCE  ALBERT 
recognised  his  genius  on  the  occasion  of  his  first  visit  to 
England,  and  his  illustrious  patrons  were  then  in  a  very 
small  minority. 

WAGNER  was  adored  by  his  household.      He  lived    for 

some   time  at  Lucerne  in  great  retirement — he  was  then 

working  at  the  Einy.     A  friend  who  had  at  that

WAGNER  AT  time  frequent  access  to  him,  has  given  us  some 
charming  WAGNERIAN  side-lights.  Nervous  and 
intensely  impressionable,  \ve  are  told  his  sentiments  always 
ran  into  extremes,  but  his  self-recovery  was  rapid.  He 
sometimes  wounded  even  his  friends  by  the  intense  and 
passionate  sincerity  of  his  language ;  but  he  atoned  so 
sweetly  for  a  passing  heat  of  temper,  that  they  loved 
him  only  the  more.  "  In  WAGNER,"  said  one  of  his 
orchestra  at  Bayreuth,  "  it  is  the  second  movement  that  is 
good." 

His  life  in  Switzerland  was  as  regular  as  it  was  laborious. 
He  rose  at  six — bathed — then  reclined  and  read  till  ten — 
breakfasted — worked  uninterruptedly  from  eleven  till  two — 
dined — rested,  always  with  a  book  in  hand — drove  from  four 
till  six — worked  from  six  till  eight — supped,  and  spent  the 
evening  in  the  midst  of  his  family. 

It  was  in  these  evenings  that  WAGNER  was  most  charm- 


438  WAGNER. 

ing.     Every  cloud   was   cleared    from    his    brow ;   his  face 

seemed  radiant  with  a  certain  light-hearted  good- 
335. 
WAGNER'S   ness  which  diffused  a  happy  atmosphere  around 

r'  him.  He  had  a  kind  word  for  everyone,  he 
entered  into  everything,  and  his  conversation  scintillated 
with  brilliancy  and  humour.  His  boundless  liberality 
sometimes  brought  him  into  pecuniary  difficulties  ;  he  could 
never  bear  to  see  anyone  in  want ;  he  had  known  too  much 
of  it  himself. 

His  poor  relations  took  advantage  of  him.  His  rustic 
family  connections  seemed  to  rise  out  of  the  earth  wherever 
he  stood,  and  claim  his  assistance  or  protection.  They 
would  come  on  a  visit  and  forget  to  leave;  they  would 
drop  in  at  meal-time;  they  would  use  his  name,  order 
things  of  his  tradespeople  and  forget  to  pay,  travel  under 
his  prestige,  and  lodge  at  his  expense. 

His  heart  was  larger  than  his  pocket — his  generosity 
far  exceeded  the  discretion  of  those  who  traded  upon 
it.  A  French  nobleman,  COUNT  GOBINEAU,  said  of  him, 
"  HERR  WAGNER  will  never  be  perfectly  happy,  for  there 
will  always  be  someone  at  his  elbow  whose  suffering  or 
distress  he  will  feel  bound  to  share."  As  a  rule  the 
French  spoke  no  good  of  WAGNER  nor  WAGNER  of  the 
French. 

I  once  spent  an  evening  in  Paris  at  VICTOR  HUGO'S  house. 
It  was  not  long  after  the  Franco-Prussian  War.  The  talk 


VICTOR  HUGO  ON   WAGNER.  439 

ran  on  WAGNER.      The  aged  poet  at  once  turned  the  conver- 
sation.    Somewhat  rashly,  perhaps,  I  ventured  to 

OOO. 

VICTOR  HUGO  say,  "  Surely  in  the  great  republic  of  art  national 

ON  WAGNER.  . .         . ,   .  , 

or  even  personal   antipathies  need   not   count. 
VICTOR  HUGO  cut  me  very  short.     "  Monsieur/'   he  said, 
"  il  a  dit  beaucoup  de   mal  de   mon  pays — il  a  insulte  la 
France.     I  cannot  hear  his  music.'* 


In  some  things  WAGNER  was  as  simple  and  tender  as  a 

child — so  true  is  it  that  there  is  a  child-like  element  in  most 

337.         men  of  genius.     His  agility  was  surprising;   he 

ALIGHT*1'8  was  ^on<^  °^  clirabing  the  trees  in  his  garden. 
HEARTEDNESS.  On  such  occasions  MADAME  WAGNER  would  say 
to  his  friends,  "  I  beseech  you  do  not  look  at  him,  or 
encourage  him,  he  will  only  run  greater  risks  !  " 

When  he  was  up  early,  he  would  go  round  to  the  other 
bed-room  doors  and  wake  the  sleepers  by  intoning  the 
"  Marseillaise "  (he  was  a  shocking  red  republican,  this 
bosom  friend  of  the  King)  to  the  accompaniment  of  what 
has  been  called  the  "  devil's  tattoo/' 

He  was  very  fond  of  animals,  especially  dogs ;  his 
favourite  dog  "Mark"  is  buried  not  far  from  his  own 

grave.       The    Meistersinger    was     arrested     for 
338. 

KINDNESS  TO  months  in  consequence  of  attentions  paid  to  a 
poor  dog  he  had  met  wandering  sick  and  master- 
less.     The  ungrateful  animal  bit  his  hand,  and  for  months 


410  WAGNER. 

WAGNER  was  unable  to  hold  a  pen,  but  the  dog  was  equally 
well  cared  for. 

Like  LISZT,  he  was  a  strong  opponent  of  vivisection, 
and  was  fond  of  quoting  FAUST'S  saying  to  scientific 
•doctors :  "  The  very  dogs  wouldn't  live  in  such  a  world  as 
yours !  " 

When  not  absolutely  absorbed  in  his  work,  he  was  most 

thoughtful   for  others,  and  was  always  planning  for  their 

339.       comfort  and  happiness ;  and,  although  quick  and 

WAGNER'S    Rj.  times  irritable,  he  could  bear  suffering  calmly. 

UNSELFISH- 
NESS.      On  one  occasion  a  lady   remarked  that  he  had 

been  singularly  sweet  and  amiable  all  day  on  a  pleasure 
excursion,  at  a  time  when  he  was  in  actual  physical  suffering 
himself.  He  confessed  at  the  end  that  he  had  felt  very 
unwell,  but  had  tried  to  hide  this  from  those  about  him  for 
fear  of  spoiling  their  enjoyment. 

He  was  naturally  adored  by  his  servants,  who  stayed 
with  him  so  long  that  they  became  like  members  of  the 
family.  He  had  an  extraordinary  power  of  attracting 
people  to  his  person.  There  was  something  irresistibly 
magnetic  about  that  brilliant  eye,  that  noble  penetrating 
look,  that  insatiable  and  unresting  vigour  of  emotion  and 
intellect. 

LISZT,  DE  BULOW,  RICHTER,  WILHELMJ,  and  all  his  staff 
of  artists,  were  absolutely  devoted  to  him,  and  gave  him

and  what  scenery  it  is  !  What  a  dream  of  summer-land 
is  the  moor  and  woodland  in  the  domain  of  Mont  Salvat  ! 
What  a  majestic  and  gorgeous  hall,  of  more  than  Eastern 
magnificence,  is  that  in  which  the  mystery  of  the  Sangrail  is 
enacted  !  What  dim  forests,  what  enchanted  caves,  what 
massive  walls  and  battlements,  what  enchanted  bowers,  what 
more  than  tropical  bloom  and  foliage  !  It  was  long  before 
the  artist  could  satisfy  WAGNER  with  that  magic  garden. 
The  master  would  have  the  flowers  as  large  as  the  girls,  and 
he  would  have  the  girls  exactly  like  the  flowers.  It  was 
difficult;  but  it  is  enough  to  say  that  WAGNER  willed  it, 
and  it  was  done. 

His  influence  with  the  actors  was  supreme;  never  would 
they  have   attempted  for  another  what  they  did  for  him.

at  first  to  face  a  situation  which  appeared  more  fit  for 
acrobats  than  for  dramatic  artists.  They  would  not  get 
into  their  cages  at  all,  until  the  master,  with  tears  in  his 
eyes,  besought  them  to  try,  and  then  all  went  easily,  and 
more  than  well. 


442  WAGNER. 

MADAME  TITIENS  had  scruples  at  first  about  the  Wag- 
nerian  parts  as  unsingable,  but  in  her  latter  days  she  was 
quite  "fanatise"  about  the  part  of  Ortrud,  in  which  she 
was  superb,  and  she  used  to  declare  that  WAGNER'S  roles 
gave  her  the  fullest  and  freest  scope  for  her  vocalisation 
and  acting.  The  singer  SCHNOR,  who  was  identified  with 
the  part  of  Tristram,  when  he  was  told  on  his  death-bed 
of  the  preparations  for  the  performance  of  the  Niebelungen 
Ring  at  Bayreuth,  exclaimed — it  was  his  last  regret — "  Then, 
after  all,  I  shall  never  sing  Siegfried." 

I  confess  I  came  fully  under  WAGNER'S  spell — I  spent  a 

delightful  evening  at  his  house  in  1876.     It  was  at  the  close 

342.       of  the   first    Bayreuth   festival.      All  the  corps 

AN  EVENING  <3ramatic  were  present — RICHTER  the  conductor

HOUSE.  was  chatting  with  WILHELMJ,  the  leader  of  the 
orchestra,  when  I  went  up  to  him  and  asked  him  whether 
he  had  recruited  his  strength  well  at  Nurenberg.  There  a 
few  nights  before  I  had  met  him  in  company  with  PROFESSOR 
ELLA,  and  in  the  quiet  old  city  of  ALBERT  DURER — whither 
he  had  escaped  for  a  rest  between  the  continued  perform- 
ances of  the  Ring — we  had  spent  an  evening  over  a  good 
bottle  of  Rhine  wine,  amid  the  fumes  of  those  detestable 
black  cheroots  which  LISZT  was  so  fond  of. 

Then  I  caught  sight  of  WALTER  BACHE,  who  introduced 
me  to  LISZT  ;  and  presently  RICHTER  took  me  up  and 
presented  me  to  WAGNER. 


AN  EVENING  AT   WAGNER'S  HOUSE.         443 

His  face  beamed  -with  kindness  and  geniality;  he  spoke 
French,  said  he  had  been  in  England  long  long  ago,  and  would 
perhaps  come  again.  He  had  great  doubts  whether  the 
English  were  sufficiently  serious  in  art  ever  to  appreciate  his 
Ring,  and  seemed  pleased  when  I  told  him  of  the  great 
popularity  of  his  music  at  the  Promenade  Concerts,  and  the 
increasing  appreciation  of  Lohengrin  and  Tannhduser. 
"  Earlier  works/'  he  said,  shrugging  his  shoulders. 

And  MATERNA,  the  unique  Briinnhilde,  was  there.  WAG- 
NER had  taken  endless  trouble  in  forming  her  for  the 
Niebelungen  Ring  and  the  great  part  she  was  to  play;  and 
master  and  pupil  always  entertained  the  liveliest  admiration 
and  affection  for  each  other,  which  sometimes  took  an 
amusing  and  demonstrative  form.  That  night,  when  Briinn- 
hilde,  an  immense  woman,  arrived  en  grande  toilette,  and 
wearing  some  of  her  best  jewels,  she  bore  directly  down 
upon  WAGNER — a  spare,  short,  fragile  little  man.  Her 
enormous  bulk  seemed  to  extinguish  him  for  a  moment. 
On  reaching  him  with  difficulty  in  the  midst  of  the 
glittering  crowd  she  embraced  him  rapturously — German 
fashion — with  "Ach,  HERR  WAGNER!  '' 

WAGNER  stood  it  like  a  man ;  but  towards  the  close  of  the 
evening  I  beheld  the  MATERNA  bearing  down  upon  him 
again,  and  as  she  neared  him  he  held  up  both  his  hands 
energetically  repelling  a  second  attack,  "Nein,  nein,  Frau 
MATERNA,  das  will  ich  gar  nicht,''  and  poor  Briinnhilde  had 
to  put  up  with  a  hand -shake  instead. 


444  WAGNER. 

I  saw  him.  again  in  England — it  was  on  that  very  evening 
he  declined  to  go  with  me  to  be  presented  to  a  Royal 
Princess  at  the  house  of  a  well-known  nobleman.  If  I  have 
cause  to  regret  that  circumstance  I  have  also  cause  to 
remember  that  evening  with  some  satisfaction — not  only 
did  I  hear  him  read  one  act  of  his  Parsifal,  but  I  received 
from  him  a  singular  token  of  personal  regard.  I  remember 
LISZT  telling  me  with  some  pride  how  he  had  received  the 
celebrated  "  Kiss  of  BEETHOVEN  " — BEETHOVEN  was  not 
in  the  habit,  it  seems,  of  embracing  people.  I  now  recall 
with  a  feeling  of  singular  satisfaction  the  occasion  on  which 
WAGNER  favoured  me  in  the  same  way,  with  a  kiss. 

He  advanced  towards  me  as  I  suddenly  entered  the  room 
with  "  Ach  mein  lieber  HERR  HAWEIS,  was  haben  Sie  den 
iiber  mich  schon  geschriebcn ! "  and  so  saying,  taking  me 
by  both  elbows,  he  saluted  me  on  both  cheeks  in  the 
orthodox  manner. 

WAGNER'S  friendship  with  the  KING  OF  BAVARIA  had  no 
doubt  contributed  largely  to  the  realization  of  all  his  plans 

during  his  own  life-time.    The  notion  of  building 
343. 
WAGNEB'S   a  special  theatre  where  the  orchestra  should  be 

out  of  sight — the  seats  arranged  tier  above  tier, 
•\vith  a  single  row  of  boxes  and  a  gallery  above  them — had 
been  long  in  his  mind. 

The  King  was  anxious  for  the  theatre  to  be  in  Munich; 
but  the  opposition  of  the  Court,  on  account  of  WAGNER'S 


WAGNER'S  CONDUCTING.  445 

political  opinions,  was  then  too  great.  Later  on  the  hotel- 
keepers  offered  to  build  a  theatre  there  on  their  own 
account,  and  to  carry  out  WAGNER'S  plans  free  of  charge  as 
a  speculation. 

WAGNER  declined.  He  chose  Bayreuth.  He  was  beholden 
to  none  save  the  King  and  his  own  followers.  They  had 
stood  by  him,  rehearsed  his  fame,  produced  his  works,  and 
they  built  his  theatre;  but  every  detail  was  directed  by 
WAGNER,  and  the  perfection  which  the  Bayreuth  perform- 
ances have  at  last  reached  is  due  to  the  same  exhaustive  and 
unremitting  personal  care. 

It  was  only  natural  that  the  master  should  yield  the 
baton  to  a  friend  like  RICHTER,  whose  experience,  physique, 

and  consummate  talent  would  enable  him  to  per-

conduct  some  of  his  own  music  at  the  Albert  Hall.  Some 
said  he  had  already  lost  nerve  as  a  conductor,  and,  indeed, 
had  never  possessed  the  requisite  patience.  That  may  have 
been  to  some  extent  true,  but  it  did  not  strike  me.  I  went 
home  and  wrote  the  following  note,  which  I  see  no  reason 
to  alter  now : 

"  WAGNER'S  notion  is  evidently  not  to  rave,  but  to  com- 
mand, and  to  deal  with  his  men  as  one  who  gives  them 
credit  for  knowing  their  own  business,  instead  of  treating 
tli em  like  a  set  of  raw  recruits,  who  have  to  be  "bullied,

shouted  at,  sworn  to,  and  licked  into  shape  from  end  to 
end.  The  most  intense  power,  concentration,  and  active 
energy  is  often  the  most  silent.  Look  at  the  silent,  irre- 
sistible weight  of  the  fly-wheel  that  drives  the  machinery 
of  a  large  manufactory,  or  the  noiseless  swing  of  the  steam 
hammer,  or  the  intense,  but  silent,  and  apparently  motion- 
less vigour  of  the  poised  eagle,  or  the  rapt  calmness  of  a 
MOLTKE,  who  watches  from  the  hill-side  every  evolution  of 
the  troops  inspired  by  him.  Only  occasionally  does  he 
raise  his  telescope,  pointing  his  hand,  or  sending  out  scouts 
and  subalterns ;  and  in  proportion  as  all  goes  well,  is  fitly 
inspired,  is  the  embodiment  of  his  will — is  he  calm.  So 
the  "  listless ''  WAGNER  sits  and  orders  his  band,  and  they 
know  his  mind  and  obey  his  look,  and  heed  his  smallest 
gesture,  often  even  quite  unperceived  by  the  audience ;  and 
this  worries  the  critics.  "With  the  best  intentions  they  can't 
make  it  out,  who  are  used  to  their  hop,  skip,  and  a  jump, 
and  their  one,  two,  three  and  away  conductors !  Doubtless, 
but  the  old  man  wins." 

A  French  critic  has  since  written:  "WAGNER  plays 
on  the  orchestra  as  though  it  were  a  gigantic  fiddle, 
with  a  firmness  of  touch  which  never  fails  him,  and 
sovereign  authority  before  which  all  are  happy  in  bowing 
down.  To  have  an  idea  of  so  extraordinary  a  conductor, 
one  must  have  seen  him/'  I  do  not  therefore  imply 
that  WAGNER  in  his  last  years  was  fitted  to  go  through 
the  kind  of  drudgery  which  RICHTER  willingly  under-

took,  and  which  culminated   in  the  triumph  of  1876    at 
Bayreuth. 

The  close  of  WAGNER'S  life  was  crowned  by  the  two  great 

Olympian-like  festivals  in  1876  and  1882.     The  Memorial 

845.        Festival   in  1883  was   his  requiem ;   whilst  the 

1118        whole  of  the  city  was  resounding  with  his  name 

FESTIVALS  * 

OF  187G-82.  an(j  fame^  the  great  master's  body  lay  at  rest  in 
a  funereal  bower  adjoining  the  Neue  Schloss.  The  event 
of  1876  was,  I  suppose,  unprecedented  in  the  annals  of 
Modern  Art.  I  have  devoted  to  it  a  separate  notice.  It 
was  my  privilege  to  witness  the  first  unfolding  of  those 
four  colossal  musical  dramas  of  the  Nibelung's  Ring  on 
the  Bayreuth  stage.  People  had  assembled  from  all  parts 
of  the  civilised  world;  kings,  princes,  and  nobles  mingled 
in  that  motley  throng.  The  dramas  lasted  every  day  from 
four  till  ten,  with  intervals  of  an  hour  between  the  acts. 
The  whole  population  lived  only  in  the  life  of  that  great 
cycle  of  tragedies  in  which  gods,  demi-gods,  and  mortals 
acted  out,  with  more  than  earthly  intensity,  the  perennially 
interesting  dramas  of  human  life  and  passion. 

It  was  between  the  Festival  of  1876  at  Bayreuth,  and  the 

346.        performance  of  Parsifal  in  1882,  that  WAGNEII

exertion  not  directly  bearing  upon  his  work — which  was 
the  new  Parsifal  drama.  He  was  not  satisfied  with  his 
reception  at  the  Albert  Hall.  He  was  much  courted  in 
society,  but  avoided  anything  like  public  receptions,  and  was 
considered  over-retiring  and  reticent  by  casual  observers. 

The  WAGNER  furor  being  now  on  the  increase  after  his 
departure,  the  two  principal  London  theatres  were  opened 
in  the  spring  and  summer  of  1880— Covent  Garden  for 
the  performance  of  the  Nibelung's  Ring,  and  Drury  Lane 
for  the  presentation  of  all  his  other  operas  seriatim. 
Neither  proved  a  commercial  success,  the  market  being 
thus  quite  over-stocked.  But  the  WAGNER  excitement  was 
still  on  the  increase,  and  when  the  Parsifal  came  to  be  pro- 
duced at  Bayreuthin  1882,  Bayreuth  was  as  thronged  as  in 
1876.  I  was  not  present  at  that  festival,  but  I  have  given 
a  special  account  of  the  Memorial  performance  which  I 
attended  in  the  following  year. 

WAGNER  died  suddenly  on   the  13th  of  February  1883, 

at  Venice.,  whither  he  had  come  to  recruit  after  the  Parsifal 

performances  in  1882,  and  to  prepare  for  their 

renewal  in   the    following    year.      He   was   cut

off  in  the  full  vigour  of  his  productive  genius. 
Time  had  not  dimmed  his  eye,  nor  shaken  his  hand,  nor 
closed  a  single  channel  of  thought  or  emotion.  He  sank 
thus  suddenly  in  the  spring  of  the  year  1883,  not  without 
Borne  warning,  yet  enjoying  life  up  to  its  latest  hour.  "  I

bear  no  longer  the  grey  clouds  and  wintry  skies  of 
Bayreuth,"  he  had  said  to  his  friends  in  the  autumn  of  1882. 
A  suite  of  apartments  in  the  Palace  Vendramin  at  Venice 
had  been  secured  for  him,  and  his  children — DANIEL,  EVA, 
ISOLDE,  and  SIEGFRIED  (now  twelve  years  old)  were  already 
there.  Venice  was  in  the  greatest  excitement  on  his  arrival. 
Italy  had  been  in  the  strangest  way  won  over  to  WAGNER 
at  Bologna,  under  the  able  and  enthusiastic  baton  of  a  la- 
mented Maestro ;  indeed,  LISZT  told  me  he  had  never  heard 
WAGNER'S  operas  more  effectively  given,  except  at  Bayreuth. 

It  was  WAGNER'S  desire  to  be  left  quiet  at  Venice,  and 

his  wishes  were  sedulously  respected ;   but   he   was   never

WAGNER    rose    in    Italy   at    Venice    between    five   and 
six,  and  worked  till  ten.     In  Venice  he  wrote

Aryan  legends,  the  German  prints  declared  that  he  had 
turned  his  attention  towards  Greece,  and  was  going  to 
Athens  to  try  and  recover  on  the  spot  something  connected 
with  the  ancient  Greek  music.  At  the  same  time  he  was 
indefatigable  in  his  efforts  to  prepare  for  the  repetitions  of 
Parsifal  in  1883,  at  which  he  intended  to  be  present  and 
which  were  carried  out  at  Bayreuth  with  such  magnificent 
success — July  1883 — in  sad  memory  of  his  death. 

He  was  already  suffering  from  heart-disease,  and  sat 
usually — the  weather  being  chilly — in  his  fur  coat.  A  glass 
of  wine  was  always  at  hand,  and  when  he  suffered  pain  he 
would  sip  cognac. 

His  rooms,  however,  before  breakfast  were  sacred,  and  his 
wife  COSIMA  scrupulously  respected  them  ;  but  at  ten  o'clock 
sbe  went  in  to  bring  him  his  letters,  and  after  a  short 
private  chat  the  family  breakfasted  together.  WAGNER  would 
then  take  his  hat  and  go  down  the  marble  steps  looking 
out  upon  the  canal,  and  ask  his  gondolier  about  the  weather. 
If  too  cold  to  venture  out  he  would  stroll  forth,  often  with 
his  wife,  and  go  into  LAVENNA'S,  the  pastrycook's,  and  buy 
bon-bons  for  the  children. 

Between  four  and  six  o'clock  he  might  often  be  seen  in 
the   arcades   and   streets,   with   all    the   family,

HIS  AFTERNOON.  451 

the  great  square  had  produced  a  version  of  the  Lohen- 
grin overture  in  his  honour,  but  played  it  in  such  fashion 
that  poor  WAGNER  was  constrained  to  take  refuge  in 
the  pastrycook's  shop  and  stop  his  ears  with  both 
hands. 

On  another  occasion,  however,  he  went  up  to  the  band- 
master, in  his  great  coat  and  slouched  hat,  and  asked  him 
to  play  something  out  of  ROSSINI'S  Gazza  Ladra.  The  con- 
ductor, not  recognising  WAGNER,  answered  civilly  that  he 
had  none  of  the  music  there,  and  otherwise  could  not  well 
derange  the  programme.  On  WAGNER  retiring  a  musician 
told  the  bandmaster  who  the  stranger  was.  Filled  with 
confusion  and  regret,  the  worthy  man  instantly  sent  for 
copies  of  the  Gazza  Ladra  selection,  and  played  it  for  two 
consecutive  days.  WAGNER  was  much  pleased,  and,  again 
going  up  to  the  band,  expressed  his  thanks,  and  praised 
especially  the  solo  cornet,  who  had  much  distinguished 
himself. 

The  master  dined  early  in  the  afternoon,  and  usually  took 
a  short  nap  afterwards,  the  faithful  BETTY  BURKEL,  a  confi- 
dential family  servant,  always  being  at  hand  in  the  next 
room,  knitting  quietly. 

At  half -past  three  the  gondolier  was  usually  in  attend- 
ance, and  in  fine  weather  the  Lido,  the  public  gardens,  the 
San  Lazzaro,  and  Giudecca  were  visited. 


In  the   milder  autumn   days   of   1882,  WAGNER,  whose

say    drawing  a  long  breath  : 

AND  BYRON  *  ' 

LOVE  LIGHT.  «  I)O  smoke,  no  dust  !  "  At  night  his  sitting- 
rooms  were  a  blaze  of  light  with  quantities  of  wax-candles. 
People  used  to  look  up  at  BYRON'S  quarters  when  he  was  in 
Venice,  and  wonder  what  festival  could  be  going  on.  The 
waters  of  the  Grand  Canal  were  all  aglow,  but  it  was  only 
BYRON,  alone  with  the  MSS.  of  Manfred,  Parisina,  and 
Don  Juan.  WAGNER'S  old  porter  happened  to  be  brother 
to  BYRON'S  old  servant,  FIDO.  "  There  is  something  like 
BYRON  about  this  great  German,"  he  remarked.  "  What  is 
that  ?  ''  they  asked.  "  Why,  he  has  the  same  marvellous 
need  of  wax  candles  !  "  "  Where  light  is  there  is  joy/* 
WAGNER  used  to  say,  quoting  the  Italian  proverb. 

As  the  evenings  drew  in,  WAGNER  used  to  read  aloud  to 
his  family  —  usually  from  some  dramatic  author.  He  some- 
times got  so  excited  that  the  good  people  in  the  house 
knocked  at  the  door  to  know  if  anything  ailed  the  master? 

When  absorbed  in  thought,  he  was  in  the  habit  of  pacing 
up  and  down  the  room,  with  his  hands  behind  him.  He 
even  had  pockets  made  at  the  back  of  his  coat.  DR.  KEP- 
TLER  said  this  position  of  the  arms  allowed  him  to  breathe 
more  freely,  and  eased  the  diseased  action  of  the  heart. 

On  November  19,  1882,  LISZT  came  to  see  him  at  Venice.

LISZT'S  VISIT  who  had  painted  the  Parsifal  scenery,  and  for 
whom  the  genius  of  WAGNER  had  an  irresistible 
attraction,  was  also  there.  He  painted  a  remarkable  por- 
trait of  LISZT,  and  a  "  Sacred  Family  "  of  JESUS,  JOSEPH, 
and  MARY.  The  guardian  angels  in  the  air  above  were 
all  portraits  of  WAGNER'S  children. 

LISZT  was  usually  up  at  four  o'clock,  and  both  WAGNER 
and  LISZT  got  through  a  great  deal  of  serious  work  in  those 
small  hours. 


WAGNER'S  personal  popularity  at  Venice  was  extraordi- 
nary.    In  a  short  time  he  and  every  member  of  his  family 
353.        were  known  even   to  the   children  of  the  poor.

or  with  little  EVA,  his  pet  daughter,  or  SIEGFRIED.  He 
mixed  with'  the  people,  chatted  and  joked,  and  was  ever 
ready  to  relieve  the  poor.  He  was  worshipped  by  his  gon- 
doliers. "He  patted  me  on  the  back,"  said  one,  "asked 
me  if  I  was  tired,  and  said  '  Amico  mio,  so  the  Carnival  has 
come  to  an  end.' "  The  man  repeated  the  incident  every- 
where, as  if  it  had  been  the  great  event  of  his  life.  "  They 
say  he  is  greater  than  a  king ;  isn't  it  so  ? "  (Egli  e  piu

streets  as  he  passed. 


454  WAGNER. 

On  December  23,  1882,  WAGNER   conducted  his  earliest 

symphony  at  the  request  of  a   small    circle  of  friends  in 

354.        celebration  of  MADAME  WAGNER'S  birthday.     On 

STRANGE    taking  the  baton  he  turned  to  the  musicians  and 
- 


"•This  is  the  last  time  I  shall  ever  conduct.'* 

"Why?"  they  asked. 

"  Because  I  shall  soon  die." 

This  was  not  at  all  his  usual  mood  ;  he  spoke  sometimes 
of  living  till  ninety  —  he  said  that  he  could  hardly  finish 
the  work  he  had  in  his  mind  even  then.  His  doctor  knew 
that  his  heart-disease  must  one  day  carry  him  off,  but  hoped 
the  end  might  be  delayed  for  five  or  six  years  at  least.  He 
was  very  sanguine  himself,  but  not  ^over-prudent.  He  took 
too  much  tea  and  coffee  and  stimulant;  he  was  deaf  to 
all  warnings,  and  joked  on  the  doctors  forbidding  their 
patients  to  indulge  in  these  things  without  setting  them  a 
good  example.  But  there  were  moments  when  his  words, 
spoken  lightly,  were  unconsciously  prophetic  of  the  coming 
end.  He  had  taken  the  utmost  delight  in  the  Carnival  of 
1883  at  Venice,  and  on  the  first  day  of  Lent  said  to  his 
gondolier,  "And  where  is  it  the  fashion  to  go  to-day?" 
"To  the  new  necropolis,  my  gracious  master,"  replied 
the  man.  Arrived  at  the  necropolis,  WAGNER  alighted 
and  walked  all  over  the  place,  admiring  the  quiet  and 
reposeful  niches  and  the  tastefully  laid-out  lawns  and 
shrubberies. 


THE  APPROACH  OF  DEATH. 

"  And  was  my  worshipful  sir  pleased  ?  "  asked  the  gondo- 
lier. 

"  Yes.  uncommonly,"  replied  WAGNER  ;  "  and  I  shall  soon 
find  some  such  quiet  spot  for  my  own  last  resting-place." 

Indeed,  there  were  mornings  when  he  would  go  out  and 

return  breathless  in  ten  minutes.     Once   at  his   banker's, 

355.        and  again  at  the  pastrycook's,  he  was  seized  with 

THE        faintness  and  put  into  his  gondola.     He  urgently 

OF  DEATH,  begged  that  his  family  might  not  be  told  of  this. 

They  had  their  own  misgivings.     When  alone  he  had  been 

overheard  groaning,  and  was  found  sometimes  with  his  hand 

pressed  to  his  heart;  but  he  would  rally  and  make  light  of 

it,  and  soon   seemed  quite  well  again ;  indeed,  on  the  12th 

(he  died  on  the  13th)  he  said  he  felt  better  than  he  had  done 

for  weeks — the  breathing  was  freer  and  the  pulse  regular. 

February  13th  came  black  with  clouds.  The  rain  poured 
in  torrents.  WAGNER  rose  as  usual,  and  announced  his 
wish  not  to  be  disturbed  till  dinner-time,  two  o'clock.  He 
had  much  to  do — much  to  finish — overmuch  indeed,  and 
the  time  was  short. 

The  master  did  not  feel  quite  well,  and  COSIMA,  his  wife, 
bade  BETTY,  the  servant,  take  her  work  and  not  leave  the 
ante-room  in  case  her  master  should  call  or  ring. 

The  faithful  creature  seemed  to  have  some  presentiment 
that  all  was  not  right.  She  listened  hour  after  hour — heard 
the  master  striding  up  and  down  as  was  his  wont. 


WAGNER. 

"Wife  COSIMA  came  in  from  time  to  time.  "The  master 
works  ever/*  said  BETTY,  "  and  has  not  called  for  anything 
— now  he  walks  to  and  fro." 

At  one  o'clock  WAGNER  rang  his  bell  and  asked :  "  Is  the 
gondola  ordered  at  four  o'clock  ?  Good  ;  then  I  will  take  a 
plate  of  soup  up  here,  for  I  don't  feel  very  well." 

There  was  nothing  unusual  about  this,  for  when  absorbed 
in  work  he  would  often  thus  have  his  light  luncheon 
alone. 

The  servant  brought  in  a  plate  of  soup  and  retired.     All 

seemed  quiet  for  some  time.        Then  suddenly  a  hurried 

pacing  up  and  down  the  room  was  heard.     The 

footsteps  ceased — a  sharp  cough,  checked.    BETTY

threw  down  her  work,  walked  on  tip-toe  to  the 
door,  and  listened  with  all  her  ears.  She  heard  one  deep 
groan;  she  stood  for  a  moment  divided  between  a  resolve 
to  call  CosiMA  or  break  through  her  master's  orders  and 
go  into  his  room  at  once.  The  suspense  was  soon  over. 
"BETTY!"  It  was  WAGNER'S  voice,  very  faint.  BETTY 
rushed  in.  WAGNER  was  leaning  back  on  his  sofa,  his  fur 
coat  was  half  off,  his  feet  rested  on  a  foot-stool.  His  face 
was  fearfully  changed — his  features  cadaverous  and  drawn 
down  with  pain  evidently  ;  with  the  utmost  difficulty  he 
contrived  to  murmur,  but  almost  inaudibly,  "Call  my  wife 
and  the  doctor."  He  never  spoke  again. 

The  terrified  BETTY  rushed  off  to  tell  wife  COSIMA.     The

instant  she  saw  him  she  cried,  "  To  the  doctor,  BETTY  !  " 
DR.  KEPPLER  was  sent  for  three  times ;  at  last  he  was  found 
just  finishing  an  operation.  Meanwhile  MADAME  WAGNER  had 
sat  down  by  her  husband.  He  immediately  laid  his  head  on 
her  shoulder,  groaning,  but  speechless ;  and  she  placed  her 
arms  about  him,  and  with  one  hand  rubbed  his  heart,  an  act 
which  had  sometimes  eased  him  when  in  pain.  His  breath- 
ing grew  softer  and  lighter,  and  presently  he  seemed  to 
subside  into  a  quiet,  motionless  sleep.  She  thought  it  a 
good  sign. 

About  half  an  hour  afterwards  the  doctor  came.  One 
glance  was  enough.  He  found  MADAME  WAGNER  still 
holding  her  husband  in  both  her  arms,  with  his  head 
resting  on  her  shoulder.  "  He  sleeps,"  she  said — and  the 
good  doctor,  suppressing  his  emotion  with  a  great  effort,  did 
not  tell  her  that  it  was  the  sleep  of  death,  and  that  now  for 
a  long  time  she  had  been  embracing  a  corpse. 

DK.  KEPPLER,  after  feeling  for  the  pulse  that  was  never 
to  beat  again,  gently  took  the  body  of  WAGNER  in  both  his 
arms  and  carried  it  to  his  bed.  It  could  not  be  called  his 
death-bed,  for  WAGNER  died  as  he  had  lived,  working — the 
table  before  him  was  strewn  with  books  and  MSS.,  with  the 
ink  scarcely  dry  upon  the  last  page. 

DR.  KEPPLER  then  turned  to  COSIMA  and  said,  with  irre- 
pressible emotion,  "  He  is  dead  !  "  The  poor  wife,  who  had 
been  so  absolutely  one  in  body,  soul,  and  mind  with  her 
husband,  fell  prostrate  with  a  great  cry  upon  his  lifeless 


458  WAGNER. 

body,  nor  for  some  time  could  any  persuasion  induce  her  to 
leave  the  corpse  which  she  continued  to  embrace. 

But  over    the  intense  sorrow   of  this  true-hearted    and 

affectionate   German   family   I   will   draw    the   veil.      The 

357.       servants  all  seemed  to  lose  their  heads.     A  vast

through  Venice  "  RICHARD  WAGNER  is  very  ill — the  doctor 
is  at  his  bed-side/'  No  more  than  this  was  known  in  the 
town  at  half-past  four.  At  half- past  five  DR.  KEPPLER 
came  down  the  steps  and  was  greeted  with  shouts  of  "  The 
doctor  !  the  doctor  !  "  In  the  dead  silence  which  followed, 
DR.  KEPPLER,  uncovering  his  head,  said,  "RICHARD  WAGNER 
is  dead.  He  died  an  hour  ago  from  the  effects  of  heart 
disease." 

No  sooner  had  DR.  KEPPLER  pronounced  the  words 
"  RICHARD  WAGNER  is  dead ! "  from  the  steps  of  the 
"  Vendramin  Palace,"  than  the  vast  throng  assembled  out- 
side to  hear  the  news  dispersed  with  cries  of  "  Dead !  dead  !  " 
and  in  a  short  time  there  was  note  a  cafe  in  Venice  without 
the  bulletin  "  Eiccardo  Wagner,  il  famoso  tedesco,  il  gran 
Maestro  del  Vendramin,  b  morto"  It  was  commonly  said 
that  since  GARIBALDI'S  death  no  such  sensation  had  been 
felt  in  Venice.

"And  now  he  must  needs  die — Per  Bacco !  Poor  dear

which  had  become  a  pet  of  WAGNER'S,  having  been  rescued 
by  him  from  an  untimely  end  in  the  canal.  "  See,"  he 
would  say,  "  even  this  kitten  he  saved  from  drowning  two 
months  ago  knows  what  it  has  lost.  It  will  hardly  move ; 
it  lies  always  here  in  the  gondola,  just  behind  where  the 
master  used  to  sit." 

Ill  news  in  these  days  of  telegraphy  flies  indeed  apace. 

The  wires  were  blocked.     In  the  course  of  the  week  no 

less  than  five  thousand  despatches  of  condolence

from  all  parts  of  the  civilised  world. 

Soon  after  death  WAGNER'S  body  was  embalmed  by  his 
devoted  medical  attendant,  DR.  KEPPLER,  and  a  cast  of  his 
face  was  taken  by  SIGNOR  BENVENUTO. 

The  bronze  coffin,  which  arrived  from  Vienna,  was  carried 


460  WAGNER. 

upstairs  by  HANS  RICHTER,  the  painter  JOUKOVSKY,  DR. 
KEPPLER,  PASSINI,  and  RUBEN;  and  the  dead  master  was 
borne  to  his  funereal  gondola  by  the  same  devoted  friends. 
The  general  expressions  of  sympathy  were  confined  to  no 
class. 

The  Italian  Government  had  offered  the  family  a  public 
ceremony,  which  was  declined ;  yet  I  know  not  what  greater 
honour  could  have  been  paid  him  than  the  spontaneous 
grief  of  all  Venice.  The  high  municipal  officers,  the  chief 
nobles,  and  an  immense  throng  accompanied  the  gondola  to 
the  station.  The  canals  were  crowded  with  gondolas  draped 
in  crape. 

In  all  the  ports  through  which  the  coffin  passed  the  flags 
floated  half-mast  high.  At  every  town  where  there  was  a 
stoppage  the  municipalities  sent  deputations,  and  the  coffin 
was  strewn  with  fresh  flowers. 

At  the  head  of  the  bier  there  was  one  enormous  wreath, 
sent  by  the  KING  OF  BAVARIA,  WAGNER'S  close  friend,  and 
at  Munich  the  King  sent  his  representative  to  accompany 
tne  funeral  cortege  to  Bayreuth. 

I  will  not  dwell  further  upon  the  honours  paid  by  the 
way,  the  processions  of  musical  societies,  the  numberless 
wreaths,  which  by  the  time  the  coffin  reached  Bayreuth 
amounted  to  fourteen  hundred  and  filled  two  large 
cars. 

On  the  17th  the  bier  was  received  at  the  station  by  the

inhabitants  of  Bayreuth  en  masse.    It  was  a  solemn  moment 

360.         when  the  widow  and  her  children  stepped  out  of

A  brigade  of  firemen  moved  in  front  of  the  hearse,  which 
was  drawn  by  four  black  horses.  All  the  gas  lamps  were 
lighted  along  the  road,  and  black  pennons  streamed  from 
tall  poles  to  right  and  left.  Midway  a  fresh  wreath  arrived 
from  the  king  with  a  large  inscription,  "  To  the  Deathless 
One,"  and  at  the  same  time  the  burgomaster  laid  another 
one  on  the  coffin  in  the  name  of  the  city  of  Bayreuth. 

Arrived  at  WAGNER'S  house,  f'Vahufried" — only  a  select 
company  were  admitted  to  the  garden — the  coffin  rested  for 
a  space  at  the  entrance,  but  was  not  taken  into  the 
house. 

It  was  MADAME  WAGNER'S  express  wish  that  no  speeches 
or  prayers  should  be  made  at  the  grave — which  had  long 
since  been  dug,  by  WAGNER'S  orders,  in  a  retired  spot  of 
his  own  garden,  surrounded  by  thick  bushes  and  fir-trees. 
A  simple  blessing  in  the  name  of  the  Church  was  to  be 
given,  and  the  coffin  then  lowered  in  silence. 

An  immense  slab  of  grey  polished  granite  rested  above 
it,  and  the  vault  door  was  to  be  opened  on  one

side.     Hither  was  the  body  now  brought  by  a

many  more.  On  either  side  walked  WAGNER'S  children, 
and  when  the  coffin  was  about  to  be  slid  into  the  grave, 
they  mounted  on  the  grey  slab  above  it  and  knelt 
down. 

At  this  moment  WAGNER'S  two  favourite  dogs  burst 
through  the  thickets,  and  sprang  towards  the  children  to 
seek  their  usual  caresses — they,  too,  had  lost  a  kind  master, 
but  they  knew  it  not. 

Then  HERR  CASELMANN,  in  the  simplest  words,  com- 
mitted the  departed,  and  all  his  family,  to  the  care  of 
CHRIST,  and  blessed  the  assembly  and  the  grave  in  the 
name  of  the  Church.  This  was  all  in  exact  accordance 
with  MADAME  WAGNER'S  wishes.  A  few  took  a  leaf  or  a 
flower  as  it  fell  from  the  piled-up  heap,  and  the  body  was 
lowered  silently  into  its  last  resling-place — earth  to  earth — 
dust  to  dust !

I   visited   Bayreuth    on    the    24th    of   July,    1883,   and 

attended  two  crowded  performances  of  WAGNEE'S  last  work, 

362.        Parsifal.     In    the    morning    I    went    into    the

WAGNER  S

couple  of  swans  and  innumerable  water-lilies,  the  long 
park-like  avenues  of  trees  are  vocal  with  wild  doves,  and 
the  robin  is  heard  in  the  adjoining  thickets.  At  my 
approach  the  sweet  song  ceases  abruptly,  and  the  startled 
bird  flies  out,  scattering  the  pale  petals  of  the  wild  roses 


I  VISIT   WAGNER'S   GRAVE.  463 

upon  my  path.  I  follow  a  stream  of  people  on  foot,  as 
they  move  down  the  left-hand  avenue  in  the  garden  of  the 
Neue  Schloss,  which  adjoins  WAGNER'S  own  grounds. 

Some  are  going — some  are  coming.  Presently  I  see  an 
opening  in  the  bushes  on  my  left ;  the  path  leads  me  to  a 
clump  of  evergreens.  I  follow  it,  and  come  suddenly  on  the 
great  composer's  grave.  All  about  the  green  square  mound 
the  trees  are  thick — laurel,  fir,  and  yew.  The  shade  falls 
funereally  across  the  immense  grey  granite  slab;  but  over 
the  dark  foliage  the  sky  is  bright  blue,  and  straight  in  front 
of  me,  above  the  low  bushes,  I  can  see  the  bow-windows 
of  the  dead  master's  study — where  I  spent  with  him  one 
delightful  evening  in  1876. 

I  can  see,  too,  the  jet  of  water  that  he  loved  playing  high 
above  the  hedge  of  evergreen.  It  lulls  me  with  its  sound. 
"  Vahnfried !  Vahnfried  ! "  it  seems  to  murmur.  It  was 
the  word  written  above  the  master's  house — the  word  he 
most  loved; — the  word  his  tireless  spirit  most  believed  in — 
how  shall  I  render  it  ?  "  Dream-life  !  dream-life  !  Earth's 
illusion  of  joy  ! " 

Great  spirit !  thy  dream-life  here  is  past,  and  face  to  face 
with  truth,  "rapt  from  the  fickle  and  the  frail,"  for  thee 
the  illusion  has  vanished!  Mayst  thou  also  know  the 
fulness  of  joy  in  the  unbroken  and  serene  activities  of 
the  eternal  Reality ! 

I  visited  the  grave  twice.  There  is  nothing  written  on 
the  granite  slab.  There  were  never  present  less  than  twenty 


4b4.  WAGNER, 

persons,  and  a  constant  stream  of  pilgrims  kept  coming  and 
going. 

One  gentle  token  of  the  master's  pitiful  and  tender  regard 
for  the  faithful  dumb  animals  he  so  loved  lies  but  a  few  feet 
off  in  the  same  garden,  and  not  far  from  his  own  grave. 

Upon  a  mossy  bank,  surrounded  with  evergreens,  is  a 
small  marble  slab,  with  this  inscription  to  his  favourite 
dog: — 

"  Here  lies  in  peace  '  Vahnfried's '  faithful  watcher  and 
friend — the  good  and  beautiful  Mark  "  (der  gute,  schone 
Mark) ! 

I  returned,  too,  to  WAGNER'S  tomb,  plucked  a  branch  of 
the  fir  tree  that  waved  above  it,  and  went  back  to  my  room 
to  prepare  myself  by  reading  and  meditation  for  the  great 
religious  drama  which  I  was  to  witness  at  four  o'clock  in  the 
afternoon — WAGNER'S  latest  and  highest  inspiration — the 
story  of  the  sacred  brotherhood,  the  knights  of  San  Graal — 
Parsifal!

INTERLUDE 

ON    THE    LAST    CROWN. 

WAGNER    worked    at    Parsifal   with    incredible   speed,   but 
with  that  extraordinary  elaboration  of  detail  which  he  him- 
self declared  taxed  his  brain  to  the  utmost.     He 
363. 

ELABORATE  sometimes  complained  that  he  could  employ  no 

BOOKING.  L    1          !•  J  L    1  •  j.1 

one  to  help  him  adequately  in  scoring  the 
parts.  Nothing  ever  satisfied  him  unless  he  did  it  himself. 
As  he  advanced  the  toil  increased.  He  would  say  that  even 
the  score  of  Lohengrin — in  which  he  had  not  yet  sounded 
all  the  resources  of  the  orchestral  art — was  light  work  in 
comparison  with  such  an  effort  as  Parsifal.  He  laboured  at 
this  with  great  love  and  tireless  zeal.  He  often  declared 
that  it  would  be  his  last  work,  although  his  busy  brain,  at 
"Venice,  was  already  revolving  new  fields  of  thought — new 
worlds  to  conquer.

4GG  ON  THE   LAST  CEOWN. 

His  friends  noticed  with  anxiety  that  failing  freshness  and 
vigour  of  body — not  of  mind — pathetic  traces  of  which  are 

noticeable   in   that   last    very    fine    photograph 
364. 
LAST       (profile)  of  which  I  give  a  woodcut,  and  which 

H'  has  been  engraved  in  most  of  the  memoirs  since 
published.  The  expression  of  the  countenance  is  softened. 
It  is  the  face  of  a  man  who  has  done  with  fighting  and 
escaped  defeat,  but  is  left  with  a  certain  weariness  of  spirit. 

Still,  the  last  year  of  WAGNER'S  life  was  full  of  halcyon 
days;  his  sun  went  down  in  a  sky  of  unclouded  serenity. 
He  had  won  more  than  all  he  could  have  expected  to  win ; 
for  in  the  early  days  he  had  often  said  in  despair,  "  I  shall 
never  make  my  ideas  understood  " — and  he  lived  to  see  the 
mighty  conceptions  of  his  genius  realised. 

His  farewell  banquet  at  Bayreuth  after  the  Parsifal 
festival  in  1882  was  a  dignified  and  touching  adieu  to

S^SEZ°TH^®Y  again.  Something  has  been  said  about  a  feeling 
WAGNEK.  Of  rivalry  between  LISZT  and  WAGNER  in  the 
last  days.  Nothing  could  be  more  false  and  unfounded. 
"WAGNER  a  fait  un  autre  miracle,"  said  LISZT,  when  hs 
attended  the  rehearsals  of  Parsifal  in  1882,  and  WAGNER'S 
affectionate  speech  in  answer  to  the  glowing  language  in 
which  LISZT  proposed  his  health  at  the  great  banquet  held 
afterwards,  showed  very  well  how  deep  and  indissoluble  was 
the  nature  of  their  friendship.  When  LISZT  sat  down 


SPEECHES  BY  LISZT  AND    WAGNER.         467 

amidst  loud  acclamations,  WAGNER  rose,  and  in  the  follow- 
ing simple  and  unaffected  words  recalled  all  he  owed  to 
LISZT  : 

"  On  this  day,  when  the  preparations  for  the  performances 
of  my  last  work  are  completed ;  when,  thanks  to  this  con- 
course of  eminent  artists,  I  may  look  with  pleasure  and 
pride  on  the  achievement,  I  feel  myself  called  upon  to 
speak,  to  all  of  you  assembled  here  at  my  invitation,  of  the 
influence  that  this  exceptional  and  unique  man  has  had  on 
my  whole  artistic  career.  At  a  time  when — as  they  say  in 
Germany — I  was  a  most  distinctly  repudiated  '  Mossoo/ 
LISZT  came  forward — LISZT,  who  had  evolved  from  his 
innermost  consciousness  a  profound  comprehension  of  my- 
self and  my  work.  He  said  to  me,  '  Thou  man  of  Art,  I 
believe  in  thee/  and  so  he  became  the  bridge  that  led  me 
from  one  world  to  another — from  the  inner  world,  I  mean, 
into  which  I  had  unreservedly  retired,  into  the  outer  world 
on  whose  discerning  judgment  the  creative  artist  has  to 
depend,  and  in  which,  at  that  time,  every  hand  was  against 
me.  He  it  is  that  sustained  and  uplifted  me  as  no  other 
did.  I  call  upon  you  to  drink  to  the  health  of  F.  LISZT." 

When  WAGNER,  in  the  autumn  of  1882,  left  the  cloudy 
skies  of  Bayreuth  for  sunny  Italy,  he  also  left  the  scene  of 
his  triumphs,  which  he  was  never  to  revisit  alive.  In  the 
spring  of  the  following  year,  as  I  have  related,  his  body 
was  brought  back  and  laid  in  his  garden  at  Bayreuth,  and 
in.  the  July  following  I  went  to  Bayreuth  to  be  present  at

the  repetition  of  the  Parsifal  performances,  every  detail  of 
which  WAGNER  had  superintended  in  the  previous  year.  I 
shall  never  see  the  like  again — the  glow  of  the  master's 
spirit  was  still  upon  the  actors,  the  musicians,  and  the 
audience. 


IV. 
PARSIFAL. 

THE  blood  of  God  ! — mystic  symbol  of  Divine  life — "for  the 
blood  is  the  life  thereof."     That  is  the  key-note  of  Parsifal, 

the  Knight  of  the  Sangrail.     Wine  is  the  ready 
THE  MYSTIC  symbolical   vehicle  —the   material   link    between 

the  divine  and  the  human  life.  In  the  old  reli- 
gions, that  heightened  consciousness,  that  intensity  of  feeling 
produced  by  stimulant,  was  thought  to  be  the  very  entering 
in  of  the  "  god  " — the  union  of  the  Divine  and  human 
spirit ;  and  in  the  Eleusinian  mysteries,  the  "  sesame " — 
the  bread  of  Demeter,  the  earth  mother ;  the  "  kykeon," 
or  wine  of  Dionysos — the  vine  god — were  thus  sacra- 
mental. 

The  passionate  desire  to  approach  and  mingle  with  Deity 
is   the   one  mystic  bond   common   to  all   religions  in  all 


THE  MYSTIC    UNION.  4G9 

lands.  It  is  the  "  cry  of  the  human " :  it  traverses 
the  ages,  it  exhausts  many  symbols  and  transcends  all 
forms. 

To  the  Christian  it  is  summed  up  in  the  "Lord's 
Supper/' 

The  mediaeval  legend  of  the  Sangrail  (real  or  royal  blood) 
is  the  most  poetic  and  pathetic  form  of  transubstantiation — 
in  it  the  gross  materialism  of  the  Roman  Mass  almost  ceases 
to  be  repulsive;  it  possesses  the  true  legendary  power  of 
attraction  and  assimilation. 

As  the  Knights  of  the  Table  Round,  with  their  holy 
vows,  provided  mediaeval  Chivalry  with  a  centre,  so  did  the 
Lord's  table,  with  its  Sangrail,  provide  Mediaeval  Religion 
with  its  central  attractive  point.  And  as  all  marvellous 
tales  of  knightly  heroism  circled  round  King  Arthur's 
table,  so  did  the  great  legends  embodying  the  Christian 
conceptions  of  sin,  punishment,  and  redemption  circle  round 
the  Sangrail  and  the  sacrifice  of  the  "  Mass/' 

In  the  legends  of  Parsifal  and  Lohengrin,  the  knightly 
and  religious  elements  are  welded  together.  This  is 
enough.  We  need  approach  Parsifal  with  no  deep  know- 
ledge of  the  various  Sagas  made  use  of  by  WAGNER  in 
his  drama.  His  disciples,  whilst  most  eager  to  trace  its 
various  elements  to  their  sources,  are  most  emphatic  in 
declaring  that  the  Parsifal  drama,  so  intimately  true  to 
the  spirit  of  Roman  Catholicism,  is  nevertheless  a  new 
creation. 


470  PARSIFAL. 

JOSEPH  OF  ARIMATHEA  received  in  a  crystal  cup  the  blood 

of  CHRIST  as  it  flowed  from  the  spear-wound  made  by  the 

Roman   soldier.     The   cup   and  the   spear  were 

367<       committed  to  Titurel,  who  became  a  holy  knight 

MONTSALVAT. 

and  head  of  a  sacred  brotherhood  of  knights. 
They  dwelt  in  the  Vizigoth  Mountains  of  Southern  Spain, 
where,  amidst  impenetrable  forests,  rose  the  legendary 
palace  of  Montsalvat.  Here  they  guarded  the  sacred  relics, 
issuing  forth  at  times  from  their  palatial  fortress,  like 
Lohengrin,  to  fight  for  innocence  and  right,  and  always 
returning  to  renew  their  youth  and  strength  by  the  celestial 
contemplation  of  the  Sangrail,  and  by  occasional  participa- 
tion in  the  holy  feast. 

Time  and  history  count  for  very  little  in  these  narratives. 

It  was  allowed,  however,  that  Titurel  the  Chief  had  grown 

extremely  aged,  but  as  it  was  not  allowed  that 

SfSfl 

he  could  die  in  the  presence  of  the  Sangrail,  he 

TITUHEL. 

seemed  to  have  been  laid  in  a  kind  of  trance, 
res-ting  in  an  open  tomb  beneath  the  altar  of  the  Grail ; 
and  whenever  the  cup  was  uncovered  his  voice  might  be 
heard  joining  in  the  celebration.  Meanwhile,  Amfortis,  his 
son,  reigned  in  his  stead. 

Montsalvat,  with  its  pure,  contemplative,  but  active 
"brotherhood,  and  its  mystic  cup,  thus  stands  out  as  the 
poetic  symbol  of  all  that  is  highest  and  best  in  mediaeval 
Christianity. 


KLINGSOR.— THE  FALL   OF  AMFORTIS.       471 

The  note  of  the  wicked  world — Magic  for  Devotion — 

Sensuality  for  Worship — breaks  in  upon  our  vision,  as  the 

scene  changes  from  the  halls  of  Montsalvat  to 

O/»Q 

Klingsor's  palace.     Klingsor,  an  impure  knight, 

K  LINGS  OK. 

who  has  been  refused  admittance  to  the  order  of 
the  "  Sangrail,"  enters  into  a  compact  with  the  powers  of 
evil — by  magic  acquires  arts  of  diabolical  fascination — fills 
his  palace  and  gardens  with  enchantments,  and  wages  bitter 
war  against  the  holy  knights,  with  a  view  of  corrupting 
them,  and  ultimately,  it  may  be,  of  acquiring  for  himself 
the  "  Sangrail,"  in  which  all  power  is  believed  to  reside. 
Many  knights  have  already  succumbed  to  the  "  insidious 
arts  "  of  Klingsor ;  but  the  tragical  turning  point  of  the 
Parsifal  is  that  Amfortis,  himself  the  son  of  Titurel, 
the  official  guardian  of  the  Grail,  in  making  war  upon  the 
magician,  took  with  him  the  sacred  spear,  and  lost  it  to 
Klingsor. 

It  came   about   in    this   way.     A   woman   of  unearthly 

loveliness  won  him  in  the  enchanted  bowers,  adjoining  the 

evil  knight's  palace,    and   Klingsor,   seizing  the

the  garden,  h^s  companions  of  the  Sangrail  covering  their 
retreat.  But  returned  to  Montsalvat,  the  unhappy  king 
awakes  only  to  bewail  his  sin,  the  loss  of  the  sacred  spear,

and  the  ceaseless  harrowing  smart  of  an  incurable  wound.

simple,  but  exactly  adapted  to  its  purpose  .... 
I  join  the  stream  of  pilgrims,  some  in  carriages,  others  on 
foot.  As  we  approach,  a  clear  blast  of  trombones  and  brass 
from  the  terrace  in  front  of  the  grand  entrance,  plays  out 
the  Grail  "  motive/'  It  is  the  well-known  signal — there  is 
no  time  to  be  lost.  I  enter  at  the  prescribed  door,  and  find 
myself  close  to  my  appointed  place.  Everyone — such  is 
the  admirable  arrangement — seems  to  do  likewise.  In  a 
few  minutes  about  one  thousand  persons  are  seated  without 
confusion.  The  theatre  is  darkened,  the  foot-lights  are 
lowered,  the  prelude  begins. 

ACT  I. 

The  waves  of  sound  rise  from  the  shadowy  gulph  sunken 
between  the  audience  and  the  foot-lights.     Upon  the  sound

then,  full  of  heavy  pain,  "  Drink  ye  all  of  this/'  followed

by  tlie  famous  Grail  motive — an  old  chorale  also  used  by 
MENDELSSOHN  in  the  Reformation  Symphony.  Then  comes 
the  noble  Faith  and  Love  theme. 

As  I  sit  in  the  low  light,  amidst  the  silent  throng,  and 
listen,  I  need  no  interpreter,  I  am  being  placed  in  possession 
of  the  emotional  key-notes  of  the  drama.  Every  subject  is 
first  distinctly  enunciated,  and  then  all  are  wondrously 
blended  together.  There  is  the  pain  of  Sacrifice — the  mental 
agony,  the  bodily  torture — there  are  the  alternate  pauses 
of  Sorrow  and  respite  from  sorrow  long  drawn  out,  the 
sharp  ache  of  Sin,  the  glimpses  of  unhallowed  Joy,  the  strain 
of  upward  Endeavour,  the  serene  peace  of  Faith  and  Love, 
crowned  by  the  blessed  Vision  of  the  Grail.  'Tis  past.  The 
prelude  melts  into  the  opening  recitative. 

The  eyes  have  now  to  play  their  part.     The  curtain  rises, 

the  story  begins.      The   morning   breaks  slowly,  the  grey 

streaks  redden,  a  lovely  summer  landscape   lies 

373>       bathed  in  primrose   light.     Under  the  shadow  of 

SUNRISE. 

a  noble  tree,  the  aged  knight,  Gurnemanz,  has 
been  resting  with  two  young  attendants.  From  the  neigh- 
bouring halls  of  Montsalvat  the  solemn  reveille — the  Grail 
motive — rings  out,  and  all  throe  sink  on  their  knees  in 
prayer.  The  sun  bursts  forth  in  splendour,  as  the  hymn 
rises  to  mingle  with  the  voices  of  universal  nature.  The 
waves  of  sound  well  up  and  fill  the  soul  with  unspeakable 
thankfulness  and  praise. 


474  PARSIFAL. 

The  talk  is   of  Amfortis,  the  king,  and  of  his  incurable 

wound.      A   wild   gallop,   a   rush   of  sound,    and   a  weird 

woman,   with   streaming    hair,    springs    towards 

8'*'       the   startled   group.      She   bears    a  phial,   with 

RUNDRY 

rare  balsam  from  the  Arabian  shores.  It  is 
for  the  king's  wound.  Who  is  the  wild  horsewoman? — 
Kundry — strange  creation — a  being  doomed  to  wander — 
like  the  Wandering  Jew,  the  wild  Huntsman,  or  Flying 
Dutchman — always  seeking  a  deliverance  she  cannot  find — 
Kimdry,  who,  in  ages  gone  by,  met  the  Saviour  on  the  road 
to  Calvary,  and  derided  him.  Some  said  she  was  Herodias' 
daughter.  Now  filled  with  remorse,  yet  weighted  with 
sinful  longings,  she  serves  by  turns  the  Knights  of  the 
Grail,  then  fulls  under  the  spell  of  Klingsor,  the  evil 
knight  sorcerer,  and  in  the  guise  of  an  enchantress,  is 
compelled  by  him  to  seduce,  if  possible,  the  Knights  of  the 
Grail. 

Eternal  symbol  of  the  divided  allegiance  of  a  woman's 
soul !  She  it  was  who,  under  the  sensual  spell,  as  an  incar- 
nation of  loveliness,  overcame  Amfortis,  and  she  it  is  now 
who,  in  her  ardent  quest  for  salvation — changed  and  squalid 
in  appearance — serves  the  Knights  of  the  Grail,  and  seeks 
to  heal  Amfortis'  wound  ! 

No  sooner  has  she  delivered  her  balsam  to  the  faithful 
Gurnemnnz,  and  thrown  herself  exhausted  upon  the  grass 
— where  she  lies  gnawing  her  hair  morosely — than  a  change 
in  the  sound  atmosphere,  which  never  ceases  to  be  generated 


AMFORTIS  APPROACHES.  475 

in  the  mystic  orchestral  gulph,  presages  the  approach  of 
Amfortis. 

He  comes,  borne  on  a  litter,  to  his  morning  bath  in  the 
shining  lake  hard  by.  Sharp  is  the  pain  of  the  wound — 

weary  and  hopeless  is  the  king.      Through  the 
875. 

AWOETIS  Wound-motive  comes  the  sweet  woodland  music 
and  the  breath  of  the  blessed  morning,  frag- 
rant with  flowers  and  fresh  with  dew.  It  is  one  of 
those  incomparable  bursts  of  woodland  notes,  full  of 
bird-song  and  the  happy  hum  of  insect  life  and  rustling 
of  netted  branches  and  waving  of  long  tassclled  grass. 
I  know  of  nothing  like  it  save  the  forest  music  in  Sieg- 
fried. 

The  sick  king  listens,  and  remembers  words  of  hope  and 
comfort  that  fell  from  a  heavenly  voice — what  time  the 
glory  of  the  Grail  passed — 

"  Dorcli  mitleid  \Visscnd  u  Wait  for  my  chosen  one, 

Der  reine  Thor, 

Guileless  and  innocent, 
Harre  sem 

Den  ich  erkor."  Pity-enlightened." 

They  hand  him  the  phial  of  balsam  ;  and  presently,  whilst 
the  lovely  forest  music  again  breaks  forth,  the  king  is 
carried  on  to  his  bath,  and  Kundry,  Gurnemanz,  and  the 
two  esquires  hold  the  stage. 

As  the  old  knight,  who  is  a  complete  repertory  of  facts 


476  PARSIFAL. 

connected  with  the  Grail  tradition,  unfolds  to  the  esquires 

the  nature  of  the  king's  wound,  the  sorceries  of 

GDRNEMANZ'S  Klingsor,   the    hope  of  deliverance   from   some 

unknown  "  guileless  one/'  a  sudden  cry  breaks 

up  the  situation. 

A  white  swan,  pierced  by  an  arrow,  flutters  dying  to 
the  ground.  It  is  the  swan  beloved  of  the  Grail  brother- 
hood, bird  of  fair  omen,  symbol  of  spotless  purity.  The 
slayer  is  brought  in  between  two  knights — a  stalwart  youth, 
fearless,  unabashed — whilst  the  death-music  of  the  swan, 
the  slow  distilling  and  stiffening  of  its  life-blood,  is 
marvellously  rendered  by  the  orchestra.  Conviction  of 
his  fault  comes  over  the  youth  as  he  listens  to  the  re- 
proaches of  Gurnemanz.  He  hangs  his  head,  ashamed  and 
penitent,  and  at  last  with  a  sudden  passion  of  remorse 
snaps  his  bow,  and  flings  it  aside.  The  swan  is  borne 
off,  and  Parsifal  (the  "  guileless  one,"  for  he  it  is),  with 
Gurnemanz  and  Kundry — who  rouses  herself  and  surveys 
Parsifal  with  strange,  almost  savage  curiosity — hold  the 
stage. 

In  this  scene  Kundry  tells  the  youth  more  than  he  cares 

to  hear  about  himself.     How  his  father,  Gamuret,  was  a 

great  knight  killed  in  battle;   how  his  mother, 

KUNDRY'S    Herzeleide  (Heart's  Affliction),  fearing  a  like  fate 

for  her  son,  brought  him  up  in  the  lonely  forest ; 

how  he  left  her  to  follow  a  troop  of  knights  that  he  met  one 


KUNDRY'  S  SLEEP.  477 

day  winding  through  the  forest  glade,  and  being  led  on  and 
on  in  pursuit  of  them,  never  overtook  them  and  never 
returned  to  his  mother,  Heart's  Affliction,  who  died  of  grief. 
At  this  point  the  frantic  youth  seizes  Kundry  by  the  throat 
in  an  agony  of  rage  and  grief,  but  is  held  back  by  Gurne- 
manz,  till,  worn  out  by  the  violence  of  his  emotion,  he 
faints  away,  and  is  gradually  revived  by  Kundry  and 
Gurnemanz. 

Suddenly  Kundry  rises  with  a  wild  look,  like  one  under 

a  spell.     Her  mood  of  service  is  over.     She  staggers  across 

the  stage  —  she  can  hardly  keep  awake.    "  Sleep/' 

o7o« 

KUNDRY'S  she  mutters,  "  I  must  sleep  —  sleep  !  "  and  falls 
down  in  one  of  those  long  trances  which  appa- 
rently lasted  for  months,  or  years,  and  formed  the  tran- 
sition periods  between  her  mood  of  Grail  service  and  the 
Klingsor  slavery  into  which  she  must  next  relapse  in  spite 
of  herself. 

And  is  this  the  guileless  one  ?    This  "wild  youth  who  slays 
the  fair  swan  —  who  knows  not  his  own  name  nor  whence 

he  comes,  nor  whither  he  goes,  nor  what  are  his 
379. 

PASSAGE  TO  destinies  ?     The  old  knight   eyes  him  curiously 

MONTSALVAT. 


._he 

seen  the  king  pass  once  —  he  had  marked  his  pain.  Was 
he  "  enlightened  by  pity  ?  ''  Is  he  the  appointed  deliverer  ? 
The  old  knight  now  invites  him  to  the  shrine  of  the  Grail. 


473  PARSIFAL. 

"What  is  the  Grail?"  asks  the  youth.  Truly  a  guileless, 
innocent  one !  yet  a  brave  and  pure  knight,  since  he  has 
known  no  evil,  and  so  readily  repents  of  a  fault  committed 
in  ignorance. 

Gurnemanz  is  strangely  drawn  to  him.  He  shall  see  the 
Grail,  and  in  the  Holy  Palace,  what  time  the  mystic  light 
streams  forth  and  the  assembled  knights  bow  themselves  in 
prayer,  the  voice  which  comforted  Amfortis  shall  speak  to 
his  deliverer  and  bid  him  arise  and  heal  the  king. 

•  •  •  •  • 

Gurnemanz  and  Parsifal  have  ceased  to  speak.  They 
stand  in  the  glowing  light  of  the  summer-land.  The  tide 
of  music  rolls  on  continuously,  but  sounds  more  strange 
and  dreamy. 

•  •  •  •  • 

Is  it  a  cloud  passing  over  the  sky?  There  seems  to  be  a 
shuddering  in  the  branches — the  light  fades  upon  yonder 
sunny  woodlands — the  foreground  darkens  apace.  The 
whole  scene  is  moving,  but  so  slowly  that  it  seems  to  change 
like  a  dissolving  view.  I  see  the  two  figures  of  Gurnemanz 
and  Parsifal  moving  through  the  trees — they  are  lost  behind 
yonder  rock.  They  emerge  further  off — higher  up.  The 
air  grows  very  dim ;  the  orchestra  peals  louder  and  louder. 
I  lose  the  two  in  the  deepening  twilight.  The  forest  is 
changing,  the  land  is  wild  and  mountainous.  Huge  galleries 
and  arcades,  rock-hewn,  loom  through  the  dim  forest ; 
but  all  is  growing  dark.  I  listen  to  the  murmurs  of  the 


THE  HALL   OF  THE  KNIGHTS.  479 

"  Grail/'  the  "  Spear/'  the  "  Pain,"  the  "  Love  and  Faith  " 
motives — hollow  murmurs,  confused,  floating  out  of  the 
depths  of  lonely  caves.  Then  I  have  a  feeling  of  void  and 
darkness,  and  there  comes  a  sighing  as  of  a  soul  swoon- 
ing away  in  a  trance,  and  a  vision  of  waste  places  and 
wild  caverns ;  and  then  through  the  confused  dream  I  hear 
the  solemn  boom  of  mighty  bells,  only  muffled.  They  keep 
time  as  to  some  ghostly  march.  I  strain  my  eyes  into  the 
thick  gloom  before  me.  Is  it  a  rock,  or  forest,  or  palace  ? 

As    the    light    returns     slowly,   a    hall    of    more    than 

Alhambra-like   splendour    opens    before  me.     My  eyes  are 

riveted    on    the    shining    pillars    of    variegated 

THE  HALL  OF  marble,   the   tesselated   pavements,   the   vaulted 

'  roof  glowing   with    gold   and   colour ;    beyond, 

arcades  of  agate  columns,  bathed  in  a  misty  moonlight  air, 

and  lost  in  a  bewildering  perspective  of  halls  and  corridors. 

I  hear  the  falling  of  distant  water  in  marble  fonts ;  the 
large  bells  of  Montsalvat  peal  louder  and  louder,  and  to 
music  of  unimaginable  stateliness  the  knights  enter  in 
solemn  procession,  clad  in  the  blue  and  red  robes  of  the 
Grail,  and  take  their  seats  at  two  semicircular  tables  which 
start  like  arms  to  the  right  and  left  of  the  holy  shrine. 
Beneath  it  lies  Titurel  entranced,  and  upon  it  is  presently 
deposited  the  sacred  treasure  of  the  Grail  itself. 

As  the  wounded  King  Amfortis  is  borne  in,  the  assembled

knights,  each  standing  in  his    place,  a  golden    cup  before 

him.   intone  the    Grail  motive,   which   is    taken 
381. 
THE  HOLT   up  by  the   entering   choruses   of   servitors   and 

esquires  bearing  the  holy  relics. 

Gurnemanz  is  seated  amongst  the  knights ;  Parsifal  stands 
aside  and  looks  on  in  mute  astonishment,  "  a  guileless  one." 

As  the  Holy  Grail  is  set  down  on  the  altar  before  the 
wounded  king,  a  burst  of  heavenly  music  streams  from  the 
high  dome — voices  of  angels  intone  the  celestial  phrases, 
"  Take,  eat ''  and  f '  this  is  my  blood !  "  and  blend  them  with 
the  "  faith  and  love ''  motives.  As  the  choruses  die  away, 
the  voice  of  the  entranced  Titurel  is  heard  from  beneath  the 
altar  calling  upon  Amfortis,  his  son,  to  uncover  the  Grail 
that  he  may  find  refreshment  and  life  in  the  blessed 
vision. 

Then  follows  a  terrible  struggle  in  the  breast  of  Am- 
fortis. He,  sore  stricken  in  sin,  yet  guardian  of  the  Grail, 
guilty  among  the  guiltless,  oppressed  with  pain,  bowed  down 
with  shame,  craving  for  restoration,  overwhelmed  with  un- 
worthiness,  yet  chosen  to  stand  and  minister  before  the 
Lord  on  behalf  of  His  saints  !  Pathetic  situation,  which 
must  in  all  times  repeat  itself  in  the  history  of  the  Church. 
The  unworthiness  of  the  minister  affects  not  the  validity  of 
his  consecrated  acts.  Yet  what  agony  of  mind  must  many 
a  priest  have  suffered,  himself  oppressed  with  sin  and  doubt, 
whilst  dispensing  the  means  of  grace,  and  acting  as  a 
minister  and  steward  of  the  mysteries. 


THIS  IS  MY  BLOOD.  431 

The  marvellous  piece  of  self-analysis  in  which  the 
conscience-stricken  king  bewails  his  lot,  as  little  admits 
of  description  here  as  the  music  which  embodies  his 
emotions. 

At  the  close  of  it  angel  voices  seem  floating  in  mid- air, 
Sighing  the  mystic  words  : 

"  Durch  mitleid  Wissend  "  Wait  for  my  chosen  one, 

Der  reine  Thor, 

„.  .  Guileless  and  innocent, 

Harre  sem, 

Den  ich  erkor."  Pity-enlightened." 

And  immediately  afterwards  the  voice  of  Titurel,  like  one 
turning  restlessly  in  his  sleep,  comes  up  from  his  living 
tomb  beneath  the  altar,  "  Uncover  the  Grail !  " 

With  trembling  hands  the  sick  king  raises  himself,  and 
with  a  great  effort  staggers  towards  the  shrine — the  cover- 
ing is  removed — he  takes   the   crystal  cup — he 
382. 

THIS  is  MY  raises  it  on  high — the  blood  is  dark — the  light 
begins  to  fade  in  the  hall — a  mist  and  dimness 
come  over  the  scene — we  seem  to  be  assisting  at  a  shadowy 
ceremony  in  a  dream — the  big  bells  are  tolling — the 
heavenly  choirs  from  above  the  dome,  which  is  now  bathed 
in  twilight,  are  heard:  "Drink  ye,  all  of  this."  Amfortis 
raises  on  high  the  crystal  vase — the  knights  fall  on  their 
knees  in  prayer.  Suddenly  a  faint  tremor  of  light  quivers 
in  the  crystal  cup — then  the  blood  grows  ruby  red  for  a 

moment.     Amfortis  waves  it  to  and  fro — the  knights  gaze 

31 


482  PARSIFAL. 

in  ecstatic  adoration.  Titurel's  voice  gathers  strength  in 
his  tomb : 

"  Celestial  rapture  I 
How  streams  the  light  upon  the  face  of  God !  " 

The  light  fades  slowly  out  of  the  crystal  cup — the  miracle  is 
accomplished.  The  blood  again  grows  dark — the  light  of 
common  day  returns  to  the  halls  of  Montsalvat,  and  the 
knights  resume  their  seats,  to  find  each  one  his  golden 
goblet  filled  with  wine. 

During  the  sacred  repast  which  follows  the   brotherhood 
join  hands  and  embrace,  singing : 

"  Blessed  are  they  that  believe  ; 
Blessed  are  they  that  love  !  " 

and  the  refrain  is  heard  again  far  up  in  the  heights,  re- 
echoed by  the  angelic  hosts. 

I  looked  round  upon   the    silent  audience  whilst  these 

astonishing   scenes   were   passing    before    me;    the   whole 

383         assembly   was   motionless  —  all    seemed    to    be 

THE  SPIRITUAL  solemnised   by   the    august    spectacle — seemed 

IMPRESSION 

MADE.  almost  to  share  in  the  devout  contemplation 
and  trance-like  worship  of  the  holy  knights.  Every  thought 
of  the  stage  had  vanished — nothing  was  further  from  my 
own  thoughts  than  play-acting.  I  was  sitting  as  I  should 
sit  at  an  oratorio,  in  devout  and  rapt  contemplation.  Before 
my  eyes  had  passed  a  symbolic  vision  of  prayer  and  ecstasy, 


THE  MEANING  OF  THE  GUILELESS  FOOL.      483 

flooding  the  soul  with  overpowering  thoughts  of  the  Divine 
sacrifice  and  the  mystery  of  unfathomable  love. 

The  hall  of  Montsalvat  empties.  Gurnemanz  strides 
excitedly  up  to  Parsifal,  who  stands  stupefied  with  what  he 
has  seen — 

"  Why  standest  thou  silent  ? 
Knowest  thou  what  thine  eyes  have  seen  ?  " 

The  guileless  one  shakes  his  head.  "  Nothing  but  a  fool !  " 
exclaims  Gurnemanz,  angrily ;  and  seizing  Parsifal  by  the 
shoulder,  he  pushes  him  roughly  out  of  the  hall,  with : 

"  Be  off !  look  after  thy  geese, 
And  henceforth  leave  our  swans  in  peace." 

The  Grail  vision  had,  then,  taught  the  "guileless  one" 
nothing.  He  could  not  see  his  mission — he  was  as  yet  un- 

awakened  to  the  deeper  life  of  the  spirit ;  though 
384. 

THE  MEANING  blameless  and  unsullied,  he  was  still  the  "natural 

GUILELESS    man."     Profound  truth  !  that  was  not  first  which 

was  spiritual,  but  that  which  was  natural :  before 

Parsifal   wins  a  spiritual  triumph,  he   must  be  spiritually 

tried ;  his  inner  life  must  be  deepened  and  developed,  else 

he  can  never  read  aright  the  message  of  the  Grail. 

The  life  of  God  in  the  spirit  comes  only  when  the  battle 
for  God  in  the  heart  has  been  fought  and  won. 

Fare  forth,  thou  guileless  one !  thou  shalt  yet  add  to  the 
simplicity  of  the  dove  the  wisdom  of  the  serpent.  Thou  art

innocent  because  ignorant ;  but  thou  shalt  be  weighed  anon 
in  the  balance  and  not  be  found  wanting :  and  then  shalt 
thou  re-conquer  the  holy  spear  lost  in  Sin,  re-won  in  Purity 
and  Sacrifice,  and  be  to  the  frail  Amfortis  the  chosen  saviour 
for  whom  he  waits. 

•  •  •  •  • 

The  foregoing  events  occupied  about  an  hour  and  a 
quarter.  When  the  curtain  fell,  the  vast  audience  broke  up 
in  silence. 

The  air -outside  was  cool  and  balmy.  In  the  distance  lay 
the  city  of  Bayreuth,  with  the  tower  of  the  Alte  Schloss  and 
the  old  church  standing  up  grey  against  the  distant  Bavarian 
hills. 

All  around  us  lay  the  pine  woods,  broken  by  the  lawns 
and  avenues  that  encircle  the  theatre  and  embower  it  in  a 
secluded  world  of  its  own — even  as  the  Palace  of  the  Grail 
was  shut  off  from  the  profane  world. 

Here,  indeed,  is  truly  the  Montsalvat  of  the  modern 
drama — a  spot  purified  and  sacred  to  the  highest  aims  and 
noblest  manifestations  of  Art. 

In  about  an  hour  the  Spear  motive  was  the  signal  blown 
on  the  wind  instruments  outside,  and  I  took  my  seat  for  the 
second  act. 

ACT  II. 

A  restless,  passion-tossed  prelude.  The  "  Grail "  subject

shuddering  might  of  his  alchemy. 

The  great  magician,  Klingsor,  is  seen  alone  in  his  dun- 
geon palace — harsh  contrast  to  the  gorgeous  halls  of  Mont- 
salvat.  Here  all  is  built  of  the  live  rock,  an  impenetrable 
fastness,  the  home  of  devilish  might  and  terrible  spells. 


Klingsor  is  aware  of  the  coming  struggle,  and  he  means 

to  be  ready  for  it.     He  owns  the  sacred  spear  wrested  from

paralysing  the  fool  by  his  enchantments  as  he  paralysed 
Amfortis,  and  the  same  woman  will  serve  his  turn. 

"Kundry!"  The  time  is  come,  the  spells  are  woven — 
blue  vapours  rise,  and  in  the  midst  of  the  blue  vapours,  the 
figure  of  the  still  sleeping  Kundry  is  seen.  She  wakes, 
trembling  violently ;  she  knows  she  is  again  under  the  spell 
she  abhors — the  spell  to  do  evil,  the  mission  to  corrupt. 
With  a  shuddering  scream  she  stands  before  her  tormentor, 
denying  his  power,  loathing  to  return  to  her  vile  mission, 
yet  returning,  as  with  a  bitter  cry  she  vanishes  from  his 
presence. 

Parsifal  has  invaded  Klingsor's  realm;  the  evil  knights 


486  PARSIFAL. 

have  fled  before  his  prowess,  wounded  and  in  disorder. 
Ktmdry  is  commissioned  to  meet  the  guileless  youth  in  the 
enchanted  garden  and,  all  other  allurements  failing,  to 
subdue  him  by  her  irresistible  fascinations  and  hand  him 
over  to  Klingsor. 

In  a  moment  the  scenery  lifts,  and  a  garden  of  marvellous 

beauty  and  extent  lies  before  us.     The  flowers  are  all  of 

colossal  dimensions — huge  roses  hang  in  tangled 

GARDEN  OP  festoons,  the  cactus,  the  lily,  the  blue-bell,  creepers 

and  orchids  of  enormous  size  and  dazzling  colour 

wave  in  mid-air,  and  climb  the  aromatic  trees. 

On  a  bright  hill  appears  Parsifal,  standing  bewildered  by 
the  light  and  loveliness  around  him.  Beautiful  girls,  dressed 
like  flowers,  and  hardly  distinguishable  from  them  at  first, 
rush  in,  bewailing  their  wounded  and  disabled  knights  ;  but 
on  seeing  Parsifal,  fall  upon  their  new  prey,  and  surround- 
ing him,  sing  verse  after  verse  of  the  loveliest  ballet  music, 
whilst  trying  to  embrace  him,  and  quarrelling  with  each 
other  for  the  privilege. 

About  that  wonderful  chorus  of  flower-girls  there  was 
just  a  suggestive  touch  of  the  Rhine  maidens'  singing.  It 
belonged  to  the  same  school  of  thought  and  feeling,  but 
was  freer,  wilder — more  considerable,  and  altogether  more 
complex  and  wonderful  in  its  changes  and  in  the  marvellous 
confusion  in  which  it  breaks  up. 

The  guileless  one  resists  these  charmers,   and  they  are 


THE  NEW  LOVE  DUET.— AN  ANALYSIS.      487 

just  about  to  leave  him  in  disgust,  when  the  roses  lift  on 
one  side,  and,  stretched  on  a  mossy  bank  overhung  with 
flowers,  appears  a  woman  of  unearthly  loveliness.  It  is 
Kundry  transformed,  and  in  the  marvellous  duet  which 
follows  between  her  and  Parsifal,  a  perfectly  new  and 
original  type  of  love  duet  is  struck  out — an  analysis  of 
character,  unique  in  musical  drama  —  a  combination  of 
sentiment  and  a  situation  absolutely  novel,  which  could 
only  have  been  conceived  and  carried  out  by  a  creative 
genius  of  the  highest  order. 

First,    I    note    that    the    once    spell-bound    Kundry   is 

devoted  utterly  to  her  task  of  winning  Parsifal,  into  this 

388.        she    throws    all   the    intensity  of   her    wild  and 

THE  NEW    desperate  nature,  but  in  turn   she  is  strangely 

LOVE   DUET.  &       • 

AN  ANALYSIS,  affected  by  the  spiritual  atmosphere  of  the 
"guileless  one" — a  feeling  comes  over  her  in  the  midst 
of  her  witchcraft  passion,  that  he  is  in  some  way  to 
be  her  saviour  too ;  yet,  woman- like,  she  conceives  of  her 
salvation  as  possible  only  in  union  with  him.  Yet  was  this 
the  very  crime  to  which  Klingsor  would  drive  her  for  the 
ruin  of  Parsifal.  Strange  confusion  of  thought,  feeling, 
aspiration,  longing ! — struggle  of  irreconcilable  elements  ! 
How  shall  she  reconcile  them  ?  Her  intuition  fails  her  not, 
and  her  tact  triumphs.  She  will  win  by  stealing  his  love 
through  his  mother's  love.  A  mother's  love  is  holy — that 
love  she  tells  him  of — it  can  never  more  be  his — but  she 


488  PARSIFAL. 

will  replace  it — her  passion  shall  be  sanctified  by  it — 
through  that  passion  she  has  sinned,  through  it  she,  too, 
shall  be  redeemed.  She  will  work  out  her  own  salvation 
by  the  very  spells  that  are  upon  her  for  evil.  He  is  pure 
— he  shall  make  her  pure,  could  she  but  win  him — both,  by 
the  might  of  such  pure  love,  would  surely  be  delivered 
from  Klingsor  the  corrupter,  the  tormentor.  Fatuous 
dream  !  How,  through  corruption  win  incorruption  ?  How, 
through  indulgence,  win  peace  and  freedom  from  desire  ? 
It  is  the  old  cheat  of  the  senses — Satan  appears  as  an  angel 
of  light.  The  thought  deludes  the  unhappy  Kundry  her- 
self— she  is  no  longer  consciously  working  for  Klingsor, 
she  really  believes  that  this  new  turn,  this  bias  given  to 
passion,  will  purify  both  her  and  the  guileless,  pure  fool 
she  seeks  to  subdue. 

Nothing  can  describe  the  snblety  of  their  long  inter- 
view ;  the  surprising  turns  of  sentiment  and  contrasts  of 
feeling.  Throughout  this  scene  Parsifal's  instinct  is  abso- 
lutely true  and  sure.  Everything  Kundry  says  about  his 
mother,  Herzeleide,  he  feels;  but  every  attempt  to  make 
him  accept  her  instead  he  resists.  Her  desperate  declama- 
tion is  splendid.  Her  heartrending  sense  of  misery  and 
piteous  prayer  for  salvation,  her  belief  that  before  her  is 
her  saviour  could  she  but  win  him  to  her  will,  the  choking 
fury  of  baffled  passion,  the  steady  and  subtle  encroachments 
made  whilst  Parsifal  is  lost  in  a  meditative  dream,  the 
burning  kiss  which  recalls  him  to  himself,  the  fine  touch 


KUNDRY  BAFFLED.  489 

by  which  this  kiss,  whilst  arousing  in  him  the  stormiest 
feelings,  causes  a  sharp  pain,  as  of  Amfortis'  own  wound, 
piercing  his  very  heart.  All  this  is  realistic  if  you  will, 
but  it  is  realism  raised  to  the  sublime. 

Suddenly    Parsifal    springs    up,   hurls    the    enchantress 

from  him,  will  forth  from  Klingsor's  realm.     She  is  baffled, 

she  knows  it ;  for  a  moment  she  bars  his  passage, 

KUNURY  then  succumbs ;  the  might  of  sensuality  which 
lost  Amfortis  the  sacred  spear,  has  been  met  and 
defeated  by  the  guileless  fool.  He  has  passed  from  inno- 
cence to  knowledge  in  his  interview  with  the  flower-girt 
girls,  in  his  long  converse  with  Kundry,  in  her  insidious 
embrace,  in  her  kiss ;  but,  all  these  are  now  thrust  aside, 
he  steps  forth  still  unconquered,  still  "guileless,"  but  no 
more  "a  fool."  The  knowledge  of  good  and  evil  has  come, 
but  the  struggle  is  already  passed. 

"Yes,  sinner,  I  do  offer  thee  Redemption,"  he  can  say 
to  Kundry ;  "  not  in  thy  way,  but  in  thy  Lord  Christ's 
way  of  sacrifice  !  ' 

But  the  desperate  creature,  wild  with  passion,  will  listen 
to  no  reason ;  she  shouts  aloud  to  her  master,  and  Klingsor 
suddenly  appears,  poising  the  sacred  spear.  In  another 
moment  he  hurls  it  right  across  the  enchanted  garden  at 
Parsifal.  It  cannot  wound  the  guileless  and  pure  one  as  it 
wounded  the  sinful  Amfortis.  A  miracle  !  It  hangs  arrested 
in  the  air  above  Parsifal's  head;  he  seizes  it — it  is  the 


490  PARSIFAL. 

sacred  talisman,  one  touch  of  which   will  heal  even  as  it 
inflicted  the  king's  deadly  wound. 

With  a  mighty  cry  and  the  shock  as  of  an  earthquake, 
the  castle  of  Klingsor  falls  shattered  to  pieces,  the  garden 
withers  up  to  a  desert,  the  girls,  who  have  rushed  in,  lie 
about  amongst  the  fading  flowers,  themselves  withered  up 
and  dead.  Kundry  sinks  down  in  a  deathly  swoon,  whilst 
Parsifal  steps  over  a  ruined  wall  and  disappears,  saluting 
her  with  the  words :  "  Thou  alone  knowest  when  we  shall 
meet  again! " 

The  long  shadows  were   stealing  over  the   hills  when  I 

came  out  at  the   second  pause.     Those  whom  I  met  and 

conversed  with  were  subdued  and  awed.     What  a 

SOLEMN  solemn  tragedy  of  human  passion  we  had  been 
assisting  at !  Not  a  heart  there  but  could  inter- 
pret that  struggle  between  the  flesh  and  the  spirit  from  its 
own  experiences.  Not  one  but  knew  the  desperately  wicked 
and  deceitful  temptations  that  come  like  enchantresses  in 
the  wizard's  garden,  to  plead  the  cause  of  the  devil  in  the 
language  of  high-flown  sentiment  or  even  religious  feeling. 

Praise  and  criticism  seemed  dumb ;  we  rather  walked  and 
spoke  of  what  we  had  just  witnessed  like  men  convinced  of 
judgment,  and  righteousness,  and  sin.  It  was  a  strange 
mood  in  which  to  come  out  of  a  theatre  after  witnessing 

O 

what  would  commonly  be  called  an  "  Opera." 

I  felt  more  than  ever  the  impossibility  of  producing  the 


PRELUDE  OF  THE   YEARS.  491 

Parsifal  in  London,  at  Drury  Lane  or  Covent  Garden, 
before  a  well-dressed  company  of  loungers,  who  had  well 
dined,  and  were  on  their  way  to  balls  and  suppers  afterwards. 

I  would  as  soon  see  the  Oberammergau  play  at  a  music 
hall. 

No ;  in  Parsifal  all  is  solemn,  or  all  is  irreverent. 
At  Bayreuth  we  came  on  a  pilgrimage ;  it  cost  us  time, 
and  trouble,  and  money ;  we  were  in  earnest — so  were  the 
actors  ;  the  spirit  of  the  great  master  who  had  planned  every 
detail  seemed  still  to  preside  over  all ;  the  actors  lived  in 
their  parts ;  not  a  thought  of  self  remained ;  no  one 
accepted  applause  or  recall ;  no  one  aimed  at  producing  a 
personal  effect;  the  actors  were  lost  in  the  drama,  and  it 
was  the  drama  and  not  the  actors  which  had  impressed  and 
solemnised  us.  When  I  came  out  they  asked  who  was 
Amfortis?  I  did  not  know.  I  said  "the  wounded  king." 

As  the  instruments  played  out  the  Faith  and  Love  motive 
for  us  to  re-enter,  the  mellow  sunshine  broke  once  more 
from  the  cloud-rack  over  city,  and  field,  and  forest,  before 
sinking  behind  the  long  low  range  of  the  distant  hills. 

ACT  III. 

The  opening  prelude  to  the  third  and  last  act  seems  to 

warn  me  of  the  lapse  of  time.     The  music  is  full

pot ;  the  restlessness  and  misery  of  a  hope  deferred,  the

weariness  of  a  life  without  a  single  joy.  The  motives,  dis- 
coloured as  it  were  by  grief,  work  up  to  a  distorted  version 
of  the  Grail  subject,  which  breaks  off  as  with  a  cry  of 
despair. 

Is  the  Grail,  too,  then  turned  into   a  mocking  spirit  to 
the  unhappy  Amfortis  ? 

Relief  comes  to  us  with  the  lovely  scene  upon  which  the 

curtain  rises.     Again  the  wide  summer  land  lies  stretching 

away  over  sunlit  moor  and  woodland.     In   the 

•M?Zt 

THE  SUMMER  foreground  wave  the  forest  trees,  and  I  hear 
the  ripple  of  the  woodland  streams.  Invariably 
throughout  the  drama,  in  the  midst  of  all  human  pain  and 
passion,  great  nature  is  there,  peaceful,  harmonious  in  all 
her  loveliest  moods ;  a  paradise  in  which  dwell  souls  who 
make  of  her  their  own  purgatory. 

In  yonder   aged   figure,   clad  in  the  Grail  pilgrim  robe, 

I   discern  Gurnemanz  ;    his  hair  is  white  ;    he  stoops  with 

years ;  a  rude  hut  is  hard  by.     Presently  a  groan 

0*70. 

WAKING  OF  arrests  his  attention,  moaning  as  of  a  human 
thing  in  distress.  He  clears  away  some  brush- 
wood, and  beneath  it  finds,  waking  from  her  long  trance, 
the  strange  figure  of  Kundry.  For  how  many  years  has 
she  slept,  we  know  not.  Why  is  she  now  recalled  to  life  ? 
She  staggers  to  her  feet ;  we  see  that  she  too  is  in  a  pilgrim 
garb,  with  a  rope  girding  her  dress  of  coarse  brown  serge. 


THE  BLACK  KNIGHT.  493 

"  Service !  service ! "  she  mutters,  and  seizing  a  pitcher, 
moves  mechanically  to  fill  it  at  the  well,  then  totters  but 
half  awake  into  the  wooden  hut.  The  forest  music  breaks 
forth — the  hum  of  happy  insect  life,  the  song  of  wild  birds. 
All  seems  to  pass  as  in  a  vision;  when  suddenly  enters  a 
knight  clad  in  black  armour  from  top  to  toe. 

The  two  eye  him  curiously,  and  Gurnemanz,  approaching, 

bids  him  lay  aside  his  armour  and  his  weapons.     He  carries 

a  long  spear.     In   silence  the    knight  unhelms, 

oJ4» 

THE  BLACK  and  sticking  the  spear  into  the  ground,  kneels 
before  it,  and  remains  lost  in  devotional  con- 
templation. The  "  Spear  "  and  "  Grail  "  motives  mingle 
together  in  the  full  tide  of  orchestral  sounds  carrying  on 
the  emotional  undercurrent  of  the  drama.  The  knight  is 
soon  recognised  by  both  as  the  long-lost  and  discarded 
Parsifal. 

The  "  guileless  one  "  has  learned  wisdom,  and  discovered 
his  mission — he  knows  now  that  he  bears  the  spear  which 
is  to  heal  the  king's  grievous  wound,  and  that  he  himself  is 
appointed  his  successor.  Through  long  strife  and  trial  and 
pain  he  seems  to  have  grown  into  something  of  Christ's  own 
likeness.  Not  all  at  once,  but  at  last  he  has  found  the 
path.  He  returns  to  bear  salvation  and  pardon  both  to 
Kundry  arid  the  wretched  king,  Amfortis. 

The  full  music  flows  on  whilst  Gurnemanz  relates  how 
the  knights  have  all  grown  weak  and  aged,  deprived  of  the 


494  PARSIFAL. 

vision  and  sustenance  of  the  Holy  Grail,  whilst  the  long- 
entranced  Titurel  is  at  last  dead. 

At  this  news  Parsifal,  overcome  with  grief,  swoons  away, 
and  Gurnemanz  and  Kundry  loosen  his  armour,  and  sprinkle 
him  with  water  from  the  holy  spring.  Underneath  his 
black  suit  of  mail  he  appears  clad  in  a  long  white  tunic. 

The  grouping  is  here  admirable;  Gurnemauz  is  in  the 
Templar's  red  and  blue  robe ;  Parsifal  in  white,  his  auburn 

hair  parted  in  front,  and  flowing  down  in  ringlets 
oyo. 

A  SACRED  on  either  side,  recalls  Leonardo's  favourite  con- 
ception of  the  Saviour's  head,  and,  indeed,  from 
this  point  Parsifal  becomes  a  kind  of  symbolic  reflection  of 
the  Lord  Himself.  Kundry,  subdued  and  awed,  lies  weeping 
at  his  feet ;  he  lifts  his  hands  to  bless  her  with  infinite  pity. 
She  washes  his  feet,  and  dries  them  with  the  hairs  of  her 
head.  It  is  a  bold  stroke,  but  the  voices  of  nature,  the 
murmur  of  the  summer  woods,  come  with  an  infinite  healing 
tenderness  and  pity,  and  the  act  is  seen  to  be  symbolical  of 
the  pure  devotion  of  a  sinful  creature  redeemed  from  sin. 
Peace  has  at  last  entered  into  that  wild  and  troubled  heart, 
and  restless  Kundry,  delivered  from  Klingsor's  spell,  receives 
the  sprinkling  of  baptismal  water  at  the  hands  of  Parsifal. 

•  •  »  •  • 

The  great  spaces  of  silence  in  the  dialogue,  broken  now 
by  a  few  sentences  from  Parsifal,  now  from  Gurnemanz,  are 
more  eloquent  than  many  words.  The  tidal  music  flows 


THE  KISS   OF  PEACE.  495 

on  in  a  ceaseless  stream  of  changing  harmonies,  returning 
constantly  to  the  sweet  and  slumbrous  sound  of  the  summer 
land,  full  of  teeming  life  and  glowing  happiness. 

Then  Gurnemanz  takes  up  his  parable.  It  is  the  Blessed 
Good  Friday  on  which  our  dear  Lord  suffered.  The  Love  and 
Faith  phrases  are  chimed  forth,  the  pain-notes  of  the  Cross 
agony  are  sounded  and  pass,  the  Grail  motive  seems  to 
swoon  away  in  descending  harmonies,  sinking  into  the 
woodland  voices  of  universal  nature — that  trespass-pardoned 
nature  that  now  seems  waking  to  the  day  of  her  glory  and 
innocence. 

In  that  solemn  moment  Parsifal  bsnds  over  the  subdued 

and  humbled  Kundry,  and  kisses  her  softly  on  the  brow —

THE  KISS  OF  fierce  fire,  mingled  with  the  bitter  wound-pain ; 
his  is  the  seal  of  her  eternal  pardon  and  peace. 

In  the  distance  the  great  bells  of  Montsalvat  are  now 
heard  booming  solemnly — the  air  darkens,  the  light  fades 
out,  the  slow  motion  of  all  the  scenery  recommences.  Again 
I  hear  the  wild  cave  music,  strange  and  hollow  sounding — • 
the  three  move  on  as  in  a  dream,  and  are  soon  lost  in  the 
deep  shadows ;  and  through  all,  louder  and  louder,  boom 
the  heavy  bells  of  Montsalvat,  until  the  stage  brightens, 
and  we  find  ourselves  once  more  in  the  vast  Alhambra-like 
hall  of  the  knights.

The  king,  in  great  agony  and  despair,  bewails  the  death

AMFOKTIS  is  knights,  and,  tottering  forward,  beseeches  them 
to  free  him  from  his  misery  and  sin-stained  life, 
and  thrust  their  swords  deep  into  his  wounded  side.  At  this 
moment  Gurnemanz,  accompanied  by  Parsifal  and  Kundry, 
enter.  Parsifal  steps  forward  with  the  sacred  spear,  now  at 
length  to  be  restored  to  the  knights.  He  touches  the  side  of 
Amfortis,  the  wound  is  healed,  and  as  he  raises  the  spear  on 
high  the  point  is  seen,  glowing  with  the  crimson  glory  of 
the  Grail.  Then  stepping  up  to  the  shrine,  Parsifal  takes 
the  crystal  cup,  the  dark  blood  glows  bright  crimson  as  he 
holds  it  on  high,  and  at  that  moment,  whilst  all  fall  on 
their  knees,  and  celestial  music  ("  Drink  ye  all  of  this ") 
floats  in  the  upper  air,  Kundry  falls  back  dying,  her  eyes 
fixed  on  the  blessed  Grail.  A  white  dove  descends  and 
hovers  for  a  moment,  poised  in  mid-air  above  the  glowing 
cup.  A  soft  chorus  of  angels  seems  to  die  away  in  the 
clouds  beyond  the  golden  dome — 

"  Marvellous  mercy  ! 
Victorious  Saviour  1 " 


A    TOUCHING  INCIDENT.  497 

Words  can  add  nothing  to  the  completeness  of  the  drama, 
and  no  words  can  give  any  idea  of  the  splendour  and  com- 
plexity of  that  sound  ocean  upon  which  the  drama  floats 
from  beginning  to  end. 

The  enemies  of  the  Grail  are  destroyed  or  subdued,  the 
wound  they  have  inflicted  is  healed,  the  prey  they  claimed 
is  rescued ;  the  pure  and  blameless  Parsifal  becomes  the 
consecrated  head  of  the  holy  brotherhood,  and  the  beatific 
vision  of  God's  eternal  love  and  Real  Presence  is  restored  to 
the  Knights  of  the  Sangrail. 

•  •  i  •  • 

When  I  came  out  of  the  theatre  at  the  end  of  the 
third  and  last  act,  it  was  ten  o'clock. 

The  wind  was  stirring  in  the  fir  trees,  the  stars  gleamed 
out  fitfully  through  a  sky,  across  which  the  clouds  were 
hurrying  wildly,  but  the  moon  rose  low  and  large  beyond 
the  shadowy  hills,  and  bathed  the  misty  valleys  with  a 
mild  and  golden  radiance  as  of  some  celestial  dawn. 

When  the  curtain  fell  on  the  last  performance  of  Par- 
sifal, at  Bayreuth,  which,  on  the  30th  July  1883,  brought 

the  celebration  month  to  a  close,  the  enthusiasm 
398. 
A  TOUCHING  of  the  audience   found   full   vent   in  applause. 

The  curtain  was  once  lifted,  but  no  calls  would 
induce  the  performers  to  appear  a  second  time  or  receive 
any  individual  homage.  This  is  entirely  in  accordance  with 
the  tone  of  these  exceptional  representations.  On  each

occasion  the  only  applause  permitted  was  at  the  end  of  the 
drama,  and  throughout  not  a  single  actor  answered  to  a 
call  or  received  any  personal  tribute. 

Behind  the  scenes  there  occurred  a  touching  incident. 
The  Banker  GROSS  led  WAGNER'S  children  up  to  the 
assembled  actors,  and  in  the  name  of  their  dead  father 
thanked  the  assembly  for  the  care  and  labour  of  love  ex- 
pended by  each  and  all  in  producing  the  last  work  of  the 
great  dead  master.  SIEGFRIED,  WAGNER'S  son,  thirteen 
years  old,  then,  in  a  few  simple  words,  stifled  with  sobs, 
thanked  the  actors  personally,  and  all  the  children  shook 
hands  with  them.  The  KING  OF  BAVARIA  charged  himself 
upon  \VAGN  ER'S  death  with  the  education  of  his  son.

(A  Leaf  from  my  Diary.) 

WAGNER    has    invested    Bayreuth    with    so    modern    an 
interest  that  we  are  apt  to  forget  that  it  has  had  a  past ; 

but  once  walk  through  it,  and  the  old  Markgrave

I»ABT  AND  days  of  the  great  prince-nobles  who  owned  the 
town  and  country  round,  handing  over  both  to 
their  heirs,  come  back  to  us ;  and  here  and  there  a  stone 
relic  reminds  us  of  a  different  sort  of  world  from  ours — a 
world  of  Hohenzollern  and  Hohenstaufen,  and  wars  and 
fightings;  aye,  and  of  plague,  pestilence,  and  famine  too. 
That  grim  warrior  prince,  armed  cap-k-pie,  who  prances

harness  on,  in  front  of  the  New  Palace;  those  vigorous 
figures  riding  ancient  stone  steeds,  now  half-shattered,  at 
each  corner  of  the  fountain — why  cannot  we  make  such

statues  now  ?  Because  we  don't  love  hard-fighting — hand 
to  hand.  "We  are  not  always  at  it — thinking  about  it.  We 
shoot  the  foe  two  miles  off,  and  carry  on  war  by  telegraph. 
We  do  not  look  up  to  our  great  nobles  or  our  royal  folk 
because  they  lead  us  to  battle  and  fortify  the  ramparts  of 
our  towns;  but  because  they  take  the  chair  at  public  dinners, 
open  hospitals,  and  encourage  music,  painting,  and  the  arts 
of  peace.  Well,  I  am  content ;  but  there  was  grit  in  the 
old  days,  for  all  that. 

The  annals  of  Bayreuth  go  back   beyond    the   eleventh 

century,   and  it    has   had    a  chequered,   though   at   times 

glorious  career.      In  1228,  on  the  death  of  the 

^       last    DUKE   OTTO    II.,   it   was   held   by   PRINCE 

THE   PLAGUE. 

FREDERICK,  together  with  Nuremberg ;  and 
under  his  successors,  who  lived  here  half  the  year,  it 
reached  its  golden  period.  All  this  must  be  taken  on 
trust,  for  of  that  early  period  there  is  nothing  left  but 
a  few  crumbling  stones.  Fire  and  plague  have  dealt 
very  terribly  with  Bayreuth.  In  1430  most  of  the  place — 
built  chiefly  of  wood — was  burnt  down.  Rebuilt  in  1472, 
it  had  attained  in  1580  to  a  population  of  only  1,907;  but 
its  increase,  in  spite  of  the  great  sack  and  slaughter  in  the 
days  of  WALLENSTEIN,  was  so  rapid  that  in  1634  the  plague 
was  able  to  carry  off  2,000  persons,  and  still  leave  a  goodly 
population.  Since  then  the  plague  has  ravaged  the  town 
no  less  than  five  times ;  144  houses  were  burnt  down  in 


MODERN  BAYREUTH.  501 

1634,  aud  almost  the  whole  town  was  in  flames  as  late  as 
1621. 

The  present  Bayreuth  dates  chiefly  from  1655.     It  is  to 

the  Brandenburg  Princes  who  lived  here  that  we  owe  those 

palaces  and  goodly  houses,  carved  stone  relics, 

MODERN  fountains,  and  decayed  splendours  that  arrest 
the  eye  as  you  stroll  through  the  Friedrich, 
Maximilian,  or  Ludwig  streets.  The  Opera  House  was 
built  by  PRINCE  FREDERICK,  the  husband  of  the  gifted 
sister  of  FREDERICK.  THE  GREAT,  SOPHIA  WILHELMINE, 
and  that  lady's  ideas  of  taste  and  magnificence  have 
been  fully  carried  out.  The  place  is  a  Renaissance  gem. 
The  carved  wooden  balustrades  of  the  staircase,  the  gor- 
geous fittings  of  the  old-fashioned  boxes,  as  they  rise  in 
three  tiers,  the  heavy  gilding  and  excessive  ornamentation 
of  wreath  and  canopy  over  the  Royal  box,  produce  a 
sumptuously  impressive  effect,  and  tell  of  that  sort  of  reck- 
less and  lavish  expenditure  which  went  on  in  France  iu 
Louis  the  XIV /s  and  XV.'s  days,  and  ended  iu  bringing 
down  the  tinsel  fabric  of  the  old  French  Monarchy.  I  sup- 
pose FREDERICK  THE  GREAT  could  not  prevent  his  relatives 
from  imitating  the  French  opera  splendour ;  and  then  we 
all  know  he  was  musical,  and  played  the  flute  himself  well 
enough — for  a  Prince. 

The  stage  boasts  of  being  the  largest  in  Germany.     Per-

haps  this,  amongst  other  reasons,  induced  WAGNER  to  select 

402.        Bayreuth  as  the  place  where  he  resolved  to  deal 

THE  OLD    the  old  operatic  system  its  death-blow  by  erecting 

OPERA 

HOUSE.  his  new  Shrine  and  Palace  of  Art  sacred  to  the 
Musical  Drama,  but,  significantly,  outside  the  city.  Since 
the  burning  of  the  Vienna  house,  the  Bayreuth  Opera  has 
been  closed,  the  exits  being  thought  inadequate,  as  indeed 
they  are.  When  the  next  fire  comes,  should  it  attack  the 
old  Opera  House,  the  thing  will  blaze  like  tinder.  Every- 
one is  exhorted  to  visit  this  costly  building,  but  when  they 
get  in  they  find  it  all  pitch  dark.  A  bright  light  from 
the  bottom  of  the  stage,  indeed,  streams  in,  but  that  only 
aggravates  matters.  Stand  with  your  back  to  it,  facing  the 
lloyal  box,  and  in  a  few  minutes  the  gorgeous  rows  of 
carved  boxes,  the  heavy  golden  candelabra  and  the  rich 
faded  velvets,  will  become  visible,  and  you  will  be  rewarded 
The  house  holds  about  1,000  people. 

I  have  said  that  in  times  past  this  favoured  city  has  five 
times  been  visited  by  the  plague;  it  now  boasts  of  being 

one    of  the    healthiest    places   in   Bavaria.      It

flowing  streams  and  pine  woods ;  it  is  1,060 
feet  above  the  sea  level,  and  surrounded  by  mountains ; 
it  has  a  population  of  22.077,  and  the  people,  whilst 
dying  at  the  rate  of  24  per  annum  to  the  1,000,  increase 
at  the  rate  of  30,  thus  gaining  annually  six  on  every 


ENTERPRIZE  OF  BAYREUTHERS.  503 

1,000.  This  may  be  all  true  and  edifying,  I  allow,  but 
the  smells  (whether  or  not  they  have  anything  to  do 
with  the  plague  I  don't  know)  are  simply  awful.  As  I 
walked  along  the  street,  I  thought  I  would  stand  opposite 
some  shop  and  just  glance  at  my  guide-book,  but  I  would 
take  care  to  select  one  where  there  was  no  smell.  I  could 
not  find  one ;  open  gratings  and  gutters  poured  forth  their 
heavy  effluvia  wherever  I  paused.  They  tell  us  now  this  is 
so  much  more  healthy  than  the  new  trapped  drain.  I  hope 
so,  because  it  is  so  much  more  unpleasant.  I  should  not 
wonder  if  a  new  visitation  of  the  old  plague  came  ere  long 
to  upset  this  new  theory  of  the  blessed  sanity  of  effluvia. 

I  read  in  my  book,  however,  that  the  Bayreuthers  are 
anxious  to  alleviate  the  sick  and  dying,  as  well  as  to  educate 
404.  the  young  and  healthy.  Not  only  have  they  a 
ENTERPRIZB  famou8  public  school,  where  Jews,  Turks,  infidels. 
BAYRECTHERS.  heretics,  and  Christians  are  indiscriminately 
taught,  but  they  have  endless  "  corpse  "  societies — or  burial 
clubs — and  hospitals  for  special  classes,  all  which  are 
described  in  words  of  such  prodigious  length  that  my  own 
poor  eloquence  withers  up  as  I  read  them.  For  instance,  a 
special  infirmary  for  stone-masons  and  bricklayers  is  termed 
a  "  Kranken-und  Unterstutzungsverein  "  for  "  Manner-und 
Steinhauergesellen ." 

After  a  walk  down    the    principal   streets  I  thought  I

would  get  to  a  "platz,"  or  open  space,  and  try  and  breathe 
the    "Himlische    Luft,"    of    which    GOTZ    VON 

405. 

JEAN  PAUL  BEKLICHINGEN  speaks ;  so  I  made  for  JEAN 
PAUL  RICHTEU'S  statue,  in  black  bronze.  The 
good  man  was  put  up  there  in  1841,  having  died  in 
1825.  That  is  sooner  than  we  build  the  sepulchres  of  some 
of  our  prophets.  LUDWIG,  "  Duke  of  Franks "  and  the 
King  of  Bavaria,  set  him  up.  I  do  not  know  who  was  the 
artist — not  a  Canova,  certainly.  His  head  is  kindly  and 
commonplace;  he  wears  a  flower — which  looks  like  a  penny 
flower — in  his  button-hole;  he  holds  a  pencil  in  one  hand 
and  a  pocket-book  in  the  other.  He  is  waiting  for  an  idea  ! 
As  he  has  been  waiting  exactly  forty-two  years  in  all  sorts 
of  weather,  the  idea  will  probably  never  come  to  him  now. 
It  is  painful  to  think  that  JEAN  PAUL — who  never  in  his 
life  waited  a  moment  for  a  thought — should  be  doomed  by 
a  heartless  sculptor  to  dawdle  on  in  unpicturesque  expectancy 
and  a  frock  coat,  perhaps  for  centuries  longer !  I  really 
wonder  this  did  not  occur  to  the  artist. 

On  the  whole,  I  like  the  Bayreuth  people.  The  barbers 
overcharge,  the  hotel-keepers  give  you  9.50  marks  instead 
of  ten  marks  for  a  gold  half-sovereign,  because  they  will 
declare  it  is  "  worn  " ;  and  the  children  wear  no  stockings. 
The  priests,  with  full  choir,  stop  and  sing  hymns  in  the 
streets  when  they  bring  out  their  dead  for  burial ;  and  the 
publicans  plant  the  cafes  amid  thick  pine-trees,  all  stuck  in

my  information  may  become  too  voluminous. 

As  I  sit  and  write  high  up  in  a  spacious  room  of  the  old 
Castle,  my  windows  open,  I  can  look  over  the  sleeping  city ; 
and  by  the  faint  moonlight  I  think  I  can  just  make  out  the 
Wagner  Theatre,  on  a  hill  beyond  the  town.  It  is  long  past 
midnight.  The  clocks  have  been  striking  what  I  believe  to 
be  half-past  two,  although  it  might  just  as  well  mean  four 
o'clock.  The  night  is  very  still ;  even  the  "  Vaterland " 
chorus  in  the  "  bier-garten  "  has  left  off  at  last.  The  Ring 
of  the  Nibdungs — Rheingold,  Walkiire,  Siegfried,  and 
Gdtterd'dmmerung — lies  open  before  me;  to-morrow  after- 
noon I  shall  see  the  Rheingold. 


VI. 

THE  NIBELUNG'S  RING. 

7. — Rheingold. 

THE  heat  at  Bayreuth  (August  1876)   was   intense.     The 
EMPEROR  OF  GERMANY,  who  attended  some  of  the  perform- 
ances, expressed  his  astonishment  at  the  eudu- 
406.

506  THE  NIBELUN&S  RING. 

"I  should  just  like,"  said  his  Imperial  Majesty,  "to 
go  down  below  and  see  where  my  Kapellmeister  EICHTEK 
sweats  " — and  he  went. 

Notwithstanding  the  excessively  sultry  weather,  a  vast 
company  of  Art  Pilgrims  ascended  the  hill  outside  the 
city,  and  took  their  seats  nearly  every  day  in  WAGNER'S 
theatre  for  a  month. 

Let  the  reader  become  with  me  in  imagination  one  of 
those  pilgrims.  If  I  cannot  make  the  sound  of  WAGNER'S 

music  ring  in  his  ears.  I  will  try  and  make  a 
407. 
WAGNER     vision  of  the  first  Wagner  Festival  pass   before 

np'  his  eyes.  As  I  contemplate  Bayreuth,  in  that 
same  month  of  August  1876,  I  perceive  the  whole  city 
to  be  given  over  to  a  kind  of  idolatry  of  WAGNER.  The 
King  appears  at  times  to  wave  incense  before  him.  LISZT, 
in  some  degree,  shares  the  homage.  With  his  venerable 
white  head,  he  looks  like  an  ancient  magician,  but  with  an 
eye  that  can  still  flash  fire,  and  a  commanding  carriage. 
The  town  is  hung  with  wreaths  and  flags ;  in  the  shops 
nothing  but  WAGNER  portraits,  busts,  medals  of  all  sorts  and 
sizes,  WAGNER'S  works,  WAGNER'S  Life  and  Genius,  and  an 
immense  German  and  French  literature  on  the  Niebelungen 
Saga. 

The  performance  of  the  Rheingold  will  live  long  in  my 
memory,  as  the  extreme  realisation  of  weird  beauty  steeped 


THE  RHINE  GIRLS.—  RHEINGOLD  !  507 

in    atmosphere    such    as  may  be    in    some   other   planet, 

flushed  with  sunset  or  moonrise.     This  music  is 

408. 

THE  RHINE  like  &  land  of  dreams,  into  which  the  spirit  breaks 
at  times,  and,  hurrying  back  a  million  of  years, 
discovers,  on  the  surface  of  far-off  seas,  or  dim  caverns,  the 
light  that  has  long  since  gone  out  for  ever.  The  elemental 
prelude  of  deep  and  slumbrous  sound  wafts  us  away  from 
all  account  of  time  and  space  of  the  present.  The  vast  hall, 
full  of  silent  human  beings,  has  been  touched  by  the  magi- 
cian's wand.  All  grows  dark,  and  the  dim  grey-green  depths 
of  the  Khine  alone  become  visible.  We  strain  our  eyes 
into  the  dimness,  and  are  aware  of  the  deep  moving  of  the 
Rhine  water.  The  three  Rhine  daughters  grow  visible, 
swimming  midwater,  swimming  and  singing,  guardians  of 
the  Rheingold.  What  unearthly,  unhuman,  magical, 
snatches  of  sweetest  song  !  There  is  at  last  realized  the 
creature  of  legend,  the  Undine  at  once  more  and  less  than 
human. 

The  hideous  King  of  the  Undergrounds,  or  Niebelungen, 

sits  watching  these  lovely  water-maidens — he  courts  them  in 

vain.     The  orchestra  weaves  on  its  divine  Rhine 

.  music,  without  which  we  almost  feel  the  scene 

KHEINOOLD  1 

must  vanish.  The  soft  cries  and  unearthly  but 
musical  laughter  of  the  Undines,  swimming  ceaselessly, 
begin  to  give  us  a  strange  feeling  of  limited,  monotonous 
life,  pointing  subtilly  to  the  difference  between  such  natures 


508  THE  KIBELUNG'S  RINti. 

and  our  own.  But  they,  too,  are  waiting  for  something. 
This  dim  green  water  is  growing  oppressive.  We  feel 
ourselves  immersed  in  its  depths.  At  first  it  was  a  dream 
scene  of  exquisite  beauty — now  it  is  almost  a  prison — 
in  another  moment  we  should  struggle  to  be  free,  but 
suddenly  the  Rheingold  begins  to  brighten.  A  shaft  of 
radiance  strikes  through  the  water.  The  Undines  scream 
with  joy.  The  Underground  King,  Alberich,  blinks  with 
astonishment.  Then  through  the  whole  depth  of  the  Rhine 
streams  an  electric  light — glowing  upon  a  distant  rock — 
dimmed  to  softest  yellow  only  by  the  water.  "  Rheingold  ! 
Rheingold ! "  a  wild  shout  arises — joy  of  the  Rhine  daugh- 
ters !  HAYDN  has  produced  the  effect  of  light  in  the  Creation 
by  a  great  burst  of  sound,  "  And  there  was  LIGHT  !  !  "  But, 
sublime  as  is  that  one  chord  on  LIGHT,  the  effect  here  is  far 
more  subtle.  We  have  been  kept  in  dark  water  for  half  an 
hour.  The  whole  system  is  made  to  pine  and  cry  out  for 
light.  It  comes  at  last — the  light  of  the  flashing  of  the 
Rheingold !  Every  fibre  in  the  body  quivers  with  it.  It  is 
as  oxygen  to  the  lungs.  The  eye  and  whole  nervous  system 
drink  it  in.  \Ve  could  shout  like  children  with  the  Rhine 
girls  over  the  joy  of  the  Rheingold  1 

The  whole  of  this  water-scene  is  of  indescribable  beauty, 
and  without  a  trace  of  vulgar  pantomimic  effect. 
A  lesser  man  would  have  made  the  Rhine  water

the  curtain  rises  we  can  hardly  see  anything.  Slowly  the 
eye  discerns  the  floating  women ;  but  we  still  follow  them 
chiefly  by  their  voices.  Alberich  is  hardly  visible ;  the  music 
itself  seems  to  keep  down  the  light;  but  then  the  dawn  of 
splendour  of  the  Rheingold  !  That  explains  all ;  the  effect 
is  consummate.  WAGNER,  it  is  evident,  has  superintended 
every  detail  and  every  nuance.  I  can  understand  now  his 
bursting  into  tears  when  the  Rhine  ladies  refused  to  enter 
the  new  invisible  machines  which  were  to  float  them  about 
in  mid- water. 

I  will  here  briefly  allude  to  the  plot  of  the  Rheingold. 
How  Alberich,  the  King  of  the  Undergrounds,  renounces

treasure  to  his  own  Underground  caverns,  there 
to  maltreat  his  wretched  hordes  of  slaves,  ^nd  compel  them 
to  turn  the  Rheingold  into  sumptuous  vessels,  amongst  them 
a  magic  helmet  and  a  Ring  whose  wearer  can  change  himself 
at  will  into  anything.  How  the  gods  meanwhile  have  been 
bribing  the  giants  with  the  promise  of  the  beautiful  Freia, 
their  sister,  to  build  them  their  Walhalla  Palace.  How  the 
giants  on  the  completion  of  the  palace  claim  Freia,  and  only 
give  her  up  upon  the  gods  extorting  the  Rheingold  from 
Alberich  and  his  undergrounds  and  paying  it  over  to  the 
monstrous  architects.  How  at  last  the  gods,  with  Freia,  go 
over  the  Rainbow  Bridge  into  the  Walhalla  to  the  sound  of

heavenly  music,  whilst  upon  the  ambrosial  air  comes  from 
afar  the  fitful  wail  of  the  Rhine  Daughters  : — 

"  Eheingold ! 

Clear  and  pure, 
Show  thy  glory  in  the  depths, 
There  alone  is  Truth  and  Trust, 

False  and  faithless  all  above, 

Who  rejoice    .....  1 " 

All  this  the  reader  may  possibly  be  familiar  with.  To  dwell 
upon  each  scene  is  here  impossible.  I  wish  to  notice  the  first 

employment  of  what  I  have  called,  in  Music  and 
ma  COLOUB  Morals  the  Colour  Art  of  the  Future.  The  eye 

is  prepared  for  the  lurid  and  horrible  interior  of 
the  Niebelungen  Caves,  where  the  scourged  slaves  ply,  amid 
shrieks,  the  ceaseless  hammer — by  white  clouds  of  steam  shot 
with  red  light.  This  is  used,  with  varying  intensities,  to  never 
pausing  music,  simply  as  a  sensuous  appeal  to  the  eye,  and 
its  effect  is  a  pyschological  marvel.  All  the  burden  of  horror 
and  pain  is  in  the  surging,  hissing,  crimson  cloud.  It  is 
the  terrible  bridge  over  which  the  spectator  passes  to  the 
realm  of  Niebelheim,  as  the  gods  pass  to  Walhalla  over  the 
rainbow.  Steam  or  any  other  medium,  shot  with  changing 
colour,  and  perhaps  accompanied  by  music — the  Colour 
Symphony — is  still  to  come ;  its  raw  elements  are  present 
in  the  sunset,  as  the  raw  elements  of  music  are  in  the 
sounds  of  nature,  and  the  cries  of  birds  and  beasts.  Wagner 
has  perhaps  unconsciously  flashed  the  first  line  of  the  new 
Art  upon  us  in  the  Rheingold, 


THE  RAINBOW  SCENE.  511 

Of  the  spiritual  beauty  of  the  "  Rainbow  scene,"  which  is. 

pictorially,  worthy  of  TURNER,  I   can   hardly   speak.     Yet 

even  here  the  fateful  curse  that  hangs  over  the 

413. 

THE  RAINBOW  Rheingold  and  all  who  touch  it — here,  in  the 
hour  of  joy  and  god-like  splendour — there  is  a 
hint  of  the  final  overthrow  of  the  Walhalla  and  the  "  Dusk 
of  the  Gods."  It  is  to  be  seen  in  the  crimson  Niebelheim 
light  upon  the  mighty  ramparts  and  towers — a  light  that 
gives  a  sober  tinge  even  to  the  rainbow — it  is  to  be  heard  in 
the  haunting  cry  of  the  Rhine  daughters  over  their  lost 
treasure,  which  makes  even  the  happy  gods  pause  on  the 
threshold  of  Walhalla.  It  is  felt  in  the  mingled  undertones 
of  the  orchestra,  breaking  forth  at  last  into  the  strong 
closing  bars  of  the  Rheingold.  A  terrible  firmness  of  pur- 
pose, beyond  the  control  even  of  the  gods  themselves,  is 
urging  forward  the  course  of  all  things  in  heaven  and  earth; 
none  may  go  back.,  none  may  look  behind.  The  old  Anangke 
— or  Necessity — of  the  Greeks  is  at  the  bottom  of  all,  and 
seems  to  say  alike  to  the  Rhine  daughters,  the  dwarfs,  the 
giants,  and  the  gods,  "  Go  forward ;  the  end  must  come ; 
what  will  be,  will  be." 

The  Rheingold  lasts  for  two  hours  and  a  half  at  a  stretch, 
during  which  time  there  is  no  pause  in  the  music,  but 
there  is  also  no  sign  of  fatigue  in  the  audience  who  sit  in 
rapt  attention  to  the  close.

Walkiire,  Brilnnhilde,  in  this  couple,  and  her  final  sacrifice 
of  Virgin  deity  in  their  cause,  this  next  drama  in  three  acts 
turns.  Let  us  enter  the  theatre  about  five  o'clock.  A 
fanfare  of  trumpets  outside  gives  the  signal,  The  lights 
are  lowered.  In  the  twilight  the  whole  assembly  seems 
aware  that  WAGNER  and  the  King  are  approaching.  In  the 
Royal  box  I  see  the  two  stand  for  a  moment  like  dark 
shadows,  the  King  bowing  once  to  the  people  amid  breathless 
silence,  broken  only  by  the  woe-burdened  chords  and  unquiet 
distant  thunderings  of  the  orchestra.

in  an  age  and  faerie  sphere  in  which  human  passion  has  to 
be  contemplated  apart  from  all  civilised  conditions.  We 
thus  follow  breathlessly,  without  shock,  the  inexorable 
development  of  the  various  phases  of  recognition,  self-aban- 
donment, confession,  and  ecstasy  which  follow.  The  wild 
music  flowing  to  the  wild  life  of  the  wandering  Siegmund, 
as  he  pours  it  all  out  to  his  new  friend  and  protectress, 
who  revives  him  with  a  cooling  draught,  consoles  him,  and 
already  claims  him  as  her  deliverer ;  the  entrance  of 
Hunding;  the  fight  between  him  and  Siegmund,  which  is 
to  take  place  on  the  morrow ;  the  sleeping  potion  admini- 
stered to  him  by  Siegliude,  and  the  long  scene  at  night, 
where  she  steals  out,  all  in  white,  to  Siegmimd — these 
are  graphic  and  awe-inspiring  situations ;  the  moon  spreads 
through  the  room,  and  the  fire  dies,  and  through  the 
open  door  are  seen  the  fair,  moon-lit  woods,  and  all  is 
peace — this  the  reader  must  imagine  for  himself.  Nothing 
more  searching  in  delineation  of  passion  was  ever  con- 
ceived than  this  scene  between  lovers  about  to  risk  all — 
with  fate  overhanging  them,  and  hearts  filled  alternately 
with  the  pain  of  dread  forebodings  and  an  inextinguishable 
love. 

As  the  last  spark  on  the  hearth  dies,  the  music  becomes 
flowing  and  deep,  like  a  broadening  river.  A  strange 
red  light — the  light  of  Wotan — falls  on  the  giant  oak- 
tree,  showing  the  hilt  of  a  sword  plunged  in  there  by  a 
mysterious  stranger.  He  who  could  draw  it  should  aloiie

free  Sicglindo  from  her  brutal  husband.  Siegraund  rises 
and  draws  it,  amidst  a  great  burst  of  triumphant  sound. 
This,  on  the  morrow,  should  give  him  victory  over  the  coarse 
Hunding,  for  the  sword  is  Wotan's  own,  hidden  there  for 
his  son  Siegmund.  The  deep  wealth  of  sound  upon  which 
the  lovers  are  now  buoyed  up  as  they  fall  into  each  other's 
arms  is  like  the  mingling  of  oceans  and  rivers  and  clouds ; 
and  the  strong,  terrible  chords,  to  which  the  curtain  again 
falls,  are  as  the  might  of  resistless  love,  hurrying  to  its 
fateful  close. 

The  second  act  reveals  to  us  the  wild  Brunnhilde — War 

Walkiire.     With  spear  in  hand  she  scales  the  rocks ;  the 

clouds  are  about  her;  she  shouts  to  her  com- 

416. 

BUUNNHILDE'S  panions,  and  her  voice  mingles  with  the  winds. 
As  she  mounts  each  crag  her  notes  rise  higher 
and  higher — a  melody  of  bewitching,  boisterous  wildness. 
How  Wotan  bids  the  War  Walkiire  defend  his  favourite 
Siegmund  in  the  coming  duel  with  Hunding;  how  Fricka,  his 
jealous  wife,  burns  for  the  death  of  Siegmund,  the  mortal 
bastard ;  how  the  god  gives  in  weakly,  and  bids  Brunnhilde 
destroy  him ;  how  Brunnhilde,  a  dear,  good  creature,  pro- 
tests, and  goes  at  last  to  her  mission,  clad  in  mail  and  scarlet, 
with  a  heavy  heart — must  be  told  in  few  words.  From  this 
moment  to  the  end  of  the  act  the  excitement,  without  pause, 
goes  on,  changing  in  form,  but  ever  increasing.  Now  the 
flying  lovers  rush  on  to  the  rocky  stage;  the  sound  of  Hun- 


THE  FIGHT.  515 

ding's  horn,  the  cry  of  his  dogs,  is  in  their  ears  j  then  all  is 
again  ecstasy ;  until  Sieglinde  breaks  out  in  a  strange  scene 
of  passionate  remorse  at  having  been  the  wife  of  an  unloved 
man.  Her  intense  love  for  Siegmund  makes  her  past  life 
seem  too  vile.  But  hark  ! — and  the  sound  of  dogs  and  horns, 
the  rushing  of  wind  and  crashing  of  branches,  swells  in  the 
orchestra,  and  Sieglinde  faints,  and  is  laid  resting  on  a 
rock.  Then  a  passage  of  unspeakable  solemnity  occurs  with 
the  re-entrance  of  Brunnhilde.  She  stands  before  Siegmund 
— come  on  her  fateful  errand — and  the  music  grows  sweet 
and  solemn,  with  the  majestic  Wotan  "  motif " ;  she  tells 
the  hero  that  whoever  looks  on  her  must  shortly  die;  that 
she  takes  the  warrior  to  Walhalla,  but  that  he  must  fall 
in  fight.  Measured  and  slow  as  fate,  yet  strangely  full  of 
tenderness,  is  her  terrible  message.  With  knightly  calm  he 
listens,  and  at  last,  with  a  burst  of  love  which  shakes 
Briinnhilde's  own  heart,  he  declares  that  he  will  kill  himself 
and  his  beloved,  but  they  shall  not  be  divided.  The  Walkiire, 
at  last  overcome,  and  faithless  to  Wotan's  command, 
promises  protection. 

But  the  orchestra  resumes  the  stormy  music ;  the  battle 

hour  approaches ;  clouds  hurry  restlessly  through  the  sky ; 

Hunding  is  close  at  hand  amongst  the  high  crags

yonder.     With   a  burning  kiss  the   hero  leaves

Sieglinde,   and   hurries  to   meet   the   foe.      She 
rises,  all  is  wild,  and  the  air  grows  stormy  and  dark  around

her ;  she  calls  Siegmund  wildly,  and  rushes  forward ;  but 
too  late,  she  never  sees  him  alive  again.  On  the  topmost 
rocks  we  hear,  behind  the  clouds,  the  warriors  shouting  and 
the  arras  clashing.  It  is  a  fearful  moment,  and  the  orchestra 
is  taxed  to  the  uttermost.  The  clouds  part  for  a  moment 
only — the  bright  Briinnhilde  is  seen  floating  above  her 
hero,  clad  in  shining  steel  and  crimson.  In  vain  !  Wotan 
himself  appears,  and  shatters  Siegmund's  magic  sword  with 
his  spear.  The  hero  is  slain.  The  clouds  now  roll  aside ; 
in  terrible  red  smoke  and  blinding  light,  the  angry  god 
stands  out.  At  a  word  Hunding,  the  coarse  hunter,  falls 
dead  before  him  ;  but  the  god  turns  upon  poor  Briinnhilde, 
and,  as  the  curtain  falls,  curses  her  for  her  disobedience. 

The  storm  music  and  the  thunder  roll  away  ;  and,  after  a 
tension    probably   unexampled   in    dramatic   art,   we  issue 

forth    into    the    now    cool    and    darkened    air,

is  THE  eighteen  hundred  people  disperse  upon  the  hill 
and  roadside,  and  discuss  for  an  hour  in  the 
temporary  cafes  their  experiences.  LISZT  I  found  with  his 
daughter,  MADAME  WAGNER,  and  other  ladies,  chatting  to  a 
group.  The  prince  and  poet  of  the  Romantic  School  has  a 
long  cigar  in  his  mouth  and  a  large  bock  of  beer  in  his 
hand.  People  hurry  up  and  are  introduced  at  times — he 
receives  all  cordially  with  "  Schon  !  Schon  !  "  I  remember 
that  WAGNER  was  loudly  called  for  at  the  end  of  the  second 
act,  but  did  not  appear.  But,  oddly  enough,  before  the  last

and  bowed,  and  was  cheered  wildly.

quite  unparalleled  in  its  wild  and  spontaneous  splendour. 
The  cries  and  shouts  are  hurled  from  rock  to  rock 
with  waving  of  arms  and  clashing  of  spears  and  shields. 
The  troubled  sky  is  in  ceaseless  motion,  the  air  is  filled  with 
boisterous  elemental  mirth,  and  the  bursting  cries  of  un- 
bridled animal  spirits  are,  somehow,  all  woven  into  a  kind  of 
chorus,  resting  upon  such  an  ocean  of  orchestral  sound  as 
has  certainly  never  before  been  heard  or  conceived  by 
mortals.  Amid  thunder  and  flashes  Briinnhilde,  dragging 
poor  rescued  Sieglinde,  now  suddenly  appears  on  the  stage, 
and  what  follows  must  be  merely  summarised.  The  despair 
of  Sieglinde;  the  devotion  of  the  tender,  reckless  Briinn- 
hilde, inconceivably  touching  symbol  of  the  devotion  which 
good  women  are  capable  of  for  each  other ;  the  wild  recru- 
descence of  joy  which  seizes  Sieglinde  when  Briinnhilde 
hands  to  her,  with  fervid  song,  the  fragments  of  Siegmund's 
magic  sword — all  that  is  left  of  him  now,  yet  enough  for 
vengeance,  enough  to  win  the  Rheingold  from  the  Giant 
Fafner,  enough  for  the  hero  Sieglinde  is  about  to  bear.

She  is  then  hurried  away  to  safety,  and,  with  the  appropriate 
recurring  strains  in  the  orchestra,  the  God  "Wo  tan  at  last 
approaches. 

The  favourite   Walkiire,    deprived   of   her   arms,   comes 

forth  to  learn  the  doom  of  her  disobedience.     Some  divine

been  drawn  earthwards  by  human  sympathy — she  will 
become  whole  woman  by-and-bye,  who  has  thus  stooped 
to  human  affection — but  earthly  love  shall  destroy  her 
divinity ;  and,  meanwhile,  parted  for  ever  from  her  sisters 
and  her  father,  who  still  love  her  fondly,  she  shall  sleep 
amid  wild  and  lonely  rocks  encircled  with  fire,  waiting  for 
the  lover  who,  dauntless,  shall  find  her  and  wake  her 
there,  and  make  her  his  earthly  bride. 

The  flight  of  the  sister  Walkiire  in  the  storm,  with  a  wild 
chorus  full  of  despairing  screams,  is  followed  by  a  protracted 
And  inconceivably  touching  parting  between  the  resigned 
Briinuhilde  and  the  father,  Wotan — whose  anger  has  died 
away  as  the  sunset  sky  has  slowly  faded  into  deeper  and  deeper 
grey.  Then,  to  long  drawn  out  and  enchanting  melody, 
Briinnhilde's  head  sinks  on  her  father's  breast,  and  his  mind 
wanders  back  to  the  happy  time  when  she,  the  War  Maiden, 
his  pride,  brought  new  warriors,  the  boldest  and  best,  to  fill 
the  Walhalla  courts.  The  poor  Walkiire  can  but  sob  that

she  has  loved  her  father  Wotan  and  Walhalla,  and  implore 
him,  if  she  is  to  become  a  mortal's  bride,  to  surround  her 
rock  with,  fire,  to  bar  her  from  all  but  the  bravest.  It  is 
now  almost  dark ;  a  faint  red  light  lingers  on  the  supple 
yet  lordly  form  of  Briinnhilde.  A  strange  swoon  seems 
to  have  already  seized  her;  the  god  lays  her  gently  prostrate 
on  the  rock,  then  waves  her  into  her  long  sleep.  Then, 
retiring  suddenly  to  the  back  of  the  stage,  he  calls  for  the 
Fire  God,  Loge ;  a  burst  of  fire  breaks  out  and  runs  round 
the  stage;  in  another  moment  the  whole  background  is  an 
immense  wall  of  rose-coloured  flame,  which  gradually  creeps 
round  the  rock.  To  the  most  enchanting  and  dream-like 
music  of  silver  bells,  harps,  and  flutes,  with  an  under-current 
of  bass  strings,  the  sleep  of  the  Walkiire  begins ;  the  god 
scales  the  rocks,  stands  for  a  moment  in  the  midst  of  the 
fire,  then  passes  through  it  out  of  sight,  as  the  curtain 
falls  to  the  silver,  peaceful,  unearthly  cadences,  repeated 
again  and  again,  swelling  and  falling,  and  ceasing  at  last 
leaving  the  heart,  after  so  much  fierce  storm,  at  rest. 


III. — Siegfried. 

The  grotesque  music  given  to  both  Mime  and  Alberich, 

like  so  much  of  WAGNER'S  misunderstood  reci- 
421. 

WAGNER'S   tative,   aims,  no  doubt,  at  following  the  inflec- 
tions of  the  human  voice  as  it  is  affected  often 
by  very  commonplace   moods,  as  well   as  by    the   meaner 


520  THE  NIBELUNG'S  RING. 

impulses  of  arrogance,  vexation,  anger,  and  spite.  What 
we  lose  in  musical  charm  we  gain  in  a  certain  ingenious 
sense  of  reality.  I  think  the  power  of  WAGNER,  the  solidity 
of  his  work,  largely  turns  upon  this.  He  is  never  afraid 
of  length,  of  silence,  even  of  dulness,  caused  by  protracted 
or  delayed  action.  Like  DE  BALZAC,  he  knew  well  how  to 
work  up  slowly  and  surely  to  a  consummate  effect,  and  his 
effect  never  hangs  fire,  nor  is  it  ever  liable  to  an  anticlimax, 
that  bane  of  second-rate  artists. 

A  cavern  rocky — somewhere  deep  in  a  forest — lies  before 

us ;  and  Mime  the  misshapen  thing — fit  brother  of  Alberich, 

the  lord  of  Niebelheim,  or  fog-land,  works  away 

at  a  forge  to  make  a  sword  fit  for — who  ?     In 

MIME  WOKKS. 

he  comes,  the  wild,  robust  child  of  the  forest — 
reminding  me  of  the  first  appearance  of  that  other  wild, 
robust  creation  Parsifal.  In  he  comes,  driving  a  fierce 
brown  bear  bridled  in  sport.  Mime  the  dwarf  shrinks  back 
— Mime,  who  'has  been  foster-father  to  this  Siegfried,  son  of 
Sieglinde  and  Siegmund.  He  has  brought  him  up  in  igno- 
rance of  his  parentage,  knowing  well  the  dash  of  Deity  in 
his  blood,  and  knowing  also  that  could  the  fragments  of 
the  magic  sword,  given  up  by  Sieglinde  as  her  most 
precious  legacy,  be  somehow  welded  together  again,  Sieg- 
fried, her  son,  would  be  able  to  wield  it  with  resistless 
might  and  slay  the  dragon  Fafner  who  keeps  the  gold. 

This   accursed    gold-heap — eternal    symbol    of    ill-gotten

wealth  and  the  curse  of  it — forms  the  magic  centre  around 
which  all  the  actors  in  this  cycle  of  dramas  consciously 
or  unconsciously  move. 

The  character-contrast  between  Mime  the  mean,  double- 
dealing,  cringing,  cowardly  creature  who  hopes  to  use  the 
young  hero  for  his  purposes,  and  Siegfried  the 

42o. 

MIME  AND  free,  noble,  daring  youth,  with  a  presentiment  of 
great  destinies  before  him,  both  are  drawn  in  large 
outline.  Great  distinction  of  type,  great  simplicity  of  con- 
ception and  straightforwardness  of  execution;  the  master 
is  sure  of  his  touches  and  lays  them  on  with  a  free  bold 
hand.  Siegfried  throughout  revolts  against  Mime — yet 
Mime  holds  secrets  which  he  burns  to  know.  Who  were 
his  father  and  mother  ?  What  means  his  wild,  secluded, 
lonely  life  ?  He  cannot  taste  broth  at  Mime's  hands  with- 
out disgust,  he  cannot  talk  with  him  without  quarrelling, 
he  can  hardly  bear  the  sight  of  him,  will  not  believe  that 
Mime  is  his  father  at  all;  wants  a  sword  that  he  can- 
not break;  will  have  the  fragments  of  the  magic  sword 
"  Nothung "  welded ;  shatters  Mime's  welding  of  them, 
proceeds  to  weld  them  himself. 

The  welding  of  Nothung,  hammer  on  anvil  in  the  gloomy 
424.  cavern,  with  the  regular  puffing  and  blowing

522  THE  NIBE 'LUNG'S  RING. 

every  blow  into  the  sword  Nothung,  produces  a  very 
singular  and  "seizing"  effect.  The  actors  appear  to  be 
entirely  lost  in  their  business — the  audience  have  come 
upon  a  forge  in  a  very  rocky  forest  cave — difficult  work  is 
going  on,  to  very  long-winded  accompaniment,  full  of  varied 
realistic  detail.  If  we  want  to  see  the  work  put  through 
we  must  stop ;  if  not,  we  may  go.  But  the  work  cannot  be 
hastened— the  welding  of  that  sword  is  the  turning-point  of 
the  drama — the  wielding  of  it  secures  the  gold,  the  ring, 
and  the  helmet ;  and  the  spell  of  these  secures  Briinnhilde 
for  Siegfried — the  transfer  of  these  treasures  wrecks  Briinn- 
hilde and  brings  on  the  final  catastrophe.  The  action  is 
delayed,  but  the  welding  is  thorough,  and  when  with  a 
mighty  stroke  the  anvil  is  cloven  in  twain,  we  know  that  the 
young  hero  is  at  last  fitted  with  an  irresistible  weapon,  and 
that  the  drama  has  moved  through  one  of  its  most  critical 
and  decisive  stages. 

The   Dragon's    Cave — the   summer    woods — the   coming 

together  of  the  various  people  interested  in  the  gold — these 

425.        are  the  elements  of  the  next  act.     There  is  the 

DRAGON'S    ^"anderer,   the    god    Wotan    in   disguise,    who 

CAVE.      originally  stole  the  gold  from  Alberich,  who  in 

his  turn  had  filched  it  from  the  Rhine  girls,  and  who  now 

thinks  he  may  get  it  back  somehow  from  Fafner  the  giant. 

Fafner,  in  the  form  of  a  great  dragon,  lies  on  it  day  and 

night.     There  is  Alberich,  the  first  robber,  hovering  about 


SIEGFRIED  APART.— MISE-EN-SCENE.  523 

the  Neid-hole,  or  cavern,  in  the  hope  of  getting  back  the 
treasure ;  there  is  Mime,  who  about  this  time  makes  sure 
of  the  prize  in  his  own  mind,  as  he  fancies  Siegfried  is  in 
his  power,  and  proposes  to  employ  him  to  kill  Fafner. 
Then  he  will  poison  him  with  a  draught,  and  clutch  both 
magic  sword  and  treasure. 

All  these  old-world  scamps  meet  and  talk  and  eye  each 
other,  and  plot  and  ask  riddles  and  give  hints.  Siegfried, 

meanwhile,  holds  the  key  of  the  great  enigma — 
SIEGFRIED  stands  completely  apart — alone  in  his  strength, 

simplicity,  and  might,  the  holder  and  wielder  of 
the  sword  Nothung — with  deep  scorn  in  his  heart  for  the 
pitiful  and  mean  schemers  and  quacks  by  whom  he  is 
surrounded,  and  with  an  innate  perception,  born  of  com- 
muning with  nature,  of  the  snares  they  are  laying  for 
him. 

The  grimness   and   hideousness  of    the  cavern  and   the 

Worm-dragon  seem  to  resume  the  spirit  of  all  the  unlovely 

wickedness  and  avarice  of  Siegfried's  rivals.     The 

MISE-EN-    glorious   sunshine,  the   glowing    foliage    of    the 

woodlands,   the    song   of  wild   birds,  symbolize 

the  spirit  whilst  providing  a  mise- en-scene  for  the  valour, 

the  victory,  and  the  love-musings  of  the  young  hero. 

The  Dragon  is  no  doubt  the  weak  point.     I  believe  MR.

DANNEEUTHER    gave    three    hundred    pounds    for    him   in 
London,  and  brought  him  over  with  the  utmost 

428. 

A  SORRT  care.  His  tail,  I  am  told,  was  worked  by  one 
man  inside  him,  and  his  jaws  by  another ;  but 
somehow  he  could  not  be  got  to  show  fight  at  the  right 
time.  He  was  a  poor  beast;  the  steam  came  out  of  his 
mouth  too  late ;  his  tail  stuck  half-way  on  the  wag,  and  he 
had  evidently  some  difficulty  in  opening  his  jaws.  He  was 
easily  slain,  and  rolled  over  conveniently  enough,  leaving 
the  treasure  in  the  hands  of  Siegfried. 

Otherwise  the  weirdness  of  the  whole  scene  was  indescrib- 
able. That  enchanting  summer  land — that  delicious  burst 
429.  of  woodland  melody — that  strong  contrast  be- 
tween  the  blazing  sheen  of  emerald  and  amber- 
lighted  trees  and  the  gloomy  cavern  hard  by — 
that  sudden  poetic,  trance-like  pause,  full  of  wild  birds  and 
love  dreams,  just  before  the  sharp  attack  on  the  Dragon, 
followed  by  the  repulsive  murder  of  Mime,  and  the  resump- 
tion of  the  same  bright  love  dream  immediately  afterwards : 
this  can  never  fail  to  impress  the  dullest  sensibility  with  its 
extreme  beauty.  VOGEL'S  Siegfried,  as  an  impersonation, 
was  on  a  level  with  MATERNA'S  Briinnhilde.  The  music  to 
which  the  curtain  falls  on  the  second  act,  as  Siegfried,  wild 
with  anticipation,  follows  the  bird  that  flies  before  him 
singing,  and  showing  him  the  way  to  Briinnhilde,  who  lies 
on  her  fire  girt  rock  waiting  for  him — that  ocean  of  summer

consciousness  of  first  love — is  beyond  these  halting  words. 

The  contrasts  which  follow  are  dramatically  admirable.

with  Siegfried,  who  suddenly  confronts  him  on  his  way  to

consummation  of  Briinnhilde's  union  with  the  upstart  demi- 
semi-god ; — follow  scene  after  scene  with  cumulative  effect. 
The  striking  episode  in  which  Siegfried  breaks  the  old  god's 
spear,  when  it  is  thrust  between  him  and  the  unknown 
object  of  his  passion;  and  finally  the  terrific  ocean  of 
crimson  flame  through  which  the  hero  bursts  fearlessly  to 
the  side  of  the  sleeping  Walkiire — truly  these  be  massive 
and  monumental  conceptions !  Like  great  world-types  they 
unroll  themselves  before  us  in  so  many  magical  scenes  of 
unsurpassed,  dramatic  and  daring  grandeur. 

I  suppose  it  will  be  generally  allowed  that  WAGNER  is  the 
greatest  master  of  love  duets  that  ever  wedded  words  to 
music.  The  absorbing  picture  of  love  and  jealousy  in 


526  THE  NIBELUNGS  RING. 

Lohengrin,  of  pure  and  impure  love  subtly  contrasted  in 
Tannhduser  —  passion  of  love  and  death  in 
Tristan  a. id  Isolde,  the  unique  passages  between 

LOVE    DU^TS. 

Parsifal  and  Kundry — passion  essentially  primeval 
touched  with  a  certain  divine  intensity  as  is  fit  in  demi-gods 
— like  Siegfried  and  Briinnhilde — these  are  essential  mani- 
festations of  dramatic  force  and  profound  intention,  beside 
which  even  the  love  passages  in  GOUNOD'S  Faust  and 
Marguerite  seem  like  mere  child's  play. 

The  moment  has  arrived.    The  majestic  Briiunhilde  wakes 
with  all  her  divine  war-maiden  instincts   still   upon   her; 

confronts  the  hero  who  is   to  win   her,  at  first 
432. 
THE        with  terror ;  realises  slowly,  painfully,  then  irre- 

R'  sistibly  and  ecstatically,  the  might  of  human 
passion,  and  surrenders  the  old  heroism  of  a  crumbling 
Walhalla,  and  the  dreams  of  god-like  power  and  indepen- 
dence, at  the  burning  touch  of  human  love.  Better  that 
touch  of  real  life  than  all  the  flimsy  visions  of  a  decaying 
mythology — nobler  the  sincerity  of  human  feeling,  that  seizes 
its  object  and  concentrates  its  sympathies,  than  the  vague, 
restless  wanderings  of  old  reprobates  like  Wotan,  or  the  war- 
lust  of  fiery,  death-hungry  Walkiire  such  as  Briinnhilde  was 
— such  as  the  bride  Walkiire  will  never  be  again.  Hear  her. 

"  O  Siegfried ! 

Lightener — world's  delight — 
Life  on  earth — 
And  laughing  lord, 
Leave,  ah !  leave  me  I  " 


THE  SURRENDER.  527 

And  Siegfried  but  replies : 

"  Awaken  Briinnhilde ! 
Waken  thou  maid ! 
Live  to  me,  laugh  to  me, 

Sweetest  delight : 
Be  mine  1  be  mine  1 " 

No  translation  seems  to  give  an  adequate  vigour  or  do 
justice  to  the  strength  and  passion  of  the  dialogue,  which 
ends  in  a  long  paean  of  triumph  as  the  curtain  falls  and 
Siegfried  takes  his  prize. 

Hail  thou  Sun 

That  shinest  around  me  ; 

Hail  thou  morn 

From  out  the  dark; 

Hail  thou  world 

That  wakes  Briinnhild'}, 

She  wakes  I  she  lives  I 

She  laugheth  back 

My  splendid  star, 

My  Briinnhilde's  glow. 

Mine  ever  mine, 

All  of  her  mine 

And  only  mine, 

(JBrunnhilde  throws  herself  into  Siegfrieds  arms.) 
Come,  life  of  me  I 
Thou  light  of  love ! 
Thou  laughing  Death  I

OF  THE

— blown  on  trumpets  outside  the  theatre,  rang  out  far  over 
hill  and  dale,  and  floated  like  an  ominous  blast  to  the  town 
below.  At  the  familiar  sound  the  people  flock  to  their  seats 
in  the  theatre.  The  first  melodies  of  the  Rkeingold  break 
from  the  orchestra,  and  the  Norns  or  Fates  are  seen  weaving 
the  last  of  their  ropes ;  they  see  as  they  weave  the  story  of 
Siegfried  and  Briinnhilde — they  see  the  gods  growing  old — 
they  trace  the  history  of  Wotan's  earth  love — they  start 
with  horror  as  they  at  last  see  the  flames  rising  in  a  vision 
round  Walhalla.  The  rope  breaks  ;  the  Norns  vanish. 

The    day   dawns   to   a   clear   subject   worked   in   skilful 

counterpoint,    and   the  farewell  scene  between  Briinnhilde

BHONNHILDE.  us>  jjer  sorrow  at  parting  is  almost  drowned 
by  her  feeling  of  pride  in  him  and  the  thought  of  glorious 
war ;  and  here  the  Walkiire  nature  breaks  out  in  her.  She 
would  fain  follow  him,  but  this  may  not  be ;  and  as  she  is 


THE  HOUSE  OF  HAGEN.  5:20 

about  to  be  left  again  on  her  fire-girt  rock,  she  scales  one 
height  after  another,  shouting  a  wild  and  ecstatic  adieu  to 
the  hero,  who  is  heard  galloping  away  to  a  strange  mixture 
of  Rhine  music  and  a  peculiar,  joyous,  scampering  subject, 
which,  together  with  his  horn-blast,  always  heralds  his 
coming  and  going. 

But  the  curse  of  the  Gold  is  upon  him,  and  death,  and 

worse   than   death,  is   brewing   for   him   in   the   house   of 

Hagen,  hateful  bastard  son  of  Dwarf  Alberich, 

4oi>. 

THE  HODSE  by  a  mortal  woman.  Hagen  lives  with  his 
brother  on  Rhine-banks,  when  Siegfried,  as  a 
wandering  knight,  appears  at  his  halls.  Hagen,  Ghunter, 
the  brother,  and  the  fair  sister,  Gutrune,  are  sitting 
together.  Hagen,  the  instrument  of  Alberich,  is  wholly 
bent  on  getting  back  the  Rheingold.  He  tells  Ghunter 
of  the  sleeping  Briinnhilde,  who  can  alone  be  approached 
by  Siegfried,  and  inflames  his  desire  to  seize  her.  At 
this  moment  Siegfried's  horn  is  heard;  he  enters,  and 
the  plot  thickens.  He  is  soon  given  a  drink  which  makes 
him  forget  every  woman  he  has  known  before,  even  poor 
Briinnhilde.  Siegfried,  thus  bewitched,  then  proceeds  to 
fall  in  love  with  Gutrune,  and  listens  to  the  tale  of  Briinn- 
hilde on  the  flame-girt  rock  with  astonishment,  swears 
friendship  to  Ghunter,  and  undertakes  to  assume  his  friend's 
shape  by  magic,  cross  the  flames,  seize  his  own  Briinnhilde, 
and  hand  her  over  to  Ghunter.

530  THE  NIBELUNG'S  RING. 

From  this  moment  the  horrible  plot  is  harrowing  in  the 
extreme.  No  art,  no  music,  no  magic  can  reconcile  us  to 

what  follows ;  the  horror  is  piled  up.     The  scene 
436. 

CAITURE  OP  changes.  Briinnhilde  waits  on  her  rock ;  hears 
>E'a  horse  and  Siegfried's  horn,  but  with  something 
jarring  and  false  about  it;  but  she  heeds  not  that,  he 
returns  !  The  fire  is  crossed,  a  warrior  appears  on  the 
height.  She  flies  to  throw  herself  into  his  arms — the  form 
of  Ghunter  is  before  her !  How  he  coolly  hands  her  over 
to  the  real  Ghunter,  who  is  waiting ;  her  horror  and 
bewildering  despair ;  his  callous  indifference  and  complete 
absence  of  all  memory  of  her,  which  she  cannot  revive  in 
him  ;  the  meeting  of  the  t\vo  couples,  Briinnhilde  and 
Ghunter  with  Siegfried  and  his  new  bride,  Gutrune ;  the 
terrible  scene  between  Briinnhilde  and  Siegfried  before 
the  household  and  retainers  of  Hagen,  in  which  she 
declares  Gutrune's  husband  to  be  hers  ;  the  jealous 
frenzy  of  Ghunter  and  the  death  of  Siegfried,  which  is 
now  plotted  and  presently  carried  out  by  stabbing  in 
the  back — all  this  it  is  impossible  here  to  do  more  than 
summarise. 

A  brief  and  exquisite  episode  between  the  Rhine-daughters 
and  Siegfried,  chiefly  a  treble  trio  by  the  floating  nymphs 
of  sustained  and  enchanting  beauty,  relieves  the  pressure  of 
horror  we  have  just  been  going  through  from  the  despair 
and  fury  of  Briinnhilde,  whose  wild  cries  and  heart-rending 
gestures  can  never  be  forgotten. 


THE  MURDER.— THE  END.  531 

Then  comes,  at  last,  the  beginning  of  the  end.     Siegfried, 

seated  with  Hagen,  Ghunter,  and  warriors,  drinks  of  a  cup 

which  restores  his  memory,  and  begins  to  relate 

A.Q7 

his  past  life  :  as  he  advances  in  his  narrative,  full 

THE  MURDER. 

of  wondrous  declamation  and  music,  he  at  length 
nears  the  Briinnhilde  episode ;  snatches  of  the  Walkiire  and 
the  fire-sleep  music  break  out ;  a  strange  fervour  seizes  him ; 
he  tells  of  the  embrace  on  the  rock,  and  his  mind  begins  to 
reel  with  sudden  perplexity.  But  it  is  enough !  At  this 
point  Hagen  stabs  him  in  the  back.  As  he  dies  his  thoughts 
grow  clear.  Briinnhilde's  love  returns — he  sees  but  her, 
dreams  of  her  in  his  dying  swoon;  although  she  is  not 
present — she,  his  first,  last  love,  fills  his  latest  consciousness. 

The   struggle  for  the  Ring  which  follows,  the  suicide  of 

Ghunter,  the  sudden  apparition  of  Briinnhilde,  introduce  the 

last  episode  of  striking  beauty.    The  scenery  from 

this  point  becomes  indescribable.     The  n.oon  is 

TUB    END. 

full  upon  the  ruffled  Rhine- waters ;  the  tall 
funeral  tapers  flash  on  the  steel  helms  of  the  retainers ; 
the  body  of  Siegfried,  clad  in  mail,  lies  in  the  middle  of  the 
stage ;  and  the  stately  form  of  the  Walkiire  is  isolated  by 
his  side,  as  the  crowd  falls  to  right  and  left. 

Whilst  an  immense  funeral  pyre  is  being  built  up  in 
the  background  beside  the  Rhine-waters,  Briinnhilde  makes 
her  last  reconciliation  with  Siegfried.  As  she  gazes  on  his 
pallid  face  she  reads  that  dying  recognition.  She  under- 

34  * 


532  THE  NIBELUNG'S  EING. 

stands,  at  last,  the  magic  spell  that  was  on  him.  Her  love 
towers  above  everything  else — she  stands  there  the  embodi- 
ment of  the  sublime  trust  in  love  beyond  sight,  that  believes 
and  lasts  out  against  all  adverse  shocks,  and  is  faithful  even 
unto  death.  She  has  known  divine  might  in  the  halls  of 
Walhalla,  she  has  had  the  power  of  the  Ring  and  the  power 
of  Gold,  and  enjoyed  all  fame  of  war  and  victory,  and  now, 
with  her  latest  breath,  comes  solemnly  forth  what  is  the 
conclusion  of  the  whole  drama,  "  Blessedness,  through  joy 
and  sorrow,  comes  to  us  from  Love  unquenchable  alone  ! " 

With  this  she  moves  in  the  moonlight  towards  the  Rhine. 
She  draws  the  Ring  of  the  Rheingold — the  cause  of  such 
grief  and  manifold  pain — from  the  hero's  finger,  and  flings 
it  back  into  the  Rhine,  from  whence  at  the  commencement 
it  was  snatched  by  Alberich. 

The  Walkiire's  black  war-horse  has  been  brought  to  her ; 
she  waves  high  a  flaming  torch,  and  hurls  it  upon  the  bier ; 
the  fire  rises  in  lurid  columns.  She  mounts  her  steed  and 
leaps  into  the  flames. 

At  that  moment,  in  the  awful  glow  of  the  flaming  pyre, 
the  waters,  still  flashing  with  moonlight  in  the  background, 
begin  to  swell  and  advance,  and  the  llhine-daughters,  sing- 
ing the  wildest  Rhine  music,  are  seen  floating  to  and  fro. 
Beyond,  a  ruddier  light  broadens,  until  the  distant  sky 
discloses  the  courts  of  the  Walhalla  in  flames.  With  a 
crash  in  the  foreground  the  house  of  Hagen  falls ;  and 
whilst  the  mighty  conflagration  flares  up  in  the  distance. 


A   SPEECH  BY   WAGNER.  533 

the  Rhine-waters,  to  rushing  music,  advance  and  submerge 
the  whole  of  the  stage. 

Thus,    with  a   scene   of  unequalled  dramatic  splendour, 

ends  the  fourth  and  last  immense  drama  jf  the  Niebelung's 

Ring.     This  is  not  the  place  for  fuller  criticism 

TcO«7. 

A  SPEECH  of  such  a  work.  At  the  close  of  it  the  j>ent- 
'  up  enthusiasm  of  the  public  rose  to  a  pitch  of 
frenzy.  They  stood  up,  and,  turning  to  the  Royal  box, 
which  WAGNER  had  left,  shouted  to  the  King,  who  remained 
seated  and  bowed  graciously.  The  plaudits  continuing,  His 
Majesty  motioned  to  the  stage.  The  people  turned,  and  in 
a  moment  WAGNER,  dressed  in  plain  black,  with  his  hat  in 
one  hand,  stepped  out  from  the  middle  of  the  curtain,  and 
stood  motionless  with  his  grey  head  uncovered  until  repeated 
cries  of  "  Sit  down  !  "  "  Sit  down  !  "  and  "  Hush  !  "  had 
calmed  the  assembly.  WAGNER  then  spoke  very  quietly, 
and  I  regret  that  not  hearing  him  quite  distinctly  at 
moments  I  am  unable  to  render  verbatim  a  speech  which 
has  doubtless  been  elsewhere  recorded.  I  understood  him 
to  say  he  had  taken  many  years  in  preparing  this  work  ; 
that  he  had  presented  a  Saga  of  the  Niebelung  in  the 
belief  that  it  dealt  with  subjects  peculiarly  congenial  to  the 
Germanic  races ;  that  a  new  and  national  development  of 
the  drama  was  now  within  their  reach;  he  believed  that 
they  had  been  satisfied  with  what  they  had  listened  to, 
so  that  it  had  been  to  the  many  assembled  there  a  real 


534  THE  NIBELUNG'S  UING. 

Festspicl.  He  then  thanked  the  King  for  his  support  and 
encouragement ;  and,  the  curtain  being  suddenly  lifted,  all 
the  crowd  of  musicians  and  actors  who  had  taken  part  in 
the  Festival  stood  ranged,  and  WAGNER,  turning  round, 
thanked  them  in  the  warmest  terms  for  their  devotion  and 
assistance. 

So  ended  the  first  great  Wagner  Festival,  held  at  Bay- 
reuth'in  1876. 

As  some  people  seem  to  have  considerable  difficulty  in 
mastering  the  plot  of  the  Nibelung's  Ring,  I  venture  to 
offer  a  rough  skeleton  account  of  it,  which  may  profitably 
be  studied  before  or  after  witnessing  the  four  dramas. 

L 

RHEINGOLD. 

SCENE  I. — The  sun  irradiating  the  depths  of  the  river,  becomes  in  the 
myth — mythos,  I  ought  to  say — a  concrete  treasure — Rhinegold.  It  has 
marvellous  properties,  and  if  stolen  and  forged  into  a  ring,  guides  its  owner 
to  all  the  hidden  gold-mines  of  the  earth.  But  he  who  owns  the  gold  must 
renounce  love.  Three  Rhine  girls  guard  the  gold.  Alberich,  King  of  the 
Undergrounds,  a  hideous  dwarf,  makes  love  to  the  Under- water  girls  of  the 
Rhine,  is  rejected,  renounces  love,  but  clutches  the  gold,  and  makes  ctf  with 
it  to  Nibelheim — fog-land — his  underground  caves. 

SCENE  II.— Wotan,  King  of  Gods,  tired  of  love,  has  employed  giants  to 
build  him  a  majestic  palace,  and  offered  them  Freia,  Goddess  of  Love,  as 
payment.  The  other  gods  refuse  to  part  with  Freia  when  the  palace  is 
done,  and  Wotan  has  nothing  left  which  the  giants  will  take  instead.  The 
clever  fire-god  Loge  hears  of  the  Rhine  gold,  now  in  Alberich's  possession. 
Offers  it  to  the  giants.  Offer  accepted,  and  Loge  and  Wotan  go  off  to 
steal  it. 

SCENE  III. — Loge  and  Wotan  enter  Nibelheim.     Alberich   displays   the 


WALKURE.  535 

gold  ;  also  a  cap,  which  enables  the  wearer  to  assume  any  form.  At  Logo's 
suggestion,  he  becomes  a  toad,  just  for  fun,  is  captured,  and  the  ring  and  all 
his  wealth  passes  over  to  Wotan,  but  not  before  the  ring  is  cursed  by  Alberich, 
and  destined  henceforth  to  bring  misery  and  disaster  to  its  owner. 

SCENE  IV. — The  gold  and  fatal  ring  are  got  rid  of  to  the  giants,  who  take 
the  whole  inpayment;  Freia,  who  gives  youth  and  joy  to  the  gods, is  released, 
and  the  gods  walk  processionally  into  their  new  palace,  over  a  beautiful 
rainbow  bridge.  Curtain  falls. 

II. 
WALKUUE. 

SCENE  I. — Opens  as  Siegmund,  a  son  of  earth-woman  by  god  Wotan,  staggers 
into  a  log  hut,  breathless,  and  falls  prostrate  with  fatigue.  Flying  from  his 
enemies,  he  has  found  shelter — but  wiisi  a  ?  In  Hunding's  hut.  Enter  Sieg- 
linde,  daughter  of  earth-woman  by  god  Wotan;  brother  and  sister,  unknown 
to  each  other,  converse.  Hunding  enters,  and  aL1  three  converse  The  situation 
dawns  on  them,  and  Hunding,  respecting  his  guest,  recognises  his  foe,  and 
summons  him  to  mortal  combat  on  the  morrow.  That  night,  in  a  stolen 
interview,  Sieglinde  and  Siegmund  arrange  matters ;  a  magic  sword  left 
sticking  in  a  big  tree  by  Wotan,  is  claimed  by  Siegmund  and  drawn  forth, 
that  being  the  only  provision  made  by  the  god  for  his  gallant  offspring.  TLo 
lovers  escape  together. 

SCENE  II. — Father  Wotan  parleys  with  the  war  maidens  anent  the  coming 
duel  of  Siegmund  with  Hunding.  Father  Wotan  parleys  with  his  wife  Fricka 
on  the  same  subject.  Fricka  is  mad  for  the  death  of  the  irregular  son 
Siegmond.  Wotan,  with  bleeding  heart,  at  last  yields,  and  Walkiire  Briinn- 
hilde  has  commission  to  get  him  well  slain  in  the  fight.  Warlike,  but  tender, 
Briinnhilde  appears  to  Siegmund,  and  tells  him  of  his  fate,  but  is  melted  at 
the  spectacle  of  the  despairing  lovers,  and  goes  over  in  disobedience  to 
their  cause,  protects  the  hero  in  the  duel,  but  is  foiled  by  Wotan,  who  comes 
in  as  a  most  detestable  dcus  ex  machind,  and  gets  his  own  son  killed  after  all. 
Briinnhilde  takes  care  of  poor  Sieglinde  about  to  become  the  mother  of 
Siegfried,  and  gives  her  the  fragments  of  the  magic  sword,  only  shattered 
by  the  might  of  Wotan.  Briinnhilde,  for  her  disobedience,  loses  her  divinity, 
and  is  laid  to  sleep  on  a  fire-encompassed  rock.  Having  stooped  to  love, 
she  is  now  handed  over  to  the  love  of  a  mortal,  only  the  lover  must  be  brave, 
and  will  have  to  get  through  the  fire  and  claim  her,  which  brings  us  to  the 
threshold  of  the  third  drama  Sieyfried. 


53G  THE  NIBELUNG'S  KING. 

IIL 
SIEGFRIED 

SCENE  I. — Sieglinde  has  died  giving  birth  to  Siegfried.  Mime  (Alberich's 
deformed  brother),  who  lives  in  a  wood,  has  sheltered  her,  and,  knowing  of  the 
secret  of  the  hero  she  has  given  birth  to,  his  demi-godhood,  and  the  invincible 
sword  he  is  to  wield,  the  fragments  of  which  are  in  Mime's  possession,  the 
shrewd  dwarf  brings  him  up  with  care,  and  intends  to  make  him  by-and-by 
slay  Fafner,  the  giant,  who,  in  the  disguise  of  a  dragon,  keeps  the  gold 
stolen  for  the  giants  by  the  gods  from  Alberich.  The  first  scene  concludes 
with  the  successful  mending  of  the  broken  sword  by  the  combined  efforts  of 
Siegfried,  now  grown  to  manhood,  and  his  foster-father,  Mime. 

SCENE  II. — All  parties  interested  are  now  found  lurking  about  the  hole 
where  Fafner  watches  the  gold.  The  old  scapegrace  of  a  god  Wotan  comes 
prowling  about,  partly  curious  to  see  his  grandson,  Siegfried,  who  is  to  wield 
the  magic  sword — partly  with  his  eye  on  the  gold.  Alberich  turns  up  at  the 
hole  watching  the  main  chance,  and  ready  to  clutch  at  his  lost  treasure. 
Mime  makes  sure  of  it  when  Siegfried  has  killed  the  dragon.  He  means  to 
bring  him  a  sleep-drink,  slay  him,  and  get  the  gold.  Presently  the  dragon 
is  slain.  Mime  offers  the  drink  ;  Siegfried  sees  through  him,  and  slays  him 
too.  Having  by  chance  put  his  finger,  stained  with  dragon's  blood,  to  hia 
lips,  he  suddenly  understands  the  cry  of  the  birds  in  the  branches.  One 
bird  sings  out  loud  and  clear,  and  tells  of  the  maid  who  lies,  fire-surrounded, 
on  a  rock.  Siegfried  follows  the  magic  bird,  who  is  to  lead  him  to 
Briinnhilde. 

SCENE  IIL — On  his  way  he  meets  Wotan,  who  opposes  his  spear,  to  test 
his  descendant's  prowess  and  power.  Siegfried  breaks  it  with  his  magio 
sword,  and  with  it  scatters  the  might  of  Walhalla.  He  reaches  the  fire-rock 
bursts  through  the  flames,  and  claims  Briinnhilde  as  his  brido. 

IV. 

GOTTERDASIMEUUNG. 

Siegfried  having  left  Briinnhilde  in  search  of  knightly  adventure,  comes 
to  the  Rhine  castle  of  Hagen.  There  he  is  drugged  with  a  magic  potion  by 
Hagen's  daughter,  Gutrune,  who  wants  to  marry  him.  Said  potion  causes 
him  to  forget  his  love  for  Briinnhilde  and  fall  in  love  with  Gutrune.  He

row  promises  to  go  with  her  brother,  Gunther,  and  capture  Briinnhilde  on 
her  fire-surrounded  rock  and  hand  her  over  to  Gunther.  Arrives  -with  him, 
seizes  Briinnhilde,  and  hands  her  over.  The  frightful  situation  is  then 
•worked  out  in  Hagen's  castle  by  the  Rhine.  Siegfried  appears  as  Gutrune's 
lover,  Gunther  as  Briinnhilde's ;  they  all  four  meet.  Briinnhilde  is  puzzled, 
and  falls  into  despair  at  not  being  recognised  by  Siegfried,  who  is  under  a 
spell.  In  his  life-time  the  harrowing  mystery  is  never  solved,  but  before  his 
assassination  by  Hagen  he  partially  recovers  his  memory.  Whilst  reciting 
the  story  of  his  life  he  is  suddenly  stabbed.  Briinnhilde  then  comes  on  the 
scene  to  find  him  dead ;  but  the  truth  that  he  has  been  bewitched  dawns 
•upon  her.  She  proclaims  him  tender  and  true  in  death.  They  heap  up 
logs  ;  he  is  hoisted  on  to  the  pile,  but  not  before  Briinnhilde  has  taken  the 
fatal  ring  from  the  hero's  finger,  and  cast  it  back  into  the  Rhine.  The  Rhine 
girls  appear  on  the  surface  singing.  The  air  darkens,  the  flames  rise. 
Briinnhilde's  war-horse  is  led  out  for  the  last  time  ;  horse  and  Walkiire  leap 
into  the  flames.  The  Rhine  swells  up  to  the  foot-lights,  washing  over  every- 
thing, and  extinguishing  the  funeral  pile  ;  and  the  house  of  Hagen — pillars, 
doors,  and  lintel — falls  into  ruin.

INTERLUDE 
ON   TANNHAUSSER    AND   LOHENGRIN. 

THE  overture  to  Tannhduser  and  the  prelude  to  Lohengrin 

were  the  first  fragments  of  WAGNER  which  arrested  seriously 

440         the  attention  of  people  in  England  about  1860, 


WAGNER'S    and  Jed   some  of   us  to  think  that  perhaps  he 

MUSIC, 

i860.  might  have  a  future  before  him.  The  French 
had  already  made  up  their  minds  that  he  had  none,  and 
M.  FE"TIS,  in  his  great  Dictionnaire  des  Musiciens,  had 
boldly  written  as  late  as  1866:  "To-day  the  transient 
curiosity  about  WAGNER  is  satisfied  ;  indifference  has  come, 
and  the  so-called  music  of  the  future  is  already  a  thing  of 
the  past." 

It  is  quite  surprising  how  little  even  good  musicians,  who 
studied  WAGNER'S  scores  and  tried  over  the  arrangements 


THE  DRAMAS  PLACED.  539 

a  quatre  mains  suspected  the  real  character  of  a  great  deal 
of  his  music.  I  distinctly  recollect  one  of  the  best  musicians 
in  England  declaring,  about  1859,  that  although  the 
beginning  and  end  of  the  Tannhduser  overture  were  admir- 
able, there  seemed  to  him  a  good  deal  of  chaos  about  the 
middle;  and  chaos  it  undoubtedly  sounded  as  it  used  in 
those  days  to  be  played  in  England.  The  secret  of  subduing 
the  strings  and  playing  the  high  notes  in  tune  pp,  thus 
striking  the  elastic  balance  of  the  whole  work,  allowing  no 
part  to  drop,  but  realising  the  grand  unity  and  true  subor- 
dination of  each  part  to  the  whole — these  things  were  but 
slowly  learned.  In  WAGNER'S  music  it  is  not  sufficient  to 
play  the  notes,  or  even  attend  to  the  p's  and  f's ;  each 
musician  must  understand  the  mind  of  the  composer — feel 
his  intention,  and  discover  the  secret  of  the  special  part 
which  he  has  to  play  in  the  whole.  The  Waguerian 
orchestra  is  not  a  machine ;  it  is  a  living  organism. 

The  Tannhduser  and  the  Lohengrin  are  the  two  first  of 

the  legendary  dramas  which  serve  to  illustrate  the  Christian 

chivalry  and  religious  aspirations  of  the  Middle 

TUB  DRAMAS  Ages,  in  conflict  on  the  one  side  with  the  narrow 

ideals  of  Catholicism,  and  on  the  other  with  the 

free  instincts  of  human  nature.     Parsifal  forms  with  them 

a  great   Trilogy  of  Christian   legends,  as  the  Ring  of  the 

Niebelungen  forms  a  Tetralogy  of  Pagan  Rhine  and  Norse 

legends.     Both  series  of  sacred  and  profane  myths  in  the 


540          ON  TANNHAUSER  AND  LOHENGRIN. 

hands  of  WAGNER,  whilst  striking  the  great  key-notes  of 
Paganism  and  Catholicism,  become  the  fitting  and  appro- 
priate vehicles  for  the  display  of  the  ever-recurrent  struggles 
of  the  human  heart — now  in  the  grip  of  inexorable  fate — 
now  passion-tossed,  at  war  with  itself  and  with  time — 
soothed  with  spaces  of  calm — nattered  with  the  dream  of 
ineffable  joys — filled  with  sublime  hopes;  and  content  at 
last  with  far-off  glimpses  of  God. 

But  in  these  dramas  all  is  vast  and  elemental.     The  feel- 

ings  are  mightier  and  more  intense  than  anything  on  earth  ; 

the   mould   of  the    characters   is   colossal.      All 

that  is   transitory,  personal,  accidental  in  love. 

IDEAL  TYPES. 

joy,  revenge,  despair,  seems  to  have  dropped 
away  as  we  gaze  at  the  rapture  of  Elsa  or  the  despair  of 
Tannhauser.  We  are  face  to  face  with  the  unalterable  types 
of  human  Tragedy;  each  phase  as  it  passes  resumes  the 
whole  of  what  is  true  and  always  true — essentially  the  same 
in  the  inmost  fibre  of  every  soul,  amidst  every  local  change 
of  time  and  circumstance. 

This  representative  character  lifts  Wagnerian  drama — in 
conception,  at  least — to  a  level  with  that  of  SHAKSPERE'S 
highest  flight.  I  do  not  compare  the  two  as  writers. 
SIIAKSPERE  had  only  the  stage  to  think  of,  WAGNER  wrote 
with  reference  to  music,  and,  although  sublime  in  parts,  his 
literary  work  is  very  uneven,  but,  couched  in  the  language 
of  myth  and  metaphor,  it  is  intensely  real,  and  has  that 


USE  OF  MYTH.  541 

one  quality  of  all  great  work,  it  appeals  to  what  does  tot 
change  in  the  heart  of  man  as  the  ages  roll  on — "  it  speaks 
to  time  and  to  Eternity." 


VIII. 
"TANNHAUSER"  AND  "LOHENGRIN." 

THE  drama  oi  Tannhduser  may  be  said  to  have  burst  upon 

WAGNER  with  the  force  of  an  imperious  inspiration.     He 

had  been  laying  siege  to  the  oracle  in  the  Flying 

44o. 

USE  OP  Dutchman  and  Rienzi,  but  the  answer  was  un- 
certain and  confused.  Essentially  a  man  of  his 
age,  filled  with  a  passionate  sympathy  with  its  desires  and 
the  prophetic  instinct  of  its  unreconciled  needs,  WAGNER 
had  been  restlessly  seeking  in  the  complex  histories  and 
clear  myths  of  the  Past  for  some  adequate  arena  for  the 
interpretation  of  the  Present.  He  had  long  felt  that  the 
life  problem  of  the  nineteenth  century  was  the  reconciliation 
of  the  Old  and  New  World  Spirits,  the  harmony  of  the 
Secular  and  Religious  life.  The  problem  has  apparently 
been  given  up  as  hopeless  by  the  new  ideal  school  of 
ROSSETTI,  MORRIS,  and  BURNE  JONES,  who  avowedly  are  dead 
to  the  present,  and  live  a  dream-life,  meditating  the  eternal 
Realities  of  Legend,  in  an  unreal  garden  of  the  Palingenesis. 


512        "TANNHAUSER"  AND  "LOHENGRIN:1 

But  with  them  the  Art  of  the  Present  is  used  to  glorify  the 
Myth  of  the  Past ;  with  WAGNER  the  Myth  of  the  Past  is 
used  to  illustrate  and  enhance  the  Life  of  the  Present. 

The  nearest  approach  to   WAGNER'S  use  of  the  myth  is 
to  be  found  in  TENNYSON'S  Idylls  of  the  King  where  the 

444.  simple   lines  of   the  old   narrative   are  used   to 
TENNYSON  inustrate  a  wide  range  of  modern  thought  and 
WAGNER,    feeling;  but  no  oppression  of  heart  is  lifted,  no 

problem  is  even  stated,  much  less  solved.  In  Tannhiiuser 
WAGNER  has  at  least  seized  with  unexampled  force  those 
two  leading  thoughts  with  which  our  age  is  struggling : 
First,  the  tremendous  empire  of  the  senses;  second,  the 
immense  supremacy  of  the  soul.  And  his  typical  knight, 
in  whom  both  these  fierce  currents  meet  and  mingle,  illus- 
trates the  conspicuous  failure  of  the  Roman  Christianity  to 
unite  both  streams  into  one  river  of  life. 

Protestantism,    though    doubtless    more    true,    with    its 
married  clergy  and  its  liberal  fees  to  the  secular  life,  is  only

and  right,  but  as  carnal  and  evil — the  Communion  Service 
is  still  in  the  spirit  and  mostly  in  the  very  letter  of  the

whatever  it  may  be  in  practice,  can  grapple  with  the 
Senses  alone,  but  it  is  by  crushing  them,  and  that  is  the 
ascetic  Romanism.  It  can  grapple  with  the  Soul  alone,  but 
it  is  by  isolating  it,  and  that  is  the  mystic  Romanism.  But 
how  to  blend  the  two  without  defrauding  either,  that  the 
Church  does  not  teach ;  it  has  no  theory  on  the  subject,  it 
addresses  itself  to  each  side  of  life  separately,  it  is  just 
where  ST.  SIMEON  STYLITES  or  ST.  BENEDICT  left  it  ages 
ago.  The  Romanist  or  Ritualist  is  quite  right  when  he 
says  we  must  go  back  to  those  times ;  with  our  present 
theories  we  must  either  go  backwards  or  forwards,  we  cannot 
stand  still. 

This  is  what  people  really  mean  when  they  say  so  often 

that  we  are  in  a  Transition  Age.     What  does  the  Church

development  of  tne  spirit  in  tne  silence  of  her  cloister, 
and  her  activities  are  confined  to  works  of  necessity, 
charity,  and  disciplinary  sacrifice.  This  may  seem  an  unfair 
account  of  Protestant  teaching  at  least;  and  so  it  is,  for 
happily  both  Protestant  and  Catholic  preachers  are  more 
human  than  their  own  theories,  but  their  theories  remain, 
and  their  real  antagonism  to  the  whole  truth  of  life  remains, 
and  it  is  reflected  in  the  sermons  that  are  commonly  heard 


544        "  TANNHAU8ER"  AND  "  LOHENGRIN.'* 

and  which  consist  mainly  of  the  STYLITES  or  the  BENEDICT 
theology. 

This  is,  in  a  word,  the  Counsel  of  Perfeation,  what 
Sunday  by  Sunday  we  have  mainly  to  listen  to  in  the 
pulpit : 

1.  Shun  the  natural  desires. 

2.  Work  out  your  salvation  in  meditation  and  prayer. 

3.  Labour  for  the  necessaries  of  life  and  for  the  poor  and 
sick. 

All  good  and  excellent;  but  such  platitudes  shrivel  like 
flies  in  an  oven  when  confronted  with  the  two  burning 
questions  of  the  day  : 

1.  The  Tremendous  Empire  of  the  Senses. 

2.  The  Immense  Supremacy  of  the  Soul ;  and  how  to 
reconcile  them. 

WAGNER,  I  need  hardly  say,  has  not  answered  the  ques- 
tion in  Tannhduser,  but  he  has  placed  it  before  us  with 
admirable  force  and  clearness,  and  shown  us  once  for  all 
how  helpless  and  incapable  the  logical,  if  not  infallible, 
Roman  Church  is  to  deal  with  it.

and  clearness.     The  whole  race  of  the  Ghibellines  is  summed 


THE  OVERTURE  TO   TANNHAUSER.          545 

up  iri  Tannhauser,  indomitable  knight — at  once  the  enemy 
and  the  spiritual  slave  of  Home — Pagan,  with  an  inex- 
haustible passion  for  the  world  and  all  that  is  in  the 
world,  an  insatiable  thirst  for  conquest,  an  ambition  put  to 
sleep  by  the  senses  for  awhile  only  to  break  out  into  wilder 
life  at  the  magic  call  of  free  poetic  minstrelsy — Catholic 
and  devotee,  by  a  reaction  as  tremendous  as  the  storm  of 
human  passion  which  sent  him  astray — strong,  reckless, 
thorough,  and  sublime  in  his  despair  to  the  last,  when  pity- 
ing heaven  touches  into  blossom  the  inexorable  staff,  and 
the  soul  of  Tannhiiuser  finds  in  heaven  with  his  beloved  the 
peace  and  mercy  denied  him  by  the  Vicar  of  God  upon 
earth.  Such  is  the  spirit  and  such  are  the  atmospheres 
that  seem  to  roll  and  unroll  before  us  like  clouds  of  black 
and  purple  crimson  and  opaline  fires  as  we  listen  to  the 
massive,  simple,  yet  richly-clothed  subjects  of  this  dramatic 
overture. 

First  leading  idea  of  the  overture — the  quiet  impassioned 
chant  of  the  Pilgrims  steals  out  of  the  distance ;  that  chant 
so  subtly  woven  into  the  changing  fabric  of  the  drama,  run- 
ning through  it  like  a  scarlet  thread,  now  associated  with 
the  stupid  mechanical  patter  of  dull  monks,  flouting  the 
merry  sunshine  with  their  sleepy  dirge;  now  giving  expres- 
sion to  Tannhauser's  hungry  repentance,  like  the  severe  yet 
pardoning  voice  of  a  recording  angel ;  now  in  the  deepen- 
ing twilight  touched  with  the  sad  hues  of  sunset,  and 
lifted  away  from  the  unhappy  knight  like  the  music  of 

35

heaven  heard  without  by  one  who  must  not  enter;  now 
goading  him  to  the  madness  of  despair  with  its  insulting 
hope  of  salvation  not  for  him ;  and  lastly  thundered  as 
from  heaven's  open  portals  like  a  great  judgment  on  the 
Papal  blasphemy  for  cursing  what  God  has  not  cursed — 
a  shout  and  clarion  of  joy  in  the  presence  of  the  angels 
of  God  over  one  sinner  that  repcnteth.  Such  is  the 
significance  of  this  incomparable  motive  of  the  Pilgrims' 
chant. 

The  procession  draws  near,  the  theme  develops  and  swells, 
and  the  procession  passes  and  the  chant  dies  away  to  give 

sudden  place  to  the  second  idea;  for  now  the 

4-18. 

THE  VENUS-  unhallowed  spells  of  the  Venus-berg  are  upon 
us,  the  vapours  rise  and  twist,  the  sprites  and 
forms  of  women  mingling  in  wild  dances  and  vanishing 
amidst  the  hissing  of  waterfalls  and  jets  of  rose  and  purple 
flame,  and  vistas  of  green  sward  between  rocks  of  crystal, 
and  far  within,  for  a  moment  unveiled  and  shameless, 
the  fatally  fair  old-world  enchantress,  Venus,  Satanic  rival 
of  Holy  Mary.  It  is  but  a  glimpse;  the  second  subject 
has  been  clearly  affirmed,  and  gives  place  to  the  third, 
which  is  the  free  element  in  Tannhauser's  spirit :  that 
immense  independence  which  at  one  time  asserts  his  will 
to  break  through  the  barrier  of  the  Church  and  enjoy  all 
earthly  pleasures,  and  at  another  refuses  to  be  held  by  the 
bonds  of  sense  and  will  back  to  heaven  and  grace.  Never

a  slave — that  is  the  key-note  of  Tannhiiuser's  song — the 
same  which  he  flings  at  Venus  in  the  first  act,  and  at  the 
assembled  knights  and  ladies  in  the  second.  Reckless, 
defiant  even  in  his  despair,  bursting  alike  the  bonds  of 
sacerdotalism  and  sensuality,  until  he  hails  his  last  judgment 
and  spiritual  emancipation  in  death. 

The  gentle  love  of  Elizabeth,  the  faithful  friendship  of 

Wclfran,   are   alone   absent   from   the   overture;    but    the 

one  is  really    as   much   drowned   in  religion  as 

the  other  is  absorbed   by  the  complete  useless -

ness  of  Wolfrau's  fidelity  and  the  ultimate 
triumph  of  Tannhauser.  The  overture  ends  with  a  sus- 
tained effort  which,  before  the  true  rendering  of  the  work 
was  understood  in  England,  subjected  the  audience  to  an 
almost  intolerable  strain.  The  pilgrims'  chant  is  at  last 
thrown  out  of  semibreves  and  crotchets,  into  prolonged 
breves  and  semibreves,  with  a  continuous  forte  and  an  inces- 
sant shrill  violin  accompaniment  of  wearing  yet  tireless 
activity  and  intensity.  This  is  the  divine  judgment  emphasis 
— this  is  the  reversal  of  the  Papal  decree  —this  is  the  re- 
demption of  human  nature  struggling  with  its  opposite  and 
indomitable  tendencies,  the  victory  that  has  overcome  the 
world,  the  earthly  and  heavenly  passion,  seen  for  the  first 
time  in  the  hour  of  death,  in  supreme  harmony  as  one  and 
indivisible.

ACT  I. 

After  this  immense  introduction,  which  at  once  satisfies  all 

our  keenly  aroused  sensibilities,  we  find  ourselves  in  that 

quiet  region  of  contemplation,  "  above  all  pain, 

vet  pitying  all  distress/'  whence  we  can  witness 

VENUS. 

undisturbed  the  pageantry  of  pleasure,  remorse, 
love,  sacrifice,  and  victory,  which  is  about  to  pass  before  us. 
In  the  glamour  of  roseate  hues,  smitten  with  the  green 
glow  as  of  prismatic  light  seen  through  ice,  with  vapours 
perfumed  and  aromatic  rising  in  white  clouds  and  dissolving 
in  thin  fleecy  tints  like  sea-foam,  the  grotto  of  the  Venus 
of  the  Yenus-berg  bursts  upon  us.  The  revelry  seems  at  its 
wildest.  We  see  the  whirling  of  Bacchantes,  but  all  is 
somewhat  dim  as  in  a  dream  or  a  dissolving  view.  The 
noisy  music  gives  place  to  an  exquisite  siren-strain — a 
chorus  of  twenty  bars  only — it  is  the  unearthly  echo  of 
magic  voices  calling  the  votaries  of  pleasure  to  the  un- 
hallowed delights  of  Holda,  the  dethroned  Venus,  once 
queen  of  heaven,  now  banished  in  disgrace  to  the  bowels  of 
the  earth  in  the  depths  of  the  Venus-berg.  Trenchant 
sarcasm  on  the  helplessness  of  ascetic  theology  to  mould 
the  "  great  glad  aboriginal  instincts "  into  its  system  ! 
Strange  Nemesis  of  the  religion  of  humanity,  that  the  love 
of  the  sexes,  made  beautiful  at  least,  if  not  holy,  at  Athens, 
should  be  relegated  by  Christian  Rome  to  the  infernal 
regions,  that  subterranean  heaven  of  the  Venus-berg,  where 


TANNKAUSER  AND    VENUS.  549 

love   might  lose   its  purity  without  losing   its  power   and 
become  bitter ! 

A  fatigue  and  stillness  fall,  we  scarce  know  how,  over  the 
scene,  the  music  droops,  a  white  cloud  rolls  across  and  veils 
the  groups  as  they  sink  on  the  mossy  banks  or  disappear 
into  the  rose  and  emerald  caverns.  A  last  faint  strain 
reaches  our  ears  and  dies  away,  we  are  alone  with  the  sleep- 
ing Tannhauser  and  his  enchantress  Holda. 

Tannhauser  awakes.  He  has  been  dreaming,  but  not  of 
Holda's  love,  not  of  the  grotto;  its  delights  are  worn  out

bells  that  tinkle  in  mountain  glens,  reminding 
him  of  the  happy  earth,  its  flowers — not  these  suffocating 
exotics — not  these  intense  and  slumbrous  perfumes — but 
fresh  woodlands,  the  horn  of  the  hunter,  the  notes  of  wild 
birds.  He  longs  once  more  for  the  nightingale,  and  the 
morning  sunlight  that  never  reaches  him  here.  And  then 
comes  one  of  those  delicate  perceptions  into  the  deeps  of 
human  nature  as  the  knight  explains  to  the  chiding  goddess 
that  a  mortal  cannot  always  enjoy  thus;  that  belongs  to 
the  eternally  young  and  vigorous  gods.  His  own  nature 
of  earth  is  ill  matched  with  pleasure  alone ;  it  clogs,  it 
pains  him ;  lie  pines  for  earth  with  all  its  sorrows,  ho 
aspires  from  the  heart  of  pleasure,  from  the  paradise  of  the 
senses,  to  the  life  of  action  and  sacrifice,  to  the  heaven' 


S50        «  TANNHAUSEE"  AND  "LOHENGRIN." 

of  the  soul.  The  dormant  energies  of  the  true  knight 
awaken  and  he  must  away.  The  famous  song  which  forms 
the  second  feature  in  the  overture  now  breaks  from  him  as 
harp  in  hand  he  confronts  the  angry  goddess,  and,  whilst 
singing  her  praises,  declares  that  he  will  go.  Again  a  subtle 
touch, — the  genuine  tribute  to  the  worth  of  Venus  as  far  as 
she  goes;  but  the  free  assertion  that,  isolated  alike  from 
the  activities  and  disciplinary  sorrows  of  earth,  she  fills  but 
a  part  of  life.  The  soul  reaches  out  from  the  garden  of 
the  senses  to  a  wider  world,  it  is  oppressed  by  the  o'erarch- 
ing  roof  of  the  Venus-berg  however  crystalline  and  rosy, 
it  sighs  for  the  blue  dome  of  the  illimitable  sky. 

All  this  is  unintelligible  to  Holda,  the  impersonation  of 

the  senses,  and,  like  many  an  angry  woman,  she  alternately 

chides  and  coaxes  and  storms,  not  perceiving  that 

her  power  is  gone  and  that  her  late  slave,  how-

ever  respectful,  is  free,  and  determined  to  remain 
so.  The  allegory  of  life  is  now  closely  clung  to  in  the 
skilful  dialogue.  Having  stormed  in  vain,  the  forsaken 
charmer  cries  bitterly,  "  Come  back,  come  back !  try  and 
believe  what  I  can  be  to  you  again." 

"  I  wish  no  longer  for  your  gifts." 

"Oh,  if  you  should  long  again,  do  not  let  your  pride 
keep  you  from  my  arms  !  " 

Then  summing  up  the  extreme  statement  of  the  revulsion 
of  feeling  which  inspires  him,  "My  longings  are  not  for 


CHANGE  TO   THE   UPPER  EA11TH.  551 

your  pleasures  but  for  battle.  Listen,  and  know  once  for 
all,  goddess,  that  I  seek  the  Grave  and  I  aspire  to  Death !  " 

"  And  if  Death  and«the  Grave  reject  you  ?  " 

"  Death  and  the  Grave  are  in  my  heart,  and  Repentance 
is  my  Peace  !  " 

"  There  is  no  Best  or  Salvation  for  you.  I  alone  can  give 
you  Peace  and  Heaven." 

Then,  in  a  climax,  the  final  note  of  the  situation,  nay, 
the  key-note  of  the  whole  drama,  is  struck. 

"  Goddess  of  the  Senses,  in  thee  is  not  my  Rest,  but  in 
Mary!"  At  the  name  of  the  most  blessed  Virgin,  her 
successful  rival,  a  loud  clap  of  thunder  shakes  the  grotto, 
and  a  dense  cloud  rolls  over  the  stage,  and  Tannhauser  finds 
himself  alone,  but,  as  the  thick  white  vapours  part,  the  whole 
scene  has  shifted. 

One  of    those   sudden    atmospheric    changes    in   which 

WAGNER  revels  now  takes  place,  reminding  us  of  the  change

EAKTH.     when  Siegfried  finds  her  there. 

The  grotto  of  the  Venus-berg  has  vanished,  with  its  purple 
shadows  and  rainbow  lights,  and  dim  recesses  of  mystery 
and  underground  magic — the  free  summer  woods  in  the 
glory  of  May  sunshine  are  before  us,  an  old  baronial  castle 
crowns  one  of  the  near  declivities.  Tannhauser  finds  him-

land  slope  reclines  a  young  shepherd,  the  tinlde  of  sheep- 
bells  mingles  with  the  artless  notes  of  the  rustic  pipe.  He 
is  skilfully  woven  into  the  drama  with  his  new  life 
of  the  spring  and  innocence  and  free  sweet  nature,  and 
forms  a  subtle  link  between  the  artificially-lighted  midnight 
of  the  Venus-berg  and  the  bright  woods  and  mountains  of  a 
smiling  earth.  The  shepherd  sings  in  his  quaint  melody  of 
his  dream  he  has  had  of  a  longing  to  follow  Dame  Holda 
into  the  Venus-berg — symbol  of  an  universal  experience,  it 
is  the  rustic's  vague  idea  of  the  artificial  luxury  and  dis- 
sipation of  great  cities.  He  awakes  (happily  for  him)  to 
the  sweet  routine  of  the  summer  pastures,  the  woodland 
notes,  the  rustic  flute. 

Play  on,  thou  simple  boy  ;  the  two  worlds  that  meet  in 
yonder  knightly  soul  are  not  for  thee ;  thou  wilt  never  know 
the  depth  either  of  his  agony  or  his  joy — it  is  not  given  to 
everyone  to  explore  the  magic  haunt  of  the  Venus-berg,  and 
then  surrender  at  discretion  to  Holy  Mary  1 

The  chorus  of  the  pilgrims  taking  up  the  first  subject 
now  approaches.  Solemnly  the  cowled  monks  pass  in 

front   of  the   shrine,   uttering   a  prayer   to   the

PILGRIMS    crucified   One,    and   a  greeting    to    the    Virgin 

mother.  To  Rome  they  are  bound,  to  seek  free 
grace  and  rest  in  absolution  from  sin  at  the  hands  of 
Holy  Church.  The  chant  is  the  very  embodiment  of 
Tannhauser's  own  aspirations,  and  as  the  pilgrims  disappear,

he  falls  at  the  foot  of  the  crucifix  and  takes  up  the 
burden  of  the  melodious  prayer.  Faint  strains  from  the 
distant  pilgrims  come  wafted  on  the  air,  a  sound  of  holy 
bells  is  in  his  ears,  his  soul  is  bathed  for  the  first  time,  after 
how  many  years !  in  the  sweet  and  recreating  emotion  of 
penitence  which  seems  to  restore  him  to  himself,  and  he 
vows  never  to  rest  till  he  too  has  found  in  a  pilgrimage  to 
Rome  that  pardon  and  peace  which  Rome  alone  can  give. 

Suddenly  hunting-horns  break  up  his  meditations,  and  a 

gay  troop  headed  by  the  Landgrave  and  his  knights  come 

thronging   down   the  mountain   slope,    and  find 

4o5» 

HUNTERS  the  pilgrim  Tannhauser  absorbed  in  prayer. 
The  influence  which  others  have  upon  a  man's 
thoughts  about  himself  is  now  happily  illustrated.  Tann- 
hauser, now  recognised  as  the  famous  m'^strel  knight  by 
the  Landgrave  and  his  friend  Wolfran,  at  first  will  not  hear 
of  joining  them.  He  is  absorbed  in  his  own  thoughts  of 
repentance ;  he  is  lost  for  ever  to  the  world.  Gradually 
the  joyous  greetings  assure  him  that  his  old  companions 
know  nothing  of  his  sin,  his  sorrow,  or  their  causes — he  is 
sympathetically  won,  his  sensitive  heart  catches  the  light 
and  fire  of  their  good-fellowship.  Some  of  us  may  remember 
those  masterly  moments  in  MR.  LIVING'S  acting,  when,  as 
Eugene  Aram  or  the  hero  of  the  Bells,  he  has  managed  at 
moments  to  forget  his  own  crime  and  feel  almost  innocent 
and  upright  in  the  reflected  sympathy  and  ignorance  of 


554        "TANNHAUSEK"  AND  " LOHENGRIN." 

those  who  believed  him  so ;  and  is  this  not  true  to  life  ? 
Does  not  a  man  feel  twice  guilty  when  found  out  ?  Is  he 
not  often  redeemable  before  the  brand  has  been  put  upon 
him,  but  not  afterwards?  To  be  accepted  as  innocent  is 
sometimes  almost  as  soothing  to  a  broken  spirit  and  a  con- 
trite heart  as  confession  and  absolution ;  and  do  we  not  all 
exercise  a  sort  of  absolution,  binding  and  loosing  from  sin  ? 
The  Landgrave  and  the  merry  hunters  seem  to  toss  the  life 
and  doings  in  Venus-berg  away  from  Tannhaussr;  they 
know  nothing  of  them.  For  a  moment,  as  he  listens  to 
their  free  joyous  talk,  the  past  seems  wiped  out.  They 
remind  him  of  his  brilliant  victory  in  song  before  he  dis- 
appeared from  among  them — of  Princess  Elizabeth,  who  had 
acknowledged  herself  won  by  his  knightly  qualities,  and 
who  is  ready  to  welcome  him  back.  At  the  sound  of  her 
name  his  whole  soul  bounds,  Venus  is  effaced,  Holy  Mary 
vanishes,  Elizabeth  seems  now  the  idol  ready  to  absorb  and 
satisfy  those  senses  profaned  in  the  Venus-berg,  and  that 
soul  so  lately  given  in  ascetic  fervour  to  the  Invisible  and 
the  Divine. 

ACT  II. 

The  joyous   prelude  to  the  second  act  contains,  at  the 
eleventh  and  following  bars,  one  of  those  magic 

t  KG 

passages   which   WAGNER   seems   able  to  throw 

ELIZABETH.     r 

in  at  will.     It  is  the  essence  of  a  heart  bounding 
with  joy,  and   is   worked   into  the  accompaniment  where 


ELIZABETH.  555 

Elizabeth  greets  the  minstrel  hall,  so  full  to  her  of  joy,  and 
the  memories  of  Tannhauser's  triumph  in  song. 

The  great  hall  of  the  minstrels  in  the  Wartburg  is  before 
us  :  a  wide  prospect  of  wild  woodland  and  hill  is  seen  from 
the  spacious  open  verandah,  and  the  fair  Elizabeth  enters, 
attired  in  flowing  white,  her  countenance  radiant  with  joy. 
In  one  of  those  broad  and  free  melodic  recitatives  so 
suitable  to  that  vast  amount  of  thinking  aloud  which  fills 
WAGNER'S  operas,  Elizabeth  describes  how  her  heart  was 
won  by  the  strains  of  the  minstrel  knight  Tannhauser.  To 
her  presently  enter  Wolfran  and  Tannhauser.  The  shock 
is  almost  too  sudden  for  the  maiden  Princess,  as  Tann- 
hauser throws  himself  at  her  feet;  she  implores  him  to 
leave  her,  but  in  another  moment  her  scruples  are  over- 
come by  his  passionate  entreaties.  He  seems  to  yield 
himself  entirely  to  this  new  situation,  nor  is  the  spell  broken 
when  Elizabeth  asks  where  he  has  been  and  what  he  has 
been  doing. 

"  Far  away,"  he  answers,  "in  a  distant  land.  The  veil  of 
oblivion  has  forever  fallen  between  yesterday  and  to-day — 
everything  in  the  past  has  vanished ;  only  one  thing  remains 
painted  upon  the  darkness — the  glory  of  your  perfection 
that  I  now  salute,  yet  never  thought  to  see  again."  Eliza- 
beth still,  with  a  touch  of  maidenly  reserve,  tries  in  vain  to 
check  her  own  raptures  at  his  return,  but  ends  in  that  full 
expansive  utterance — that  majestic  strain  so  nobly  intense 
and  pure  (such  a  contrast  to  the  feverish  sensuality  of  the 


556        "  TANNHAUSER"  AND  "LOHENGRIN." 

Venus-berg  music),  in  which  her  noble  love  finds  at  once  its 
expression  and  solace.  Her  reticence  gives  way.  She  is  not 
afraid  to  tell  him  now  all  the  strange  growth  of  new  feelings, 
vague  longings,  her  sadness  at  his  absence,  her  want  of 
interest  in  all  but  him,  her  broken  slumber,  her  waking 
tears,  her  maddening  memories ;  and  yet  throughout  she 
remains  so  simple,  so  pure,  so  guileless,  that  Tannhauser 
feels,  for  the  first  time,  what  the  true  love  of  the  pure  woman 
might  be  to  a  man.  Satisfying  all,  yet  lifting  all  into  a  region 
of  harmony  and  delight — not  enervating  but  renewing  and 
ennobling  all  things,  and  forming,  indeed,  tbe  soul's  missing 
link  between  earth  and  heaven  !  What  wonder  if  in  that 
moment  the  magic  Venus  and  the  mystic  Mary  are  alike 
forgotten.  The  love  duet  rolls  on  impassioned,  and  yet 
strongly  cast  in  an  almost  Mozartian  mould  of  regularity,  in 
which  strophe  and  antistropbe  are  taken  up  alternately  by 
the  lovers,  and  whole  phrases  occur,  ending  with  the  perfect 
cadence,  and  repeated  without  variation  as  in  the  most 
orthodox  Italian  scena.  "We  must  recollect  that  Tannhauser 
is  not  Lohengrin,  and  still  leans  more  to  the  recognised  form 
than  any  of  WAGNER'S  later  operas.  But  here  I  cannot 
think  that  the  regularity  of  form  is  in  the  least  out  of  place, 
or  in  conflict  with  the  sense  and  admirably  dramatic  finish 
of  the  episode,  which  will  not  suffer  by  comparison  with  any 
predecessor  of  any  school. 

At  the  close  of  the  duet  Tannhauser  leaves  the  stage,  and 


THE  LANDGRAVE.  557 

the  Landgrave  finds  Elizabeth  and  bids  her  prepare  for  the 

reception  of  the  whole  court  to  witness  a  contest 
4o7. 

IRE       between   various   bards — amongst    whom   Tann- 

'  hauser  will  of  course  be  found.     Elizabeth  will 

have   to    crown    the   victor.      The    pageantry    which    now 

follows,  accompanied  by  the  famous  assembling  march,   is 

of  its  kind  unequalled  in  the  annals  of  opera. 

The  Tournament  of  Song  brings  us  to  perhaps  the  most 
connected  suite  of  melody  in  all  WAGNER'S  works.  The 
458.  march,  which  so  largely  contributes  to  the  popu- 
CESSION!U,  ^ar^y  °f  this  opera,  moves  on  with  a  rhythm 
MAKCH.  an(j  a  richness  worthy  of  the  gorgeous  display 
of  pages  in  mauve,  scarlet,  white,  and  purple — of  ladies 
with  delicately  contrasted  court  trains  of  canary-yellow, 
blue,  dove- grey,  with  touches  of  crimson  velvet,  plumes, 
and  blaze  of  jewels  ;  troops  of  knights  with  retainers  steel- 
clad  with  shining  helmet  and  falchion.  On  a  throne  the 
Landgrave  takes  his  seat,  with  Elizabeth,  the  Queen  of 
the  Song  Tournay,  at  his  right.  The  bards  with  their 
harps  are  ranged  in  front,  and  seated,  Tannhauser  amongst 
them;  and  as  the  rainbow  crowd  continues  to  defile  slowly 
into  the  spacious  hall,  and  seems  likely  to  fill  every  part 
of  it,  a  joyous  chorus  takes  up  the  burden  of  the  march, 
and  pours  forth  the  most  exhilarating  strains  in  honour  of 
the  Landgrave  and  the  approaching  festival  of  song — not 
a  touch  of  foreboding,  not  a  trace  of  sadness  to  warn  us  of 


558        "  TANNHAUSEE"  AND  " LOHENGRIN." 

the  impending  catastrophe.  The  music  runs  chiefly  in  the 
metallic  major  key  of  five  sharps,  full  of  exulting  joy  and 
expectant  triumph. 

We  now  approach  a  scene  which  almost  every  critic  has 
found  to  be  a  disappointment.     The  music  improvised  by 

459.  the  bards  is  considered  dull.     It  might  have  been 
TnB    ,    less   stiff  and    more   melodic.      Even  Wolfran's 

MI  N STEEL  8 

MUSIC,  music,  usually,  at  least,  as  fine  and  melodic, 
if  not  more  so,  than  Tannhiiuser's  own,  is  tame  and 
formal,  and  so  is  Walter's,  but  it  seems  to  us  all  this 
is  for  a  purpose.  The  splendid  assembling  melody  just 
traversed  passes  into  the  arid  and  artificial  praise  of  woman's 
love,  as  a  thing  too  exquisitely  exalted  to  be  approached ;  or 
in  fact,  to  have  anything  to  do  with  the  senses  at  all.  The 
conception  and  the  language  are  both  exaggerated  and  false, 
and  the  arid  music  betrays  its  real  heartlessness ;  it  is  the 
fitting  prelude  to  the  over-glowing  and  wild  bound  of 
sensuous  melody  which  is  about  to  break  from  Tannhauscr 
in  vindication  of  the  senses. 

The  exact  casus  belli,   or  triangular    conflict,  between 
Chivalry,  the  World,  and  the  Church,  is  here  caught  and 

460.  stated  for  us  with  quite  surprising  force.  Chivalry 
CHIVALRY,  jn  ij-s  religious  mood  converted  every  woman  into 

HIE  WORLD, 

TOE  CHURCH.  a  VIRGIN  MARY.  The  praises  of  Love  had  then 
to  be  sung  in  this  attenuated  atmosphere,  in  which  the  senses 


CHIVALRY,   THE   WORLD,   THE  CHURCH.      559 

could  not  breathe.  It  was  like  playing  Othello  without  the 
Moor  of  Venice ;  it  was  the  futile  attempt  to  wed  the  natural 
love  of  the  sexes  to  the  Church's  ideal  of  celibate  purity, 
and  the  greater  the  collision  with  reality  and  practice,  the 
stronger,  the  more  conventional  became  the  futile  attempt. 
Love  is  the  subject  proposed  to  the  bards  in  competition. 
Wolfran  declares  that  in  the  presence  of  Elizabeth's 
beauty  his  heart  dissolves  in  prayerful  dreams.  There  is 
the  source  of  all  delight — the  balm  of  all  grief.  He  aspires 
to  worship  and  die  for  the  lady,  but  views  with  horror  the 
notion  of  rashly  troubling  her  with  any  wild  desires.  Tlrs 
little  piece  of  strained  humbug,  sung  by  one  who  probably 
does  not  believe  a  word  of  it,  is  greeted  by  the  crowd, 
•who  certainly  do  not  practise  it,  with  much  applause  : 
"  We  praise  thy  noble  song  !  "  Tannhauser  now  replies ; 
at  first  keeping  within  bounds,  and  giving  a  natural 
expression  to  a  legitimate  sentiment,  he  remarks  that  he, 
too,  has  felt  the  love  of  woman,  but  that,  so  far  from  not 
troubling  her  with  desire,  he  conceives  that  this  is,  after 
all,  the  root  of  the  matter ;  that  if  a  man  could  not 
understand  that,  he  could  not  know  much  about  love. 
For  his  part,  he  glories  in  it,  and  has  no  fear  or  mis- 
giving about  it. 

It  is  characteristic  of  Tannbauser  that,  having  spoken 
this  half  truth,  he  goes  no  farther;  and  Walter  cuts  in 
with  the  other  half  truth,  and  utters  his  platitudes  about 
virtue,  meaning  by  virtue  continence.  Ho  denounces  the 


560        "TANNHAUSER"   AND  " LOHENGRIN." 

notion  that  woman's  love  ought  to  have  anything  to  do  with 
the  senses,  and  thus  places  his  own  conception  in  antagonism 
with  Tannhauser's. 

Such,  indeed,  was  the  work  and  the  influence  of  the 
Church  of  the  period.  There  was  no  one  to  step  forth  and  lilt 
the  two  half  truths  into  a  higher  region  of  holy  and  healthy 
unity — by  proclaiming  the  consecration  of  sense  by  affec- 
tion and  self-restraint,  instead  of  its  extinction  or  corrup- 
tion by  abstinence  and  emotional  mysticism.  No  one  could 
then  and  there  solve  the  problem  which  Protestantism  has 
after  all  only  half  solved,  retaining  a  theory  but  half  con- 
sistent with  its  practice,  and  the  consequences  to  Tannhauser 
and  Elizabeth  were  quickly  fatal. 

If  the  Venus-berg  had  done  nothing  else  for  Tannhauser, 

it  had  at  all  events  taught  him  one  lesson  that  he  could

wings  of  a  strange  knowledge  into  furious  opposition,  and, 
casting  all  caution  to  the  -winds,  breaks  though  the  formal 
stupidity  of  his  rivals  into  an  assertion  of  what  is,  at  least, 
true  and  blameless  in  itself,  that  man  as  man  is  constituted 
specially  to  love  woman  as  woman.  The  fine  trait  of  Eliza- 
beth's mute  instinctive  assent  to  this  passionate  assertion  is 
dramatic  and  touching — it  is  the  unconscious  purity  of  a 
simple-minded  and  pure  woman  assenting  to  a  natural  fact. 


TANNUAUSEE  SPLITS  ON  THE  ROCK.        561 

She  is  soon  taught  better  by  the  burst  of  indignant  horror 
that  breaks  from  the  conventional  crowd — "Silence  his 
madness  !  "  Poor  Tannhauser,  thus  bullied  by  the  crowd, 
condemned  by  his  friend  Wolfrnn,  defied  to  single  combat, 
loses  his  head,  and  utters  the  exaggerated  statement  of 
what,  if  it  had  been  left  alone,  would  after  all  have  been 
true  and  fair  enough,  though  not  the  whole  truth  about  love. 
Forced  into  opposition,  and  wild  with  admiration  and  desire 
for  Elizabeth,  he  flies  at  a  bound  into  the  praise  of  Venus. 
The  songs  of  the  enchanted  mountain  are  in  his  ears,  and 
force  themselves  in  wild  snatches  through  the  agitated 
orchestra — his  voice  climbs  boldly  up  through  the  famous 
and  free  melody,  in  which  he  praised  Venus  at  the  moment 
of  his  departure.  Alas  !  it  is  also  the  knell  of  that  noble 
love  for  Elizabeth,  which  might  have  lifted  him,  but  which 
he  must  also  shortly  abandon  for  ever;  and  Tannhauser,  the 
too  bold  champion  of  nature  and  nature's  rights,  falls,  in 
the  moment  of  his  perfervid  but  almost  healthy  protest,  a 
victim  to  the  combined  incapacity  of  the  Church  and 
Chivalry  to  reconcile  without  emasculating  the  secular  and 
religious  impulses  of  our  nature. 

At  the  unhappy  name  of  Venus  in  Tannhauser*s  song, 
all  the  accursed  and  sensual  horrors  of  the  Venus-berg  are 
instantly  associated  with  the  minstrel  knight.  Elizabeth 
herself  perceives  that  his  position  is  untenable.  The  dying 
mythology  at  once  hurls  Tannhauser  from  the  heaven  of 
Christian  grace.  Swords  are  drawn,  and  the  saintly  Eliza-

beth  can  only  throw  herself  between  her  outcast  lover 
and  his  would-be  murderers!  Tannlmuser  has  now  got 
thoroughly  confused  himself.  He  has  been  irresistibly  im- 
pelled to  speak  an  irresistible  truth.  Yet  that  truth  in  that 
form  was  evidently  sin — deserved  punishment — cried  for 
penance  and  divine  pardon.  "THE  TREMENDOUS  EMPIRE 
OF  THE  SENSES,"  "the  strong  man  armed,"  begins  to  confess 
a  mightier  power, — "THE  IMMENSE  SUPREMACY  OF  THE

saint,  an  infuriated  mob,  an  offended  God. 

I   shall   not   attempt   to   describe   the   glowing  pages  of 

chorus  in  which  this  complex  situation  is  rendered.     Just 

as   the  scene  is  growing  a  little  too  tense  and 

harrowing,  without  in  the  valley  is  heard  a  chant 

TO  ROME! 

of  young  pilgrims.  It  is  the  refrain  of  the  great 
subject  of  the  overture  which  binds  the  whole  of  the  opera 
together  with  a  quite  magical  unity.  Before  that  sweet, 
unearthly,  familiar  strain,  a  silence  falls  upon  the  turbulent 
citizens  in  the  great  hall.  Some  repair  to  the  wide  open 
verandah  to  see  the  pilgrims.  But  to  Tannhauser's  highly- 
wrought  mood  that  chant  is  as  the  voice  of  heaven — he, 
too,  remembers  his  sudden  vow  to  become  a  pilgrim  and 
repair  to  Rome,  where,  at  the  hands  of  the  Holy  Father, 
after  due  penance,  he  may  perchance  find  some  dawn  of 
hope,  and  be  purged  from  his  grievous  sin. 

So,  as  he   passes   swiftly   out   of  the  hall  to   meet   the

pilgrims,  with  a  great  shout  from  the  assembled  throng, "  To 
Rome  I"  the  second  act  closes.

It  is  the  wayside  crucifix  of  the  first  act — no  longer  a 

scarcely  solemn  or  pathetic  object,  lost  in  the   thronging 

463.       glories  of  the  bright  morning  woods  in  spring,

•WAYSIDE  • 

CRUCIFIX,  autumn  twilight,  it  stands  out  grim  and  dark, 
and  all  the  scene  has  grown  sad  and  sombre.  Wolfran 
advances  towards  the  shrine  in  search  of  Elizabeth,  who  is, 
since  the  departure  of  Tannhauser,  ever  to  be  found  praying 
there  alone,  and  alone  she  still  would  be.  She  mutely 
waves  Wolfran  aside,  thanking  him  for  his  friendly  sym- 
pathy, but  relapsing  into  silent  and  absorbed  prayer.  On 
the  evening  wind  comes  again  the  floating  chant  of  the 
pilgrims,  now  returning  from  Rome.  The  maiden  rises, 
and  listens  in  startled  excitement  and  intense  expectation. 
The  sweet  and  majestic  chant  reaches  its  climax  as  the 
pilgrims  defile  before  the  crucifix.  Elizabeth  watches  each 
hooded  figure  with  increasing  despair.  He  is  not  there. 
As  the  last  passes  she  feels  that  the  bitterness  of  death 
has  come  and  passed  with  them,  and,  falling  upon  her 
knees,  she  prays  that  her  last  earthly  longings  may  be 
forgiven,  and  that,  white  and  free  from  stain,  she  may  be 
soon  received  into  the  heavenly  kingdom,  and  that  her 
beloved  may  also  find  grace  at  the  last.  Once  more  Wolfran

approaches  her  respectfully,  but  she  needs  not  his  support. 
Her  step  does  not  falter  now;  the  last  touch  of  human 
frailty  has  left  her ;  she  is  sensible  to  no  earthly  blandish- 
ments, the  heavenly  bridegroom  has  claimed  her  for  hia 
own,  and  gentle  death  will  soon  lead  her  into  his  presence. 

As  we  listen  to  the  exquisite  stream  of  pure  melody  which 
flows  once  only  from  the  flutes  and  clarionets  as  Elizabeth 
slowly  descends  into  the  valley  and  disappears  towards  the 
Wartburg,  we  are  irresistibly  reminded  of  Longfellow's 
exquisite  translation: 

O  Land!  O  Land  !  for  all  the  broken-hearted 
The  mildest  herald  by  our  fate  allotted 
Beckons,  and  with  inverted  torch  doth  stand 
To  lead  us  with  a  gentle  hand 
Into  the  land  of  the  great  departed, 
Into  the  Silent  Land  1 

This  solemn  and  peaceful  scene  is  followed  by  one  even 
more  composed  and  restful — more  dignified  it  could  scarcely 
be.  The  terrible  sorrow  and  sublime  resignation  of  Eliza- 
beth seem  to  have  weaned  Wolfran  from  all  his  earthly 
desires,  and  he  has  ceased  almost  to  regret  the  love  of 
Elizabeth  for  himself,  whilst  committing  her  to  the  care 
of  Heaven  in  his  incomparable  song  to  the  evening  star.  In 
the  deepening  twilight  he  prays  that,  as  she  so  wills  it,  she 
may  be  taken  from  a  world  of  pain  and  sorrow  into  the 
eternal  joy,  and  there,  in  the  trackless  fields  of  light,  which 
seem  to  mortals  the  very  homes  of  the  sweet  and  solemn 
starlight,  she  may  find  the  heavenly  and  fadeless  day. 


ENTER   TANNHAUSER.  505 

We  have  all  this  time  been  unconsciously,  and  with 
consummate  dramatic  art,  prepared  for  the  final  climax. 

Wolfran  checks  his  harp,  as  a  wayworn  man  of

eyes,  his  squalor  and  unsteady  gait,  tell  or  im- 
mense sufferings  and  privation,  bodily  and  mental. 

Wolfran  scarcely  recognises  Tannhauser  in  the  strange 
figure  before  him. 

"  Who  art  thou,  solitary  one  ?  " 

"Who  am  I?  I  know  thee  well — Wolfran,  the  famed 
minstrel." 

The  touch  of  bitterness  reminding  his  friend  of  the  arti- 
ficial song  of  love  which  called  forth  his  own  passionate  and 
disastrous  protest,  is  retaliated  with — 

"  Darest  thou  retrace  thy  steps  unpardoned  ?  " 

"  Fear  not,  my  famous  bard,  I  seek  not  thee ;  but  I  do 
seek  a  man  to  show  me  the  way." 

"What  way?" 

"  The  way  to  the  Venus-berg.'' 

In  another  instant  Tannhauser  has  passed  from  bitterness 

to   confession ;    and   as   Wolfran    inquires   concerning   his 

465.         pilgrimage,  he  unburdens  himself  freely  in  the 

TANNFEssioN'8  f°ll°wing  magnificent  oration,  which,  as  a  simple 

AND  DEATH,    piece  of  dramatic  declamation,  deserves  a  high 

rank.     We   repeat,   that  WAGNER'S   drama  is   of  its  kind 

equal  to  its  music;   it  will   repay  careful   study,   and   we 


566        "TANNHAUSEfi"  AND   "LOHENGRIN." 

cannot  forbear  giving  here  a  free   translation,   with   con- 
necting narrative : 

"  Listen !  Wolfran,  listen  !  With  a  heart  more  fervently  penitent 
than  ever  was  heart  of  pilgrim,  I  sought  the  road  to  Home  An  angel — 
ah,  woe  is  me  ! — had  rooted  out  the  pride  of  sin;  but  I  longed  to  expiate 
that  pride  in  deep  abasement.  I  longed  for  the  grace  denied  me,  in 
order  to  ease  the  bitterness  of  that  angel's  tears  for  me,  a  sinner !  The 
rough  way  selected  by  the  most  contrite  pilgrim  seemed  all  too  easy  for 
me.  When  he  chose  the  soft  grass  for  his  bare  feet,  I  sought  the  sharp 
stones  and  thorny  places  for  mine.  When  he  slaked  his  thirst  in  cool 
rivulets,  I  only  drank  in  the  fiery  torrent  of  the  sun.  Whilst  he  prayed 
to  heaven,  I  shed  my  life-blood  in  honour  of  the  Most  High.  When  the 
travellers  rested  in  the  inn,  I  was  stretched  without  in  ice  and  wind  and 
snow.  I  went  like  a  blind  man  through  the  magic  plains  of  Italy.  I 
did  it  all  because  I  thought,  in  dying  to  the  world,  by  contrition,  to 
soothe  the  weeping  of  my  dear  angel.  I  arrived  at  Eome.  I  approached 
the  holy  throne.  I  bowed  in  prayer  and  self-abasement  on  the  threshold 
of  the  sanctuary.  The  morning  broke.  I  heard  a  chiming  of  bells 
and  a  chorus  of  celestial  voices ;  the  whole  temple  seemed  filled  with 
praise  and  fervent  joy,  for  plenary  indulgence,  grace  and  pardon  were 
promised  to  the  multitude  of  penitents.  Then  I  saw  him,  God's  Vicar 
upon  earth  1  We  grovelled  in  the  dust  at  his  feet.  I  saw  him  give 
pardon  to  thousands  of  sinners  like  me,  and  they  rose  up  absolved,  and 
oh,  how  happy  !  And  I  drew  near.  My  head  was  bared ;  I  smote  on 
my  breast ;  I  said,  '  God  be  merciful  to  me,  even  to  me :  God  forgive  the 
criminal  pleasures — the  crime  of  the  senses,  the  unsubdued  desires.'  In 
my  agony  I  implored  the  Holy  Father  to  loose  me  from  the  chain  of  my 
sins  ;  and  God  knows  my  soul  was  pierced  through  at  that  moment  with 
many  sorrows.  And  His  Vicar  whom  I  besought  made  answer  thus, 
Wolfran,  only  thus :  '  If  thou  hast  shared  these  criminal  joys — if  thy 
heart  has  been  seared  with  Hell's  own  fire — if  thou  hast  been  in  the 
Venus-berg,  there  is  an  end  of  it  :  thou  art  damned  for  ever.  Even  as 
this  dry  staff  of  my  crozier  will  never  blossom  more,  so  neither  shall 
salvation  ever  blossom  for  thy  soul  in  hell.'  At  these  words  I  fell 
senseless  to  the  earth  as  one  dead.  When  I  came  to  myself  I  was 
alone  in  the  vast  temple.  It  was  night ;  I  heard  a  pilgrim  chant  of  joy 
and  salvation ;  those  holy  strains  filled  me  with  horror.  I  fled  from 
that  lying  hymn ;  it  fell  chill  upon  my  shuddering  soul,  and  seemed  to 
freeze  my  heart  to  ice.  Then  suddenly,  with  irresistible  violence,  I  felt 


TANNHAUSER' S  CONFESSION  AND  DEATH.     567 

myself  drawn  back  to  that  burning  enchantress  who  had  once  fillad  me 
with  such  unspeakable  ecstasy.  I  return  to  thee,  sweet  Venus — my 
only  consoler.  I  come,  I  come  to  thy  nightly  entrancing  pleasure,  to  thy 
glittering  court,  where  all  thy  beauties  smile  to  greet  me,  for  evermore, 
throughout  eternity  1  " 

"  Unhappy  man  1  "  cries  Wolfran,  who  sees  that  his  friend  is  under  a 
ppell  and  going  mad.  He  tries  to  stop  his  growing  exaltation  as  he 
invokes  Venus. 

"  Thou  hearest,  my  love,  my  goddess  1  All  men  curse  me.  Guide 
thou  my  steps."  The  white  Venus  cloud  begins  to  pass  over  the  stage  ; 
then  comes  the  wild  cry  of  the  sirens,  now  no  longer  soft  and  seductive 
as  of  yore,  but  almost  harsh  and  strident,  like  the  voices  of  women 
roughened  in  the  bitter  life  of  the  barren  senses.  But  Tannhauser's  head 
is  gone. 

"  Ah  1  heavenly  perfume — delicious  voices  !  I  am  yours  !  Come, 
come,  ye  nymphs ;  I  se*e  your  joyous  forms  1  Crown  me  with  pleasures  ! 
I  feel  the  secret  fire  in  all  my  veins.  I  know  their  soft  low  light — it  is 
the  enchanted  mist  of  the  Venus-berg — the  reign  of  love !  "  At  that 
moment  the  vision  of  Venus,  stretched  on  a  bed  of  roses,  appears  for  an 
instant,  and  Tannhauser  is  with  difficulty  restrained  by  the  strong  arms 
of  Wolfran  from  rushing  towards  her.  For  the  last  time  she  calls  him. 
But  now  songs  of  the  pilgrims  are  heard  in  the  valley — the  Venus-berg 
was  but  an  enchantment  of  the  senses.  Tannhauser  listens  and  gazes 
transfixed  as  a  funeral  procession  draws  near.  At  the  sound  of  prayer 
Venus  and  her  crew  vanish.  The  Pagan  deity  is  after  all  ousted  by  the 
Christian  martyr.  Elizabeth  has  prayed  for  Tannhauser  with  her  dying 
breath.  Elizabeth  has  interceded  for  him  on  earth  :  his  good  angel  in 
heaven,  his  victorious  saint.  Her  prayers  have  been  heard.  For  a 
moment  only  the  magical  form  of  Venus  had  flashed  out  and 
passed — another  form  now  fills  the  heart  and  brain  of  the  ruined 
knight.  Elizabeth,  lying  dead  upon  her  bier,  is  borne  in.  As  the  fair 
corpse,  strewn  with  flowers,  is  set  down,  the  sun  breaks  out  and  reveals 
a  glorious  summer  day.  The  pilgrim  strain  rises  once  more  to  heaven, 
and  Tannhauser,  whilst  the  last  dimness  clouds  his  eyes,  worn  with 
disease  and  suffering,  staggers  to  the  bier  and  falls  prostrate  in  death  by 
the  side  of  his  beloved.  A  line  of  young  pilgrims  bearing  a  budding 
staff,  in  token  of  his  supreme  forgiveness,  pass  singing : 

"  Blessed  is  the  pure  virgin  who  has  joined  the  glorious  company 
of  the  angels.  Blessed  is  the  sinner  for  whom  she  has  prayed  and 
won  heaven's  pardon."  And  then  the  united  assembly  reply,  re-echoing 


568        "TANNHAUSEB"  AND  "  LOHENGRIN." 

the  great  Pilgrim  Chorus,  heard  first  in  the  overture,  and  last  over  the 
corpses  of  the  faithful  lovers : 

"  The  sinner  has  received  the  pardon  of  heaven  ; 
He  enters  into  the  rest  of  the  blessed  ones." 

It  would  be  difficult  to  add  to  such  a  close  as  this.  The 
parable  seems  at  last  fully  worked  out.  The  noblest  nature, 
46G.  filled  with  the  genuine  experiences  of  both  ex- 
PHILoF°PHT  tremes  °f  ltfe>  seeks  f°r  guidance  and  counsel  at 
TANNHAUSER.  the  hands  of  Rome,  and  is  rejected.  The  last 
incompetence  of  Roman  Catholicism  to  deal  with  life  has 
been  demonstrated,  and  the  reductio  ad  absurdum  of  its 
method  is  reached  in  the  Pope's  heartless  and  stupid  speech. 
Certain  sins  by  Rome's  decree  are  venial,  others  are  mortal ; 
roan  has  made,  and  man,  in  the  name  of  God,  administers 
the  scale  of  punishment  which  he  has  made.  The  whole 
system  is  here  exhibited  as  not  alive,  but  mechanical,  and  as 
a  gross  outrage  upon  the  rights  of  the  human  conscience 
arid  the  spiritual  facts  of  the  soul.  In  Tannhauser  this 
inhuman  management  produces  despair  and  worse  crime, 
when  a  higher  vision  is  suddenly  opened  up,  and  above  the 
dream  of  the  senses,  above  the  anathema  of  the  Pope — 
somehow  inseparably  connected  with  human  love,  but  with 
human  love  deprived  at  last  of  all  its  lower  conditions — the 
sweet  pardon  comes  home,  as  it  were,  on  the  wings  of 
angels,  and  the  weary  pilgrim,  rejected  on  earth  but 
received  in  heaven,  passes  to  rejoin  the  best  beloved  in  the 
peace  of  God.

THOSE  who  see  TRANSIT  BSTANTIATION,  the  blood  real  or  the

ToTA^on  the  Prose'  The  P°etl7  of  the  great  Romanist 
REAL.  dogma  shines  out  in  that  cycle  of  Middle- Age 
legends,  derived  originally  from  the  Welsh  bards,  into  which 
the  French  Trouvares  poured  the  spirit  of  the  new  chivalry, 
leaving  the  later  Germanic  singers  to  invest  their  lays  with 
a  spiritual,  not  to  say  theological,  significance.  In  the 
legend  of  Parsifal  and  the  Holy  Grail,  transubstantiation 
is  no  longer  seen  as  the  lowest  degradation  to  which  a 
miracle-monger  can  subject  a  pathetic  symbol.  It  rises  at 
once  to  the  highest  level  of  poetic  inspiration.  It  becomes 
the  immortal  expression  of  the  courage,  self-sacrifice,  and 
purity  of  the  ideal  Christian  knight. 

The  story  of  the  sacred  quest,  and  the  guardianship  of 
the    "  real   blood "  in   its   varied   developments,   sums    up

endeavour,  patience,  failure,  and  aspiration.  The 
Incidents  belong  to  an  eternally  recurring  class.  The 
Characters  remain  in  their  vast  outline  so  many  phases  of 
the  human  soul.  The  Moral  is  the  moral  of  human  life  as  it 
repeats  itself,  essentially  the  same  under  all  Protean  changes 
of  time  and  place.  It  is  this  representative  quality  that 
has  so  impressed  WAGNER  with  the  force  and  superiority 
of  legend  or  the  mythus  to  present,  in  a  condensed 
and  simple  form,  the  feelings  common  to  our  nature. 
There  they  appear  raised,  by  situations  purely  ideal,  to 
their  highest  degree  of  intensity.  The  love  of  all  women 
is  in  Elsa, — their  jealousy  and  revenge  is  in  Ortrud ;  the 
abandon  and  despair  of  all  noble  and  blighted  natures 
in  Tannhauser,  their  nobility  and  thirst  for  action  in 
Lohengrin. 

But  the  reader  must  now  grasp  the  elements  of  the 
narrative  itself,  as  it  rises  out  of  a  double  legend,  into  that 
peculiar  distinctness  which  the  genius  of  WAGNER  has  im- 
pressed upon  his  version  of  the  "  Sangrail ''  and  the 
"  Knight  of  the  Swan." 

The  cup  of  the  holy  blood  was  that  in  which  our  Lord 
had  consecrated  the  elements  at  His  last  supper.  To  the 


THE  STORY  OF  THE  BLOOD.  571 

eye  of  faith  that  cup  had  never  perished.     It  existed  still ; 
469.       it  ever  would  exist — blessed  by  the  Lord  Him- 

^OF  T™BET  self>  filled  with  His  blood»  the  verT  visible  in~ 
BLOOD,     carnation  of  His  unspeakable  love  in  its  sublime 

purity  and  sacrifice.  There,  in  one  glowing  symbol,  is  the 
whole  parable  of  the  sacramental  claim.  Literalised  by 
Rome,  it  reads  thus  : — "  On  earth,  in  a  material  cup,  is  the 
real  presence,  dwelling  for  ever  incarnate,  with  men." 

That  dogma  is  the  secret  of  all  sacerdotalism.  The  quest 
might  belong  to  the  people ;  but  the  guardianship  of  the 
sacred  elements,  attributed  in  the  myth  to  the  holy  knights, 
belonged,  in  reality,  to  the  holy  Church,  before  whose 
mystic  thrall  all  Christian  knights  bowed  down. 

Joseph  of  Arimathea  had  been  the  first  guardian  ;  but 
for  the  sins  of  the  world,  as  faith  grew  cold,  the  holy  cup 
had  been  caught  away  by  angels  to  heaven,  only  to  be 
restored  to  Titurel,  the  anointed  knight. 

Even  so  does  divine  truth  appear,  disappear,  and  reappear, 
as  the  world  is  able  and  worthy  to  entertain  it. 

On  the  summit  of  a  lofty  mountain,  clothed  with  luxuriant 
forests,  somewhere,  as  the  Trouveres  supposed,  on  the  con- 
fines of  India,  or  the  Visigoth  mountains  of  Spain,  stood  a 
glittering  pile.  There  Titurel,  with  a  band  of  chosen 
knights,  kept  the  Holy  Grail  in  the  palace  of  Montsalvat. 
Those  shining  domes  of  clear  agate  were  lifted  with  opal 
columns.  The  walls  glowed  with  Oriental  jasper;  the 
shrine  was  bright  with  gold  and  precious  stones ;  the  per-

fume  of  myrrh  and  aloes  floated  through  its  corridors,  and 
the  fertility  of  Eden  surrounded  its  precincts  with  tropical 
fruits  and  flowers. 

The  imagery  of  Montsalvat  is  a  strange  mixture  of  Asiatic 

mystery  and  Eastern  pomp,  wedded  to  the  Catholic  shrines 

470.       of  the  West.     It  is  a  Mont  St.  Michel  in  the 

MONT9ALVAT  tropics.      The   knights   of    the   Grail   embodied 

AND 

LOHENGRIN,  exactly  the  Church's  conception  of  the  warrior's 
highest  mission.  .  Her  knight  was  a  religious  mystic,  but 
he  appeared  constantly  in  the  world,  and  stood  like  an 
impassable  barrier  between  injured  innocence  and  brutal 
force.  Lohengrin  is  the  shining  embodiment  of  the  moral 
force,  represented  by  the  Church  of  the  Middle  Ages, 
which  enabled  the  unarmed  monk  to  dash  princes  and 
proud  monarchs  from  their  thrones.  The  knight  of  the 
Sangrail  came  as  the  angel  of  God,  with  all  an  angel's 
might,  and  more  than  an  angel's  sympathy.  He  shows 
himself  a  man  amongst  men,  but  the  mystery  of  Mont- 
salvat was  upon  him.  He  could  not  justify  or  explain 
his  actions;  he  could  not  reveal  his  name.  The  question, 
"  By  what  authority  doest  thou  these  things  ?  "  will  ever  be 
met  by  the  noblest  natures  with  sealed  lips.  The  "  things  " 
are  their  own  authority.  Every  spiritual  mission  justifies 
itself.  When  its  prophet  stoops  to  explain,  the  hour  of  his 
retirement  is  at  hand.  Like  Lohengrin,  his  power  is  at 
an  end,  he  must  return  to  Montsalvat,  and  leave  a  world 


THE  SWAN  LEGEND  AND   ELSA.  573 

to  which  so   much  has  been  given,  and  which  has  proved 
itself  worthy  of  so  little. 

Titurel  was  succeeded  by  Parsifal,  and  Lohengrin  was 
the  son  of  Parsifal.  It  is  at  this  point  that  the  Germanic 
legend  of  the  Knight  of  the  Swan,  so  popular  at  the  mouths 
of  great  rivers,  weds  itself  to  the  wider  myth  of  the  Saint 
Grail. 

An   innocent  woman  of  high  rank  is  accused  by  brutal 

conspirators  of  a  high  crime.     She  sees  in  a  dream  a  knight

sea.     He  enters  the  mouth  of  the  river,  lands,  and  conquers. 

He  weds  her  on  one  condition,  that  she  will  never  ask  his 

name   or  his  credentials.     She  promises,  but  at  last  cannot 

resist  the  temptation;  she  urges  the   fatal  question.     The 

swan   reappears,  and  the  knight  is  borne  away  from  her  for 

ever. 

WAGNER'S  opening  prelude  to  Lohengrin  resumes  the  clear 

phases   of  the   coming   drama.      It   is   a  wondrous  sound

soul  of  the  listener  with  a  certain  keen  hunger

The  essence  of  the  day  to  be  born  is  there,  as  the  essence  of 
Lohengrin  is  in  the  mystic  prelude. 

But  more  various  and  suggestive  is  the  musical  language 
of  pure  emotion  than  any  image  or  painted  symbols  of 
crystal  globes  and  angels,  for  the  musical  strain  provides 
the  single  emotion  in  its  fulness  and  indivisibility,  which 
fires  a  whole  set  of  symbols,  and  animates  a  whole  series  of 
incidents. 

You  may  state  Lohengrin  as  a  STORY,  as  a  PHILOSOPHICAL 

CONCEPTION,  as  a  SYMBOL,  or  as  a  pure  METAPHYSICAL  IDEA, 

,_„        and   music    shall    seize    and   inspire   each   state-

CEPTION    OF 

«4ix>HKXGRiN"froTn  the  remote  and  mystic  shrine  of  Mont- 
salvat  to  the  banks  of  the  Scheldt  to  rescue  a 
forlorn  maiden,  entering  into  the  din  and  turmoil  of  war 
and  human  passion,  and  at  last  retiring  to  the  inviolable 
sanctuary. 

As  a  PHILOSOPHICAL  CONCEPTION,  it  sums  up  the  two  poles 
of  human  nature — the  passion  for  contemplation,  and  the 
passion  for  action.  In  the  Middle  Ages,  the  monastic  soli- 
tude, with  its  visions  and  its  mysteries,  stood  for  one  ; 
chivalry,  with  its  knights -err  ant  and  its  bloody  wars  and 
adventures,  stood  for  the  other ;  and  in  the  legends  of  the 
Sangrail  the  two  are  united,  but  the  conception  is  a 
representative  one,  and  eternally,  philosophically  true  to 
human  nature.  Man  dreams  and  aspires;  he  seeks  isola-

tion  •  be  places  leagues  of  oceans  continents,  impenetrable 
forests,  between  his  soul  and  tbe  work-a-day  world.  He 
ascends  bis  boly  mountain,  bis  Montsalvat,  and  dwells  in  its 
resplendent  halls,  on  the  very  confines  between  heaven  and 
earth.  Still,  even  there  he  seeks  for  confraternity  in  his 
isolation.  There  are  with  him  others,  Titurel,  Parsifal,  the 
knights  of  the  holy  quest,  of  tbe  San  Grail,  of  the  blood 
which  is  the  life  thereof.  But  to  what  end  this  science  of 
contemplation  ?  to  what  end  this  heart  alternately  refrained 
and  expanded,  these  muscles  so  firmly  knit,  these  limbs  so 
proudly  clad  in  shining  mail,  this  bright  sword  lying  idle  in 
its  scabbard  ?  Made  strong  and  holy,  for  what  but  for 
action?  Prepared,  but  not  made  perfect,  except  through 
suffering.  The  return  of  the  holy  knight  to  the  struggles  of 
the  world  is  at  once  the  recognition  of  the  spiritual  force 
embodied  by  the  Church,  and  the  condemnation  of  the 
monastic  ideal  of  solitude  and  prayer.  The  larger  moral 
missed  by  the  Church  is  caught  by  the  popular  myth.  The 
discipline  of  life  is  not  apart  from  human  love,  however 
shining  may  be  the  summits  of  Montsalvat. 

The  training  of  the  heart  must  lie  in  the  full  expansion  of 
love.  Lohengrin  loves  Elsa. 

The  training  of  the  hand  must  be  in  knightly  deeds 
done  amongst  men.  Lohengrin  slays  the  oppressor. 

In  the  midst  of  glory  come  pain  and  separation,  yet  the 
experience  and  trial  have  both  been  needful ;  and  though 
the  latest  note  be  one  of  sorrow,  yet  will  the  white  swan, 


576  LOHENGRIN. 

Death,  lead  the  good  knight  safely  through  the  rolling 
waters  to  his  rest. 

As  a  SYMBOL,  the  descent  of  the  mystic  knight,  the 
glimpse  of  his  supernal  graces  vouchsafed  to  earth,  and 
his  withdrawal  to  the  mysterious  region,  is  all  imaged  by 
the  vision  of  the  holy  cup  borne  of  angels,  which  to  the 
expectant  saint  comes  from  out  the  remote  distance — 
"  Rose-red,  with  beatings  in  it  as  if  alive,  till  all  the  white 
walls  of  the  cell  are  dyed  with  rosy  colours  leaping  on 
the  wall,  and  then  .  .  .  the  Grail  pass'd." —  Tennyson. 

As  a  pure  METAPHYSICAL  idea,  Lohengrin  stands  for  the 
dawn  of  sensibility ;  as  when  one  awakes  after  long  sleep, 
and,  slowly  recovering  consciousness,  begins  to  feel  life  in 
all  one's  limbs,  and  to  be  keenly  conscious  of  the  sun,  and 
flowers,  and  of  food,  and  wine  — all  the  activities  and  stimu- 
lants of  life.  Then,  after  a  climax  of  consciousness  to  pain 
or  to  pleasure  has  been  reached,  the  slow  returning  of  sen- 
sibility into  the  realm  of  unconscious  sleep.  Life  in  the 
work-a-day  world  has  been  taken  away,  and  the  white  swan 
of  sleep  has  borne  the  weary  one  back  to  the  dreamland  of 
Montsalvat. 

And  now  let  us  come  upon  the  Prelude,  and  see  how 

it    closes   with   Lohengrin   under  one    and    all

symbolical,  or  metaphysical  conceptions,  which  I  have 
referred  to. 

And  here,  if  not  before,  our  powers  of  description  may 
well  fail.  The  orchestra  alone  can  take  their  place.  But 
who  has  not  heard,  in  the  shrill  breathing  of  the  opening 
violins  and  flutes, 

The  slender  sound, 
As  from  a  distance  beyond  distance, 
.  .  .  O  !  never  harp  was  born, 

Nor  aught  we  blow  with  breath,  or  touch  with  hand, 
Was  like  that  music  as  it  came. 

How  it  remains  for  long  in  the  upper  air,  as  loth  to  leave 
the  shining  heights  of  Montsalvat,  then  steals  cautiously 
down  to  parley  with  some  earthlier  whispers.  Like  Briinn- 
hilde,  the  Walkiire  stooping  from  Walhalla  to  listen  to  the 
plaint  of  human  lovers,  even  so  is  the  high  sound  drawn  to 
earth.  The  warm  tints  of  the  sunny  genial  world,  with  all 
its  lights  and  shadows,  "  all  the  wealth,  and  all  the  woe," 
begin  to  glow  and  mantle  in  the  richly-swelling  tide  of 
sound.  One  by  one  all  the  instruments  of  the  orchestra  are 
gathered  in  as  the  deeper  notes  of  the  descending  scale 
climb  downwards,  and  the  varied  voices  of  pain  and  fore- 
bodings and  excess  of  tender  love  are  woven  into  the  mighty 
fabric  of  suspended  harmonies,  until  with  a  vast  shattering  of 
silver  cymbals  the  climax  is  reached  and  repeated,  and  then 
the  little  far-off  voice  of  bitterness  like  a  heart-pang  shoots 
through  the  rich  and  laden  atmosphere  of  changing  and 
dissolving  sound,  and  we  suddenly  are  conscious  that  the 

37 


578  LOHENGRIN. 

power  of  the  spell  is  waning,  the  satisfaction  of  a  finished 
work  sinks  in  upon  the  soul,  lately  the  scene  of  such  stormy 
and  conflicting  emotions,  and  we  heave  a  long  and  peaceful 
high  as  the  phrase  ends  with  a  perfect  major  close.  But  at 
that  moment,  like  Elsa  awaking  from  her  deadly  swoon,  we 
are  aware  that  the  shining  knight  is  gone.  The  music  is 
caught  up  higher  and  higher,  further  and  further  "  the 
slender  sound  "  from  "  a  distance  beyond  distance  "  recedes 
as  it  came,  and  as  the  ear  clings  to  the  last  faint  ethereal 
whisper  in  the  upper  air,  we  perceive  that  the  knight  of  the 
Sangrail  has  passed. 

ACT  I. 

As  the  last  whisper  of  shrill  violin  harmonics  dies  away, 
the  curtain  rises  upon  the  grassy  lowlands   in  the  neigh- 
bourhood  of  Antwerp.      The  river  winds   away

NY  TUB  into  the  distance,  broadening  out  to  the  dim 
and  hazy  sea.  The  whole  scene  lies  glowing 
and  palpitating  in  the  splendour  of  a  summer  day,  and 
Henry,  the  King  of  Germany,  seated  under  a  spreading 
oak,  holds  his  court  with  military  pomp.  The  fore- 
ground is  crowded  with  knights  and  retainers  in  splendid 
costumes. 

A  blast  of  trumpets  sounds,  and  a  herald  steps  forward, 
and  in  a   musical  phrase  closely  imitative  of  the   natural

inflection  of  a  voice  bawling  out  loud,  proclaims  his  sove- 
reign's will,  which  is,  that  an  army  should  at  once 
EOTEB  THE  muster  to  serve  the  king  in  his  foreign  wars.  The 
enthusiasm  of  the  people  is  checked  by  the  very 
business-like  way  in  which  the  King  rises,  and  in  dignified 
Wagnerian  recitative  reminds  his  loyal  people  of  their  inter- 
nal discords,  and  especially  of  their  immediate  disagreement 
about  the  Overlordship  of  Brabant  itself,  and  he  then  calls 
upon  the  leading  noble,  Frederic  Count  of  Telramund,  to  show 
the  cause.  This  ambitious  man,  who  has  married  Ortrud,  a 
lineal  princess  of  Friesland,  and  who  aspires  to  the  vacant 
throne  of  Brabant,  then  steps  forth  and  tells  how  that  the 
late  ruling  Duke  made  him  guardian  of  his  two  children, 
Gottfried  and  Elsa ;  how  that  Elsa,  who  should  have  been 
his  own  bride,  conspired  with  some  unknown  lover,  doubt- 
less eager  for  the  crown,  and  treacherously  in  a  wood  made 
away  with  her  brother,  Gottfried ;  how  he,  the  Count,  then 
married  Ortrud  and  claimed  the  throne  for  himself.  He 
then  proceeds  to  arraign  Elsa  for  the  murder  of  her  brother, 
and  here  the  legend  of  the  swan  is  slipped  in. 

The  discerning  reader  may  as  well  know  that  Gottfried 
has  been  turned  into  a  swan  by  the  magic  arts  of  the  wicked 
Frisian  Princess  Ortrud,  who  aspires  with  Frederic  Telra- 
mund to  the  vacant  throne.  A  thrill  of  horror  runs  through 
the  assembly  on  learning  the  charge  now  made  against  Elsa, 
and  a  highly  expressive  cry  bursts  forth  from  the  people. 
The  first  crisis  is  steadily  worked  up  with  all  the  dramatic

art  and  patient  analysis  of  the  situation  so  characteristic 
of  WAGNER'S  genius.  Nothing  is  forgotten.  The  King 
bids  the  Count  consider  the  awful  nature  of  the  charge. 
The  Count  grows  more  violent  in  his  assertions,  and  begins 
to  impute  all  those  base  motives  to  Elsa  which  are  indeed 
his  own. 

The  King  reproves  him  judicially,  and  recalls  the  contro- 
versy to  facts  with  "  Summon  the  maid  ! "     The  herald  now 
proclaims  a  judicial  trial,  and  the  royal  will  is 
477>       emphasized  by  a  great  unsheathing  and  flourishing

of  swords.  In  answer  to  the  general  summons, 
Elsa,  in  pure  white,  accompanied  by  her  maidens,  is  seen 
approaching.  The  crowd  parts  as  she  slowly  moves  like 
one  in  a  trance  not  seeing  or  hearing.  A  cry  of  subdued 
admiration  and  sympathy  greets  her,  and  is  immediately 
followed  by  the  first  Elsa  motive  in  the  orchestra — that 
strain  of  pure  and  pathetic  melody,  inseparably  connected 
with  her  innocence  and  her  vision  of  Lohengrin.  The 
crowd  are  half  won  over. 

"  How  like  an  angel  of  light !  He  who  accuses  her  must 
surely  prove  her  guilt.1'  She  stands  face  to  face  with  the 
King.  In  answer  to  his  questions  she  inclines  her  head, 
but  speaks  not  when  asked  to  confess  her  guilt.  With  a 
weary,  dreamy  sigh  come  the  words  "  Alas !  my  poor 
brother !  "  The  King  and  the  people  are  staggered,  when 
Elsa  raises  her  head,  and  in  a  strain  that  must  ever  thrill 


ENTER  ELSA.  581 

all  hearers  into  rapt  silence,  she  relates,  with  eyes  dreamy 
and  fixed,  how,  an  unprotected  orphan,  she  has  often  prayed 
for  a  heavenly  guide.  % 

The  crowd  stare  wonderingly. 

The  King,  a  little  impatient,  hreaks  in  with  "  Elsa, 
defend  thyself  ! ''  Now  from  the  orchestra  softly  streams 
the  opening  subject  of  the  prelude,  the  dream  music  of 
Montsalvat.  Thither  indeed  at  such  a  moment  has  the 
spirit  of  Elsa  been  caught  away.  Her  face  begins  to  glow ; 
as  she  is  lifted  up  to  the  celestial  contemplation,  she 
describes  the  form  of  the  shining  knight  who  appeared  in 
answer  to  the  orphan's  prayer,  and  ends  with  the  pas- 
sionate apostrophe,  "  My  guardian,  my  defender,  thou  shalt 
be  my  champion  !  " 

Her  prayer  is  echoed  by  the  excited  multitude.  The 
King  alone  resists  the  spell.  Instantly  the  rival  Count 
seizes  his  occasion  to  declare  that  she  calls  for  her  para- 
mour, and  that  he  is  prepared  to  meet  him  in  single  combat. 
Not  a  man  steps  forth.  The  wavering  crowd  are  evidently 
struck  by  his  determined  attitude. 

The  King  expresses  confidence  in  the  Count,  and  things 
are  beginning  to  look  black  indeed  for  Elsa. 

Still  the  King  will  not  judge — Heaven  alone  must 
decide — Telramund  is  pledged  to  fight.  All  eyes  turn  to 
Elsa.  She  accepts  the  challenge,  and  is  asked  for  her 
champion.  She  grows  dreamy,  speaks  again  of  her  knight, 
and  offers  herself  up  to  him  in  a  kind  of  ecstatic  prayer.  Her

spell   is  once   more  on  the   inconstant   crowd.     "  A   noble 
prize  !  who  will  the  victor  be  ?  " 

The  solemn  moment  has  arrived.     The  herald  again  steps 
forth,  and  with  declamatory  accents,  simulating  the  natural 
-        inflections,  he  calls  for  Elsa's  champion.     There 
LL  HE    is  no   answer,   and   the   dropping   notes  of  the 


trombone  and  violoncello  pizzicato  admirably 
render  the  pause  of  suspense.  Elsa  passes  slowly  from 
tranquillity  to  agitation.  The  crowd  begins  to  side  against 
her,  the  hostile  court  exults.  Elsa  turns  to  the  King,  and 
implores  for  one  more  summons.  Again  the  trumpets 
sound,  again  the  herald  cries  ;  again  an  ominous  silence, 
broken  only  by  one  soft  trumpet  note,  a  still  softer  horn 
note,  then  five  taps,  like  fate,  on  the  kettle-drum,  suspended 
by  rests.  "  The  Heavens  are  silent,  she  is  doomed,"  cries 
the  mob,  and  Elsa  sinks  on  her  knees  in  passionate  prayer  — 
a  prayer  of  exquisite  distress,  which  is  soon  changed  as  her 
vision  brightens  to  a  growing  ecstasy. 

"  O  Lord,  send  my  knight  ! 
Send  him  again  stainless  and  white. 
Let  me  behold  that  form  of  light  1  " 

The  tremulous  violins  sustain  and  suspend  the  stretched

a  marvel ! ''  then  a  confused  roar  of  voices,  and  a  rush 
and  mingling  together  of  the  gaily-decked  multitude.  "  A 
swan !  a  fair  swan  !  yonder  a  bark — the  swan  drawing  tho 
bark.  A  knight,  a  full  fair  knight,  shining  in  resplendent 
armour.  A  helm  of  light — see  how  he  gains  the  shore  ! " 
He  comes,  and  from  the  crowd  behind  who  cannot  see — 
"What?  where?  there!  look!  who  is  it?"  Such  are  the 
exclamations  of  this  eight-part  chorus,  which  renders  better 
than  any  description,  the  exciting  and  rapturous  scene  which 
now  unfolds  itself,  as  the  crowd  parts  to  right  and  left,  and 
the  knight,  the  unknown  knight,  who  is  Lohengrin,  steps 
from  the  swan-drawn  bark,  clad  in  shining  silver  mail  from 
top  to  toe,  and  stands  for  a  moment  waving  his  adieu  to  the 
swan. 

In  that  strain  of  unaccompanied  melody,  so  famous,  and 
so  clear  in  its  lofty,  fearless  simplicity,  he  announces  his 
mission  to  the  King,  and  in  another  moment  Elsa  is  in  his 
arms. 

The  first  development  of  the  parable  is  reached.  Lohen- 
grin has  found  the  earthly  counterpart  to  his  mystic  passion 
for  the  Holy  Grail.  He  has  heard  from  the  lips  of  his 
queen  those  glowing  words,  "My  hope!  my  solace,  my 
hero,  I  am  thine ! "  but  in  an  instant,  before  surrendering 
himself,  he  guards  his  sacred  identity  with,  "Never,  as 
thou  dost  love  me,  ask  from  whence  I  came — never  ask 
my  race  or  name." 


584  LOHENGRIN. 

With  these  words,  the  first  ominous  notes  of  pain,  which 

recur  again  in  the  mouth  of  Elsa's  rival,  Ortrud,  and  which 

480        are  henceforth  identified  with  the  fatal  question, 

and  weighted  with  the  woe  of  the  final  catastrophe, 

ALIQUID.  are  heard ;  and  the  phrase  is  followed  by  that 
other  famous  recurring  strain,  expressive  of  the  weird 
mystery  that  envelops  Lohengrin,  and  for  ever  separates 
him  from  his  earthly  surroundings,  even  at  the  moment 
when  he  seems  most  immersed  in  and  identified  with  all 
human  interests  of  love  and  war ;  and  the  warning  is  twice 
repeated. 

In  a  transport  of  confiding  love,  Elsa  promises  every- 
thing. Then  Lohengrin  clasps  her  to  his  breast,  with  the 
simple  but  intense  words  wedded  to  the  simplest,  clearest, 
musical  phrase,  "  Elsa,  I  love  thee."  The  snatch  of  six 
part-chorus  that  now  greets  the  pair,  "O,  sweet  enchant- 
ment, wondrous  love  \"  is  a  piece  of  rich  and  satisfying 
harmony,  in  which  the  leading  melody,  full  of  repose, 
rings  high  above  the  glowing  chords  and  modulations  upon 
which  it  is  floated  out. 

But  the  champions  already  stand  face  to  face,  and  whilst 

the  ground  is  being  measured  out,  bandy  words  of  mutual 

defiance.     Then  the  herald  once  more  proclaims 

481'       aloud   the   fight.     The   two  rivals  commit   their

cause  to  heaven.     The  King,  for  the  first  time, 
becomes  thoroughly  melodic  and  lyrical  in  his  prayer,  which 


THE  CLOSE  OF  ACT  I.  585 

is  taken  up  by  the  whole  assembly,  in  a  full  and  over- 
powering chorus  of  considerable  length,  at  the  close  of 
which,  to  the  rattle  of  violins,  the  King  draws  his  sword  as 
the  signal  to  begin. 

Trumpets  on  the  stage  blare  forth,  and  the  combatants 
rush  together.  The  indescribable  close  of  the  first  act 
must  be  left  to  the  reader's  imagination  or  memory.  Fre- 
deric falls  before  Lohengrin's  sword,  his  life  is  magnani- 
mously spared.  Elsa's  ecstasy,  the  intense  passion  of  which 
silences  the  turbulent  burst  of  chorus,  surpasses  in  its 
fervour  the  famous  "  Robert,  toi  que  j'aime !  "'  itself  a 
masterpiece  of  dramatic  passion. 

Nothing  finer  of  its  kind  has  ever  been  conceived  than 

the  phrase  beginning  on  G  above  the  line,  "  Joy,  oh  joy  !  "

strain,  at  the  close  of  which   Elsa   sinks   exhausted   upon 

Lohengrin's  breast. 

A  lesser  artist  would  have  here  brought  down  the  curtain, 
but  the  climax  is  rounded  off  superbly  with  ten  more  pages 
of  chorus  in  eleven  parts,  in  which  the  rage  and  astonish- 
ment of  Count  Frederic  and  Ortrud  his  consort,  the  thanks- 
giving of  the  king,  the  triumph  of  the  knight,  the  ecstasy 
of  Elsa,  and  the  bewildered  joy  of  the  multitude,  take  up 
the  heroine's  strain,  and  work  out  her  touching  and  melodic

phrases  in  a  symphonic  form,  and  with  a  wealth  of  orchestra- 
tion worthy  of  the  finest  parts  of  Fldelio.  At  the  close  of 
which  Frederic  falls  iii  despair  at  the  feet  of  his  wife  Ortrud, 
Lohengrin  is  carried  off  in  procession  on  his  own  shield, 
and  Elsa  is  raised  high  on  the  King's,  overspread  with 
gorgeous  mantles,  whilst  the  curtain  descends  amid  the 
universal  rejoicings. 

ACT  IT. 

The  moon  is  slowly  rising  over  the  square  of  the  great 
Minster  of  Antwerp.  On  one  side  of  it  is  ranged  the  palace 

brightly    lighted    up,    and   the    sound   of   dance 

483. 

ORTRUD  AND  music   mingles    incongruously   with    the    lonely 
D'  gloom  of  the  two  dark  figures  cowering  on  the 
steps  in  front  of  the  cathedral  portals. 

In  the  long  and  stormy  duet 'which  follows,  Frederic  up- 
braids Ortrud  with  having  goaded  him  on  falsely  to  accuse 
Elsa  of  her  brother's  murder.  He  had  weakly  relied  on  his 
wife's  lie  and  her  magic  to  slay  his  rival.  Now  he  had 
been  thrown  in  the  ordeal  combat,  and  both  were  disgraced. 
His  very  sword  was  gone ;  he  longs  for  it  to  slay  his  now 
detested  consort.  He  raves  like  a  second  weak  blubbering 
Ahab  before  a  second  wily  and  indomitable  Jezebel.  The 
woman  now  shows  her  reserve  force  ;  she  tells  the  disgraced 
noble  he  has  been  d-efeated  by  magic.  Had  he  but  grazed 
the  body  of  the  unknown  knight  he  might  still  have  been

victor,  but  now  he  could  only  paralyze  his  power  by  extort- 
ing the  secret  of  his  name.  But  one  could  accomplish  this 
— Elsa,  who  on  the  morrow  was  to  become  a  bride.  There 
was  not  a  moment  to  be  lost.  See,  the  music  has  died  in 
the  castle-halls,  the  revellers  are  gone. 

Elsa  will  come  forth  presently  on  her  balcony,  to  drink 

deep  after  the  heated  ball-room  from  the  cool  cisterns  of 

the   night.     The  stars  are  out.     Hush  !  yonder

his  wife,  who  sits  down  on  the  steps  with  face 
buried  apparently  in  her  hands,  but  in  reality  with  an  eye 
as  of  a  cat  fixed  on  its  prey,  watching  every  motion  of  the 
snow-white  figure  slowly  emerging,  and  now  leaning  out 
upon  the  balcony  towards  her. 

Soft  summer  night,  and  stars  that  seem  to  beat  in  time 
to  yonder  palpitating  heart !  Sweet  wandering  airs  that 
fan  the  hot  cheeks  and  happy  restless  spirit  of  maiden  Elsa, 
who  in  solitude,  balmy  and  silent,  seeks  to  possess  herself, 
and  sound  with  full  and  satisfying  thought  the  depths  of 
her  own  happiness  !  In  her  most  entrancing  song,  that 
floats  out  into  the  listening  night,  she  seems  to  sound  and 
sound,  and  to  find  those  depths  fathomless. 

The  short  orchestral  prelude  recasts,  in  a  meditative  and 
subdued  mould,  some  of  the  elements  of  the  last  triumphal 
chorus,  and  then,  clear  through  the  balmy  midsummer 
moonlight,  steals  forth  that  enchanting  song,  in  its  opening

phrases  so  strikingly  like  "  Home,  sweet  home,"  but  quite 
etherealised  out  of  all  resemblance  to  it  as  it  proceeds. 

But  the  snake  in  the  dark  now  rears  its  slanderous  head. 
Ortrud  draws  out  of  the  deep  shadow  with  a  pathetic  wail — 

"  Elsa ! ''     The   startled   girl  is   soon  melted  to

LATET      pity  for  her  prostrate  rival,  who  craftily  abases 
herself  and  pleads  for   her  husband,   whom  she 
represents  as  deeply  penitent,  and  eager  for  the  royal  favour 
of  his  happy  rival. 

Elsa's  own  spirit,  longing  to  overflow  and  impart  happi- 
ness to  all,  is  played  upon  by  the  sorceress,  who  is  presently 
received  with  open  arms  by  the  trusting  bride ;  and  few  can 
forget  MADEMOISELLE  TITIENS'  magnificent  burst  of  insult- 
ing malice  and  vengeance  (during  Elsa's  momentary  with- 
drawal) in  which  Ortrud  summons  the  infernal  gods  whom 
she  worships  to  accomplish  her  dark  designs  for  the  ruin  of 
Elsa's  love.  Elsa  finishes  by  inviting  her  two  rivals  to  array 
themselves  in  splendid  apparel,  and  grace  with  her  the 
nuptial  festival  on  the  morrow.  The  gratitude  of  Ortrud 
now  offers  a  return  in  the  shape  of  good  counsel.  She  art- 
lessly advises  Elsa  not  to  marry  a  man  she  knows  nothing 
of,  but  to  extort  the  confession  of  his  name  at  least ;  and  the 
phrase  of  exalted  passion  in  which  Elsa  naively  answers  the 
designing  woman,  that  she  cannot  know  what  true  love  is  if 
she  can  so  suggest  a  doubt,  is  one  of  matchless  freshness 
and  full  of  tidal  joy. 


THE  MOANING   COMES.  589 

But  the  poison  has  nevertheless  been  instilled,  and  the 

pair  withdraw  into  the  castle  together.     Frederic  now  creeps 

from   his   recess,  where   he   has  listened  to  all, 

TUB  MORNING  utters  a  f  ew  strains  of  malignant  joy.     The  day 

breaks;    the  long    drawn-out   and    magnificent 

crisis  of  the  second  act  is  at  hand. 

With  the  bright  glancing  of  the  morning  light  upon  the 
cathedral,  palace,  and  market-place,  the  soul  passes  into  a 
new  phase  of  emotions.  Now  we  can  see  the  meaning  of  the 
long,  gloomy  duet  between  Frederic  and  Ortrud,  succeeded 
by  the  finely-contrasted  night-scene  of  Elsa's  love  and 
Ortrud's  treachery.  The  whole  atmosphere  of  the  night, 
laden  with  oppressive  and  exhausting  passion,  confined  to 
three  individuals,  has  prepared  us  for  the  fresh  life  of  the 
day  and  the  busy  stir  and  tumult  of  feelings,  in  which  the 
individual  is  at  first  lost  in  the  crowded  scene,  and  then  steps 
forth  into  prominence,  but  still  to  carry  on  his  action  no 
longer  in  private,  but  coram  populo. 

The  early  dawn  broadens  to  the  cheery  sound  of  horns 
answering  each  other,  call  for  call,  from  the  distant  turrets 
of  the  city.  Troops  of  men  and  girls  visit  the  town  Well,  and 
pass  to  and  fro  in  the  market-place. 

And  now  the  castle  gates  open,  forth  come  the  royal 
trumpeters  and  blow  the  herald  blast,  summoning  from  right 
and  left  the  nobles  and  retainers,  to  prepare  for  the  presence 
of  the  King  and  the  marriage  festivities  of  Elsa  and  her 
knight. 


590  LOUENGEIN. 

The  straightforward  chorus  in  which  the  gay  groups 
greet  each  other  is  exhilarating,  and  seems  to  banish  the 
last  shade  of  night  from  the  stage  and  of  gloom  from  the 
heart. 

The  royal  herald  here  steps  forth,  and  with  a  flourish  of 
trumpets  announces  to  the  hushed  crowd  that  Frederic 

Telramund   is  an   outlaw   and   traitor,   and   the 

487. 

THE  CROWD  people,  like  parrots,  break  out  gaily  into  free 
8'  cursing.  Lohengrin  is  then  proclaimed  Guardian 
of  Brabant,  and  the  pliable  chorus  assents  vociferously. 
The  third  message  summons  the  nobles  and  retainers  to 
the  espousals  of  Elsa  and  the  knight,  which,  of  course, 
forms  the  subject  for  a  longer  chorus,  in  which  the  nobles 
profess  themselves  willing  to  follow  the  new  Overlord  to 
victory  against  the  King's  foes  in  a  distant  land.  Observe 
the  fine  proportion  of  the  herald's  tripartite  message,  and  the 
corresponding  bursts  of  chorus  which  greet  it.  Again, 
the  perfection  of  form  is  instinctively  reached.  What 
follows  shows  that  acquaintance  with  popular  movements, 
and  that  deep  insight  into  political  instincts  of  crowds 
subjected  to  the  manipulation  of  agitators,  of  which 
WAGNER  had  some  bracing  experience  when  he  himself 
appeared  as  a  party  orator  during  the  rise  of  Saxony  and  the 
agitation  of  1848. 

There  are  always  two  sides  to  a  question,  and  in  every 
political  movement  always  a  reactionary  minority. 


CONSPIRACY. —ENTER  PAGES.  591 

No  sooner  has  the  boisterously  loyal  chorus  ceased,  than 

a  movement  is  apparent   in   the   crowd,   and   four   nobles 

detach  themselves  from  the  herd.     "  The  land  we 

are  to  quit ! "  cries  one.     "  Against  a  foe  who

never  threatened  us/'  replies  a  second.  "  Such 
rashness  will  bring  sorrow/'  says  a  third.  "  But  who  will 
dare  oppose  the  King?"  asks  the  fourth.  "I!"  cries 
Frederic  of  Telramund,  stepping  from  his  hiding-place. 

He  has  indeed  struck  while  the  iron  is  hot,  and,  with  the 
rapid  instinct  of  self-preservation,  he  levels  a  blow  at  his 
victim,  declares  that  all  have  been  duped  by  magical  arts, 
and  that  the  unknown  knight  must  be  unmasked. 

The  crowd  is  but  half  won,  but  the  poison  of  suspicion 
has  been  dropped,  and  the  rapid  kaleidoscope  has  already 
shifted,  as  the  conspirators  mingle  in  the  gathcr- 
ENTER      ing  crowd  of  nobly-clad  courtiers,  and  four  royal 
pages  appear  in  scarlet,  yellow,  and  blue  satin, 
and  from  their  fresh  girl  voices  a  very  song  of  the  morning, 
"  Make  way  !  make  way  !  "  falls  like  dew  and  sunshine.     It 
is   one  of  those   matchless    fragments   of  clear   and   effec- 
tively simple   harmony   of   which   WAGNER  seems  to  have 
an  inexhaustible  store.     The  cry  from  the  Syrens  in  Tann- 
hciuser,  and  the  parting  salute  of  the  chorus  in  the  bridal 
chamber,  are  but  two  of  a  hundred  other  examples.     The 
glittering   crowd   now   parts;    splendid  pages,    in    all   the 
colours  of  the  rainbow,  make  their  way  some  to  the  open 


592  LOHENGRIN. 

Minster  door,  others  to  range  themselves  on  either  side  up 
the  flight  of  steps.  On  the  Palace  balcony  appear  groups  of 
beautiful  children,  and  gaily-dressed  women  and  cavaliers, 
and  instalments  of  the  royal  procession  are  seen  slowly 
winding  from  terrace  to  terrace,  and  approaching  until  the 
last  flight  of  marble  stairs  lands  them  in  the  great  square, 
which  parts  the  procession  from  the  Minster. 

The   stately   music   heralds  in  the  appearance  of  Elsa; 

there  is  a  long-drawn-out  expectant  sigh  from  the  crowd, 

"  She   comes !    with    blushes   glowing,    on   holy

white,  stands  revealed  to  the  whole  assembly 
on  the  top  of  the  Palace  stairs.  Then,  slowly  preceded 
and  followed  by  her  maidens,  she  advances  in  the  pro- 
cession, and  crosses  the  market-place,  whilst  a  rapturous 
chorus  rends  the  air  with,  "  Hail !  Elsa  of  Brabant/'  As 
the  strain  culminates  in  one  long  shout,  Elsa's  foot  is  on 
the  second  step  of  the  Minster  stairs,  when  the  treacherous 
Ortrud,  who  has  formed  one  of  her  train,  rushes  forward, 
and  pushes  Elsa  aside  with  "  Stand  back,  Elsa !  no  longer 
will  I  follow  you  like  a  slave;  the  precedence  is  mine, 
you  shall  yet  bow  to  me ! "  The  tumult  following  these 
words,  and  the  fierce  colloquy  between  Elsa  and  Ortrud 
threaten  to  end  in  dire  confusion ;  but  WAGNER  has  the 
stages  of  development  firmly  in  hand,  and  the  transitions  of 
incident  and  emotion  never  lose  definite  purpose  and  clear-

ness.  But  one  thing  has  again  to  be  done.  Doubt,  sus- 
picion of  the  unknown  knight,  has  to  be  sown  amongst  the 
people,  and  matured  in  the  heart  of  Elsa.  In  presence  of 
such  a  rabid  falcon  as  Ortrud,  the  poor  white  dove  is  only 
too  powerless.  The  sorceress  hurls  at  her,  and  at  the 
assembled  crowd,  the  charge  of  magic  against  the  mysterious 
knight,  insists  upon  his  name,  and  with  every  taunt  harps 
upon  a  question  to  which  Elsa  can  give  no  answer,  until  the 
effect  of  her  words,  supported  by  the  disaffected  minority 
gathering  round  Frederic  Telramund,  is  also  seen  in  the 
maiden's  passionate  assertions  of  her  utter  trust,  in  the 
midst  of  her  growing  agitation.  Suddenly  the  King  and 
Lohengrin  are  announced,  and  the  orderly  progression  of 
the  drama  is  displayed  by  Frederic  now  stepping  forth  to 
confront  his  rival,  as  Ortrud  had  dealt  with  hers.  It  is  the 
occasion  for  a  new  emphasis  of  the  harrowing  question, 
"  Who  is  the  knight "  to  whom  the  fortunes  of  Brabant,  and 
Elsa,  the  jewel  of  Brabant,  have  been  handed  over  in  a 
moment  of  popular  excitement  ?  Let  him  stand  forth  and 
declare  himself.  "  Yon  shining  knight,  who  has  defied  my 
sword,  I  here  accuse  of  sorcery  vile !  "  cries  Frederic.  At 
first  the  King  is  for  passing  the  charge  by,  but  Frederic's 
vehemence  begins  to  win  the  crowd.  The  mystic  knight  is 
forced  at  last  to  declare  that  Elsa  alone  can  put  that  question 
to  him,  that  he  will  answer  no  other. 

Fatal  trust  in  the  reticence  of  a  woman !     Had  she  not

crowd  expect  to  know.  The  poison  is  working  in  the  blood 
of  the  bride.  Frederic  and  Ortrud  no  longer  care  to  inter- 
rupt the  nuptial  procession ;  their  work  is  done.  The  organ 
peals  forth  from  the  open  portals,  and  dies  away  in  one  long 
swell.  All  seems  fair  again.  Elsa  falls  in  tears  on  the 
breast  of  her  knight.  Ortrud  stands  aside  with  menacing 
arm  uplifted;  but  in  the  tears  of  Elsa,  and  in  the  trium- 
phant attitude  of  Ortrud,  we  read  the  doom  of  the  injured 
bride,  and  the  brief  yet  bitter  ascendancy  of  the  perfidious 
•witch,  so  swiftly  developed  in  the  third  and  last  Part. 

ACT  III. 

There  is  but  one  more  development  in  the  character  of 

Elsa,  and   the  lines  of  the   plot   are  complete.     It   is   the 

struggle  between  her  love  and  her  curiosity,  in 

INTRODUCTION  which  the  last  wins,  and  the  denouement  passes 

to   a  terribly  rapid  close.     That  struggle  is  the 

centre  and  pith  of  the  last  act. 

The  famous  introduction  is  instinct  with  the  higher  moral 
of  the  whole,  which  is  inferred  rather  than  felt  out  in 
the  closing  incidents  of  the  drama.  The  music  is  all  joyous 
stir,  and  knightly,  chivalrous  vigour.  It  is  the  shout  of  a 


THE  BRIDAL   CHORUS,  595 

multitude,  it  is  the  triumph  of  Lohengrin  in  his  accomplished 
mission,  in  which  his  personal  feelings  and  his  fateful  love 
are  all  put  aside,  and  the  larger  aspect  of  his  public  work, 
in  delivering  Elsa,  breaking  up  the  malign  enchantment, 
and  restoring  the  little  Prince  Gottfried  to  his  adoring 
people,  is  alone  entertained. 

In  this  stirring  prelude,  Lohengrin,  not  the  lover,  not  the 
rival,  but  only  the  victorious  knight  of  the  Sangrail,  seems 
to  pass  for  the  last  time,  enveloped  in  mystic  glory  before 
us,  amidst  the  acclamations  of  the  people ;  and  the  martial 
strains  ring  on,  long  after  the  hero  has  retired  into  the 
sacred  rest  of  Montsalvat.  But  the  joys  and  the  sorrows  of 
earth  love  must  first  be  traversed. 

The  empty  bridal  chamber  is  before  us.     On  one  side,  a 

wide  oriel  window,  through  which  we  may  see  the  summer 

moonlight,  setting  full  upon  the  broad  waters  of

Ihe  doors  open. 

They  enter  as  pages  bearing  torches.  The  King,  nobles, 
and  ladies,  conduct  Elsa  and  her  knight  to  their  bridal  room. 
No  more  graceful  scene,  no  more  delicate  and  enchanting 
music,  has  ever  been  devised  than  the  famous  "  Faithful  and 
true !  we  lead  you  to  where  love  triumphant  shall  crown 
you  with  joy ."  Eight  ladies  now  take  up  a  new  and  equally 
enchanting  strain,  which  is  in  fact  a  poetical  version  of 

whom  God  hath  joined  together";  and  throughout  the

596  LOHENGRIN. 

astonishing  scene  that  follows,  there  reigns  that  singular 
elevation  which  must  for  ever  separate  this  great  love  duet 
from  such  sensuous  emanations  as  GOUNOD'S  duet  between 
Faust  and  Marguerite,  or  even  WAGNER'S  own  delineation 
of  passion  in  Tristan  and  Isolde. 

Here  everything  is  rare  and  sublimated. 

The  breath  of  a  divine  fervour  lifts  the  knightly  love 
of  Lohengrin  into  an  atmosphere  of  resplendent  purity. 
As  the  last  notes  of  bridal  music  die  away,  and  the  doors 
are  closed  upon  the  happy  pair,  that  long-drawn-out  duet 
begins,  which  in  dramatic  force  alone  will  bear  comparison 
with  the  finest  bursts  in  Romeo  and  Juliet. 

Merely  as  a  psychological  study  it  is  worth  dwelling 
upon,  although  it  is  not  easy  to  give  any  idea  of  the  truth 
and  power  of  the  music.  The  happy  strain  is  o'er,  "  We 
are  alone,  who  never  were  alone  since  first  we  met."  The 
first  notes  of  Lohengrin  take  us  from  the  joyous  conven- 
tional view  of  the  bridal  chorus,  into  the  immediate  privacy 
of  the  lovers. 

With  the  closing  of  the  doors  the  atmosphere  is  shifted 

instantly.     The  melody  is  long  drawn  out,  reposeful,  and 

intime.     He   longs   to  know  from  her  own  lips 

whether  she  is  happy.     It  is  the  old,  imperious

instinct,  which  is  eager  to  seek  a  confirmation  of 
its  desire  from  a  kindred  soul. 

It  must  hear  from  other  lips  what  it  already  knows,  and 


ONLY  A    WOMAN!  597 

be  thus  twice  blessed.  "  Happy  !  "  cries  Elsa,  "  that  word 
ray  transport  cannot  measure  !  " 

He  is  satisfied.  She  has  given  him  back  his  feelings. 
He  reminds  her  of  the  mystic  love  which  brought  him  from 
the  distance  in  her  hour  of  need.  She  answers  with  a 
glimpse  of  her  own  vision.  Now  that  she  holds  in  her  arms 
its  realisation,  it  lends  eloquence  to  her  lips.  She  will  be 
melted  by  his  eyes,  and  flow  about  him  like  a  river;  she 
will  be  the  little  flower  that  kisses  his  feet  as  they  move  in 
the  fresh  grass. 

She  will  live  so.  No,  she  will  die,  if  in  dying  her  life  can 
become  more  his  own.  Is  this  love  ?  is  it  all  that  love  can 
say  ?  No,  it  might  still  breathe  his  dear  name.  "  Must  it 
be  for  ever  concealed  from  me  ?  " 

With  the  beseeching  yet  warning  fifth  from  E  to  A — 
"  Elsa !  "  Lohengrin  would  check  her  miserable  rashness. 
But  the  woman  is  unbalanced  by  the  intensity  of  her  emo- 
tions, and  with  clinging  urgency  rushes  on  heedless.  "  How 
sweetly  sounds  my  name  from  thy  dear  lips  !  but  thy  dear 
name  shall  never  sound  from  mine  !  " 

Will  the  spell  never  be  broken  ?     Will  she  never  know  ? 

Again  her  lover  would  check  her — "  Oh,  my  sweet  wife  !  '* — 

notes  full  of  a   sudden  heart-pang.     She  heeds

once  softly ;  I  only  shall  hear  it."  Lohengrin  rises.  His 
pain  is  too  great,  he  needs  diversion  for  his  thoughts,  he 
will  put  this  dreadful  moment  aside.  He  lifts  her  from  the 
couch ;  they  are  both  standing  by  the  oriel  casement.  He 
pushes  it  wide  open.  The  moonlight  streams  in,  and  the 
soft  air  is  full  of  strange  and  mystic  perfumes.  The  air 
seems  to  grow  chill.  The  music  of  shrill  triplets  on  flutes 
and  clarionets  is  here  marvellous.  The  lovers  stand  between 
the  moonlight  and  the  dawn. 

Alas !  too  true.     The  dream  of  love  draws  to  its  pallid 
awakening.     For   a   moment   they   stand   and    inhale    the 

odorous   gales,   which   come   streaming   towards 
406. 

WHAT'S  ix  the  knight  as  from  the  aromatic  shrine  of  Mont- 
sal  vat.  Thoughts  of  its  glory  rush  into  his 
mind;  his  ecstatic  nature  wakes  beneath  them;  bespeaks 
what  seem  to  her  wild  words  of  magic  and  mystery.  A 
vague  distrust  mingles  with  her  passion.  His  secret  is 
fraught  perchance  with  danger;  he  is  not  safe  in  her 
embrace;  others  may  have  mystic  claims  over  him.  Yet 
for  a  moment  she  is  folded  in  a  long  embrace.  Oh ! 
could  her  folly  all  be  forgotten  !  But  no !  the  very  inner 
woman  comes  out  piteously  with,  "  Let  me — let  me  know  !  " 
The  first  stern  notes  from  the  knight  are  her  answer  :  "  No 
more  of  this,  Elsa  !  "  But  she  is  quite  wild,  weakly  wild. 
"  Tell,  oh  tell  me  thy  race,  name,  all ! — I  will  never,  never, 
tell  it  to  anyone."  It  is  a  situation  that  must  so  often  have 


AN  EXCEEDING  BITTER   CRY.  599 

repeated  itself  in  the  sad  aimals  of  humanity — the  eager 
insatiable  curiosity  of  woman,  wrecking  her  own  love  and 
the  love  of  one  dearer  to  her  than  life  itself.  But  the 
deepest  side  of  the  ideal  knight  is  now  fairly  aroused.  The 
sense  of  his  duty,  and  the  honour  of  the  Sangrail !  Before 
that  consummate  glory  even  the  fire  of  love  grows  pale, 
nnd  he  tells  his  bride  that  wavering  faith  shall  never  be 
forgiven. 

In  a  moment  the  unhappy  Elsa  is  melted  and  contrite. 

She  falls  back  on  the  simple  human  side  of  her  love,  and 

calls  him  to  her  arms,  the  only  spell  she  knows. 

AN  EXCEEDING  But  Lohengrin  now  proclaims  that  he  belongs 

to  a  higher  world,  that  none  can  add  or  take 

from  the  sacred  order  which  owns  his  allegiance :  that  the 

bliss  from  whence  he  comes  and  whither  he  must  return  is 

ineffable,  supernal. 

Alas !     Help !     Heaven  ! 

A  cry  of  bitter  jealous  passion  breaks  from  the  frantic 
woman.  She  now  feels,  by  a  quick  and  sure  instinct,  that 
she  is  going  to  be  left.  One  more  typical  situation.  The 
plaint  of  all  forsaken  hearts  is  resumed  in  that  despairing 
cry  of  Elsa ;  the  time  for  asking  his  name  seems  past.  The 
sense  of  overhanging  doom  is  upon  her.  A  vague  terror 
shakes  her  whole  frame.  Is  it  the  prophetic  sense  of  the 
murderers  that  are  even  now  with  Frederic  of  Telramund, 
close  outside  her  bedchamber  ?  "  Hark  !  there  are  sounds  !  " 


GOO  LOHENGRIN. 

the  knight's  quick  ear  has  heard,  but  she  is  gazing  vacantly 
from  the  casement.  Another  terror  now  seizes  her.  Over 
the  flooded  river  brightening  to  the  dawn  she  catches  sight 
of  the  ominous  swan  that  brought  her  champion. 

"  The  swan  !  the  swan  !  "  she  screams  like  one  possessed. 
"  As  when  I  first  beheld  his  pinions  shine — he  comes  for 
thce  !  "  In  her  mad  despair,  trust,  caution,  even  love  itself, 
seems  to  give  way  to  the  impetuous  fury  of  a  wild  creature ; 
and  this  last  consummate  touch  of  human  nature  is  simply 
overpowering  on  the  stage.  In  the  gentlest  and  tcnderest 
o£  women,  when  pushed  to  extremity,  there  is  often  the 
imperious  ferocity  of  a  tiger  at  bay.  Like  a  vindictive  fury 
she  flies  at  him  with,  "Declare  thy  race  and  name!  Declare 
thy  name — thy  name  !  Where  is  thy  home  ? '' 

At  that  moment  the  door  is  burst  open,  the  murderers 

rush  in.     Elsa  has  just  strength  and  presence  of  mind  left, 

as  the  sudden  revulsion  of  feeling  takes  posses-

sword  before  she  swoons  away.  With  a  touch 
of  that  enchanted  blade,  Lohengrin  slays  Frederic  Telra- 
mund,  then  lifts  the  fainting  form  of  Elsa  on  to  the  bed. 
Nobles  and  servitors  enter.  The  knight,  lost  for  ever  to 
his  love,  with  sad  and  solemn  calmness  bids  them  lead 
Elsa  to  the  King,  and  promises  there,  in  presence  of  all,  to 
declare  his  name  and  home.

THE  KING  lights,  the  splendid  vision  of  the  broad  prairie 
u  and  banks  of  the  winding  Scheldt,  with  the 
hazy  distant  sea,  is  all  ready,  as  in  the  opening  act,  to  be 
revealed  as  the  scene  of  the  final  situation,  and  almost 
immediately  the  curtain  is  withdrawn,  and  the  opening 
pageant  is  again  before  us.  The  King  is  with  his  nobles 
under  the  spreading  oak,  the  full  morning  sun  is  throb- 
bing over  river  and  mead.  The  assembling  drum  and 
trumpet  music,  of  quite  a  perfunctory  character,  goes  on 
for  several  pages,  whilst  the  crowd  distributes  itself.  It 
is  an  immense  relief,  and  in  its  indifference  rests  the  mind, 
and  prepares  us  quite  after  the  Shaksperean  method  for 
the  exciting  denouement  close  at  hand. 

Mutual  compliments  now  pass  between  the  war-like 
monarch  and  his  people.  It  appears  that  all  are  now  pre- 
pared to  join  in  his  foreign  war  for  the  sake  of  Germany, 
and  he  is  thanking  them,  when  four  nobles,  bearing  a 
corpse  on  a  shrouded  bier,  enter  and  lay  their  burden  at 
the  King's  feet.  A  thrill  of  astonishment  and  horror  runs 
through  the  assembly  as  Telramund's  friends  are  recognised 
in  the  four  pall -bearers.  To  all  inquiries  they  answer  that

the  knight,  the   new  guardian  of  Brabant,  has  sent  them 
there  with  their  burden. 

Elsa  is  now  seen  approaching  with  a  train  of  ladies,  her 

head  downcast  in  deepest  sorrow,  and  the  orchestra  repeats 

a  fragment  of   the   motive   which   indicates   the 

burden   of    the   overhanging   mystery.      A  new

commotion  in  the  crowd,  and  in  another  moment 
the  knight  of  the  Grail,  fully  armed  in  shining  mail,  as 
in  the  first  act,  strides  into  the  midst,  and  stands  before 
the  King  by  the  side  of  the  shrouded  bier.  He  is  received 
with  acclamations  as  the  heaven-sent  hero,  but  at  once 
informs  the  King  that  all  is  changed  now,  that  he  has 
been  doggedly  arraigned  by  a  section  of  the  nobles  to  re- 
veal his  name  and  nation,  and  that  at  this  moment  he 
stands  accused  of  foul  murder.  With  these  words  he  tears 
the  pall  from  Frederick  Telramund's  corpse,  and  declares 
that  in  self-defence  he  slew  him.  His  accents  have  hitherto 
been  proud  and  defiant,  but  as  he  nears  the  subject  of  his 
great  personal  sorrow  his  tone  changes,  as  though  for  a 
moment  his  inner  mood  were  coloured  by  a  tenderer  and 
more  regretful  glow  of  feeling.  As  he  proceeds  to  recount 
his  brider's  fault  of  faith,  he  recovers  himself,  and  prepares 
to  make  the  fateful  announcement  which  is  to  free  his  bonds 
on  earth,  deprive  him  of  his  love,  and  restore  him  to  the 
heaven  of  Montsalvat.  Rising  to  his  full  stature,  whilst

origin,  "  I  do  not  shrink  from  declaring  my  name  and 
lineage.  Ye  shall  know  that  I  am  more  than  the  equal 
of  the  proudest  noble  here/* 

Then    follows    the    masterly    summary    of   the    opening 

orchestral   prelude,   the   leading  parts    being   for    the  first 

time  transferred  in  a  consecutive  melody  to  the 

"i  AM  hero.  Then  the  legend  of  the  Sangrail  comes 
forth.  The  story  of  the  shining  halls  of  Mont- 
salvat,  with  its  consecrated  knights ;  of  his  own  mission  to 
succour  the  oppressed,  of  the  ineffable  raptures  of  the 
blessed  cup.  The  whole  orchestration,  now  headed  by  the 
mystic  knight,  is  like  the  actual  unfolding  in  flesh  and 
blood,  or  revelation  to  the  eye  of  sense  of  what  in  the 
ethereal  introduction  was  but  an  anticipatory  vision. 

The  crystal  globe  has  yielded  up  its  secret.  The  parable 
of  the  Grail  is  about  to  be  realised  as  the  knight  declares, 
"  My  father  is  crowned  Parsifal,  and  I  am  LOHENGRIN  ! " 

An  immense  emotion  now  takes  possession  of  the 
monarch  and  his  assembled  lieges.  ce  While  I  hear  him," 
exclaims  the  King,  "the  holy  tears  course  down  my  cheeks." 

Poor  Elsa  staggers  back — "  'Tis  all  dark — dark  !  The 
earth  reels  !  air — air — I  cannot  breathe  !  "  Her  fainting 
form  is  caught  in  Lohengrin's  arms,  longing,  hungering 
for  her  the  last  time.  "  I  felt  thou  wast  the  soul  of  all 
delight."  It  is  almost  the  last  touch  of  earthly  passion. 
Elsa,  awaking  from  her  swoon,  tries  passionately  to  detain

him.  She  despairs,  she  repents,  she  will  do  any  penance. 
Too  late  !  "  Alas  !  my  sweetest  wife,  I  must  leave  thee  for 
ever/'  It  is  his  only,  but  inexorable  reply.  Elsa  seems 
stunned :  worn  out  for  a  moment  with  the  intense  emotion, 
she  lies  still  in  his  arms.  The  knight  commits  her  fainting 
to  her  ladies,  then  turns,  and  explains  that  he  cannot  lead 
the  army  to  war;  that  he  must  return  from  whence  he  came. 

But  on  the  distant  Scheldt  the  portent  is  now  seen  again. 
Groups  crowd  once  more,  and  rush  to  the  river  banks. 

The  cry  of  "The  swan!  the  swan!"  resounds 
THE  SWAN  I  on  all  sides.  Lohengrin  advances  to  the  swan, 

now  close  on  the  banks  with  the  empty  skiff, 
and  greets  the  fair  white  bird  with  a  modified  form  of 
the  first  magic  strain,  which  is  so  widely  known  as  the 
"  Swan ''  motive.  But  ere  he  ascends  the  bark  he  unlocks 
the  riddle  of  the  swan,  and  the  mystery  of  the  vanished 
Gottfried,  Elsa's  brother.  He  returns  for  a  moment  to 
fold  his  lost  bride  in  one  last  embrace,  to  tell  her,  that 
had  she  been  true,  in  a  year  her  brother  would  have  been 
restored,  and  her  husband  would  not  have  been  lost  to  her ; 
that  now,  his  ring,  his  horn,  and  his  sword,  alone  can  be 
left  with  her.  These  she  must  give  to  her  brother  when 
he  appears.  They  are  the  sure  means  of  victory ;  they  will 
constitute  him  the  leader  and  Overlord  of  his  people.  He 
then  commits  himself  once  more  to  the  service  of  the  Holy 
Grail,  and  strides  back  to  the  empty  bark.

tarried  another  minute,  the  spell  would  have 
been  broken,  and  Gottfried  restored.  But  at  that  instant, 
whilst  a  burst  of  execration  rises  from  the  crowd,  the  swan 
vanishes — the  young  Gottfried  rushes  towards  Elsa. 

The  dove  of  the  Holy  Grail  flutters  down,  and  is  har- 
nessed by  Lohengrin  to  the  bark,  which  moves  off  apace 
with  the  shining  knight.  With  a  scream  of  joy,  Elsa 
falls  into  her  brother's  arms,  and  then  catching  sight  of 
her  beloved  borne  away  on  the  great  flood,  with  a  wild 
despairing  cry  of  "  My  husband  !  "  sinks  lifeless  to  the

the  crushed  self-abasement  of  Elsa,  her  Jate  repentance — 
too  late;  her  illogical  passion,  hoping  against  hope  to  detain 
her  knight  ;  her  exhausted  emotions,  waking  at  last  only 
in  fitful  bursts,  and  exhibiting  in  the  shock  of  their  com- 
plete overthrow  the  phenomena  of  wild  joy,  instantly 
followed  by  the  last  flood  of  grief,  in  which  her  very  life 
seems  to  exhale  itself;  the  fateful  gleam  of  a  malignant 
spite,  which  prompts  Ortrud  a  moment  too  soon  to  reveal 
her  secret;  the  crowning  vision  of  the  Sangrail,  in  the 
shape  of  the  heavenly  dove  which  once  a  year  descended 
to'  renew  the  potency  of  the  sacrificial  cup,  and  now  flutters 
for  a  second  before  the  dazed  eyes  of  mortals,  in  that 
supreme  hour  of  an  accomplished  deliverance ;  and  lastly, 
the  perfect  close,  and  sense  of  dramatic  unity  left  upon 
the  mind  by  the  departure  of  the  shining  knight,  as  he 
came,  over  the  great  water-floods,  lost  as  soon  as  known — 
eternal  symbol  of  the  joy  and  tender  glories  that  are  for 
ever  vanishing  in  the  moment  of  possession ;  yet,  in  their 
transitory  glow,  leaving  behind  them  the  memory  which 
is  to  feed  the  coming  years  with  the  bright  legacy  of  an 
aspiring  and  insatiable  hope  :  all  this  must  stamp  Lohengrin 
— as,  indeed,  every  work  of  WAGNER'S  is  stamped — with  an 
impress  of  earnest  reality  separating  it  from  all  ordinary 
operas,  and  constituting  it  a  great  poem,  wedded  to 
dramatic  action  and  filled  with  noble  music.

ON    PHENOMENAL    PLAYERS. 

THE  greatest  phenomenal  players  of  their  age  have  un- 
doubtedly been  LISZT  and  PAOANINI.  They  were  great 

not  merely  because  they  could  play  better  than 
THE  FIRST  others,  but  because  they  created  what  they 

played.  It  is  quite  possible  to  maintain  that 
RUBINSTEIN  and  BULOW  play  quite  as  well  as  LISZT,  or 
that  ERNST  and  JOACHIM  are  as  good  as  PAGANINI,  but 
it  is  nevertheless  an  absurdity  and  impertinence  to  argue 
the  point.  They  were  not  the  first — they  came  afterwards. 
A  man  who  takes  gold  out  of  a  mine  may  be  as  good  as 
the  man  who  discovered  the  mine,  but  he  is  not  that  man. 
He  does  excellent  work,  but  he  was  not  the  first  on  tho 
ground — he  came  afterwards. 

A  thing  once  discovered  cannot  be  rediscovered,  and  an

*"  apart  from  what  is  new  and  original  in  their 
respective  contributions  to  Art,  it  is  doubtful 
whether  two  such  extraordinary  personalities  as  those  of 
PAGANINI  and  LISZT  have  ever  appeared  in  the  world  of 
virtuosity.  In  some  respects  LISZT  is  even  more  extra- 
ordinary than  PAGANINI;  for,  in  the  first  place,  he  elec- 
trified a  world  still  under  thd  spell  of  the  weird  Italian's 
Cremona;  and,  in  the  second  place,  his  demands  have 
achieved  for  the  piano  what  no  demands  of  PAGANINI 
ever  could  for  the  violin — a  profound  modification  and 
re-creation  of  the  instrument  to  enable  him  to  realise  his 
prodigious  feats  of  sonority  and  execution.  The  modifica- 
tions introduced  by  violin  repairers — strengthening  bars 
ribs,  glueing  cracks,  &c. — are  trifling  compared  to  th 
changes  which  separate  the  pianoforte  of  1820  from  that 
of  1880.  PAGANINI  is  the  creator  of  the  modern  violin 
school ;  but  LISZT  has  not  only  created  the  modern  piano- 
forte school,  but  in  some  sort  the  modern  pianoforte. 

Great  heart,  great  brain,  daring  originality,  electric 
organisation,  iron  nerve,  and  a  soul  vibrating  to  sound  like 
an  ./Eolian  harp  to  the  wind;  there  you  have  the  per- 
sonality, phenomenal  and  unique,  of  FRAXZ  LISZT.

authority,  its  childlike  and  impulsive  fancy,  was  nevertheless 
a  great  creative  period. 

Then  were  sown  the  seeds  that  have  since  germinated  so 
gloriously  in  literature,  and  art,  and  politics  throughout 
Europe.  Then  flourished,  or  at  least  were  born,  the  men

In  1811  was  FRANZ  LISZT  born.  He  had  the  hot  Hun- 
garian blood  of  his  father,  the  fervid  German  spirit  of  his 
mother,  and  he  inherited  the  lofty  independence,  with  none 
of  the  class  prejudices,  of  the  old  Hungarian  nobility  from 
which  he  sprang. 

LISZT'S  father,  ADAM,  earned  a  modest  livelihood  as  agent 
and  accountant  in  the  house  of  COUNT  ESTERHAZY.  In  that 
great  musical  family  inseparably  associated  with  the  names

of  HAYDN  and  SCHUBERT,*  ADAM  LISZT  had  frequent 
opportunities  of  meeting  distinguished  musicians.  The 
Prince's  private  band  had  risen  to  public  fame  under  the 
instruction  of  the  venerable  HAYDN  himself.  The  LISZTS, 
father  and  son,  often  went  to  Eisenstadt,  where  the  Count 
lived ;  there  they  rubbed  elbows  with  CHERUBINI  and 
HUMMEL,  a  pupil  of  MOZART. 

FRANZ  took  to  music  from  his  earliest  childhood.    When 
about  five  years  old,  he  was  asked  what  he  would  like  to  do. 

"  Learn  the  piano/'  said  the  little  fellow.     Soon

ming, making  what  he  called  "  clangs,"  chords,  and  modu- 
lations. He  mastered  scales  and  exercises  without  difficulty. 

But  there  was  a  certain  intensity  in  all  he  did,  which 

seemed  to  wear  him  out.     He  was  attacked  with  fever,  but 

would   hardly   be   persuaded    to   lie  down  until

aloud  to  God  to  make  him  well,  and  vowed  that 
on  his  recovery  he  would  only  make  hymns  and  play  music

which  pleased  God  and  his  parents.  The  strong  lines  of  his 
character  early  asserted  themselves — religious  ardour,  open 
sincerity,  a  certain  nobleness  of  soul  that  scorned  a  lie 
and  generously  confessed  to  a  fault,  quick  affections,  ready 
sympathies,  a  mind  singularly  without  prejudices  or  antipa- 
thies, except  in  music.  LISZT'S  musical  antipathies  are 
matters  of  world- wide  notoriety  ;  his  hatred  of  "  Conserva- 
torium "  dogma,  his  contempt  for  the  musical  doctrinaire, 
his  aversion  to  the  shallow  and  frivolous,  his  abhorrence  of 
mere  sensationalism. 

The  boy's  decided  bent  soon  banished  all  thought  of  any- 
thing but   a   musical   vocation,  but  the  res  angusta  domi 
stood  in  the  way.     How  was  he  to  be  taught?

THE  WHEEE-  how  was  he  to  be  heard  ?  how  to  earn  money  ? 
That  personal  fascination,  from  which  no  one 
who  has  ever  come  in  contact  with  LISZT  has  quite  escaped, 
helped  him  thus  early.  When  eight  years  old,  he  played 
before  COUNT  ESTERHAZY  in  the  presence  of  six  noblemen, 
amongst  them  COUNTS  AMADEE,  APPONYI,  and  SZAPARY — 
eternal  honour  to  their  names  !  They  at  once  subscribed 
for  him  an  annuity  of  six  hundred  gulden  for  six  years. 
This  was  to  help  the  little  prodigy  to  a  musical  education. 

His  parents  felt  the  whole  importance  of  the  crisis.  If 
the  boy  was  to  prosper,  the  father's  present  retired  life  with 
a  fixed  income  must  be  changed  for  an  unsettled  wandering 
and  precarious  existence.  "  When  the  six  years  are  over,

and  your  hopes  prove  vain,  what  will  become  of  us  ?  "  said 
his  mother,  who  heard,  with  tears  in  her  eyes,  that  father 
was  going  to  give  up  the  agency  and  settle  down  wherever 
the  boy  might  need  instruction,  protection,  and  a  home. 
"  Mother,"  said  the  impetuous  child,  "  what  God  wills ! " 
and  he  added,  prophetically  enough,  "  God  will  help  me  to 
repay  you  for  all  your  anxieties  and  for  what  you  do  for 
me."  And  with  what  results  he  laboured  in  this  faith, 
years  afterwards  in  Paris,  we  shall  see. 

The  agency  was  thrown  up ;  the  humble  family,  mother, 

father,  son,  went  out  alone  from  the  little  Hungarian  village 

into   an  unknown    and    untried   world,    simply

THE  WIDE,  trusting  to  the  genius,  the  will,  the  word  of  an 
'D'  obscure  child  of  eight :  "  I  will  be  a  musician, 
and  nothing  else  ! " 

As  the  child  knelt  at  his  farewell  mass  in  the  little  village 
church  of  Raiding,  many  wept,  others  shook  their  heads, 
but  some  even  then  seemed  to  have  a  presentiment  of  his 
future  greatness,  and  said,  "That  boy  will  one  day  come 
back  in  a  glass  coach."  This  modest  symbol  represented  to 
them  the  idea  of  boundless  wealth. 

HUMMEL  would  only  teach  for  a  golden  louis  a  lesson,  and 

then  picked  his  pupils  ;  but  at  Vienna  the  father

MANY      arid  son  fell  in  with  CZERNY,  BEETHOVEN'S  pupil, 
and  the  famous  SALIERI,  now  seventy  years  old. 


FIRST  APPEARANCES.  615 

CZERNY  at  once  took  to  LISZT,  but  refused  to  take  any- 
thing for  his  instruction.  SALIERI  was  also  fascinated,  and 
instructed  him  in  harmony ;  and  fortunate  it  was  that  LISZT 
began  his  course  under  two  such  strict  mentors. 

He  soon  began  to  resent  CZERNY'S  method,  thought  he 
knew  better  and  needed  not  those  dry  studies  of  CLEMENTI 
and  that  irksome  fingering  by  rule ;  he  could  finger  every- 
thing in  half-a-dozen  different  ways.  There  was  a  moment 
when  it  seemed  that  master  and  pupil  would  have  to  part ; 
but  timely  concessions  to  genius  paved  the  way  to  dutiful 
submission,  and  years  afterwards  the  great  master  dedicated 
to  the  rigid  disciplinarian  of  his  boyhood  his  Vingt-quatre 
Grandes  Eludes  in  affectionate  remembrance. 

Young  talent  often  splits  upon  the  rock  of  self-sufficiency. 
Many  a  clever  artist  has  failed  because  in  the  pride  of 
youthful  facility  he  has  declined  the  method  and  drudgery 
of  a  correct  technique. 

Such  a  light  as  LISZT'S  could  not  be  long  hid;  all  Vienna 

in  1822  was  talking  of  the  wonderful  boy.     "  Est  deus  in 

nobis,"  wrote  the  papers  rather  profanely.     The 

FIHST        "little  Hercules,"  the  "young  giant,"  the  boy

"  virtuoso  trom  the  clouds,  were  amongst  the 
epithets  coined  to  celebrate  his  marvellous  rendering  of 
HUMMEI/S  "  Concerto  in  A  "  and  a  free  "  Fantasia  "  of  his 
own. 

The  Vienna  Concert  Hall  was  crowded  to  hear  him ;  and 


616  LISZT. 

the  other  illustrious  artists — then,  as  indeed  they  have  been 
ever  since  forced  to  do  wherever  LISZT  appeared — effaced 
themselves  with  as  good  a  grace  as  they  could. 

It  is  a  remarkable  tribute  to  the  generous  nature  as  well 
as  to  the  consummate  ability  of  LISZT,  that,  whilst  opposing 
partisans  have  fought  bitterly  over  him — Thalbergites, 
Herzites,  Mendelssohnites  versus  Lisztites — yet  few  of  the 
great  artists  who  have,  one  after  another,  had  to  yield  to 
him  in  popularity  have  denied  to  him  their  admiration, 
while  most  of  them  have  given  him  their  friendship. 

LISZT  early  wooed  arid  early  won  Vienna.  He  spoke 
ever  of  his  dear  Viennese  and  their  "  resounding  city." 

When  I  saw  LISZT  at  Tivoli  in  1880,  ^1  remember  his 
saying  to  me,  "J'ai  regu  le  celebre  baiser  de  BEETHOVEN." 

I  find  that  BEETHOVEN'S  secretary.  SCHINDLER, 
516. 
IHE  KISS  OF  wrote,   in   1823,  to  BEETHOVEN  :  "  You  will  be 

*'  present  at  little  LISZT'S  concert,  will  you  not  ? 
It  will  encourage  the  boy.  Promise  me  that  you  will  go." 
And  BEETHOVEN  went.  When  the  "  little  LISZT  "  stepped 
on  to  the  platform,  he  saw  BEETHOVEN  in  the  front  row  ;  it 
nerved  instead  of  staggering  him — he  played  with  an  aban- 
don and  inspiration  which  defied  criticism.  Amidst  the 
storm  of  applause  which  followed,  BEETHOVEN  was  observed 
to  step  up  on  the  platform,  take  the  young  virtuoso  in  his 
arms,  and  salute  him,  as  LISZT  assured  me,  "  on  both 
cheeks."  This  was  an  event  not  to  be  lightly  forgotten,

and  hardly  after  fifty-seven  years  to  be  alluded  to  without 
a  certain  awe ;  indeed,  LISZT'S  voice  quite  betrayed  his  sense 
of  the  seriousness  of  the  occasion  as  he  repeated,  with  a 
certain  conscious  pride  and  gravity,  "  Oui,  j'ai  TCQU  le  baiser 
de  BEETHOVEN." 

A  concert  tour  on  his  way  to  Paris  brought  him  before 
the  critical  public  of  Stuttgardt  and  Munich.  HUMMEL,  an 

old  man,  and  MOSCHELES,  then  in  his  prime,  heard 
517. 

CHEKOBINI   him,  and  declared  that  his  playing  was  equal  to 
theirs.     But  LISZT  was  bent  upon  completing  his 
studies  in  the  celebrated  school  of  the  French  capital,  and 
at  the  feet  of  the  old  musical  dictator  CHERUBINI. 

The  ERARDS,  who  were  destined  to  owe  so  much  to  LISZT, 
and  to  whom  LISZT  throughout  his  career  has  owed  so 
much,  at  once  provided  him  with  a  magnificent  piano ;  but 
CHERUBINI  put  in  force  a  certain  bye-law  of  the  Conservatoire 
excluding  foreigners,  and  excluded  FRANZ  LISZT. 

This  was  a  bitter  pill  to  the  eager  student.     He  hardly 

knew  how  little   he   required  such   patronage.     In  a  very 

short  time  "  le  petit  LISZT  "  was  the  great  Paris

MOSCHELES,  LAFONT,  and  DE  BERIOT  assisted.  ROSSINI

would  sit  by  his  side  at  the  piano  and  applaud.  He  was 
a  "  miracle."  The  company  never  tired  of  extolling  his 
"  verve,  fougue  et  originalite,1'  whilst  the  ladies,  who  petted 
and  caressed  him  after  each  performance,  were  delighted  at 
his  simple  and  graceful  carriage,  the  elegance  of  his  language, 
and  the  perfect  breeding  and  propriety  of  his  demeanour. 

He  was  only  twelve  when  he  played  for  the  first  time  at 
the  Italian  Opera,  and  one  of  those  singular  incidents  which 
remind  one  of  PAGANINI'S  triumphs  occurred. 

At  the  close  of  a  bravura  cadenza  the  band  forgot  to  come 
in,  so  absorbed  were  the  musicians  in  watching  the  young 
prodigy.  Their  failure  was  worth  a  dozen  successes  to  LISZT. 
The  ball  of  the  marvellous  was  fairly  set  rolling. 

GALL,  the  inventor  of  phrenology,  took  a  cast  cf  the 
little  LISZT'S  skull ;  TALMA,  the  tragedian,  embraced  him 
publicly  with  effusion ;  and  the  misanthropic  MARQUIS  DE 
NOAILLES  became  his  mentor,  and  initiated  him  into  the  art 
of  painting. 

In  1824  LISZT,  then  thirteen  years  old,  came  with  his 
father  to  England ;  his  mother  returned  to  Austria. 

He  went  down  to  Windsor  to  see  GEORGE  IV.,

celebrity,  KALKBRENNER,  NEATE,  then  a  fashionable 
pianist,  once  a  great  favourite  of  GEORGE  III.,  and 
whom  I  remember  about  thirty  years  ago  in  extreme  old 
age  at  Brighton.  He  described  to  me  the  poor  old  king's 
delight  at  hearing  him  play  some  simple  English  melodies. 
"I  assure  you,  Mr.  NEATE,"  said  GEORGE  III.,  "I  have 
had  more  pleasure  in  hearing  you  play  those  simple  airs 
than  in  all  the  variations  and  tricks  your  fine  players 
affect." 

GEORGE  IV.  went  to  Drury  Lane  on  purpose  to  hear 
the  boy,  and  commanded  an  encore.  LISZT  was  also 
heard  in  the  theatre  at  Manchester,  and  in  several  private 
houses. 

On  his  return  to  France  people  noticed  a  change  in  him. 

He  was  now  fourteen,  grave,  serious,  often   pre- occupied, 

already  a  little  tired  of  praise,    and  excessively 

tired  of  being  called  "  le  petit  LISZT."     His  vision 

X   CHANGE. 

began  to  take  a  wider  sweep.  The  relation 
between  art  and  religion  exercised  him.  His  mind  was 
naturally  devout.  THOMAS  A  KEMPIS  was  his  constant  com- 
panion. "  Rejoice  in  nothing  but  a  good  deed";  "Through 
labour  to  rest,  through  combat  to  victory " ;  "  The  glory 
which  men  give  and  take  is  transitory" — these  and  like 
phrases  were  already  deeply  engraven  on  the  fleshly  tablets 
of  his  heart.  Amidst  all  his  glowing  triumphs  he  was 


620  LISZT. 

developing  a  curious  disinclination  to  appear  in  public;  he 
seemed  to  yearn  for  solitude  and  meditation. 

In  1827  he  now  again  hurried  to  England  for  a  short 
time,  but  his  father's  sudden  illness  drove  them  to  Boulogne, 

where,   in  his    forty-seventh   year,    died    ADAM 
521. 

DEATH  OF  LISZT,  leaving  the  young  FRANZ  for  the  first  time 
in  his  life,  at  the  early  age  of  sixteen,  unprotected 
and  alone. 

Rousing  himself  from  the  bodily  prostration  and  torpor 
of  grief  into  which  he  had  been  thrown  by  the  death  of  his 
father,  FRANZ,  with  admirable  energy  and  that  high  sense 
of  honour  which  has  always  distinguished  him,  began 
to  set  his  house  in  order.  He  called  in  all  his  debts, 
sold  his  magnificent  grand  Erard,  and  left  Boulogne  for 
Paris  with  a  heavy  heart  and  a  light  pocket,  but  not  owing 
a  sou. 

He  sent  for  his  mother,  and  for  the  next  twelve  years, 

18.28-1840,  the  two  lived  together,  chiefly  in  Paris.     There, 

as  a  child,  he  had  been  a  nine-day's  wonder,  but 

522. 

CARE  OF  HIS  the  solidity  of  his  reputation  was  now  destined  to 
go   hand   in   hand   with  his  stormy   and   inter- 
rupted mental  and  moral  development. 

Such  a  plant  could  not  come  to  maturity  all  at  once. 
No  drawing-room  or  concert-room  success  satisfied  a  heart 
for  which  the  world  of  human  emotion  seemed  too  small, 


UNSETTLED   CONDITIONS.  621 

and  an  intellect  piercing  with  intuitive  intelligence  into  the 
"  clear-obscure  "  depths  of  religion  and  philosophy. 

But  FRANZ  was  young,  and  FRANZ  was  poor,  and  his 
mother  had  to  be  supported.  She  was  his  first  care.  Syste- 
matically, he  laboured  to  put  by  a  sum  which  would 
assure  her  of  a  competency,  and  often  with  his  tender  genial 
smile  he  would  remind  her  of  his  own  childish  words,  "  God 
will  help  me  to  repay  you  for  all  that  you  have  done  for 
me."  Still  he  laboured  often  wofully  against  the  grain. 

"  Poverty  "  he  writes,  "that  old  mediator  between  man 
and  evil,  tore  me  from  my  solitude  devoted  to  meditation,  and 
placed  me  before  a  public  on  whom  not  only  my  own  but 
my  own  mother's  existence  depended.  Young  and  over- 
strained, I  suffered  painfully  under  the  contact  with  external 
things  which  my  vocation  as  a  musician  brought  with  it, 
and  which  wounded  me  all  the  more  intensely  that  my 
heart  at  this  time  was  filled  entirely  with  the  mystical 
feelings  of  love  and  religion." 

Of  course  the  gifted   young    pianist's    connection   grew 

rapidly.     He  got   his  twenty  francs  a  lesson  at  the  best 

houses ;  he  was  naturally  a  welcome  guest,  and

ransian  society.  His  lite  was  ieverish,  his 
activity  irregular,  his  health  far  from  strong ;  but  the  vulgar 
temptations  of  the  gay  capital  seemed  to  have  little  attrac- 
tion for  his  noble  nature.  His  heart  remained  unspoiled.

« 

He  was  most  generous  to  those  who  could  not  afford  to  pay 
for  his  lessons,  most  pitiful  to  the  poor,  most  dutiful  and 
affectionate  to  his  mother.  Coming  home  late  from  some 
grand  entertainment,  he  would  sit  outside  on  the  staircase 
till  morning  sooner  than  awaken,  or  perhaps  alarm,  her  by 
letting  himself  in.  But  in  losing  his  father  he  seemed  to 
have  lost  a  certain  method  and  order.  His  meals  were 
irregular,  so  were  his  lessons;  more  so  were  the  hours 
devoted  to  sleep. 

At  this  time  he  was  hardly  twenty ;  we  are  not  surprised 
anon  to  hear  in  his  own  words  of  "  a  female  form  chaste 

and  pure  as  the  alabaster  of  holy  vessel "  :  but 
524. 
A  FEMALE   he  adds  :  "  Such  was  the  sacrifice  which  I  offered

I  will  explain. 

MDLLE.  CAROLINE  ST.  CRICQ  was  just  seventeen,  lithe, 
slender,  and  of  "  angelic  "  beauty,  and  a  complexion  like  a 
lily  flushed  with  roses,  "  impressionable  to  beauty,  to  the 
world,  to  religion,  to  God."  The  Countess,  her  mother, 
appears  to  have  been  a  charming  woman,  very  partial  to 
LISZT,  whom  she  engaged  to  instruct  Mademoiselle  in  music. 

The  lessons  were  not  by  time,  but  by  inclination.  The 
young  man's  eloquence,  varied  knowledge,  ardent  love  of 
literature,  and  flashing  genius  won  both  the  mother  and 
daughter.  Not  one  of  them  seemed  to  suspect  the  whirl- 
pool of  grief  and  death  to  which  they  were  hurrying.  The 


LOVE  AND   GRIEF.  623 

Countess  fell  ill  and  died,  but  not  before  she  had  recom- 
mended LISZT  to  the  COUNT  ST.  CRICQ  as  a  possible  suitor 
for  the  hand  of  Mademoiselle. 

The  haughty  diplomat  ST.  CRICQ  at  once  put  his  foot 
down.  The  funeral  over,  LISZT'S  movements  were  watched. 
They  were  innocent  enough.  He  was  already  an  enfant  de 
la  maison,  but  one  night  he  lingered  reading  aloud  some 
favourite  author  to  Mademoiselle  a  little  too  late.  He  was 
reported  by  the  servants,  and  received  his  polite  dismissal 
as  music  master. 

In  an  interview  with  the  Count  his  own  pride  was  deeply 
wounded.  "  Difference  of  rank  !  "  said  the  Count.  That 
was  quite  enough  for  LISZT.  He  rose,  pale  as  death,  with 
quivering  lip,  but  uttered  not  a  word. 

As  a  man  of  honour  he  had  but  one  course.  He  and 
CAROLINE  parted  for  ever.  She  contracted  later  an  uncon- 
genial marriage;  he  seems  to  have  turned  with  intense 
ardour  to  religion.  His  good  mother  used  to  complain  to 
those  who  came  to  inquire  for  him  that  he  was  all  day  long 
in  church,  and  had  ceased  to  occupy  himself,  as  he  should, 
with  music. 

Love,  grief,  religion,  all  struggling  together  for  victory 

in   that  young  and  fervid  spirit,  at  last  seemed

see  his  mother  at  meals.  He  never  appeared  in  the  streets, 
and  not  unnaturally  ended  by  falling  dangerously  ill. 

It  was  at  this  time  that  Paris  was  one  moruing  startled 
with  the  following  newspaper  announcement : 

"  DEATH    OF    YOUNG    LISZT. 
526.

painful — at  an  age  when  most  children  are  at 
school.     He  had  conquered  the  public/'  &c. 

So  wrote  the  Etoile.  In  fact,  he  was  seriously  ill. 
M.  VON  LENZ,  BEETHOVEN'S  biographer,  went  to  visit  him. 
He  was  lying  pale,  haggard,  and  apathetic ;  could  hardly  be 
roused  to  converse  except  occasionally  when  music  cropped 
up.  Then  his  eye  brightened  for  a  moment  like  the 
"  flashing  of  a  dagger  in  the  sun." 

In  1830  the  Revolution  burst  on  Paris.     This,  it  seems, 

was  needed  to  arouse  LISZT.     The  inner  life  was  suddenly  to

gueri ! ''  his  mother  used  to  say.  LISZT  was  hardly  re- 
strained by  her  tears  and  entreaties  from  rushing  to  the 
barricades.  The  cure  threatened  to  be  worse  than  the

him,  and  he  shouted  with  the  rest  for  the  silver-haired 
GENERAL  LAFAYETTE,  "  genius  of  the  liberties  of  two 
worlds." 

The  republican  enthusiasm,  so    happily  restrained  from

THE  AGE.  great  battle  symphonies,  his  whole  artistic  nature 
received  a  decisive  and  startling  impulse  from  the  sudden 
apparition  of  PAGANINI  in  Paris.  Preceded  by  revolution 
and  cholera,  this  weird  man  had  come  upon  the  bright  city 
that  had  sinned  and  suffered  so  much,  and  found  her  shaken 
and  demoralised,  but  still  seething  with  a  strange  ferment 
of  new  life  in  which  Saint-Simonianism,  communism,  and 
scepticism,  side  by  side  with  fanaticism,  piety,  and  romance, 
struggled  to  make  confusion  worse  confounded.  Into  the 
depths  of  what  has  been  called  the  Romantic  movement  of 
1830-40  it  is  not  my  purpose  here  to  enter.  There  was  war 
alike  with  the  artificial  hum- drum  of  the  old  French  world 
and  the  still  more  artificial  revival  of  the  classical  world  of 
Greece  and  Rome. 

The  human  spirit  was  at  length  to  be  liberated  ;  no  one,

it  was  held,  need  believe  anything  that  did  not  happen  to 
commend  itself  to  his  fancy  or  passion.  As  HEINE  put  it : 
"  The  great  God,  it  appeared,  was  not  at  all  the  being  in 
whom  our  grandmothers  had  trusted ;  he  was,  in  fact,  none 
other  than  you  yourself/'  No  one  need  be  bound  by  the 
morals  of  an  effete  civilisation.  In  Love  the  world  of  sen- 
timent alone  must  decide  our  actions.  Everyone  must  be 
true  to  nature.  All  men  were  brothers,  and  women  should 
have  equal  and  independent  rights.  The  social  contract, 
most  free  and  variable,  must  be  substituted  for  marriage, 
community  of  goods  for  hereditary  possessions,  philosophy 
for  law,  and  romance  for  religion.  The  beautiful  and 
pregnant  seeds  of  truth  that  lay  imbedded  in  the  teeming 
soil  of  this  great  movement  have  since  fully  germinated ; 
its  extravagances  have  already,  to  a  great  extent,  been 
outgrown. 

In  spite  of  theories  disastrous  to  political  and  social 
order,  the  genius  of  MADAME  SAND,  VICTOR  HUGO,  and 
A.  DE  MUSSET,  sceptic  and  sensualist  as  he  was,  have 
rescued  the  movement  from  the  despair  of  raw  materialism, 
and  produced  works  of  immortal  beauty  and  spiritual 
significance. 

They  helped  the  European  spirit  to  recover  its  indepen- 
dence, they  reacted  against  the  levelling  tyranny  of  the  first 
NAPOLEON,  and  were  largely  instrumental  in  undermining 
the  third  NAPOLEON'S  throne  of  gilded  lead.  Stained  with 
licence  and  full  of  waywardness,  it  was,  nevertheless,  an  age 


PAG  AN  IN  I  AND   THE  AGE.  627 

of  great  and  strong  feelings — an  age  volcanic,  vivid,  electric. 
Such  an  age  eagerly  welcomed  the  magicians  who  set  the 
language  of  emotion  free,  and  gave  to  music  its  myriad 
wings  and  million  voices. 

PAGANINI  appeared.  The  violin  was  no  more  the  violin. 
A  new  transcendent  technique  made  it  the  absolute  minister 
of  an  emancipated  and  fantastic  will.  The  extraordinary 
power  exercised  by  the  Italian  violinist  throughout  Europe 
was  quickened  by  the  electric  air  which  he  breathed.  The 
times  were  ripe.  He  stood  before  kings  and  people  as  the 
very  emotional  embodiment  of  the  Zeitgeist.  He  was  the 
emancipated  demon  of  the  epoch,  with  power  to  wield 
the  sceptre  of  sound,  and  marshal  in  strange  and  frenzied 
legions  the  troubled  spirits  of  the  time. 

When  LISZT  heard  PAGANINI,  it  seemed  to  him  to  be  the 
message  for  which  he  had  been  waiting.  From  him  he 
doubtless  received  that  passion  for  "  transcendant  execu- 
tion/' that  absolute  perfection  of  technique,  which  enabled 
him  to  create  the  modern  pianoforte  school,  and  win  for 
ERARD  and  BROAD  WOOD  what  PAGANINI  won  for  STRADI- 
VARIUS  and  JOSEPH  GUARNERIUS.  His  transcriptions  of 
PAGANINI'S  studies,  the  arpeggio,  ihefioriture,  the  prodigious 
attaque  and  elan  that  took  audiences  by  storm,  the  meetings 
of  extremes  which  abolished  the  spaces  on  the  pianoforte 
key-board  by  making  the  hands  ubiquitous — these  and  other 
"  developments  "  were  doubtless  inspired  by  the  prodigious 
feats  of  PAGANINI.

LISZT  now  suddenly  retired  from  the  concert-room.     He 

was   no   longer   heard   in   public ;    he    seemed   disinclined, 

529.        except   in   the  presence  of  his  intimates,  to  ex-

WITHDRAWS 

HIMSELF.  fect  himself,  to  work  up  and  work  out  the  new 
impulses  which  he  had  received  from  PAGANINI. 

He  thus  early  laid  deep  the  foundations  of  his  unique 
virtuosity ;  and  when  he  reappeared  in  public,  he  seemed  to 
mount  at  once  to  that  solitary  pinnacle  of  fame  and  sur- 
passing excellence  to  which  the  greatest  pianists  then  and 
ever  since  have  looked  up  in  admiring  and  despairing 
wonder.  TAUSIG  said,  "  "We  are  all  blockheads  by  the 
side  of  LISZT."  RUBINSTEIN  has  often  declared  LISZT'S 
perfection  of  art  and  wealth  of  resource  to  be  simply 
unrivalled. 

For  a  short  time  in  his  absence  at  Paris,  it  was  thought

that  THALBERG  would  prove  a  formidable  opponent.     But 
LISZT  had  only  to  reappear,  and  THALBERG  him- 

«*oU. 

LISZT  AND   self  was  forced  to  join  in  the  general  applause. 

When   between  the   various   schools   there    was 

war,  it  was  carried  on  by  the  partisans  of  the  great  men. 

Although  they  freely  criticised  one  another,  nothing  is  more 

remarkable  than  the  kindly  personal  feeling  which  obtained 

between  LISZT  and  his  natural  enemies,  the  great  pianists 

of  the  age,  MOSCHELES,  CHOPIN,  MENDELSSOHN,  THALBERG. 

There  were  no  doubt  cabals,  and  at  one  time  in  Paris  he

met  with  much  detraction,  but  he  seemed  to  move  in  a 
region  of  lofty  courtesy  in  which  squabbling  for  precedence 
was  out  of  place;  and  his  generosity  of  heart  and  genial 
recognition  of  others'  talent  disarmed  criticism  and  silenced 
malice. 

With  the  outburst  of  the  Revolution,  with  the  appearance 

of  PAGANINI,  came  also  to  LISZT  a  violent  reaction  against 

the  current  religious  ideas  and  the  whole  of  the 

KQi 

Catholic   teaching.       Reading    had    opened    his 

REACTION. 

eyes;  the  Catholic  system  seemed  to  him  not 
only  inadequate,  but  false.  He  required  a  freer  atmosphere, 
one  rather  more  interpretative  of  human  facts  and  human 
nature ;  he  thought  he  found  it  in  the  doctrines  of  the 
Saint-Simonians.  The  "  Nouveau  Christianisme,"  by  far 
the  best  of  ST.  SIMON'S  lucubrations,  seemed  to  show  that 
the  Church  had  misrepresented  and  outraged  the  religion  of 
CHRIST.  It  failed  to  take  due  account  of  art  and  science, 
had  no  sympathy  with  progress,  refused  altogether  to  assi- 
milate the  Zeitgeist,  and  had  evidently  ceased  to  lead  the 
thinkers  or  purify  the  masses. 

About  this   time   LISZT   came   across   the   eloquent  and 

gifted  ABBE   DE  LAMENNAIS.     This  man  it  was 
532. 
LISZT  AND  DE  who,  more  than  any   other,   saved   LISZT  from 

"*'    drifting  into  the  prevailing  whirlpool  of  atheism. 
The   heterodox  Abbe,  who   himself  had   broken  with   the 


630  LISZT. 

retrograde  religion  of  Rome,  re -formulated  his  system,  and 
discovered  for  him  what  at  that  time  he  most  craved  for — a 
link  between  his  religion  and  his  art. 

"  Art/'  said  DE  LAMENNAIS,  "  is  in  man  what  creative 
power  is  in  GOD."  Art  is  the  embodiment  of  eternal  types. 
Nature  suggests  a  beauty  she  never  completely  realises. 
Only  in  the  soul  of  man  is  the  supernal  beauty  mirrored  as 
it  exists  in  the  mind  of  God.  Art  is  the  soul's  formula 
for  the  expression  of  its  inner  life.  "  Art,  therefore,  is  an 
expression  of  GOD  j  her  works  are  an  infinite  manifold 
reflection  of  Him.' 

The  mission  of  art  to  reveal  the  secrets  of  the  inner  life, 
to  lift  the  souls  of  others  into  high  communion  with 

itself,  to  express  its  joy  in  possession,  its  hope 
THE  MISSION  of  attainment,  its  instiable  and  divine  longings, 

its  dreams  of  the  infinite — these  seemed  to  LISZT 
high  functions,  enriching,  fertilising,  and  consoling  all  life, 
and  leading  the  spirit  forth  into  that  weird  border-land  of 
the  emotions,  where  voices  come  to  it  from  the  Unseen,  and 
radiant  flashes  from  behind  the  Veil. 

It  was  towards  the  close  of  1831  that  LISZT  met  CHOPIN 

in   Paris.     From    the    first,  these    two   men.  so 
534. 

LISZT  AND  different,  became  fast  friends.    CHOPIN'S  delicate, 

retiring  soul  found  a  singular  delight  in  LISZT'S 

strong  and   imposing   personality.      LISZT'S    exquisite   per- 


LISZT  AND   CHOPIN.  631 

ception  enabled  him  perfectly  to  live  in  the  strange  dream- 
land of  CHOPIN'S  fancies,  whilst  his  own  vigour  inspired 
CHOPIN  with  nerve  to  conceive  those  mighty  Polonaises  that 
he  could  never  properly  play  himself,  and  which  he  so 
gladly  committed  to  the  keeping  of  his  prodigious  friend. 
LISZT  undertook  the  task  of  interpreting  CHOPIN  to  the 
mixed  crowds  which  he  revelled  in  subduing,  but  from 
which  his  fastidious  and  delicately-strung  friend  shrank  with 
something  like  aversion. 

From  CHOPIN,  LISZT  and  all  the  world  after  him  got 
that  tempo  rubato,  that  playing  with  the  duration  of  notes 
without  breaking  the  time,  and  those  arabesque  ornaments 
which  are  woven  like  fine  embroidery  all  about  the  pages  of 
CHOPIN'S  nocturnes,  and  which  lift  what  in  others  are 
mere  casual  nourishes  into  the  dignity  of  interpretative 
phrases  and  poetic  commentaries  on  the  text. 

People  were  fond  of  comparing  the  two  young  men  who 
so  often  appeared  in  the  same  salons  together — LISZT  with 
his  finely-shaped,  long,  oval  head  and  profile  d'ivoire,  set 
proudly  on  his  shoulders,  his  stiff  hair  of  dark  blonde 
thrown  back  from  the  forehead  without  a  parting,  and 
cut  in  a  straight  line,  his  aplomb,  his  magnificent  and 
courtly  bearing,  his  ready  tongue,  his  flashing  wit  and  fine 
irony,  his  genial  bonhomie  and  irresistibly  winning  smile ; 
and  CHOPIN,  also  with  dark  blonde  hair,  but  soft  as  silk 
parted  on  one  side,  to  use  LISZT'S  own  words,  "  an  angel  of 
fair  countenance  with  brown  eyes,  from  which  intellect 


C32  LISZT. 

beamed  rather  than  burned,  a  gentle,  refined  smile,  slightly 
aquiline  nose,  a  delicious,  clear,  almost  diaphonous  com- 
plexion, all  bearing  witness  to  the  harmony  of  a  soul  which 
required  no  commentary  beyond  itself." 

Nothing  can  be  more  generous  or  more  true  than  LISZT'S 

recognition   of    CHOPIN'S  independent   support.     "To   our 

endeavours/'   he   says,   "to   our   struggles,   just 

LISZT  ON    then  so  much  needing  certainty,  he  lent  us  the 

support  of  a  calm,  unshakable  conviction,  equally 

armed  against  apathy  and  cajolery/'     There  was  only  one 

picture  on  the  walls  of  CHOPIN'S  room;  it  hung  just  above 

his  piano.     It  was  a  head  of  LISZT. 

The  over-intensity  of  LISZT'S  powerful  nature  may  have 
occasionally  led  him  into  extravagances  of  virtuosity,  which 
laid  him  open  to  some  just  criticism.  ROBERT  SCHUMANN 
observed  acutely :  "  It  appears  as  if  the  sight  of  CHOPIN 
brought  him  again  to  his  senses." 

It  is  no  part  of  my  present  scheme  to  describe  the  battle 

which  romanticism  in  music  waged  against  the  prevalent 

conventionalities.     We   know  the   general  out-

OF   THE

supremacy  of  RICHARD  WAGNER,  who  certainly 
marks   firmly   and   broadly   enough  the  greatest   stride  in 
musical  development  made  since  BEETHOVEN. 


ELEMENTS  OF  THE  MUSIC  OF  THE  FUTURE.    633 

That  HECTOR  BERLIOZ  emancipated  the  orchestra  from 
all  previous  trammels,  and  dealt  with  sound  at  first-hand  as 
the  elemental  and  expressional  breath  of  the  soul,  that  he 
was  thus  the  immediate  precursor  of  WAGNER,  who  said 
with  more  modesty  than  truth,  "  I  have  invented  nothing," 
this  is  now  admitted.  That  SCHUMANN  was  afraid  of  the 
excesses  into  which  the  romantic  musicians  threatened  to 
plunge,  and,  having  started  well  and  cheered  them  on, 
showed  some  tendency  to  relapse  into  old  form  at  the 
moment  when  his  ingenious  and  passionate  soul  sank  into 
final  and  premature  gloom — that  has  heen  whispered.  That 
MENDELSSOHN  was  over-wedded  to  classical  tradition  and  a 
certain  passion  for  neatness  and  precision  which  prevented 
him  from  sounding  the  heights  and  depths  of  the  revolu- 
tionary epoch  in  the  midst  of  which  he  moved,  and  by 
which  his  sunny  spirit  was  so  little  affected — this  I  am  now 
able  to  see.  That  SPOHR  was  too  doctrinaire  and  mannered, 
MEYERBEER  a  great  deal  too  fond  of  melo-drama  and  sen- 
sation for  its  own  sake,  that  ROSSINI  and  AUBER,  exclusively 
bent  on  amusing  the  public,  were  scarcely  enough  hommes 
seneux  to  influence  the  deeper  development  of  harmony, 
or  effect  any  revolution  in  musical  form,  most  musicians 
will  allow;  and  that  LISZT  by  his  unique  virtuosity  has 
made  it  difficult  for  the  world  to  accept  him  in  any  other 
capacity,  is  the  constant  grievance  paraded  by  his  admirers. 
From  all  which  reflections  it  may  be  inferred  that  many 
workers  have  contributed  to  the  wealth,  resource,  and 


634  LISZT. 

emancipation  of  modern  music  from  those  trammels  which 
sought  to  confine  its  spirit  or  limit  its  freedom.  Through 
past  form,  it  has  at  length  learned  to  use  instead  of  being 
used  by  form.  The  modern  orchestra  has  won  the  unity 
and  spontaneity  of  an  independent  living  organism.  Like 
the  body,  it  is  a  complex  mechanism,  but  it  is  to  the  mind 
of  the  composer  as  the  human  body  is  to  the  soul.  It 
has  grown  so  perfect  an  instrument,  and  deals  with  so 
perfectly  mastered  an  art,  that  a  prelude  like  Lohengrin 
or  the  opening  of  Parsifal  sounds  like  the  actual  expres- 
sion of  the  inner  moods  of  the  spirit  rendered  outwardly 
with  automatic  unconscious  fidelity.  The  rule,  the  technique, 
are  lost,  hidden,  forgotten,  because  completely  efficacious, 
and  subordinated  to  the  free  movements  of  the  composer's 
spirit. 

To  this  latest  triumph  of  the  musical  art  three  men  since 
BEETHOVEN  have  mainly  contributed ;  their  names  are 
certainly  HECTOR  BERLIOZ,  WAGNER,  and  LISZT. 

The  darling  of  the  aristocracy,  accustomed  from  his 
earliest  youth  to  mix  freely  with  the  haute  noblesse  of 

Germany  and  France,  LISZT  was  a  republican  at 
637. 
LISZT  AND    heart.     He  felt  acutely  for  the  miseries  of  the 

8'  people,  and  he  was  always  a  great  player  for 
the  masses.  "  When  I  play,"  he  once  said,  "  I  always 
play  for  the  people  in  the  top  gallery,  so  that  those 
who  can  pay  but  five  groschen  for  their  seats  may  also 


LISZT  AND  THE  BEGGARS.  635 

get  something  for  their  money."  He  was  ever  foremost 
in  alleviating  the  sufferings  of  the  poor,  the  sick,  and 
the  helpless.  He  seems,  indeed,  to  have  been  unable  to 
pass  a  beggar,  and  the  beggars  soon  find  that  out;  they 
will  even  intrude  upon  his  privacy  and  waylay  him  in  his 
garden. 

Once,  when  at  the  height  of  his  popularity  in  Paris, 
a  friend  found  him  holding  a  crossing- sweeper's  broom  at 
the  corner  of  the  street.  "The  fact  is,"  said  LISZT  simply, 
"  I  had  no  small  change  for  the  boy,  so  I  told  him  to  change 
me  five  francs,  and  he  asked  me  to  hold  his  broom  for  him 
till  he  returned."  I  forgot  to  ask  LISZT  whether  the  lad 
ever  came  back. 

I  was  walking  with  him  one  day  in  the  private  gardens  of 
the  Villa  d'Este  at  Tivoli  when  some  little  ruffians,  who  had 
clambered  over  the  wall,  rushed  up  to  him  with  a  few 
trumpery  weeds,  which  they  termed  "bouquets."  The 
bejpevolent  Maestro  took  the  gift  good-humouredly,  and 
fumbling  in  his  pocket,  produced  several  small  coins,  which 
he  gave  to  the  urchins,  turning  to  me  apologetically  : 
"They  expect  it,  you  know.  In  fact,"  he  added,  with  a 
little  shrug,  "  whenever  I  appear  they  do  expect  it."  His 
gifts  were  not  always  small.  He  could  command  large 
sums  of  money  at  a  moment's  notice.  The  proceeds  of 
many  a  splendid  concert  went  to  manufacturing  committees, 
widows,  orphans,  sick  and  blind.  He  founded  pensions 
and  provided  funds  for  poor  musicians;  he  set  up  monu- 


636  LISZT. 

ments  to  great  artists.  A  pecuniary  difficulty  arising  about 
BEETHOVEN'S  statue  at  Bonn,  LISZT  immediately  guaran- 
teed the  whole  sum.  In  the  great  commercial  crisis  of 
1834  at  Lyons  LISZT  gave  concerts  for  the  artisans  out 
of  work ;  and  in  Hungary,  not  long  after,  when  the 
overflow  of  the  Danube  rendered  hundreds  homeless,  LISZT 
was  again  to  the  fore  with  his  brilliant  performances  for 
charity. 

All  through  his  life  he  was  an  ardent  pamphleteer,  and 

he   fought    not    only    for    the    poor,    but    in    the    highest 

interests  of  his  art,  and  above  all  for  the  dignity 

THE  DIGNITY  of  his  own  class.     In  this  he  was  supported  by 

such  musical  royalties  as  MENDELSSOHN,  ROSSINI, 

PAGANINI,  and  LABLACHE.      We  have   heard   how  in  past 

days  the    musicians   were   not  expected  to   mix  with   the 

company,  a  rope  being  laid  down  on  the  carpet,  showing 

the  boundary  line  between  the  sacred  and  profane  in  social 

rank. 

On  one  occasion  LABLACHE,  entering  the  music  saloon 
at  a  certain  great  house,  observed  the  usual  rope  laid  down 
in  front  of  him  when  he  came  on  to  sing  in  a  duet.  He 
quietly  stooped  down  and  tossed  it  aside.  It  was  never 
replaced,  and  the  offensive  practice  dropped  out  of  London 
society  from  that  day. 

LIS/T  refused  to  play  at  the  court  of  QUEEN  ISABELLA  in

Spain  because  the  court  etiquette  forbade  the  introduction 

_3g        of  musicians   to  royalty.      In  his  opinion  even

mined  it  should  be  paid. 

He  met  CZAR  NICHOLAS  I.,  who  had  very  little  notion 
of  the  respect  due  to  anyone  but  himself,  with  an  angry 
look  and  a  defiant  word ;  he  tossed  FREDERICK  WILLIAM 
IV.'s  diamonds  into  the  side  scenes ;  and  broke  a  lance 
with  LOUIS-PHILIPPE,  which  cost  him  a  decoration. 

He  never  forgave  that  thrifty  king  for  abolishing  certain 
musical  pensions  and  otherwise  snubbing  art.  He  refused 
on  every  occasion  to  play  at  the  Tuileries.  One  day 
the  King  and  his  suite  paid  a  t(  private  view  "  visit  to  a 
pianoforte  exhibition  of  ERARD'S.  LISZT  happened  to  be 
in  the  room,  and  was  trying  a  piano  just  as  His  Majesty 
entered.  The  King  advanced  genially  towards  him  and 
began  a  conversation;  but  LISZT  merely  bowed  with  a 
polished  but  icy  reserve. 

"  Do  you  still  remember,"  said  the  King,  "  that  you 
played  at  my  house  when  you  were  but  a  boy  and  I 
DUKE  OF  ORLEANS?  Much  has  changed  since  then." 

"Yes,  Sire/'  replied  LISZT  dryly,  "but  not  for  the 
better/' 

The  King  showed  his  royal  appreciation  of  the  repartee  by 
striking  the  great  musician's  name  off  the  list  of  those  who 
were  about  to  receive  the  cross  of  the  Legion  of  Honour.

SAND'S  early  philosophy,  and  his  witty  saying,  which  reminds

man  marries  or  not,  he  will  sooner  or  later  be  sure  to  repent 
it,"  belongs  to  this  period.  His  relations  with  MME.  SAND 
have  been  much  misrepresented.  He  wa  s  far  more  attracted 
by  her  genius  than  by  her  person,  and  although  for  long 
years  he  entertained  for  her  feelings  of  admiration  and 
esteem,  she  never  exercised  over  hiru  the  despotic  influence 
which  drove  poor  CHOPIN  to  despair.

he  did  his  best  to  prevent  her  from  taking  the  rash  course 
which  separated  her  from  her  family  and  made  her  his 
travelling  companion,  and  that  years  afterwards  her  own

arranged  and  the  whole  facts  of  the  case  were  canvassed 
in  a  conseil  de  famille  at  Paris,  confessed  of  their  own 
accord  that  throughout  LISZT  had  acted  "  like  a  man  of 
honour." 

It  was  during  his  years  of  travel  with  the  COUNTESS 
D'AGOULT  in  Italy  and  Germany  that  LISZT  composed  the 
great  bulk  of  his  celebrated  transcriptions  of  songs  and 
operatic  pieces,  as  well  as  the  renowned  Etudes  d'Execution 
Transcendante. 

LISZT'S   attempt   to   preserve  his  incognito  in  Italy  con- 
spicuously  failed.     He    entered   RICOKJDI'S   music-shop    at 
Milan,    and,   sitting    down    at    a  grand    piano, 

542* 

"LISZT  OR  began  to  improvise.  "  "Tis  LISZT  or  the  devil !  " 
he  heard  RICORDI  whisper  to  a  clerk,  and  in 
another  moment  the  great  Italian  entrepreneur  had  wel- 
comed the  Hungarian  virtuoso  and  placed  his  villa,  his  box 
at  the  opera,  his  carriage  and  horses  at  his  disposal.  Of 
course  RICORDI  very  soon  organised  a  concert,  in  which 
the  Milanese  were  invited  to  judge  the  "pianist  of  the 
future,"  as  he  was  then  styled.  The  Milanese  were  better 
pleased  with  LISZT  than  was  LISZT  with  the  Milanese.  He 
could  not  make  them  take  to  BEETHOVEN.  They  even 
kicked  at  certain  favourite  studies  of  his  own,  but  he  won 
them  by  his  marvellous  improvisations  on  fragments  of  their 
darling  ROSSINI,  and  afterwards  wrote  a  smart  article  in  the 
Paris  Gazette  Musicale,  expressing  his  dissatisfaction  with 


640  LISZT. 

the  frivolity  of  Italian  musical  culture,  quoting  in  scorn  a 
voice  from  the  pit  which  greeted  one  of  his  own  "  Preludes 
Etudes  " — it  was  the  word  "  etude  "  at  which  the  pit  stuck 
— "Vengo  al  teatro  per  divertirmi  e  non  per  studiare,"  a 
sentiment  which  I  think  I  have  heard  repeated  in  more 
northern  latitudes. 

Of  course  LISZT'S  free  criticism  got  back  to  Milan.   Milan 

was  furious.     LISZT  was  at  Venice.     The  papers  denounced 

643.       him.     Everybody   proposed   to   fight  duels   with

TO  MILAN,  piano,  and  they  handed  him  over  to  the  devil. 
LISZT  wrote  pacifying  letters  in  the  Milanese  papers,  but 
the  uproar  only  increased.  What  would  happen  if  he  ever 
dared  to  show  himself  in  Milan  again,  no  one  dared  to 
speculate.  He  was  a  monstrous  ingrate ;  he  had  insulted 
everyone  down  to  the  decorators  and  chorographers  of  La 
Scala,  and  he  must  be  chastised  summarily  for  his  insolent 
presumption. 

When  the  disturbance  was  at  its  height,  LISZT  wrote  to 
the  Milanese  journals  to  say  that  he  declined  a  paper  war ; 
that  he  had  never  intended  to  insult  the  Milanese;  that  he 
would  arrive  shortly  in  Milan  and  hold  himself  in  readiness 
to  receive  all  aggrieved  persons,  and  give  them  every  ex- 
planation and  satisfaction  they  might  require. 

On  a  hot  summer's  day  he  drove  quietly  through  Milan 
in  an  open  carriage,  and,  taking  up  his  abode  at  a  fashionable 


DISILLUSION.  641 

hotel,  awaited  the  arrival  of  the  belligerents.  But  as  not 
one  of  them  turned  up  or  made  the  least  sign,  LISZT  went 
back  to  Venice. 

When,  however,  in  fulfilment  of  a  promise,  he  returned  in 
September,  he  met  with  a  characteristic  snub,  for  his  concert 
was  poorly  attended,  and  then  only  by  the  upper  classes. 
He  had  mortally  wounded  the  people.  He  did  not  consider 
MERCADANTE  and  BELLINI  so  great  as  BEETHOVEN,  and  he 
said  so.  This  was  indeed  a  crime,  and  proved  clearly  that 
he  could  not  play  the  piano  ! 

Towards  the  year  1840  the  relations  between  LISZT  and 

the  COUNTESS  D'AGOULT  had  become  rather  strained.     The 

inevitable  dissolution  which  awaits  such  alliances 

was  evidently  at   hand.     For  a  brief  period  on 

DISILLUSIOK. 

the  shores  of  the  Lake  of  Como  the  cup  of  his 
happiness  had  indeed  seemed  full ;  but  es  war  ein  Traum. 
"  When  the  ideal  form  of  a  woman/'  so  he  wrote  to  a 
friend,  "  floats  before  your  entranced  soul — a  woman  whose 
heaven-born  charms  bear  no  allurements  for  the  senses,  but 
only  wing  the  soul  to  devotion — if  you  see  at  her  side  a 
youth  sincere  and  faithful  in  heart,  weave  these  forms  into  a 
moving  story  of  love,  and  give  it  the  title  On  the  Shores  of 
the  Lake  of  Como." 

He  wrote,  we  may  be  sure,  as  he  then  felt.  He  was 
sometimes  mistaken,  but  he  was  always  perfectly  open, 
upright,  and  sincere.

A  little  daughter  was  born  to  him  at  Bellaggio,  on  the 
shores  of  that  enchanted  lake.  He  called  her  COSIMA  in 
memory  of  Como.  She  became  afterwards  the  wife  of  VON 
BULOW.,  then  the  wife  and  widow  of  RICHARD  WAGNER. 

But  in  1840  the  change  came.     The  Coimtess  and  her 

children  went  off  to  Paris,  and  the  roving  spirit  of  the  great 

545.       musician,  after  being  absorbed  for  some  time  in

Bologna,  and  Rome,  he  went  to  Bonn,  then  to  Vienna,  and 
entered  upon  the  last  great  phase  of  his  career  as  a  virtuoso, 
which  lasted  from  1840  to  between  1850-60. 

In  1842  LISZT  visited  Weimar,  Berlin,  and  then  went  to 
Paris.  He  was  meditating  a  tour  in  Russia.  Pressing 
invitations  reached  him  from  St.  Petersburg  and  Moscow. 
The  most  fabulous  accounts  of  his  virtuosity  had  raised 
expectation  to  its  highest  pitch.  He  was  as  legendary  even 
amongst  the  common  people  as  PAGANINI. 

His  first  concert  at  St.  Petersburg  realised  the  then 
uuheard-of  sum  of  £2,000.  The  roads  were  crowded  to  see 
him  pass,  and  the  corridors  and  approaches  to  the  Grand 
Opera  blocked  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  him. 

The  same  scenes  were  repeated  at  Moscow,  where  he  gave 
six  concerts  without  exhausting  the  popular  excitement. 

On  his  return  to  Weimar  he  accepted  the  post  of  Kapell-

growing  passion  for  orchestral  composition.     But 
the  time  of  rest  had  not  yet  come. 

In  1844  and  1845  he  was  received  in  Spain  and  Portugal 
with  incredible  enthusiasm,  after  which  he  returned  to  Bonn 
to  assist  at  the  inauguration  of  BEETHOVEN'S  statue.  With 
boundless  liberality  he  had  subscribed  more  money  than 
all  the  princes  and  people  of  Germany  put  together  to  make 
the  statue  worthy  of  the  occasion  and  the  occasion  worthy 
of  the  statue.

His  transcendent  virtuosity  was  only  equalled  by  his 
splendid  munificence ;  but  he  found  what  others  have  so  often 
experienced — that  great  personal  gifts  and  prodigious  eclat 
cannot  possibly  escape  the  poison  of  envy  and  detraction. 
He  was  attacked  by  calumny;  his  very  gifts  denied  and 
ridiculed;  his  munificence  ascribed  to  vainglory,  and  his 
charity  to  pride  and  ostentation;  yet  none  will  ever  know 
the  extent  of  his  private  charities,  and  no  one  who  knows 
anything  of  LISZT  can  be  ignorant  of  the  simple,  unaffected

goodness  of  heart  which  prompts  them.  Still  he  was 
wounded  by  ingratitude  and  abuse.  It  seemed  to  check 
and  paralyse  for  the  moment  his  generous  nature.

long  with  LISZT  ;  he  soon  arose  and  shook  himself  like  a 
lion.  His  detractors  slunk  away  into  their  holes,  and  he 
walked  forth  victorious  to  refill  his  empty  purse  and  reap 
new  laurels.  His  career  was  interrupted  by  the  stormy 
events  of  1848.  He  settled  down  for  a  time  at  Weimar, 
and  it  was  then  that  he  began  to  take  that  warm  interest 
in  RICHARD  WAGNER  which  ended  in  the  closest  and  most 
enduring  of  friendships. 

He  laboured  incessantly  to  get  a  hearing  for  the  Lohengrin 

and  Tannhduser.     He  forced  WAGNER'S  compositions  on  the 

band,  on  the  GRAND  DUKE;  he  breasted  public

political  outlaw  and  an  inventor  of  extravagant  compositions

But  years   of  faithful   service,   mainly   the   service   and

immense  prestige  and  authority  of  LISZT,  procured  WAGNER 
a  hearing,  and  paved  the  way  for  his  glorious  triumphs  at 
Bayreuth  in  1876,  1882,  and  1883. 

At  the  age  of  seventy-two   LISZT  retained  the  wit  and 

vivacity   of  forty.     He  passed  from  Weimar  to  Rome,  to 

550.       Pesth,  to  Berlin,  to  Vienna,  but  objected  to  cross

piano,  but  loved  to  be  surrounded  by  young  aspirants  to 
fame.  To  them  he  was  prodigal  of  hints,  and  ever  ready  to 
lavish  all  sorts  of  kindness  upon  people  who  were  sympathique 
to  him. 

At  unexpected  moments,  in  the  presence  of  some  timid 
young  girl  overpowered  with  the  honour  of  an  introduction, 
or  alone  with  a  friend  when  old  days  were  spoken  of, 
would  LISZT  sit  down  for  a  few  minutes  and  recall  a  phrase 
of  CHOPIN  or  a  quaint  passage  from  SCARLATTI,  and  then, 
forgetting  himself,  wander  on  until  a  flash  of  the  old  fire 
came  back  to  his  eyes  as  he  struck  a  few  grand  octaves,  and 
then,  just  as  you  were  lost  in  contemplation  of  that  noble 
head  with  its  grand  profile  and  its  cascade  of  white  hair,  and 
those  hands  that  still  seemed  to  be  the  absolutely  uncon- 
scious and  effortless  ministers  of  his  fitful  and  despotic  will, 
the  master  would  turn  away — break  off,  like  one  suddenly 
blase,  in  the  middle  of  a  bar,  with  "  Come,  let  us  take  a 
little  walk ;  it  will  be  cool  under  the  trees  "  \  and  he  would 


646  LISZT. 

have  been  a  bold  man  who  ventured  in  that  moment   to 
allude  to  the  piano  or  music. 

I  saw  LISZT  but  six  times,  and  then  only  between  the 
years  1876  and  1881.  I  have  heard  him  play  upon  two 
occasions  only,  then  he  played  certain  pieces  of  CHOPIN 
at  my  request  and  a  new  composition  by  himself.  I  have 
heard  MME.  SCHUMANN,  BULOW,  RUBINSTEIN,  MENTER, 
and  ESSIPOFF,  but  I  can  understand  that  saying  of  TAUSIG, 
himself  one  of  the  greatest  masters  of  technique  whom 
Germany  has  ever  produced  :  "  No  mortal  can  measure 
himself  with  LISZT.  He  dwells  alone  upon  a  solitary 
height." 


(A  Leaf  from  my  Diary.) 

As  I  drove  (in  the  autumn  of  1880)  through  the  groves  of 
olives  brightening  with  crude  berries  that  clothe  the  slopes 

of  Tivoli,  and  entered  the  gateway  which  leads 
551. 
r  ENTER  THE  up  to  the  ducal  Villa  d'Este,  it  was  with  some- 

E' thing  of  the  feeling  of  a  pilgrim  who  approaches 
a  shrine.  Two  massive  doors  open  on  to  a  monastic  cloister, 
and  the  entrance  to  the  villa  itself  is  out  of  the  cloisters,  just 
as  the  rooms  are  entered  from  the  cloister  of  Trinity  College, 
Cambridge. 

Here  for  six  years  past  in   the   autumn  LISZT  has  led 
a  retired  life,  varied  by  occasional  excursions  to  "Rome. 


KIND  ENQUIRIES.  647 

I  was  conducted  up  a  staircase  which  opened  oil  to  a  lofty 
terrace,  and  thence  into  a  side  room,  whilst  the  Swiss  valet 
disappeared  to  summon  the  Abbate  LISZT.  In  another 
moment  I  saw  a  side  door  open,  and  the  venerable  figure 
of  LISZT,  already  for  years  engraven  on  my  heart,  advanced 
towards  me. 

It  was  the  same  noble  and  commanding  form  —  with  the 
large  finely-chiselled  features,  the  restless  glittering  eye  still 
full  of  untamed  fire,  the  heavy  white  hair,  thick  mantling 
on  the  brow  and  cropped  square  only  where  it  reached  the 
shoulders,  down  which  I  can  well  imagine  it  might  have 
continued  to  flow  unchecked  like  a  snowy  cataract. 

He  came  forward  with  that  winning  smile  of  bonhomie 
which  at  once  invites  cordiality,  and  drew  me  to  him  with 
both  hands,  conducting  me  at  once  into  a  little  inner 
sitting-room  with  a  window  opening  on  to  the  distant 
Campagna. 

The  room  was  dark,  and  completely  furnished  with  deep 
red  damask  —  cool  and  shadowy  contrast  to  the  burning 

sunshine  of  Italy.      After   alluding  to  our  last

has  worked  so  bravely  for  LISZT'S  music  in  England,  he 
said,  "  Now  tell  me,  how  is  BACIIE  ?  I  have  a  particular, 
quite  particular,  regard  for  BACHE  ;  he  stayed  with  me 
here  some  years  ago,  and  he  has  been  very  steadfast  in

was  overwhelmed  by  these  inquiries  and  the  like.  I  could 
not  give  him  very  good  accounts  of  M.  HUGO,  whose  health 
I  feared  was  declining ;  but  I  said  that  the  last  evening  I 
had  spent  with  him  in  Paris,  he  had  received  up  to  twelve 
at  night,  and  seemed  full  of  life ;  although  his  hours  were, 
as  a  rule,  much  earlier  now.  Of  M.  RENAN  I  could,  of 
course,  speak  much  more  fully,  as  he  had  recently  been 
a  good  deal  with  me  in  England.  "  RENAN  took  me  to 
M.  HUGO'S  when  I  was  in  Paris,  and  we  had  a  delightful 
evening/'  he  remarked.  After  asking  after  a  few  other 
personal  friends,  he  said,  "  I  am  glad  to  see  you  here.  At 
this  time  I  have  a  little  more  leisure.  I  escape  to  this 
retreat  for  rest.  At  Rome  I  am  besieged  (obsede)  by  all 
sorts  of  people,  with  whom  I  do  not  care  to  entertain 
particular  relations — why  should  I  ?  what  have  we  in  com- 
mon?— they  come  out  of  curiosity  to  stare,  that  is  all; 
and  even  here  1  am  worried  with  callers,  who  have  no 
interest  for  me  "  ;  and  indeed  it  was  current  in  Rome  that 
the  Abbate  LISZT  would  receive  no  one  at  Tivoli ;  and 
especially  ladies  were  not  admitted.  I  was,  therefore,  much 
gratified  when  he  said  to  me,  "  You  are  married — why  did 
not  you  bring  your  wife  ?  Come  again  with  her."  And  so 
I  did  ;  and  on  my  next  visit  LISZT  offered  us  each  an  arm. 
He  was  much  taller  than  either  of  us,  and,  looking  down 
with  a  paternal  air,  said,  "  Come,  my  children,  I  will  show 


A   GLORIOUS   VIEW,  649 

you  over  the  garden. ''     But  on  ray  first  visit  to  the  Villa 
d'Este  I  was  alone. 

I   could   not   help   admiring   the  situation  of  the  Villa. 

"  Indeed/'  said  LISZT,  "  this  is  quite  a  princely  residence ; 

it  is  rented  by  the  CARDINAL  HOHENLOHE,  with 

OOo. 

A  GLORIOUS  whom  I  have  had  very  old  and  friendly  relations ; 
he  is  good  enough  to  apportion  it  to  me  in  the 
autumn ;  you  see  his  picture  hangs  there.  The  place  is 
quite  a  ruin.  It  belongs  to  the  DUKE  OP  MODENA,  but  of 
course  they  can't  keep  it  up  now :  the  Cardinal  spent 
£2,000  to  make  it  habitable.  You  shall  see  presently,  the 
terraces  are  rather  rough;  I  don't  often  go  about  the  place, 
but  1  will  come  out  with  you  now,  and  show  you  some 
points  of  view.  I  lunch  about  one  o'clock ;  you  will  stay, 
and  put  up  with  the  hospitalite  de  garqon." 

He  then  led  me  to  the  window.  Down  the  slope  of  a 
precipitous  mountain  stretched  the  Villa  d'Este  gardens; 
tall  cypress-trees  marked  the  lines  of  walk  and  terrace; 
groves  of  olive,  between  which  peeped  glittering  cascades 
and  lower  parterres,  studded  here  and  there  with  a  gleaming 
statue,  and  tall  jets  of  water,  eternally  spouting,  fed  from 
the  Marcian  springs;  the  extremity  of  the  park  seemed  to 
fade  away,  at  an  immense  depth,  into  the  billowy  Cam- 
pagna. 

It  was  like  an  enchanted  scene ;  from  the  contemplation 
of  which  I  was  roused  by  the  Abbate  taking  my  arm,  and, 


650  LISZT. 

passing  through  several  ante-chambers,  we  emerged  on  to 
the  raised  terrace,  which  commanded  one  of  the  most 
striking  views  in  Italy,  or  the  world. 

"  Round  to  the  left/'  said  LISZT,  ' '  lies  Hadrian's  Villa ; 
and  perhaps  your  eyes  are  good  enough  to  see  St.  Peter's 
yonder  in  the  horizon."  The  grey  mist  hung  at  a  distance 
of  eighteen  miles  over  the  straggling  buildings  of  distant 
Rome;  but  they  gleamed  out  here  and  there.  Beyond  these 
wooded  flanks  of  the  mountain ;  beyond  the  ruins  of  villas 
where  MAECENAS  arid  HORACE  and  the  ANTONINES  held  their 
revels ;  beyond  the  rushing  murmur  of  cascades  and  foun- 
tains; never  silent,  yet  ever  making  a  low  and  slumbrous 
melody,  lay  the  Campagna  like  a  vast  lake,  over  which 
the  shadow  of  cloud  and  flicker  of  sunlight  swept  and  faded 
out :  and  again,  beyond  the  Campagna,  loomed  the  Eternal 
City  with  its  mighty  dome. 

We  seemed  lifted  into  the  upper  air,  as  on  the  spacious 
summit  of  a  lofty  precipice ;  the  dry  vine-leaves  hung  about 
the  trellised  parapets,  and  the  Virginian  creeper  was  just 
beginning  to  redden. 

LISZT  was  silent.  As  I  looked  at  the  noble  and  expressive 
features,  never  quite  in  repose,  and  strongly  marked  with 

the   traces    of    those   immense   emotions   which

formances  of  his  earlier  days,  I  could  not  help  saying, 
"  If  you  do  not  find  rest  here,  you  will  rest  nowhere  on 
earth  "  ;  it  was  indeed  a  realm  of  unapproachable  serenity 
and  peace.  Then  we  descended  by  winding  ways,  pausing 
in  the  long  walk,  thickly  shaded  with  olive-trees  and  the 
beloved  ilex,  where  fifty  lions*  heads  spout  fifty  streams 
into  an  ancient  moss-grown  tank. 

"  It  is,"  said  LISZT,  "  a  retreat  for  summer;  you  can  walk 
all  day  about  these  grounds,  and  never  fear  the  sun — all  is 
shade.  But  come  down  lower";  and  so  we  went,  at  times 
turning  round  to  look  down  an  avenue,  or  to  catch,  through 
the  trees,  a  peep  of  the  glowing  horizon  behind. 

Presently  we  came  to  a  central  space,  led  into  by  four 
tall  cypress-groves.  Here,  up  from  a  round  sheet  of  water 
in  front  of  us,  leapt  four  jets  to  an  immense  height ;  and 
here  we  rested,  whilst  the  Abbate  gave  me  some  account  of 
this  Villa  or  Chateau  d'Este,  and  its  former  owners,  which 
differed  not  greatly  from  what  may  be  found  in  most  guide- 
books. 

As  we  re-ascended,  the  bell  of  Sta.  Croce,  in  the  tall 
campanile  over  the  cloisters  which  form  part  of  the  Villa 

d'Este,  rang  out  a  quarter  to  one.     It  was  a  bad 
555. 
A  CHAT     bell,   like    most   Italian   bells,   and   I  naturally 

"  alluded  to  the  superiority  of  Belgium  bells,  above 
all  others.  Rather  to  my  surprise,  LISZT  said,  "Yes,  but 
how  are  they  played  ?  I  remember  being  much  struck  by 


652  LISZT. 

the  Antwerp  carillon."  I  described  to  him  the  mechanism 
of  the  carillon  clavegin  and  tambour,  and  reminded  him 
that  the  Antwerp  carillon  was  much  out  of  tune,  Bruges 
being  superior,  as  well  as  of  heavier  calibre,  and  Mechlin 
bearing  off  the  palm  for  general  excellence.  We  stopped 
short  on  one  of  the  terraces,  and  he  seemed  much  in- 
terested with  a  description  I  gave  him  of  a  performance 
by  the  great  carilloneur  M.  DENYN  at  Mechlin,  and  which 
reminded  me  of  RUBINSTEIN  at  his  best.  He  expressed 
surprise  when  I  alluded  to  VAN  DEN  GHEYN'S  compositions 
for  bells,  laid  out  like  regular  fugues  and  organ  voluntaries, 
and  equal  in  their  way  to  BACH  or  HANDEL,  who  were 
contemporaries  of  the  great  Belgian  organist  and  caril- 
loneur. "  But,"  he  said,  "  the  Dutch  have  also  good  bells. 
I  was  once  staying  with  the  King  in  Holland,  arid  I  believe 
it  was  at  Utrecht  that  I  heard  some  bell-music  which  was 
quite  wonderful."  I  have  listened  myself  to  that  Utrecht 
carillon,  which  is  certainly  superior,  and  is  usually  well- 
handled. 

We  had   again   reached   the   upper    terrace,    where   the 
Abbate's  midday  repast  was  being  laid  out  by  his  valet.     It 

was  a  charming  situation  for  lunch,  commanding 
556. 
LIBZT  PLATS  that  wide  and  magnificent   prospect  to  which  I 

ME'  have  alluded;  but  autumn  was  far  advanced, 
there  was  a  fresh  breeze,  and  the  table  was  ordered  indoors. 
Meanwhile,  LISZT  laying  his  hand  upon  my  arm,  we  passed 


LISZT  PLAYS  TO  ME.  653 

through  the  library,  opening  into  his  bed-room,  and  thence 
to  a  little  sitting-room  (the  same  which  commanded  that 
view  of  the  Campagna).  Here  stood  his  grand  Erard 
piano.  "  As  we  were  talking  of  bells/'  he  said,  "  I 
should  like  to  show  you  an  '  Angelus '  which  I  have  just 
written-";  and,  opening  the  piano,  he  sat  down.  This 
was  the  moment  which  I  had  so  often  and  so  vainly 
longed  for. 

When  I  left  England,  it  seemed  to  me  as  impossible  that 
I  should  ever  hear  LISZT  play,  as  that  I  should  ever  see 
MENDELSSOHN,  who  has  been  in  his  grave  for  thirty-three 
years.  How  few  of  the  present  generation  have  had  this 
privilege  !  At  Bayreuth,  I  had  hoped,  but  no  opportunity 
offered  itself,  and  it  is  well  known  that  LISZT  can  hardly 
ever  be  prevailed  upon  to  open  the  piano  in  the  presence 
of  strangers.  A  favourite  pupil,  POLIG,  who  was  then  with 
him  at  the  Villa  d'Este,  told  me  he  rarely  touched  the  piano, 
and  that  he  himself  had  seldom  heard  him — "  but,"  he  added 
with  enthusiasm,  "  when  the  master  touches  the  keys,  it  is 
always  with  the  same  incomparable  effect,  unlike  anvone  else, 
always  perfect." 

"  You  know,"  said  LISZT,  turning  to  me,  "  they  ring  the 
(  Angelus '  in  Italy  carelessly ;  the  bells  swing  irregularly, 
and  leave  off,  and  the  cadences  are  often  broken  up  thus  "  : 
and  he  began  a  little  swaying  passage  in  the  treble — like 
bells  tossing  high  up  in  the  evening  air :  it  ceased,  but  so 
softly  that  the  half-bar  of  silence  made  itself  felt,  and  the 


654  LISZT. 

listening  ear  still  carried  the  broken  rhythm  through 
the  pause.  The  Abbate  himself  seemed  to  fall  into  a  dream  ; 
his  fingers  fell  again  lightly  on  the  keys,  and  the  bells  went 
on,  leaving  off  in  the  middle  of  a  phrase.  Then  rose  from 
the  bass  the  song  of  the  Angelas,  or  rather,  it  seemed  like 
the  vague  emotion  of  one  who,  as  he  passes,  hears  in  the 
ruins  of  some  wayside  cloister  the  ghosts  of  old  monks 
humming  their  drowsy  melodies,  as  the  sun  goes  down 
rapidly,  and  the  purple  shadows  of  Italy  steal  over  the  land, 
out  of  the  orange  west ! 

We  sat  motionless — the  disciple  on  one  side,  I  on  the 
other.  LISZT  was  almost  as  motionless  :  his  fingers  seemed 
quite  independent,  chance  ministers  of  his  soul.  The  dream 
was  broken  by  a  pause ;  then  came  back  the  little  swaying 
passage  of  bells,  tossing  high  up  in  the  evening  air,  the 
half-bar  of  silence,  the  broken  rhythm — and  the  Angelus 
was  rung. 

Luncheon  being  announced,  we  rose,  and  LISZT,  turning 

to   his   young  friend   POLIG,  who   occupied   an   apartment 

at  Este,  and  enjoys  the  great  master's  help  in 

K  XT

ZL  REVEREXDO.  .     . 

"and  join  us   m  about   an  hour — nay,   sooner 
if  you  will/' 

So  we  sat  down  in  the  cozily-furnished  little  sitting-room 
— dark,  like  all  the  Abbate's  suite  of  apartments,  and 
evidently  intended  to  shut  out  the  sun. 


ANECDOTES.  655 

I  was  still  heated  with  our  clambering  walk,  and  LISZT 
insisted  on  my  keeping  on  my  great-coat,  and  provided  me 
in  addition  with  a  priest's  silken  skull-cap,  playfully  re- 
marking, "As  you  call  me  'Abbate/  I  shall  address  you 
as  <  11  lleverendo/  and  whenever  you  come  here,  you  will 
find  this  priest's  cap  ready  for  you." 

The  "  hospitalite  de  garcon  "  proved  anything  but  ascetic. 
A  vegetable  soup,  maccaroni  with  tomato  sauce,  a  faultless 
beefsteak  or  "  bistecco"  dressed  with  fried  mushrooms, 
cooked  dry  ;  a  peculiar  salad,  composed  of  a  variety  of  herbs 
in  addition  to  leeks,  onions,  lettuce,  and  fruit,  the  like  of 
which  I  can  never  hope  to  taste  until  I  lunch  again  with 
the  Abbate  at  the  Villa  d'Este. 

"VVe  were  alone.     I  need  not  say  that,  in  such  company, 
the  wines  seemed  to  me  to  possess  an  ideal  fragrance  and 
a  Sicilian  flavour  wholly  unlike  and  incompara- 
bly   superior  to   the   heavy  vintages   of   Spain. 

ANECDOTES. 

There  were  some  questions  about  MENDELSSOHN 
and  CHOPIN  that  I  had  always  wished  to  ask ;  but  at  first 
the  conversation  was  much  more  general.  We  spoke  of 
the  curious  recent  fancy  of  the  Italians  for  WAGNER'S 
music ;  the  way  his  operas  had  been  produced  at  Bologna, 
and  just  then  Rienzi  at  Rome.  "  Yes,"  he  said;  "the 
Italians  are  beginning  to  understand  more  kinds  of  melody 
than  onej  they  perceive  at  last  that  WAGNER'S  melody 
pervades  each  part  of  his  score — it  is  "  la  melodie  aplusieurs 


656  LISZT. 

etages"  This  notion  of  "  a  melody  in  flats,"  or  "  of 
several  stories/'  struck  me  as  most  apt,  as  well  as  humorous. 
Speaking  of  WAGNER,  I  related  to  him  an  unhappy  occa- 
sion on  which  I  had  been  requested  by  LORD  H to 

try  and  prevail  on  WAGNER,  when  in  England,  to  accom- 
pany me  to  his  house  one  night,  where  we  were  to  meet 
a  royal  princess  most  anxious  to  see  WAGNER.  I  reluc- 
tantly undertook  the  mission,  but  failed  to  induce  the 
great  Maestro  to  go  with  me,  and  so  was  placed  in  the 
unpleasant  position  of  having  to  apologize  on  my  arrival  for 
his  absence.  "  Ah  ! "  said  LISZT,  laughing,  e<  a  similar  thing 
occurred  to  me  lately :  some  royalties  at  Sienna  asked  me 
to  get  WAGNER  to  meet  them  ;  but  I  knew  WAGNER  better, 
and  at  once  declined  to  charge  myself  with  that  commission. 

Your  mention  of  LORD  H reminds  me  that  I  knew  him 

years  ago ;  indeed,  in  my  young  days,  I  was  on  one  occasion 
at  his  house,  and,  curiously  enough,  a  regrettable  event 
occurred  to  me  also.  Some  ladies  present  importuned  me 
to  play.  I  was  not  unwilling,  but  I  did  not  quite  care  for 
the  manner  in  which  I  was  pressed,  and  I  declined ;  indeed, 
I  believe  I  left  the  house  rather  abruptly.  Well,  it  was  a 
time  when  I  was  playing  a  good  deal  in  the  various  capitals 
of  Europe,  and  much  more  fuss  was  being  made  with  me 
than  was  perhaps  necessary  ;  and  then,  you  know,  I  was 
much  younger,  and  I  dare  say  acted  hastily ;  but  I  have 
always  regretted  it." 

He  spoke  very  little  of  his  extraordinary  successes  when 


LISZT  ON  SOME  GREAT  MUSICIANS.         657 

at  his  zenith,  which  can  only  be  compared  to  the  sensation 
produced  by  PAGANINI.  But  he  spoke,  as  I  have  elsewhere 
stated,  with  pride  of  having  received  the  kiss  of  BEETHOVEN. 
"  Ay,"  he  said,  "  when  I  was  a  very  young  man,  and  in 
public  too,  it  was  difficult  to  get  the  great  man  to  go 
and  hear  rising  talent;  but  my  father  got  SCHINDLER  to 
induce  BEETHOVEN  to  come  and  hear  me — and  he  embraced 
me  before  the  whole  company ."  A  similar  event  occurred 
to  JOACHIM,  who,  when  a  boy,  received  the  public  embrace 
of  MENDELSSOHN  after  playing  a  fugue  of  BACH'S. 

LISZT  spoke  in  the  highest  terms  of  HERR  RICHTER,  at 

the  same  time  regretting  that  the  Wagner  Festivals  at  the 

559        Albert  Hall  had  not  been  financially  more  suc- 

LISZT  ON    cessful.     Having  been  accused,  in  America  and 

RICHTER, 

MEYERBEER,  elsewhere,  of  misrepresenting  the  relations  be- 
AND  MEN-  tween  WAGNER  and  MEYERBEER,  and  knowing 
that  WAGNER  would  never  mention  M-EYJJR- 
BEER'S  name,  nor  allow  anyone  to  speak  of  him  in  his 
presence,  I  asked  LISZT  whether  it  was  true  that  MEYERBEER 
had  introduced  WAGNER  to  M.  JOLY  in  Paris,  with  a  view 
to  bringing  out  his  Flying  Dutchman,  knowing  all  the  time 
that  M.  JOLY  was  on  the  point  of  bankruptcy.  "  Well,0 
said  LISZT,  "  that  is  probably  true.  No  one  is  exactly  to 
blame,  if  a  youcg  unknown  man  fails  to  arrive  at  once  at 
the  Grand  Opera  de  Paris ;  getting  up  a  work  there  is  a 
question  of  many  months  and  thousands  of  pounds.  WAG-

NERJS  libretto  was  bought  for  a  small  sum,  his  music  dis- 
carded, and  he  was  practically  turned  adrift.  Afterwards, 
he  was  notoriously  forced  to  live  by  arranging  Italian  opera 
tunes  for  the  piano  and  cornet -a-pist on.  It  is  possible  that 
MEYERBEER  may  have  been  of  some  small  use  to  WAGNER 
at  first,  but  WAGNER  will  not  hear  of  him.  MENDELSSOHN 
had  the  same  antipathy/'  Now  I  saw  another  opportunity  : 
"  I  have  often  wondered,  in  reading  MENDELSSOHN'S  letters/' 
I  said,  "  why  his  allusions  to  you  are  so  brief  and  so  few ; 
here  and  there,  we  read  that  you  were  of  the  company,  that 
the  evening  was  delightful,  and  that  you  or  CHOPIN  played; 
and  MENDELSSOHN  seems  to  have  little  more  to  say,  though 
in  his  allusions  to  many  of  his  great  contemporaries  he  is 
often  explicit  and  detailed  enough." 

"  Ah  !  well,"  said  LISZT,  "  MENDELSSOHN'S  letters  have 
been,  to  some  extent,  what  is  called  arranged  and  selected 
for  publication.  There  is  a  good  deal  which  it  was  not 
advisable  to  print,  or  that  couldn't  be  printed;  and  then 
there  was  something  between  me  and  MENDELSSOHN  :  I 
am  sure  I  don't  quite  know  what ;  but  at  one  time,  a 
certain  coolness  sprang  up  between  us;  it  was,  however, 
much  more  between  our  followers  than  between  us.  MEN- 
DELSSOHN did  not  get  on  with  the  French :  at  Paris,  for 
instance,  and  with  reason  there ;  then,  at  Berlin  and 
Leipsic  too  he  had  his  difficulties  with  the  musical  autho- 
rities, some  of  whom  were  certainly  my  friends.  Tlic 
first  time  I  saw  MENDELSSOHN  was  at  Berlin;  I  called  in 


LISZT  ON  SOME  GREAT  MUSICIANS.         659 

the  morning,  about  twelve  o' clock ;  be  was  charming,  full 
of  life  and  vigour,  and  received  me  joyously.  MADAME 
MENDELSSOHN  pressed  me  to  stay  to  lunch,  and,  meaning 
to  go,  I  still  stayed  on  talking  and  playing,  till  suddenly  it 
•was  six  o'clock,  and  then  he  said,  '  Now  you  must  stay  and 
dine.'  So  I  stayed,  and  left  about  nine  o'clock,  after  a 
delightful  day;  then  the  next  time  we  met  we  had  some 
words  about  MEYERBEER,  whom  MENDELSSOHN  could  not 
endure,  and  I  spoke  rather  hotly.  I  dare  say  I  was  in  the 
•wrong,  but  somehow,  from  that  time,  we  ceased  to  be  quite 
so  cordial,  and  we  did  not  meet  very  often ;  but  there  was 
no  rupture  or  quarrel  between  us,  none  ever ;  our  partisans 
quarrelled ;  but  between  us  personally  there  was  never  any 
real  animosity.  And  then  quite  late  in  his  career,  a  year 
before  he  died,  MENDELSSOHN  did  a  very  graceful  little 
thing.  He  brought  me  a  MS.  of  BEETHOVEN,  a  chorus 
copied  in  BEETHOVEN'S  hand  out  of  MOZART'S  Don  Juan;  he 
knew  it  was  the  kind  of  thing  I  should  value  very  highly, 
and  he  bade  me  keep  it  for  his  sake.  Well,  I  was  travelling 
a  good  deal — I  gave  it  with  other  things  into  my  mother's 
keeping,  and  I  suppose  it  was  shown  about,  and  someone 
stole  it ;  at  any  rate,  it  disappeared ;  but  I  always  like  to 
remember  it,  because  it  proved  that,  notwithstanding  the 
serious  differences  which  had  arisen  between  our  schools 
and  methods  before  his  death,  personally  he  felt  kindly 
towards  me  down  to  the  last." 

The  conversation  turning  on  HEINE — "  Of  course  I  knew

HEINE.  He  was  one  of  those  original  eccentrics  whom  it  is 
difficult  to  class  :  his  reputation  was  a  celebrite  d'auberge. 
Yes,  he  alluded  to  me  in  some  of  his  prose  works  not  un- 
kindly. I  had  the  misfortune  (maladresse)  to  set  one  of  his 
songs  to  music." 

"  How  few  good  poems  there  are  suitable  for  music  !  " 
"  Yes,  and  how  little  good  music  !  " 

Of  PAGANINI  he  said,  "  No  one  who  has  not  heard  him 

can   form  the  least  idea  of  his  playing.     The  fourth  string 

performances,  the  tunes  in  harmonics,   and  the 


arpeggios  used  as   he  used  them,  were  then  all 
BOTTESIKI,  new  to  the  public  and  the  players  too  ;  they  sat 
staring   at   him   open-mouthed.      Everyone   can 
play  his  music  now,   but  the  same  impression   can   never 
again  be  made/' 

Of  BOTTESINI,  the  double-bass  soloist,  he  said,  "  He  is 
the  only  great  player  of  my  time  whom  I  have  never 
heard.  He  never  seemed  to  be  in.  my  direction,  and  was 
always  moving  about,  but.  is  settled  now." 

LISZT  was  very  humorous  upon  vamped-up  reputations, 
aal  the  airs  and  graces  which  musicians  give  themselves. 

ft  After  a  bit,  in  England  at  least,  you  must  be  '  dignified  ' 
—  that  is  a  good  word  ;  the  English  like  a  '  dignified  pro- 
fessor !'"  and  he  drew  himself  up  like  a  very  Pecksniff, 
put  on  a  look  of  solemn  and  dictatorial  gravity,  lifting

intruders. 

Speaking  of  BULOW  and  of  RUBINSTEIN,  lie  said,  "They 
are  two  men  who  stand  quite  apart  from  all  the  rest  ;  still,

mensely    risen   within   the    last    twenty    years.

about  some  professional  reputations  ;  and  pre- 
tending to  hold  very  carefully  a  watering-pot,  he  added, 
"  Some  reputations  take  a  good  deal  of  judicious  watering. 
I  could  mention  some  who  had  the  good  fortune  to  marry 
people  who  watered  them  beautifully  in  the  newspapers. 
It  makes  some  difference,  you  know.  I  don't  say  that  you 
can  create  a  reputation  without  talent  ;  but  the  '  humbug  ' 
is  too  often  at  top,  and  the  '  talent  *  at  the  bottom  ;  and 
in  England  you  are  miserably  taken  in  by  foreigners.  It 
is  your  own  fault  ;  but  the  way  mediocre  foreign  talent  has 
been  over  and  over  again  pushed  in  England  —  especially 
bad  singers  —  is  simply  scandalous/' 

How  interesting  it  would  be  to  read  the    memoirs    and 

criticisms  of  LISZT  upon  music  and  musicians  for  the  last 

5G2.        fifty  years  !     No  one    living,  perhaps,  with    the

"  I  have  often  wished/'  I  said,  "  that  you  had  written 
more  of  your  recollections  of  those  great  musicians,  artists, 
and  poets  with  whom  you  have  been  connected."  I  alluded 
to  his  charming  Life  of  Chopin. 

"Ah!  "he  said  abruptly,  "CHOPIN  had  no  life,  properly 
speaking;  his  was  an  exclusive,  self-centred  personality. 
He  lived  inwardly — he  was  silent  and  reserved,  never  said 
much,  and  people  were  often  deceived  about  him,  and  he 
never  undeceived  them.  People  talk  of  the  style  of  CHOPIN, 
the  touch  of  CHOPIN,  and  of  playing  like  CHOPIN.  When 
he  played  himself,  he  played  admirably  well,  and  especially 
his  own  compositions;  but  he  was  supposed  to  have  formed  a 
school  of  Chopinites,  who  had  the  Tradition — and  you  heard 
that  Mr.  This,  an3  Madame  That — they  alone  could  play 
like  CHOPIN— he  had  formed  them — people  danced  round 
them,  and  they  affected  to  have  the  true  Chopin  secret. 
Yes,"  he  said,  "  it  was  absurd  enough ;  and  CHOPIN  looked 
on,  and  said  nothing;  he  was  very  diplomatic — he  never 
troubled  himself  to  stop  this  cant,  and  to  this  day  there 
may  be  those  who  play  'like  CHOPIN  ' — who  have  received

CHOPIN!'"  The  last  words  were  pronounced  in  a  solemn 
tone,  and  with  a  look  of  mock  gravity  indescribably  humo- 
rous. As  he  rose  from  table,  LISZT  said,  "  You  spoke  of  my 
sketch  of  CHOPIN — I  have  just  brought  out  a  new  edition  of 
it  at  Leipsic."  We  went  into  the  library,  and  he  gave  me

a  handsome  quarto  volume  of  312  pages,  printed  in  French 
on  fine  paper.  "Take  it,"  he  said;  "you  will  find  some 
forty  pages  more  than  in  the  edition  you  have  read."  I 
opened  the  volume,  and  on  the  frontispiece  found  that  LISZT 
had  written  aslant — 


I  had  conceived,  ever  since  I  had  studied  the  life  and 

563.       works  of  CHOPIN,  the  greatest  desire  to  hear  him 

LISZT  PLAYS  played  by  LISZT  :  indeed,  the  numbers  of  those

10  ME-     still  living  who  have  had  this  privilege  must  be 
very  limited.    I  ventured  to  say,  "  CHOPIN  always  maintained 


CG4  LISZT. 

that  you  were  the  most  perfect  exponent  of  his  works.  I 
cannot  say  how  grateful  I  should  be  to  hear,  were  it  only 
a  fugitive  passage  of  CHOPIN'S,  touched  by  your  hand." 

"  With  all  the  pleasure  in  the  world/'  replied  the  immor- 
tal pianist ;  and  again  I  sat  down  by  the  grand  piano,  and 
humming  to  him  a  phrase  of  op.  37,  I  begged  that  it  might 
be  that. 

"  I  will  play  that,  and  another  after  it."  (The  second 
was  op.  48.) 

It  is  useless  for  me  to  attempt  a  description  of  a  perform- 
ance every  phrase  of  which  will  be  implanted  in  my  memory, 
and  on  my  heart,  as  long  as  I  live. 

Again,  in  that  room,  with  its  long  bright  window  opening 
out  into  the  summer-land,  we  sat  in  deep  shadow — in  perfect 
seclusion ;  not  a  sound  but  the  magic  notes  falling  at  first 
like  a  soft  shower  of  pearls  or  liquid  drops  from  a  fountain 
— blown  spray  falling  hither  and  thither,  and  changing  into 
rainbow  tints  in  its  passage,  as  the  harmonic  progression 
kept  changing  and  tossing  the  fugitive  fragments  of  melody 
with  which  that  exquisite  nocturne  opens,  until  it  settles  into 
the  calm,  happy  dream,  which  seems  to  rock  the  listener 
to  sleep  with  the  deep  and  perfect  benison  of  ineffable  rest; 
then  out  of  the  dream,  through  a  few  bars,  like  the  uneasy 
consciousness  of  a  slowly  awakening  sleeper,  and  again  the 
interlude,  the  blown  rain  of  double  pearls — until  once  more 
the  heavenly  dream  is  resumed.  I  drew  my  chair  gently 
nearer,  I  almost  held  my  breath,  not  to  miss  a  note.  There 


LISZT  PLAYS  CHOPIN  TO  ME.  G65 

was  a  strange  concentrated  anticipation  about  LISZT'S  playing 
unlike  anything  I  had  ever  heard — not  for  a  moment  could 
the  ear  cease  listening;  each  note  seemed  prophetic  of  the 
next,  each  yielded  in  importance  to  the  next :  one  felt  that 
in  the  soul  of  the  player  the  whole  nocturne  existed  from 
the  beginning — as  one  and  indivisible,  like  a  poem  in  the 
heart  of  a  poet.  The  playing  of  the  bars  had  to  be  gone 
through  seriatim ;  but  there  were  glimpses  of  a  higher  state 
of  intuition,  in  which  one  could  read  thoughts  without 
words,  and  possess  the  soul  of  music,  without  the  interven- 
tion of  bars  and  keys  and  strings ;  all  the  mere  elements 
seemed  to  fade,  nothing  but  perception  remained.  Sense  of 
time  vanished ;  all  was  as  it  were  realised  in  a  moment, 
that  moment  the  Present — the  eternal  Present — no  Past, 
no  Future.  Yet  I  could  not  help  noticing  each  incident : 
the  perfect,  effortless  independence  of  the  fingers,  mere 
obedient  ministers  of  the  master's  thought;  the  complete 
trance  of  the  player — living  in  the  ideal  world,  and  reducing 
the  world  of  matter  about  him  to  the  flimsiest  of  unreal 
shadows ;  and  I  had  time  to  notice  the  unconscious  habits  of 
the  master,  which  have  already  passed  into  historic  manner- 
isms in  his  disciples,  like  CARDINAL  NEWMAN'S  stooping 
gait,  GARIBALDI'S  half  closing  of  the  eyes,  or  VICTOR 
EMMANUEL'S  toss  of  the  head.  So  I  noticed  the  first 
finger  and  thumb  drawn  together  to  emphasize  a  note,  or 
the  fingers  doubled  up,  then  lifted  in  a  peculiar  manner, 
with  a  gentle  sweep  in  the  middle  of  a  phrase — things  in 


666  LISZT. 

which  those  are  determined  to  be  like  the  master  who  can 
be  like  him  in  nothing  else  ;  also  the  peculiar  repercussion 
resonance,  since  reduced  to  something  like  a  science  by 
RUBINSTEIN,  and  the  caressing  touch,  which  seemed  to  draw 
the  soul  of  the  piano  out  of  it  almost  before  the  finger 
reached  the  key-board.  When  LISZT  passed  silently  to 
op.  48,  he  arrived  at  some  stiff  bravura  passages,  which 
called  forth  his  old  vigour.  Yet  here  all  was  perfect ;  not 
a  note  slurred  over  or  missed;  the  old  thunder  woke  beneath 
his  outstretched  hands ;  the  spirits  of  the  vasty  deep  were  as 
obedient  as  ever  to  their  master's  call.  With  the  last  chord 
he  rose  abruptly;  abruptly  we  came  out  of  the  dim, 
enchanted  land  of  dreams ;  the  common  light  of  day  was 
once  more  around  me.  "Now,  you  must  be  off!"  he 
exclaimed;  indeed,  I  had  barely  time  to  catch  my  tram  for 
Rome ;  "  but,"  he  added,  "  I  have  something  I  wish  you  to 
take  to  BACHE  and  DANNREUTHER  " ;  and  he  took  out  three 
bronze  medals,  giving  me  the  third  to  keep ;  the  design  was 
by  a  Roman  artist  of  great  merit.  On  one  side  was  LISZT'S 
own  profile,  on  the  other  a  star-crowned  Fame  holding  a 
palm-branch. 

Before  I  left,  I  asked  LISZT  if  I  might  give  some  account 

in  print   of  the  delightful  day  I   had   spent   in 

"i  AM  TOO  his  company,  so   that   the  hearts   of  his   many 

friends    and    admirers    in    England    might    be 

gladdened  by  some  account  of  him. 


ALL  SOULS  DAT.  667 

"Whatever  you  will/'  he  good-naturedly  replied;  "  write 
what  you  like,  and  let  me  see  it  when  it  appears." 

LISZT  changes  his  residence  three  times  every  year  :  from 
Rome  to  Weimar,  from  Weimar  to  Pesth,  and  at  Pesth  he 
is  usually  occupied  in  bringing  out  or  conducting  some  of 
his  works.  But  he  is  determined  to  cross  the  water  no 
more.  He  hates  the  sea ;  indeed,  I  am  told  that  he  objects 
even  to  going  over  the  suspension-bridge  at  Florence.  I 
ventured  to  say  to  him,  "In  England  we  have  heard  of 
LISZT,  but  already  he  is  a  kind  of  mythus.  '  His  legend/ 
as  M.  RENAN  would  say,  '  has  begun  to  form.'  People  are 
beginning  to  ask,  '  Was  there  indeed  ever  such  a  person  ?  ' 
Come  over  and  prove  to  us  that  he  still  exists."  But  he 
only  shook  his  head.  "  I  am  too  old ;  I  cannot  come  to 
England." 

LISZT  was  at  Rome  again  in  1881.  He  happened  to  be 
driving  in  an  open  carriage  just  in  front  of  mine,  when  all 

Rome   went   on   a   pilgrimage    to    St.    Lorenzo 
5C5. 
ALL  SOULS  Cemetery  on  All  Souls  day.     We  saluted  as  we 

passed.  I  thought  him  looking  more  worn  than 
in  the  previous  year,  but  the  old  radiant  smile  and  frank 
courtesy  were  the  same ;  the  fact  is,  he  had  fallen  on  a 
staircase  at  Weimar  in  summer,  and  was  obliged  to  be  very 
careful.  He  is  not  going  to  the  Villa  D'Este  this  year  at 
Tivoli.  It  is  too  cold,  although  the  CARDINAL  HOHEX- 
LOHE  promised  to  warm  it  well  with  stoves.  Last  year 


(JGS  LISZT. 

about  tliis  time,  when  I  was  there  with  him,  on  a  second 
visit  with  my  wife,  the  hot  November  sun  beat  so  fiercely 
down  on  our  luncheon-table,  spread  on  a  broad  balcony 
overlooking  the  whole  Campagna,  that  we  had  to  move  into 
the  shade,  and  the  Swiss  valet  walked  round  and  round, 
taking  innumerable  flies  out  of  our  wine.  But  the  morning 
and  evening  were  colder  there  than  they  are  at  Rome,  and 
November  is  usually  cold  enough  in  Rome. 

"  I  am  going,"  said  GREENOUGH  the  sculptor,  to  me,  '  to 
look  in  on  the  Abbate  LISZT  to-night,  at  the  Hotel  Alberti." 

"  I  will  be  of  the  party/'  I  said. 
56G.  J> 

LISZT  AT  We  were  ushered  into  a  little  room  at  about 
nine  o'clock.  The  Abbate  was  seated  at  a  game 
of  cards  with  his  grand-daughter  the  BARONNE  DE  BULOW 
and  an  Italian  gentleman.  He  received  us  with  his  old 
delightful  grace  and  bonhomie.  I  insisted  upon  his  finishing 
his  game  of  cards. 

"  Where  are  you  staying,  and  how  long  have  you  been 
here  ?  " 

"  Why,  I  left  my  card  and  address  some  days  ago." 

"  Ah,  leave  me  another,  and  write  the  address  again." 

"  I  will  leave  you  six,  and  call  every  day,  just  to  ask 
after  you/'  said  I,  laughing. 

"  Then  I  will  give  you  six  invitations." 

"  But,"  I  said,  "you  never  asked  ine  to  your  birthday 
festival/' 


LISZT  ON  RUBINSTEIN,   MENTER,    WIRTZ.    G69 

"  You  are  of  those  who  are  always  asked." 

"  If  I  had  been  at  Rome,  I  should  certainly  have  slipped 
in." 

"I  shall  receive  again;  you  shall  yet  come,"  said  LISZT; 
and  then  he  sat  down  to  finish  his  game  as  we  others  talked 
to  each  other,  the  Abbate  turning  round  to  drop  a  word 
here  and  there,  just  enough  to  show  that  he  was  not  indiffe- 
rent to  our  presence.  They  told  me  he  had  to  be  kept  very 
quiet,  chiefly  because  he  insisted  upon  getting  through  so 
much  work,  and  I  felt  that  callers  should  be  discreet  and 
not  stay  too  long. 

Presently  the  game  was  over,  and  LISZT,  pushing  aside 

the  cards,  turned  to  us,  and  I  had  a  few  words  with  him. 

The  grand  piano  was  open  behind  him,  but  we 

LISZT  ON    were  not  to  hear  it.     I  told  him  of  the  piano- 

RUBINSTEI.V,  .       ,  T  -.  ,  TT  •  1 

MKNTER,  recital  mania  in  London  last  season :  He  said 
of  RUBINSTEIN,  "He  is  the  King  of  all  pianists 
now  before  the  public,  he  must  carry  all  before  him  " ;  and 
of  SOPHIE  MENTER,  whom  he  had  specially  charged  me  to 
hear,  "No  woman  can  touch  her — in  every  style  she  is 
superb."  He  said  he  was  at  work  upon  orchestral  com- 
position, which,  he  intimated,  the  public  did  not  always  care 
about ;  and  I  spoke  of  our  painter  WATTS,  who  now  delights 
to  paint  for  himself,  and  often  declares  that  his  favourite 
conceptions  are  those  least  understood  by  the  public. 
Ah ! "  said  LISZT  ;  "  but  here  is  an  artist,"  turning  to  a 


670  LISZT. 

stranger  present,  tl  who  paints  for  the  public  and  is  appre- 
ciated " ;  it  was  his  graceful  way  of  turning  the  talk  off 
himself;  and  then  he  went  on  to  speak  of  that  eccentric 
Belgian  artist,  WIRTZ,  whom  he  had  known.  The  WIRTZ 
gallery  at  Brussels  is  veiy  famous  now,  though  LISZT  seemed 
to  fancy  WIRTZ  was  still  little  known.  "  His  creations,0 
he  said,  "were  strange  and  fantastic,  he  was  voted  mad, 
and  the  critics  abused  and  laughed  at  him.  I  remember 
he  had  a  great  studio,  and  at  one  end  a  kind  of  pulpit ; 
he  used  to  get  up  in  it  and  preach  against  the  critics  and 
society,  and  declaim  about  all  sorts  of  things."  LISZT  told 
a  good  anecdote  about  him.  "  He  used  to  send  these  odd 
pictures  to  the  Salon  year  after  year,  which  were  always 
returned;  the  judges  would  have  nothing  to  say  to  him. 
Well,  he  happened  to  become  possessed  of  a  veritable 
RUBENS,  and  the  malicious  idea  occurred  to  him  to  put 
his  own  name  to  it,  and  send  it  up  to  the  Salon.  The 
judges,  taking  it  for  more  WIRTZ  rubbish,  sent  it  back. 
Poor  WIRTZ,  you  can  imagine  that  he  went  up  into  his 
pulpit  next  time  with  a  good  text !  " 

I  said  to  him  later,  "So  you  will  not  come  to  Eng- 
land?" 

"  I  have  travelled  so  much  ;  I  have  gone  about  the  world 
till  I  am  tired.  I  change  residences,  as  it  is,  three  times  a 
year  :  Pesth,  Weimar,  Rome;  and  if  I  went  about  more,  I 
could  not  get  through  the  work  which  I  have  set  myself  to 
do.  The  first  time  I  was  in  England,  I  was  taken  there  by 


LISZT  AND   THE  AMERICAN  LADY.          671 

COUNT  ESTERHAZY  ;  you  know,  he  was  a  great  friend  of 
GEORGE  IV.  That  was  in  1824." 

"You  were  at  Antwerp  last  year;  we  all  thought  yon 
might  have  come  across." 

"  I  was  present,"  he  replied ;  "  I  shall  never  go  aci  oss 
again." 

An   American   lady   here   said   to   LISZT  the  other  day, 

without   much   discretion   or   tact,   "Ah,    Abbate,    if   you 

_C8        would   only  come  to  America,  you  could  make 

LISZT  AND   a  large  fortune  !  "  forgetting  that  LISZT  had  made 

AMERICAN  and  spent  immense  fortunes,  and  had  left  quite 
as  much  as  he  wanted. 

"  Madame,"  replied  the  great  virtuoso,  with  that  exquisite 
touch  of  courteous  but  satirical  humour  of  which  he  is 
a  master,  "  if  you  stood  in  need  of  that  large  fortune,  believe 
me  I  would  go." 

We  spoke  of  WAGNER,  and  I  noticed  how  he  had  infected 
the  most  opposite  schools,  how  even  VERDI  had  drunk  deep, 
many  portions  of  "  Aida  "  being  quite  Wagneresque. 

"  Yes,  he  is  well  in  the  air  now ;  everything  breathes  Mm 
at  last." 

"And  the  Parsi/alt  "  I  said  ;  "is  that  new  drama  really 
coming  off?  " 

"  Surely,  next  year  in  July,  at  Bayreuth.  We  shall  have 
all  the  world  there." 

"  All  the  Wagnerites,"  I  said. 


672  LISZT. 

"  No,  no,  all  sorts ;  it  is  the  fashion  now ;  tons  les  badauds 
s'en  melent!"  which  might  be  rendered  in  elegant  American, 
"  Every  cockney  is  just  on  him." 

I  understood 'that  the  Abbate  would  retire  early,  and  we 

took  our  leave.     I  can  see  his  noble  figure  now,  dressed  in 

a  long  black  priest's  gown ;  as  he  rose  with  us, 

took  a  candle  and  came  out  into  the  passage,  the 

GOOD   NIGHT. 

light  fell  flickeriugly  upon  those  well-known  and 
majestic  features;  the  thick  white  hair  seemed  to  crown 
him,  falling  straight  on  either  side  to  his  shoulders;  he 
looked  like  an  old-world  figure  carved  by  MICHAEL  ANGELO, 
and  standing  in  a  niche  apart,  always  the  same  strange 
genial  striking  combination  which  has  captivated  society 
throughout  Europe  and  been  the  wonder  of  the  musical 
•world  for  fifty  years,  always  unconsciously  scenic,  statuesque, 
and  withal  superbly  human — such  will  long  linger  in  my 
memory  the  Abbate  FRANZ  LISZT  at  Rome  in  1881.
