This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

HORACE WALPOLE 



ISa To HoBAOs Mann. 

Dbab Sib, [Deo. 1748.] 

I have been much desired by a very particular friend, 
to recommend to you Sir William Haynard^ who is going 
to Florence. Tou will oblige me extremely by any civilities 
you show him while he stays there ; in particular, by intro- 
ducing him to the Prince and Princess de Craon, Madame 
Suares, and the rest of my acquaintance there, who, I dare 
say, will continue their goodness to me, by receiving him 
with the same politeness that they received me. I am, &c 

189. To HoBAOE Mann. 

ArUngton Street, Jan. 24, 1744. 
Don't think me guilty of forgetting you a moment, 
though I have missed two or three posts. If you knew 
the incessant hurry and &tigue in which I live, and how 
few moments I have to myself, you would not suspect 
me. You know I am naturally indolent, and without 
application to any kind of business ; yet it is impossible, 
in this country, to live in the world, and be in Parliament, 
and not find oneself every day more hooked into politics 
and company, especially inhabiting a house that is again 
become the centre of affairs. My Lord becomes the last 

Lxrm 188.—^ Fourth Baronet, of Walton, Enex.

2 To Horace Mann [1744 

resource, to which they are all forced to apply. One part 
of the ministry, you may he sure, do ; and for the other, 
they i^ect to give themselves the honour of it too. 

Last Thursday I would certainly have written to give 
you a full answer to your letter of grief \ hut I was shut 
up in the House till past ten at night ; and the night hefore 
till twelve. But I must speak to you in private first. 
I don't in the least douht but my Lady W. and Bichcourt 
would willingly be as mischievous as they are malicious^ 
if they could : but, my dear child, it is impossible. Don't 
fear from Lord Carteret's silence to you ; he never writes : 
if that were a symptom of disgrace^ the Duke of Newcastle 
would have been out long ere this : and when the Begency 
were not thought worthy of his notice, you could not 
expect it. As to your being attached to Lord Orford, that 
is your safety. Carteret told him the other day, 'My 
Lord, I appeal to the Duke of Newcastle, if I did not tell 
the King that it was you who had carried the Hanover 
troops.' That, too, disproves the accusation of Sir Bobert's 
being no Mend to the Queen of Hungary. That is now 
too stale and old. However, I will speak to my Lord and 
Mr. Pelham — would I had no more cause to tremble for 
you, than from little cabals! But, my dear child, when 
we hear every day of the Toulon fleet sailing, can I be easy 
for you ? or can I not foresee where that must break, unless 
Matthews and the wonderful fortune of England can inter- 
pose e£fectually ? We are not without our own fears ; the 
Brest fleet of twenty-two saQ is out at sea ; they talk, for 
Barbadoes. I believe we wish it may be thither destined. 
Judge what I think ; I cannot^ nor may write ; but I am

The whole world, nay, the Prince himself, allows, that 
if Lord Orford had not come to town, the Hanover troops 
had been lost They were in effect given up by all but 
Carteret. We carried our own army in Flanders by a 
majority of 112'. Last Wednesday was the great day of 
expectation: we sat in the committee on the Hanover 
troops till twelve at night : the numbers were 271 to 226. 
The next day on the report we sat again till past ten, the 
opposition having moved to adjourn till Monday, on which 
we divided, 265 to 177. Then the Tories all went away 
in a body, and the troops were voted. 

We have still tough work to do : there are the estimates 
on the extraordinaries of the campaign, and the Treaty of 
Worms to come — I know who ' thinks this last more difficult 
to fight than the Hanover troops. It is likely to turn out 
as laborious a session as ever was. All the comfort is, all 
the abuse don't lie at your door nor mine ; Lord Carteret 
has the full perquisites of the ministry. The other day, 
after Pitt had called him 'the Hanover troop-minister, 
a flagitious task-master,' and said, ' that the sixteen thousand 
Hanoverians were all the party he had, and were his 
placemen ' ; in short, after he had exhausted invectives, he 
added, 'But I have done: if he were present, I would say 
ten times more.' Murray shines as bright as ever he did 
at the bar ; which he seems to decline, to push his fortune 
in the House of Commons under Mr. Pelham. 

This is the present state of our politics, which is our 
present state; for nothing else is thought of. We fear 
the King will again go abroad.

I HAVE scarce time to write, or to know what I write. 
I live in the House of Commons. We sat on Tuesday till 
ten at night, on a Welsh election ; and shall probably stay 
as long to-day on the same. 

I have received all your letters by the couriers and the 
post: I am persuaded the Duke of Newcastle is much 
pleased with your dispatch; but I dare not inquire, for 
fear he should dislike your having written the same to me. 

I believe we should have heard more of the Brest 
squadron, if their appearance off the Land's End on Friday 
was sennight, steering towards Ireland, had occasioned 
greater consternation. It is incredible how little impres- 
sion it made : the stocks hardly fell : though it was then 
generally believed that the Pretender's son was on board \

We expected some invasion; but as they were probably 
disappointed on finding no rising in their favour, it is now 
believed that they are gone to the Mediterranean. They 
narrowly missed taking the Jamaica fleet, which was gone 
out convoyed by two men-of-war. The French pursued 
them, outsailed them, and missed them by their own in- 
expertness. Sir John Norris is at Portsmouth, ready to 
sail with nineteen men-of-war, and is to be joined by two 
more from Plymouth. We hope to hear that Matthews 
has beat the Toulon squadron before they can be joined 
by the Brest'. This is the state of our situation. They 
have stopped the embarkation of the six thousand men 
for Flanders ; and I hope the King's journey thither. The 
opposition fight every measure of supply, but very unsuc- 
cessfully. When this Welsh election is over, they will 
probably go out of town, and leave the rest of the session 
at ease. 

I think you have nothing to apprehend from the new 
mine that is preparing against you. My Lord is convinced 
it is an idle attempt ; and it will always be in his power 
to prevent any such thing from taking effect. I am very 
unhappy for Mr. Chute's gout, or for anything that distiurbs 
the peace of people I love so much, and that I have such 
vast reason to love. Tou know my fears for you : pray 
Heaven they end well! 

It is universally believed that the Pretender's son, who 
is at Paris, will make the campaign in one of their armies. 
I suppose this will soon produce a declaration of war"; 
and then France, perhaps, wiU not find her account in 
having brought him as near to England as ever he is like 
to be. Adieu I My Lord is hurrying me down to the 
House. I must go!

yesterday the King sent a message to both Houses to 
acquaint us that he has certain information of the young 
Pretender being in France \ and of the designed invasion 
from thence, in concert with the disaffected here. Inmie-

and seasonably was come to town on purpose, moved for 
an address to assure the King of standing by him with 
lives and fortunes. Lord Hartington, seconded by Sir 
Charles Windham ', the convert son of Sir William \ moved 
the same in our House. To our amazement, and little sure to 
their own honour, Waller and Dodington, supported in the 
most indecent manner by Pitt, moved to add, that we would 
immediately inquire into the state of the Navy, the causes 
of our danger by negligence, and the sailiog of the Brest 
fleet. They insisted on this amendment, and debated it till 
seven at night, not one (professed) Jacobite speaking. The 
division was 287 against 123. In the Lords, Chesterfield

All the troops have been sent for in the greatest haste 
to London ; but we shall not have above eight thousand 
men together at most. An express is gone to Holland, and 
Oeneral Wentworth followed it last night, to demand six 
thousand men, who will probably be here by the end of 
next week\ Lord Stair has offered the King his service, 
and is to-day named Commander-in-chief. This is very 
generous, and will be of great use. He is extremely beloved 
in the army, and most firm to this &mily. 

I cannot say our situation is the most agreeable; we 
know not whether Norris is gone after the Brest fleet or 
not *• We have three ships in the Downs, but they cannot 
prevent a landing, which will probably be in Essex or 
Suffolk. Don't be surprised if you hear that this crown 
is fought for on land. As yet there is no rising ; but we 
must expect it on the first descent. 

Don't be uneasy for me, when the whole is at stake. 
I don't feel as if my friends would have any reason to be 
concerned for me : my warmth will carry me as far as any 
man ; and I think I can bear as I should the worst that j 
can happen : though the delays of the French, I don't know 
from what cause, have not made that likely to happen. 

The King keeps his bed with the rheumatism. He is 
not lees obliged to Lord Orford for the defence of his crown, 
now he is out of place, than when he was in the administra- 
tion. His zeal, his courage, his attention, are indefatigable 
and inconceivable. He regards his own life no more than 
when it was most his duty to expose it, and fears for 
everything but that.

Ireland, and have sent for two more. The Dutch are 
coming : Lord Stair is general. Nobody is yet taken up — 
God knows why not ! We have repeated news of Matthews 
having beaten and sunk eight of the Toulon ships ; but the 
French have so stopped all communication that we don't

March let, 1744. 

I WISH I could put you out of the pain my last letters 
must have given you. I don't know whether your situation, 
to be at such a distance on so great a crisis, is not more 
disagreeable than ours, who are expecting every moment to 
hear the French are landed. We had great ill-luck last 
week: Sir John Norris, with four-and-twenty sail, came 
within a league of the Brest squadron, which had but 
fourteen. The coasts were covered with people to see the 
engagement ; but at seven in the evening the wind changed, 
and they escaped. There have been terrible winds these 
four or five days : our fleet has not suffered materially, but 
theirs les& Ours lies in the Downs ; ^ye of theirs at Tor- 
bay — the rest at La Hogue. We hope to hear that these 
storms, which blew directly on Dunkirk, have done great 
damage to their transports. By the fortune of the winds, 
which have detained them in port, we have had time to 
make preparations ; if they had been ready three weeks ago, 
when the Brest squadron saOed, it had all been decided. 
We expect the Dutch in four or five days. Ten battalions, 
which make seven thousand men, are sent for from our 
army in Flanders, and four thousand from Ireland, two of 
which are arrived. If they still attempt the invasion, it 
must be a bloody war ! 

The spirit of the nation has appeared extraordinarily in 
our fiivour. I wish I could say as much for that of the 
ministiy. Addresses are come from all parts, but you know 



JO To Horace Mcmn [1744 

how little they are to be depended on — King James had 
them. The merchants of London are most zealous: the 
French name will do more harm to their cause than the 
Pretender's service. One remarkable circumstance happened 
to Colonel Cholmondeley's regiment on their march to 
London: the public-houses on all the road would not let 
them pay anything, but treated them, and said, 'You are 
going to defend us against the French.' There are no signs 
of any rising. Lord Barrimore, the Pretender's general, and 
Colonel Cecil, his Secretary of State, are at last taken up ; 
the latter, who having removed his papers, had sent for 
them back, thinking the danger over, is committed to the 
Tower, on discoveries from them; but^ alas! these dis- 
coveries go on but lamely. One may perceive who is not 
minister, rather than who is. The opposition tried to put 
off the suspension of the Habeas Corpus—feebly. Vernon* 
and the Grenvilles are the warmest: Pitt and Lyttelton 
went away without voting. My father has exerted himself 
most amazingly : the other day, on the King's laying some 
information before the House, when the ministry had deter- 
mined to make no address on it, he rose up in the greatest 
agitation, and made a long and fine speech on the present 
situation. The Prince was so pleased with it, that he has 
given him leave to go to his court, which he never would 
before. He went yesterday, and was most graciously received. 
Lord Stair is at last appointed general. General Ogle- 
thorpe* is to have a commission for raising a regiment of

The answer £rom the Court of France to Mr. Thomson on 
the subject of the boy ' is most arrogant : ' that when we 
have given them satisfaction for the many complaints which 
they have made on our infraction of treaties, then they will 
think of giving us des ^daircissemenia,* 

We have no authentic account yet from Matthews : the 
most credited is a letter from Marseilles to a Jew, which 
says it was the most bloody battle ever fought ; that it 
lasted three days ; that the two first we had the worst, and 
the third, by a lucky gale, totally defeated them. Sir 
Charles Wager always said, Hhat if a sea-fight lasted three 
days, he was sure the English suffered the most for the two .

I HAVE but time to write you a minute-line, but it will be 
a comfortable one. There is just come advice, that the 
great storm on the 26th of last month, the very day the 
embarkation was to have sailed from Dunkirk, destroyed 
twelve of their transports, and obliged the whole number of 
troops, which were fifi;een thousand, to debark. You may

look upon the invasion as at an end, at least for the present ; 
though, as everything is so come to a crisiSi one shall not 
be surprised to hear of the attempt renewed. We know 
nothing yet certain from Matthews; his victory grows a 
great doubt 

As this must go away this instant, I cannot write more — 
but what could be more ? Adieu I I wish you all joy. 

146. To Horace Mann. 

March 15th, 1744. 

I HAVE nothing new to tell you : that great storm certainly 
saved us from the invasion — then. Whether it has put an 
end to the design is uncertain. They say the embargo at 
Dunkirk and Calais is taken off, but not a vessel of ours is 
come in from thence. They have, indeed, opened again the 
communication with Tpres and Nieuport, &c., but we don't 
yet hear whether they have renewed their embarkation. 
However, we take it for granted it is all over — ^from which, 
I suppose, it will not be over. We expect the Dutch troops 
every hour. That reinforcement, and four thousand men 
from Ireland, will be all the advantage we shall have made 
of gaining time. 

At last we have got some light into our Mediterranean 
affair, for there is no calling it a victory. Villettee has sent 
a courier, by which it seems we sunk one great Spanish 
ship*; the rest escaped, and the French fled shamefully; 
that was, I suppose, designedly and artfully. We can't 
account for Lestock's not coming up with his seventeen 
ships*, and we have no mind to like it, which will not

King on his Speech, which I suppose they send you. There 
is not the least news, but that my Lord Carteret's wedding 
has been deferred on Lady Sophia's falling dangerously ill 
of a scarlet fever ; but they say it is to be next Satuiday. 
She iB to have sixteen hundred pounds a year jointure, four 
hundred pin-money, and two thousand of jewels, Carteret

I COULD tell you a great deal of news, but it would not

But the chief entertainment has been the nuptials of our 
great Quixote ^ and the fur Sophia. On the point of matri- 
mony, she fell ill of a scarlet feyer, and was given over, 
while he had the gout, but heroically sent her word, that if 
she was well, he would be so. They corresponded every 
day, and he used to plague the Cabinet Council with read- 
ing her letters to them. Last night they were married ; 
^^ud as all he does must have a particular air in it, they 
supped at Lord Pomfret's : at twelve, Lady Granville (his 
mother) and all his family went to bed, but the porter: 
then my Lord went home^ and waited for her in the lodge : 
she came alone in a hackney-chair, met him in the hall, 
and was led up the back-stairs to bed. What is ridiculously 
lucky is, that Lord Lincoln goes into waiting to-day, and 
will be to present her I On Tuesday she stands godmother

daughter^^ am impatient to see the whole manage ; it will 
be admirable. There is a wild young Venetian ambassa-

she is foolish and childish to a degree. She said, 'Lordl 
the old Secretary is going to be married !' They told her 
he was but fifty-four. * But fifiy-four ! why,' said she, ' my

The invasion from Dunkirk seems laid aside. We talk 
little of our fleets : Sir John Norris has resigned : Lestock 
is coming home, and has sent before him great complaints 
of Matthews ; so that affair must be deared up. The Eang 
talks much of going abroad, which will not be very prudent. 
The campaign is not opened yet^ but I suppose will disclose 
at once with great 6cUU in several quarters. 

I this instant receive your letter of March Slst, with the 
simple Demetrius, for which, however, I thank you. I hope 
by this time you have received all my letters, and are at 
peace about the invasion ; which we think so much over, 
that the opposition are now breaking out about the Dutch 
troops, and call it the worse measure ever taken. Those 
terms so generally dealt to every measure successively, will 
at least soften the Hanoverian history. 

Adieu I I have nothing more to tell you : I flatter myself

clause, after a long debate, to make it forfeiture of estates, 
as it IB for dealing with the father. We sat till one in the 
morning, and then carried it by 285 to 106. It was the 
best debate I evw heard. The King goes to Kensington 
to<morrow, and not abroad. We hear of great quarrels 
between Marshal Wade and Due d'Aremberg. The French 
King is at Valenciennes with Monsieur de Noailles, who is 
now looked upon as first minister. He is the least danger- 
ous for us of all. It is affirmed that Gardixud Tencin is 
disgraced, who was the yery worst for us. If he is, we 
shall at least have no invasion this summer. Successors 
of ministers seldom take up the schemes of their predeces- 
sore ; especially such as by failing caused their ruin, which, 
I believe, was Tencin's case at Dunkirk. 

For a week we heard of the afEair at YiUafranoa * in a 
worse light than was true : it certainly turns out ill for 
both sides. Though the French have had such bloody loss, 
I cannot but think they will carry their point, and force 
their passage into Italy. 

We have no domestic news, but Lord Lovel's being 
created Earl of Leicester, on an old promise which my 
father had obtained for him. Earl Bericeley is married to 
Miss Draz ', a very pretty Maid of Honour to the Princess ; 
and the Viscount Fitzwilliam* to Sir Matthew Decker's' 
eldest daughter ; but these are people I am sure you don't 
know.

Loodon, Hay 29, 1744. 

Surcs I wrote I have received two from you of May 6th 
and 19th. I am extremely sorry you get mine so late. 
I have desired your brother to complain to Mr. Preverau : 
I get yours pretty regularly. 

I have this morning had a letter from Mr. Conway at the 
army; he says he hears just then that the French have 
declared war against the Dutch : they had in effect before 
by besieging Menin, which siege our army is in fiill march 
to raise. They have laid bridges over the Scheldt, and 
intend to force the French to a battle. The latter are 
almost double our number, but their desertion is prodigious, 
and their troops extremely bad. Fourteen thousand more 
Dutch are ordered, and their six thousand are going from 
hence with four more of ours ; so we seem to have no more 
apprehensions of an invasion. All thoughts of it are over I 
no inquiry made into it I The present ministry fear the 
detection of conspiracies more than the thing itself: that 
is, they fear eveiything that they are to do themselves. 

My father has been extremely ill, from a cold he caught 
last week at New Park. Princess Emily came thither to

fish, and he^ who is grown quite indolent, and has not 
been out of a hot room this twelvemonth, sat an hour and 
a half by the water-side. He was in great danger one day, 
and more low-spirited than ever I knew him, though 
I think that grows upon him with his infirmities. Hy 
sister was at his bed-side ; I came into the room, — he burst 
into tears and could not speak to me : but he is quite well 
now ; though I cannot say I think he will preserve his life 
long, as he has laid aside all exercise, which has been of 
such vast service to him. He talked the other day of 
shutting himself up in the fEurthest wing at Houghton ; 
I said, ' Dear my Lord, you will be at a distance from all 
the family there ! ' He replied, ' So much the better I * 

Pope is given over with a dropsy*, which is mounted into 
his head : in an evening he is not in his senses ; the other 
day at Ghiswick, he said to my Lady Burlington, * Look at 
Jesus there ! how ill they have crucified him !' 

There is a Prince of Ost-Frize ' dead, which is likely to 
occasion most unlucky broils : Holland, Prussia, and Den- 
mark have all pretensions to his succession ; but Prussia is 
determined to make his good. If the Dutch don't dispute 
it, he will be too near a neighbour ; if they do, we lose his 
neutrality, which is now so materiaL 

The town has been in a great bustle about a private 
match ; but which, by the ingenuity of the ministry, has 
been made politics. Mr. Fox fell in love with Lady Caro- 
line Lenox'; asked her, was refused, and stole her. His 
father^ was a footman; her great-grandfather a king: hinc

monds, but who have tried to make Fox and all that set

how to get out of it They were for hindering Williams ^ 
who is Fox's great friend, and at whose house they were 
married, from haying the red ribbon; but he has got it 
with four others, the Viscount Fitzwilliam, Calthorpe', 
Whitmore^, and Harbord'. Dashwood (Lady Carteret's 
quondam lover) has stolen a great fortune, a Miss Bate- 
man; the marriage had been proposed, but the fathers 
could not agree on the terms. 

I am much obliged to you for all your Sardinian and 
Neapolitan journals. I am impatient for the conquest of 
Naples, and haye no notion of neglecting sure things, which

booby* to you. Indeed, dear Mr. Chute, I never saw him, 
but was pressed by Mr. Selwyn, whose brother's friend he 
is, to give him that letter to you. I now hear that he is 
a warm Jacobite ; I suppose you somehow disobliged him 
politically. 

We are now mad about tar-water, on the publication of 
a book** that I will send you, written by Dr. Berkeley,

Jane 11, 1744. 

PSbhafs you expect to hear of great triumphs and vic- 
tories; of General Wade grown into a Duke of Marl- 
borough ; or of the King being in Flanders, with the second 
part of the battle of Dettingen — ^why, aye ; you are bound 
in conscience, as a good Englishman, to expect all this — 
but what if all these lo Paeans should be played to the 
Dunkirk tune ? I must prepare you for some such thing ; 
for unless the French are as much their own foes as we 
are our own, I don't see what should hinder the festival of 
to-day^ being kept next year a day sooner. But I will 
draw no consequences : only sketch you out our present 
situation : and if Cardinal Tencin can miss making his use 
of it, we may bum our books and live hereafter upon 
Providence. 

The French King's army is at least ninety thousand 
strong; has taken Menin already, and Tpres almost ^ 
Bemains then only Ostend; which you will look in the 
map and see does not lie in the high road to the conquest 
of the Austrian Netherlands. Ostend may be laid under 
water, and the taking it an affair of time. But there lies 
all our train of artillery, which cost two hundred thou- 
sand pounds; and what becomes of our communication 
with our army ? Why, they may go round by William-

other bcxfy's army I It turns out that the whole combined 
army, English, Duteh, Austrians, and Hanoverians, does 
not amount to above thirty-eiz thousand fighting men I and 
yet forty thousand more French, under the Due d'Haroourt ^ 
are coming into Flanders. When their army is already so 
superior to ours, for what can that reinforcement be in- 
tended, but to let them spare a triumph to Dunkirk ? Now 
you will naturally ask me three questions : where is Prince 
Charles? where are the Dutch? what force have you to 
defend England? Prince Charles is hovering about the 
Bhine to take Lorrsin, which they seem not to care whether 
he does or not^ and leaves you to defend the Netherlands. 
The Dutch seem indifferent whether their barrier is in the 
hands of the Queen or the Emperor ; and while you are so 
mad, think it prudent not to be so themselves. For our 
own force, it is too melancholy to mention : six regiments 
go away to-morrow to Ostend, with the six thousand Dutch. 
Carteret and Boetzlaer (the Dutch Envoy Extraordinary) 
would have hurried them away without orders ; but Qeneral 
Smitsarty their commander, said he was too old to be 
hanged. This reply was told to my father yesterday : 'Ay,' 
said he^ ' so I thought I was ; but I may live to be mis- 
taken 1 ' When these troops are gone, we shall not have in 
the whole island above six thousand men, even when the 
regiments are complete ; and half of those pressed and new- 
listed men. For our sea-force, I wish it may be greater in 
proportion ! Sir Charles Hardy, whose name ' at least is 
ill-favoured, is removed, and old Balchen*, a firm Whig, put

that they can let us haye but six of the twenty ships we 
expected. My father is going into Norfolk, quite shocked 
at living to see how terribly his own conduct is justified. 
In the City the word is, ^Old Sunderland's^ game is acting 
over again.' Tell me if you receive this letter : I believe 
you will scarce give it about in memorials. 

Here are arrived two Florentines, not recommended to 
me, but I have been very civil to them. Marquis Salviati 
and Gonte Delci ; the latter remembers to have seen me 
at Madame Grifoni's. The Venetian ambassador met my 
father yesterday at my Lady Brown's: you would have 
laughed to have seen how he stared and ecceUenea'd him. 
At last they fell into a broken Latin chat, and there was 
no getting the ambassador away from him. 

If you have the least interest in any one Madonna in 
Florence, pay her well for all the service she can do us. 
If she can work miracles, now is her time. If she can't, 
I believe we shall all be forced to adore her. Adieu 1 Tell 
Mr. Chute I fear we shall not be quite so well received at 
the conversazioni, at Madame de Craon's, and the Casino', 
when we are but refugee heretics. Well, we must hope I 
Yours I am, and we will bear our wayward fate together.

London, June 18, 1744. 
I HAVE not any immediate bad news to tell you in con- 
sequence of my last. The siege of Ypres does not advance 
so expeditiously as was expected ; a little time gained in 
sieges goes a great way in a campaign. The Brest squadron 

• 7 Lord Snnderland who betnij«d * The Florentine coffee-house. 

James II. Walpo(e» Walpole,

is making just as great a figure in our channel as Matthews 
does before Toulon and Marseilles. I should be glad to be 
told by some nice computers of national glory, how much 
the balance is on our side. 

Anson ^ is returned with vast fortune, substantial and 
lucky. He has brought the Aquapulca ship ' into Ports- 
mouthy and its treasure is at least computed at five hundred 
thousand pounds. He escaped the Brest squadron by a 
mist. You will have all the particulars in a gazette. 

I will not £eu1 to make your compliments to the Pomfrets 
and Carterets. I see them seldom, but I am in favour ; so 
I conclude, for my Lady Pomfret told me the other night, 
that I said better things than anybody. I was with them 
all at a subscription-ball at Banelagh last week, which my 
Lady Carteret thought proper to look upon as given to her, 
and thanked the gentlemen, who were not quite so well 
pleased at her condescending to take it to herself. My 
Lord stayed with her there till four in the morning. They 
are all fondness— walk together, and stop every five steps 
to kiss. Madame de Craon is a cipher to her for grandeur. 
The ball was on an excessively hot night; yet she was 
dressed in a magnificent brocade, because it was new that 
morning for the inauguration-day. I did the honours of 
all her dress: 'How charming your Ladyship's cross is! 
I am sure the design was your own.' — 'No, indeed; my 
Lord sent it me just as it is.' — 'How fine your ear-rings 
are I ' — 'Oh I but they are very heavy.' Then as much to 
the mother. Do you wonder I say better things than any- 
body?

I send you by a ship going to Leghorn the only new 
books at all worth reading. The Abuse of Parliaments^ 
is by Dodington and Waller, circumstantially scurrilous. 
The dedication of the Essay ^ to my father is fine; pray 
mind the quotation from Milton. There is Dr. Berkeley's 
mad book on tar-water, which has made everybody as mad 
as himsel£ It begins with tar-water and ends with the 
Trinity; Orator Henley preached the other day on the Tar- 
inity. 

I hare lately made a great antique purchase of all Dr. 
Middleton's collection which he brought from Italy, and 
which he is now publishing \ I will send you the book 
as soon as it comes out. I would not buy the things till 
the book was half printed, for fear of an ^ Museo WcUpoUano. 
Those honours are mighty well for such known and learned 
men as Mr. Smithy the merchant of Venice. My dear 
Mr. Chute, how we used to enjoy the title-page^ of his 
understanding I Do you remember how angry he was when 
showing us a Guide, after pompous rooms full of Sebastian 
Riccis, which he had a mind to establish for capital pictures, 
you told him he had now made amends for all the rubbish 
he had showed us before ? 

My father has asked, and with some difficulty got, his 
pension of four thousand pounds a year, which the King 
gave him on his resignation, and which he dropped, by the 
wise fears of my uncle and the Selwyns. He has no reason 
to be satisfied with the manner of obtaining it now, or with

Ht DEABBST Habst, Arlington Street, June S9, 1744, 

I don't know what made my last letter so long on the 
road : yours got hither as soon as it could. I don't attribute 
it to any examination at the post-oflfice. €K>d forbid I should 
suspect any branch of the present administration of attempt- 
ing to know any one kind of thing I I remember when 
I was at Eton, and Mr. Bland^ had set me any extraordinary T 
task, I used aomeliiBeB to pique myself upon not getting it, I 
because it was not immediately my school business. What ! J 
learn more than I am absolutely forced to learn I I felt the \ 
weight of learning that ; for I was a blockhead, and pushed I ^ 
up above my parts. 

Lest you maliciously think I mean any application of 
this last Bent^&oe anywhere in the world, I shall go and 
transcribe some lines out of a new poem, that pretends to 
great impartiality, but is eyidently wrote by some secret 
friend of the ministry'. It is called Pope's, but has no good 
lines but the foUowing. The plan supposes him complaining 
of being put to death by the blundering discord of his two 
physicians, Burton' and Thompson^; and from thence makes 
a transition, to show that all the present misfortunes of the 
world flow from a parallel disagreement ; for instance^ in 
politics :

30 To the Eon. Henry Seymour Conway [1744 

Ask you what cause this conduct can create? 
The doctors differ that direct the state. 
Graterus, wild as Thompson, rules and raves, 
A slave himself, yet proud of making slaves; 
Fondly believing that his mighty paris 
Can guide all councils and command all hearts; 
Oive shape and colour to discordant things, 
Hide fraud in ministers and fear in kings. 
Presuming on his power, such schemes he draws 
For bribing Iron", and giving Europe laws, 
That camps, and fleets, and treaties fill the news, 
And succours unobtain'd and unaccomplished views. 

Like solemn Burton grave Plumbosus acts, 
He thinks in method, argues all from facts; 
Warm in his temper, yet affecting ice. 
Protests his candour ere he gives advice; 
Hints he dislikes the schemes he recommends, 
And courts his foes— and hardly courts his friends ; 
Is fond of power, and yet concem'd for fame — 
From different parties would dependents claim ; 
Declares for war, but in an awkward way, 
Loves peace at hearty which he's afraid to say; 
His head perplez'd, altho' his hands are pure — 
An honest man, — but not a hero sure! 

I beg you will never tell me any news till it has passed 
every impression of the Dutch gazette; for one is apt to 
mention what is wrote to one: that gets about, comes at 
last to the ears of the ministry, puts them in a fright, and 
perhaps they send to beg to see your letter. Now, you 
know one should hate to have one's private correspondence 
made grounds for a measure, — especially for an absurd one, 
which is just possible. 

If I was writing to anybody but you, who know me so 
well, I should be afraid this would be taken for pique and 
pride, and be construed into my thinking all ministers 
inferior to my £etther; but, my dear Harry, you know it

was neyer my foible to think orer-abundantly well of him. 
Why I think as I do of the present great geniuses, answer 
for me. Admiral Matthews, great British Neptune, bouncing 
in the Mediterranean, whfle the Brest squadron is riding in 
the English Channel, and an invasion from Dimkirk every 
moment threatening your coasts ; against which you send 
for six thousand Dutch troops, while you have twenty 
thousand of your own in Flanders, which not being of 
any use, you send these very six thousand Dutch to them, 
with above half of the few of your own remaining in 
England; a third part of which half of which few you 
countermand, because you are again alarmed with the 
invasion, and yet let the six Dutch go, who came for no 
other end but to protect you. And that our naval discretion 
may go hand-in-hand with our military, we find we have 
no force at home; we send for fifteen ships from the 
Mediterranean to guard our coasts^ and demand twenty 
from the Dutch. The first fifteen will be here, perhaps, 
in three months. Of the twenty Dutch, they excuse all 
but six, of which six they send all but four ; and of your 
own small domestic fleet, five are going to the West Indies 
and twenty a-hunting for some Spanish ships that are 
coming from the Indies. Don't it put you in mind of 
a trick that ib done by calculation ? Think of a number : 
halve it — double it— add ten — subtract twenty — add half 
the first number — take away all you added: now, what 
remains?

Here lies, who died, as most folks die, in hope, 

The mould'ring, more ignoble part of Pope ; 

The bard, whose sprightly genius dar'd to wage 

Poetic war with an immorfd age; 

Made every vice and private folly known 

In friend and foe — a stranger to his own; 

Set virtue in its loveliest form to view, 

And still profess'd to be the sketch he drew. 

As humour or as interest serv'd, his verse 

Gould praise or flatter, libel or asperse: 

Unharming innocence with guilt could load. 

Or lift the rebel patriot to a god: 

Give the censorious critic standing laws — 

The first to violate them with applause; 

The just translator and the solid wit, 

Like whom the passions few so truly hit: 

The scourge of dunces whom his malice made — 

The impious plague of the defenceless dead : 

To real knaves and real fools a sore — 

Beloved by many, but abhorr'd by more. 

If here his merits are not full exprest, 

His never-dying strains shall tell the rest. ^x

Ht DSABEST Habby, Arlington Street, July 20, 1744. 

I FEEL that I have so much to say to you, that I foresee 
there will be but little method in my letter ; but if, upon 
the whole^ you see my meaning, and the depth of my friend- 
ship for you, I am content. 

It was most agreeable to me to receiye a letter of confi- 
dence from you, at the time I expected a very different one 
from you ; though, by the date of your last, I perceive you 
had not then received some letters, which, though I did not 
see, I must call simple, as they could only tend to make 
you uneasy for some months. I should not have thought 
of communicating a quarrel to you at this distance, and 
I don't conceive the sort of friendship of those that thought 
it necessary. When I heard it had been wrote to you, 
I thought it right to myself to give you my account of it^ 
but, by your brother's desire, suppressed my letter, and leffc 
it to be e:q>lained by him, who wrote to you so sensibly on 
it, that I shall say no more but that I think myself so ill- 
used that it will prevent my giving you thoroughly the 
advice you ask of me; for how can I be sure that my 



86 To (he Hon. Henry Seymour Conway [1744 

resentment might not make me see in a stronger light the 
reasons for your breaking off an affair which you know 
before I never approved * ? 

You know my temper is so open to anybody I love that 
I must be happy at seeing you lay aside a reserve with me, 
which is the only point that ever made me dissatisfied with 
you. That silence of yours has, perhaps, been one of the 
chief reasons that has always prevented my saying much to 
you on a topic which I saw was so near your heart Indeed, 
its being so near was another reason ; for how could I expect 
you would take my advice, even if you bore it? But, my 
dearest Harry, how can I advise you now ? Is it not gone 
too flEtr for me to expect you should keep any resolution 
about it, especially in absence, which must be destroyed the 
moment you meet again? And if ever you should marry 
and be happy, won't you reproach me with having tried to 
hinder it? I think you as just and honest as I think any 
man living ; but any man living in that circumstance would 
think I had been prompted by private reasons, I see as 
strongly as you can all the arguments for your breaking off ; 
but, indeed, the alteration of your fortune adds very little 
strength to what they had before. You never had fortune 
enough to make such a step at all prudent : she loved you 
enough to be content with that ; I can't believe this change 
will alter her sentiments, for I must do her the justice to 
say that it is plain she preferred you with nothing to all the 
world. I could talk upon this head, but I will only leave 
you to consider, without advising you on either side, these 
two things— whether you think it honester to break off with

her after such engagements as yours (how strong I don't 
know), after her refusing very good matches for you, and 
show her that she must think of making her fortune ; or 
whether you will wait with her till some amendment in 
your fortune can put it in your power to marry her. 

My dearest Harry, you must see why I don't care to say 
more on this head. My wishing it could be right for you to 
break o£F with her (for, without it is light, I would not have 
you on any account take such a step) makes it impossible for 
me to advise it ; and, therefore, I am sure you will forgive 
my declining an act of friendship which your having put in 
my power gives me the greatest satisfi^ction. But it does 
put something else in my power, which I am sure nothing 
can make me decline, and for which I have long wanted an 
opportunity. Nothing could prevent my being unhappy at 
the smallness of your fortune, but its throwing it into my 
way to offer you to share mine. As mine is so precarious, 
by depending on so bad a constitution, I can only offer you 
the inmiediate use of it. I do that most sincerely. My 
places still (though my Lord Walpole has cut off three 
hundred pounds a year to save himself the trouble of signing 
his name ten times for once) bring me in near two thousand 
pounds a year. I have no debts, no connections ; indeed no 
way to dispose of it particularly. By living with my father, 
I have little real use for a quarter of it. I have always 
flung it away all in the most idle manner; but, my dear 
Harry, idle as I am, and thoughtless, I have sense enough 
to have real pleasure in denying myself baubles, and in 
saving a very good income to make a man happy, for whom 
I have a just esteem and most sincere friendship. I know 
the difficulties any gentleman and man of spirit must 
struggle with, even in having such an offer made him, 
much more in accepting it. I hope you will allow there 
are some in making it. But hear me : if there is any such 



88 To Horace Mann [1744 

thing as friendship in the world, these are the opportunities 
of exerting it, and it can't be exerted without it is accepted. 
I must talk of myself to prove to you that it will be right 
for you to accept it. I am sensible of having more follies 
and weaknesses, and fewer real good qualities, than most 
men. I sometimes reflect on this, though I own too seldom. 
I always want to begin acting like a man, and a sensible 
one, which I think I might be if I would. Can I begin 
better, than by taking care of my fortune for one I love ? 
You have seen (I have seen you have) that I am fickle, and 
foolishly fond of twenty new people ; but I don't really love 
them — I have alwa3rs loved you constantly : I am willing to 
convince you and the world, what I have always told you, 
that I loved you better than anybody. If I ever felt much 
for anything (which I know may be questioned), it was 
certainly for my mother. I look on you as my nearest 
relation' by her, and I think I can never do enough to show 
my gratitude and affection to her. For these reasons, don't 
deny me what I have set my heart on— the making your 
fortune easy to you. . . .

I HAVE not written to you^ my dear child, a good while, 
yt know; but, indeed, it was from having nothing to tell 
you. You know I love you too well for it to be necessary 
to be punctually proving it to you ; so, when I have nothing 
worth your knowing, I repose myself upon the persuasion 
that you must have of my friendship. But I will never let 
that grow into any negligence, I should say, idleness, which 
is always mighty ready to argue me out of everything

I ought to do ; and letteivwriting is one of the first duties 
that the very best people let perish out of their rubric. 
Indeed, I pride myself extremely in having been so good 
a correspondent ; for, besides that every day grows to make 
one hate writing more, it is difficult, you must own, to keep 
up a correspondence of this sort with any spirit, when long 
absence makes one entirely out of all the little circumstances 
of each other's society, and which are the soul of letters. 
We are forced to deal only in great events, like historians ; 
and, instead of being Horace Mann and Horace Walpole, 
seem to correspond as Guicciardin and Clarendon would: 

Discedo AJcaeus puncto ittius; Hie meo quia I 
Quis nisi CMmachus? 

Apropos to writing histories and Guicciardin; I wish to 
God, Boccalini^ was living ! never was such an opportunity 
for Apollo's playing off a set of fools, as there is now ! The 
good City of London, who, from long dictating to the 
government, are now come to preside over taste and letters, 
have given one Carte \ a Jacobite parson, fifty pounds a year 
for seven years, to write the history of England ; and four 
aldermen and six common-councilmen are to inspect his 
materials and the progress of the work. Surveyors of 
common sewers turned supervisors of literature I To be 
sure, they think a history of England is no more than 
Stowe's Survey of the Parishes t Instead of having books 
published with the imprmatur of an university, they wiU be

Thomas Johnson, Churchwardens. 

But, brother historian, you will wonder I should have 
nothing to communicatej when all Europe is bursting with 
events, and every day 'big with the fate of Cato and of 
Bome.' But so it is; I know nothing; Prince Charles's

from our reinforcement and his diminutions. In the mean 
time, as I am at least one of the principal heroes of my own 
politics, being secure of any invasion, I am going to leave all

tune. Lord Stair is going into Scotland : the King is grown 
wonderfully fond of him, since he has taken the resolution

into very good large tooth-combs. You know the present

grenadiers. I should like to see their loves woven into 
a French opera: La Ch^tardie's character is quite adapted to 
the civil discord of their stage : and then a northern heroine 
to reproach him in their outrageous quavers, would make 
a most delightful crash of sentiment, impertinence, gallantry, 
contempt, and screaming. The first opera that I saw at 
Paris, I could not believe was in earnest, but thought they 
had carried me to the op^ra comique. The three acts of the 
piece' were three several interludes, of the Loves of Antony

of TibuUus with a niece of M»oenas; besides something

I don't know any of your English* I should delight in 
your Vaux-hall-ets : what a figure my Orifona must make 
in such a romantic scene I I haye lately been reading the 
poems of the Earl of Surrey, in Henry the Eighth's time ; 
he was in loye with the fair Geraldine of Florence ; I haye 
a mind to write under the Grlf<«a'8 picture these two lines 
from one of his sonnets : 

From Tuscans came my lady's worthy race. 
Fair Florence was some time her auncient seat. 

And then these : 

Her beauty qf kinde, her yertue from aboye ; 
Happy is he that can obtaine her loye I 

I don't know what qf hinde means, but to be sure it was 
something prodigiously expressiye and gallant in those days, 
by its being unintelligible now. Adieu! Do the Chutes

London, Aug. 16, 1744. 
I AX writing to you two or three da3rs beforehand, by way 
of settling my affairs : not that I am going to be married or 
to die ; but something as bad as either if it were to last as 
long. Tou will guess that it can only be going to Houghton ; 
but I make as much an affidr of that, as other people would 
of going to Jamaica. Indeed I don't lay in store of cake 
and band-boxes, and citron-water, and cards, and cold meat, 
as country gentlewomen do after the session. My packing-up 
and trayelling concerns lie in yery small compass ; nothing 
but myself and Patapan, my footman, a doak-bag, and 
a couple of books. My old Tom is eyen reduced upon the 
article of my journey ; he is at the Bath, patching together 



46 To Horace Mann [1744 

some very bad remains of a worn-out constitution. I always 
travel without company ; for then I take my own hours and 
my own humours, which I don't think the most tractable 
to shut up in a coach with anybody elsa You know, St. 
^yremont's ^ rule for conquering the passions, was to indulge 
them; mine for keeping my temper in order, is never to 
leave it too long with another person. I have found out 
that it will have its way, but I make it take its way by 
itself. It is such sort of reflection as this, that makes me 
hate the country : it is impossible in one house, with one set 
of company, to be always enough upon one's guard to make 
one's self agreeable, which one ought to do, as one always 
expects it from others. If I had a house of my own in 
the country, and could live there now and then alone, or 
frequently changing my company, I am persuaded I should 
like it ; at least, I fancy I should ; for when one begins to 
reflect why one don't like the country, I believe one grows 
near liking to reflect in it. I feel very often that I grow to 
correct twenty things in myself as thinking them ridiculous 
at my age ; and then with my spirit of whim and folly, 
I make myself believe that this is all prudence, and that 
I wish I were young enough to be as thoughtless and 
extravagant as I used to be. But if I know anything of 
the matter, this is all flattering myself: I grow older, and 
love my follies less — ^if I did not, alas I poor prudence and 
reflection ! 

I think I have pretty well exhausted the chapter of myself. 
I will now go talk to you of another fellow, who makes me 
look upon myself as a very perfect character ; for as I have 
little merit naturally, and only pound a stray virtue now 
and then by chance, the other gentleman seems to have no 
vice, rather no villainy, but what he nurses in himself and

methodises with as much pains as a stoic would patience. 
Indeed his pains are not thrown away. This i>ains-taking 
person's name is Frederic, King of Prussia *. Pray remember 
for the future never to speak of him and H. W. without 
giving the latter the preference. Last week we were all 
alarm! He was before Prague with fifty thousand men, 
and not a man in Bohemia to ask him, ' What dost thou ? * 
This week we have raised a hundred thousand Hungarians, 
besides vast militias and loyal nobilities. The King of 
Poland is to attack him on his march, and the Bussians to 
fall on Prussia. In the mean time, his letter or address 
to the people of England * has been published here : it is 
a poor performance ! His Voltaires and his Utterati should 
correct his works before they are printed. A careless song, 
with a little nonsense in it now and then, does not mis- 
become a monarch ; but to pen manifestoes worse than the 
lowest commis that is kept jointly by two or three margraves, 
is insufferable ! 

We are very strong in Flanders, but still exi>ect to do 
nothing this campaign. The French are so intrenched, 
that it is impossible to attack them. There is talk of 
besieging Haubeuge; I don't know how certainly. 

Lord Middlesex's match is determined, and the writings 
signed. She proves an immense fortune; they pretend 
a hundred and thirty thousand pounds — what a fund for 
making operas! y^ 

Hy Lady Carteret is going to Tunbridge yc . ^ there is 
a hurry for a son : his only one ' is gone mad : about a fort-

Lady is in the honeymoon of her grandeur : she Uves in 
public places, whither she is escorted by the old beaux of 
her husband's court; fair white-wigged old gallants, the 
Duke of Bolton, Lord Tweedale, Lord Bathurst, and Charles 
Fielding^; and she all over knots, and small hoods, and 
ribbons. Her brother^ told me the other night, 'Indeed 
I think my thister doesth countenanth Banelagh too mutch.' 
They call my Lord Pomfret, King Stanislaus, the queen's 
father. 

I heard of an admirable dialogue^ which has been written 
at the army on the battle of Dettingen, but one can't get 
a copy; I must tell you two or three strokes in it that 
I have heard. Pierrot asks Harlequin, ^Que donne-t-on aux

My Lord bids me tell you how much he is obliged to you

1744] To the Hon. Henry Seymour Conway 51 

hiB. Ill tell you what, we shall both be obliged to you if 
you wfll inclose a magnifying glass in your next letters ; for 
your two last were in so diminutiye a character, that we 
were forced to employ all Mrs. Leneve's spectacles, besides 
an ancient family reading-glass, with which my grandfather 
used to begin the psalm, to discoyer what you said to us. 
Besides this, I have a piece of news for you : Sir Bobert 
Walpole, when he was made Earl of Orford, left the 
ministry, and with it the palace in Downing Street ; as 
numbers of people found out three years ago, who, not 
haying your integrity, were quick in perceiving the change 
of his situation. Tour letter was full as honest as you ; 
for, though directed to Downing Street, it would not, as 
other letters would have done, address itself to the present 
possessor. Do but think if it had ! The smallness of the 
hand would have immediately struck my Lord Sandys with 
the idea of a plot ; for what he could not read at first sight, 
he;pp(^d certainly have concluded must be cipher.

morning, who had lost a leg in a former engagement ; and 
then, haying received advice of another litter being advanced 
as far as Darsingham, Lord Walpole commanded Captain

them ; but on the approach of our troops the enemy stole

to have you engaged in the least more glory than you have 
been. I should not loye the remainder of you the least 
better for your having lost an arm or a leg, and have as 
full persuasion of your courage as if you had contributed to 
the slicing off twenty pair from French officer& Thank God, 
you have sense enough to content yourself without being 
a hero! though I don't quite forget your expedition a 
huzzar-hunting the beginning of this campaign. Pray, no 
more of those jaunts ! I don't know anybody you would 
oblige with a present of such game : for my part, a fragment 
of the oldest hussar on earth should never have a place in 
my museum — they are not antique enough ; and for a live 
one, I must tell you, I like my racoon infinitely better. 

Adieu I my dear Harry. I long to see you. Tou will 
easily believe the thought I have of being particularly well 
with you is a vast addition to my impatience, though 
you know it is nothing new to me to be overjoyed at your 
return.

Does Decency insist upon one's writing within certain 
periods, when one has nothing to say ? because, if she does, 
she is the most formal, ceremonious personage I know. 
I shall not enter into a dispute with her, as my Lady 
Hervey did with the goddess of Indolence, or with the 
goddess of letter-writing, I forget which, in a long letter 
that she sent to the Duke of Bourbon; because I had 
rather write than have a dispute about it. Besides, I am 
not at all used to converse with hieroglyphic ladies. But, 



1744] To Horace Mann 53 

I do assure you, it is merely to avoid scolding that I set 
about this letter : I don't mean your scolding, for you are 
all goodness to me ; but my own scolding of myself— a cor- 
rection I stand in great awe of, and which I am sure never 
to escape as often as I am to blame. One can scold other 
people again, or smile and jog one's foot, and affect not 
to mind it; but those airs won't do with oneself; one 
always comes off by the worst in a dispute with one's own 
conviction. 

Admiral Matthews sent me down hither your great 
packet : I am charmed with your prudence, and with the 
good sense of your orders for the Neapolitan expedition ; 
I won't say your good-nature, which is excessive; for I think 
your tenderness of the little Queen ^ a little outr^, especially 
as their apprehensions might have added great weight to 
your menaces. I would threaten like a corsair, though 
I would conquer with all the good breeding of a Scipio. 
I most devoutly wish you success ; you are sure of having 
me moat happy with any honour you acquire. Tou have 
quite soared above all fearof Goldsworthy, and, I think, must 
appear of consequence to any ministry. I am much obliged 
to you for the medal, and like the design : I shall preserve it 
as part of your works. 

I can't forgive what you say to me about the coffee-pot : 
one would really think that you looked upon me as an old 
woman that had left a legacy to be kept for her sake, and 
a curse to attend the parting with it. My dear child, is it 
treating me justly to enter into the detail of your reasons ? 
was it even necessary to say, ' I have changed your coffee- 
pot for some other plate ' ? 

I have nothing to tell you, but that I go to town next

Arlington Street, Oct 19, 17ii. 

I HAVE received two or three letters from you ainoe I wrote 
to you last, and all contribute to give me fears for your 
situation at Florence. How absurdly all the Queen's haughti- 
nesses are dictated to her by her ministers, or by her own 
Austriacity! She lost all Silesia because she would not 
lose a small piece of it, and she is going to lose Tuscany for 
want of a neutrality, because she would not accept one for 
Naples, even after all prospect of conquering it wasyanished. 
Everything goes ill ! the Sang of Sardinia beaten ; and to- 
day we hear of Goni lost ^ I Tou will see in the papers too, 
that the Victory, our finest ship, is lost, with Sir John Balchen 
and nine hundred men. The expense alone of the ship is 
computed at above two hundred thousand pounds. We 
have nothing good but a flying report of a victory of Prince 
Charles over the Prussian, who, it is said, has lost ten 
thousand men, and both his legs by a cannon-ball. I have 
no notion [of his losing them, but by breaking them in 
over-huny to run away. However, it comes from a Jew, 
who had the first news of the passage of the Rhine*. But, 
my dear child, how will this comfort me, if you are not to 
remain in peace at Florence I I tremble as I write !

My Lord Walpole has promised me a letter for young

was my brother's : he protests he is not ; but the youth has 
profited of his mother*s gallantriea 

I have not seen Admiral Matthews yet, but I take him 
to be very mad. He walks in the Park with a cockade 
of three colours: the Duke desired a gentleman to ask 
him the meaning, and all the answer he would give was,

to see him, thank him for my packet, and inquire after 
the cases. 

It is a most terrible loss for his parents, Lord Beauchamp's'

He has written the most shocking letter imaginable to poor 
Lord Hertford, telling him that it is a judgement upon him 
for all his undutifulness, and that he must always look 
upon himself as the cause of his son's death. Lord Hertford 
is as good a man as lives, and has always been most un- 
reasonably ill-used by that old tyrant. The title of Somerset 
will revert to Sir Edward Seymour ^, whose line has been 
most unjustly deprived of it from the first creation. The 
Protector, when only Earl of Hertford, married a great

Lord Lincoln was manured last Tuesday, and Lord Middle- 
sex will be very soon, vddave you heard the gentle manner 
of the French Eing'C dismissing Madame de Gh&teauroux? 
In the very circle, the Bishop of Soissons " told her, that, 
as the scandal the King had given with her was public, his 
Majesty thought his repentance ought to be so too, and that 
he therefore forbad her the court ; and then turning to the 
monarch, asked him if that was not his pleasure, who 
replied, Tes. They have taken away her pension too, and 
turned out even laundresses that she had recommended 
for the future Dauphiness. To complete the scene of folly, 
the simple Queen has made a triumphal entry into Paris 
for the recovery of the Sling's soul — not forgetting his body.

I FiKD I must not wait any longer for news, if I intend 
to keep up our correspondence. Nothing happens ; nothing 
has since I wrote last, but Lord Middlesex's wedding ; which 
was over a week before it was known. I believe the bride 
told it then ; for he and all his family are so silent, that they 
would never have mentioned ityshe might have popped out 
a child, before a single Sackville would have been at the 
expense of a syllable to justify he^^

ArUngton Street, Not. 26, 1744. 
I HAVE not prepared you for a great event, because it was 
really so unlikely to happen, that I was afraid of being the 
author of a mere political report ; but, to keep you no longer 
in suspense, Lord Granville has rtsigned : that is the term, 
fhonnUe fagon de parler; but, in few words, the truth of 
the history is, that the Duke of Newcastle (by the way, 
mind that the words I am going to use are not mine, but 
his Majesty's) 'being grown as jealous of Lord Granville 
as he had been of Lord Orford, and wanting to be first 
minister himself which, a puppy I how should he be ? ' 
{autre phrase royale), and his brother being as susceptible of 
the noble passion of jealousy as he is, have long been con- 
spiring to overturn the great Lord. Besolution and capacity 
were all they wanted to bring it about ; for the imperiousness 
and universal contempt which their rival had for them, 
and for the rest of the ministry, and for the rest of the 
nation, had made almost all men his enemies ; and, indeed, 
he took no pains to make friends : his maxim was, ' Give 
any man the crown on his aide, and he can defy everything.' 
Winnington asked him, if that were true, how he came to 
be minister? About a fortnight ago, the whole Cabinet 
Council, except Lord Bath, Lord Winchelsea, Lord Tweedale, 
the Duke of Bolton, and my good brother-in-law \ (the two 
last severally bribed with the promise of Ireland,) did 
venture to let the King know, that he must part with them 
or with Lord Granville. The monarch does not love to be 
forced, and his son is full as angry. Both tried to avoid the

rupture. My father was sent for, but excused himself from 
coming till last Thursday, and even then would not go to 
the King ; and at last gave his opinion very unwillingly. 
But on Saturday it was finally determined : Lord Granville 
resigned the seals, which are given back to my Lord President 
Harrington. Lord Winchelsea quits too * ; but for all the 
rest of that connection, they have agreed not to quit, but to 
be forced out : so Mr. Pelham must have a new struggle to 
remove every one. He can't let them stay in; because, to 
secure his power, he must bring in Lord Chesterfield, Pitt, 
the chief Patriots, and perhaps some Tories. The King has 
declared that my Lord Granville has his opinion and affec- 
tion— the Prince warmly and openly espouses him. Judge 
how agreeably the two brothers will enjoy their ministry I 
To-morrow the Parliament meets : all in suspense ! every- 
body will be staring at each other ! I believe the war will 
still go on, but a little more Anglicized. For my part, 
I behold all with great tranquillity ; I cannot be sorry for 
Lord Granville, for he certainly sacrificed everything to 
please the King; I cannot be glad for the Pelhams, for 
they sacrifice everything to their own jealousy and am- 
bition. 

Who are mortified are the fair Sophia and Queen Stanis- 
laus '• However, the daughter carries it off heroically ; the 
very night of her fall she went to the Oratorio. I talked 
to her much, and recollected all that had been said to me 
upon the like occasion three years ago ; I succeeded, and 
am invited to her assembly next Tuesday. Tell Uguccioni 
that she still keeps conversaeioni, or he will hang himsel£ 
She had no court, but an ugly sister and the fair old- 
fashioned Duke of Bolton. It put me in mind of a scene 
in Harry YIII, where Queen Catherine appears after her

gentleman-usher. 

My dear child, wM le monde t are you as great a philo- 
Bopher about it as I am? You cannot imagine how 
I entertain myself, especially as all the ignorant flock 
hither, and conclude that my Lord must be minister again. 
Yesterday, three bishops came to do him homage ; and who 
should be one of them but Dr. Thomas ^ the only man 
mitred by Lord Granville ! As I was not at all mortified 
with owr fiill, I 9m only diverted with this imaginary 
restoration. Thejrmtle think how incapable my Lord is of 
business agaiiy^He has this whole summer been troubled 
with bloody ^ater upon the least motion; and to*day 
Banby assured me, that he has a stone in his bladder, which 
he himsftlf believed before ; so now he must never use the 
least exercise, never go into a chariot again ; and if ever to 
Houghton, in a litter. Though this account will grieve 
you, I tell it you, that you may know what to expect ; 
yet it is common for people to live many years in his 
situation^/ 

If yoti are not as detached from everything as I am, you 
will wonder at my tranquillity, to be able to write such 
variety in the midst of hurricanes. It costs me nothing I 
so I shall write on, and tell you an adventure of my own. 
The town has been trying all this winter to beat panto- 
mimes off the stage, very boisterously ; for it is the way 
here to make even an afihir of taste and sense a matter of 
riot and arms. Fleetwood, the master of Druiy Lane, has 
omitted nothing to support them, as they supported his 
house. About ten days ago, he let into the pit great numbers 
of Bear-garden htuiaers (that is the term), to knock down 
everybody that hissed. The pit rallied their forces, and 
drove them out: I was sitting very quietly in the side- 
4 Biflhop of Lincoln. TToIpoIe.— Translated to Saliibiizy, 1761 ; d. 1766. 



62 To Horace Mann [1744 

boxeSy contemplating all thia On a sudden the curtain flew 
up, and discovered the whole stage filled with blackguards, 
armed with bludgeons and dubs, to menace the audience. 
This raised the greatest uproar ; and among the rest, who 
flew into a passion, but your friend the philosopher? In 
short, one of the actors advancing to the front of the stage 
to make an apology for the manager, he had scarce begun 
to say, ' Mr. Fleetwood — ' when your friend, with a most 
audible voice and dignity of anger, called out, ' He is an 
impudent rascal I' The whole pit huzzaed, and repeated 
the words. Only think of my being a popular orator I 
But what was still better, while my shadow of a person 
was dilating to the consistence of a hero, one of the chief 
ringleaders of the riot, coming under the box where I sat, 
and pulling off his hat, said, 'Mr. W., what would you 
please to have us do next?' It is impossible to describe to 
you the confusion into which this apostrophe threw me. 
I sunk down into the box, and have never since ventured 
to set my foot into the playhousa The next night, the 
uproar was repeated with greater violence, and nothing was 
heard but voices calling out, 'Where's Mr. W. ? where*s 
Mr. W. ?' In short, the whole town has been entertained 
with my prowess, and Mr. Conway has given me the name 
of Wat Tyler ; which, I believe, would have stuck by me, 
if this new episode of Lord Oranville had not luckily 
interfered. 

We every minute expect news of the Mediterranean 
engagement ; for, besides your account^ Birtles has written 
the same from Genoa. We expect good news, too, from 
Prince Charles^ who is driving the King of Prussia before 
him'. In the mean time, his wife the Archduchess' is 
dead, which may be a signal loss to him,

I forgot to tell you that, on Friday, Lord Charles Hay^, 
who has more of the parts of an Irishman than of a Scot, 
told my Lady Granyille at the Drawing-room, on her seeing 
so full a courts 4hat people were come out of curiosity.' 
The Speaker* is the happiest of any man in these bustles: 
he says, ' this Parliament has torn two Cayourite ministers 
from the throne.' His conclusion is, that the power of the 
Parliament will in the end be so great, that nobody can be 
minister but their own Speaker. ... *

You will wonder what has become of me : nothing has. 
I know it is above three weeks since I wrote to you ; but 
I will tell you the reason. I have kept a parliamentary 
silenoe, which I must explain to you. Ever since Lord 
Granville went out, all has been in suspense. The leaders 
of the opposition immediately imposed silenoe upon their 
party: everything passed without the least debate — in 
short, aU wen makmg their bargains. One has heard of the 
corruption of courtiers ; but believe me, the impudent prosti- 
tution of Patriots, going to market with their honesty, beats 
it to nothing. Do but think of two hundred men o/^ 
fnoei consummaie virtue setting themselves to sale for three 
weeks ! I have been reprimanded by the wise for saying 
that they all stood like servants at a country statute fair to 
be hired. All this while nothing was certain : one day the

coalition was settled; the next, the treaty broke off: 
I hated to write to you what I might contradict next post 
Besides, in my last letter I remember telUng you that the 
Archduchess was dead; she did not die till a fortnight 
afterwards. 

The result of the whole is this : the Eling, instigated by 
Lord Granyille, has used all his ministry as ill as possible, 
and has with the greatest difficulty been brought to consent 
to the necessary changea Mr. Pelham has had as much 
difficulty to regulate the disposition of places. Numbers of 
lists of the Jmngry have been given in by their cenhAfions ; 
of those, several Tories have refused to accept the proffered 
posts: some, from an impossibility of being re-chosen for 
their Jacobite counties. But upon the whole, it appears 
that their leaders have had very little influence with them ; 
for not above four or five are come into place. The rest 
will stick to opposition. Here is a list of the changes, as 
made last Saturday : 

Duke of Devonshire, Lord Steward, in the room of the Duke 

of Dorset.

with a star, the turned out, and are all of the Granville and 
Bath squadron, except Lord Cholmondeley, (who, too, had 
connected with the former,) and Mr. Philipson. The King 
parted with great regret with Lord Cholmondeley, and 
complains loudly of the force put upon him. The Prince, 
who is fuU as warm as his father for Lord Granville, has 
already turned out Lyttelton,who was his secretary, and Lord 
Halifax', and has named Mr. Drax* and Lord Lichiquin^

Parliament, he was unwilling to accept anjrthing yet : the 
ministiy very rightly insisted that he should ; he asked for 
Secretary at War, knowing it would be refused — and it was. 

By this short sketch, and it is impossible to be more 
explanatory, you will perceive that all is confusion : all 
parties broken to pieces, and the whole opposition by tens 
and by twenties selling themselyes for profit — ^power they 
get none I It is not easy to say where power resides at 
present: it is plain that it resides not in the King; and 
yet he has enough to hinder anybody else from having it. 
His new governors have no interest with him — scarce any 
converse with him. 

The Pretender's son is owned in France as Prince of 
Wales ; the princes of the blood have been to visit him in 
form. The Duchess of Ch&teauroux ^ is poisoned there ; so 
their monarch is as ill-used as our most gracious Kingt

me better than I do you ; and yet if our loves were to be

I received from you last post ; but before I say a word to 
that, I must tell you that I have at last received the cases ; 
three with gesse figures, and one with Lord Conway's gun- 
barrels : I thought there were to be four, besides the guns ; 
but I quite forget^ and did not even remember what they 
were to contain. Am not I in your debt again ? Tell me, 
for you know how careless I am. Look over your list, and 
see whether I have received aU. There were four barrels, 
the Ganymede, the Sleeping Cupid, the model of my statue, 
the Musaeum Florentmumy and some seeds for your brother* 
But alas I though I received them in gross, I did not at all

I shall quite make interest for you : nay, I would speak to 
our new ally, and your old acquaintance, Lord Sandwich, 
to assist in it ; but I could have no hope of getting at his 
ear, for he has put on such a first-rate tie-wig, on his admis- 
sion to the Admiralty board, that nothing without the lungs 
of a boatswain can ever think to penetrate the thickness of 
the curls. I think, however, it does honour to the dignity 
of ministers : when he was but a Patriot, his wig was not of 
half its present gravity. There are no more changes made : 
all is quiet yet ; but next Thursday the Parliament meets 
to decide the complexion of the session. My Lord Chester- 
field goes next week to Holland, and then returns for Ire* 
land. 

The great present disturbance in politics is my Lady 
Granville's assembly ; which I do assure you distresses the 
Pelhams infinitely more than a mysterious meeting of the 
States would, and far more than the abrupt breaking up 
of the Diet at Grodno. She had begun to keep Tuesdays 
before her lord resigned, which now she continues with 
greater zeal. Her house is very fine, she very handsome, 
her lord very agreeable and extraordinary; and yet the 
Duke of Newcastle wonders that people will go thither. 
He mentioned to my father my going there, who laughed 
at him ; CaMs a proper person to trust with such a childish 
jealousy! Harry Fox says, 'Let the Duke of Newcastle 
open his own house, and see if all that come thither are his 
friends.' The fashion now is to send cards to the women, 
and to declare that all men are welcome without being 
asked This is a piece of ease that shocks the prudes of the 
last age. You can't imagine how my Lady Granville shines 
in doing honours ; you know she is made for it. Hy Lord 
has new furnished his mother's apartment for her, and has 
given her a magnificent set of dressing-plate: he is very 
fond of her, and she as fond of his being so.

You will have heard of Marshal Belleisle's being made 
a prisoner at Hanover ; the world will belieye it was not 
by accident. He is sent for over hither: the first thought 
was to confine him to the Tower*, but that is contrary to 
the polUesse of modem war : they talk of sending him to 
Nottingham, where Tallard^ was. I am sure, if he is 
prisoner at large anywhere, we could not have a worse 
inmate! so ambitious and intriguing a man, who was 
author of this whole war, will be no bad general to be ready 
to head the Jacobites on any insurrection.

Hague on his travels, has had an offer to raise a regiment 
for their service, of which he is to be colonel, with power 
of naming all his own officers. It was proposed that it 
should consist of Irish Boman Catholics, but the regency of 
Ireland have represented against that, because they think 
they will all desert to the French. He is now to try it of 
Scotch, which will scarce succeed, unless he will let all 
the officers be of the same nation. An affsiir of this kind 
first raised the late Duke of Argyll, and was the cause of 
his first quarrel with the Duke of Marlborough, who was 
against his coming into our army in the same rank. 

Sir Thomas Hanmer^^ has at last published his Shak-

everybody must be obliged to collate it with other editions. 
One most curiously absurd alteration I have been told.

so ridiculous a creature as the Duke of Newcastle can 
overturn ministries I Don't take me for a partisan of Lord 
Granville's because I despise his rivals ; I am not for adopt- 
ing his measures ; they were wild and dangerous : in his 
single capacity, I think him a great genius ; and without 
having recourse to the Countess's translatable periods, am 
pleased with his company. His frankness charms one when 
it is not necessary to depend upon it ; and his contempt of 
fools is veiy flattering to any one who happens to know 
the present ministry. Their coalition goes on as one should 
expect ; they have the name of having effected it ; and the 
opposition is no longer mentioned : yet there is not a half- 
witted prater in the House but can divide with every new 
minister on his side, except Lyttelton, whenever he pleases. 
They actually do every day bring in popular bills, and on 
the first tinkling of the brass, all the new bees swarm back

to the Tory side of the House. The other day, on the 
Flanders army, Mr. Pitt came down to prevent this: he 
was very ill, but made a very strong and much admired 
speech for coalition, which for that day succeeded, and the 
army was voted with but one negative. But now the

You have heard from your brother the reason of my not 
haying written to you so long. I have been out but twice 
since my father fdl into this illness, which is now near 
a month ; and all that time either continually in his room, 
or obliged to see multitudes of people; for it is most 
wonderful how everybody of all kinds has affected to 
express their concern for him I He has been out of danger 
above this week; but I can't say he mended at all per- 
ceptibly, till these last three days. His spirits are amazing, 
and his constitution more; for Dr. Hulse said honestly 
from the first, that if he recovered, it would be from his 
own strength, not from their art. After the four or five 
first days, in which they gave him the bark, they resigned 
him to the struggles of his own good temperament— and it 
has surmounted I surmounted an explosion and discharge 
of thirty-two pieces of stone, a constant and vast effusion 
of blood for five days, a fever of three weeks, a perpetual 
flux of water, and sixty-nine years, already (one should 
think) worn down with his vast fatigues ! How much more 
he will ever recover, one scarce dare hope about: for us, 
he is greatly recovered ; for himself —

March 4th. 

I had written thus far last week, without being able to 
find a moment to finish. In the midst of all my attendance 
on my Lord and receiving visits, I am forced to go out and 
thank those that have come and sent ; for his recovery is 
now at such a pause, that I fear it is in vain to expect much 
farther amendment* How dismal a prospect for him, with 
the possession of the greatest understanding in the world, 
not the least impaired, to lie without any use of it ! for 
to keep him from pains and restlessness, he takes so much 
opiate, that he is scarce awake four hours of the four-and- 
twenty ; but I will say no more of this. 

Our coalition goes on thrivingly ; but at the expense of 
the old court, who are all discontented, and are likely soon 
to show their resentment The brothers have seen the 
best days of their ministry. The Hanover troops dismissed 
to please the opposition, and taken again with their consent, 
under the cloak of an additional subsidy to the Queen of 
Hungary, who is to pay them. This has set the Patriots 
in so villainous a light, that they will be ill able to support 
a minister who has thrown such an odium on the Whigs, 
after they had so stoutly supported that measure last year, 
and which, after all the clamour, is now universally adopted, 
as you see. If my Lord Granville had any resentment, as 
he seems to have nothing but thirst, sure there is no 
vengeance he might not take! So far from contracting 
any prudence from his &11, he laughs it off every night 
over two or three bottles. The Countess is with child. 
I believe she and the Countess-mother have got it ; for there 
is nothing ridiculous which they have not done and said 
about ii There was a private masquerade lately at the

We are every day nearer confusion. The King is in as 
bad humour as a monarch can be ; he wants to go abroad, 
and is detained by the Mediterranean affiedr * ; the inquiry 
into which was moved by a Major Selwyn, a dirty pensioner, 
half-turned Patriot, by the Court being overstocked with 
votes. This inquiry takes up the whole time of the House 
of Commons, but I don't see what conclusion it can have. 
My confinement has kept me from being there, except the 
first day ; and all I know of what is yet come out is, as 
it was stated by a Scotch member the other day, 'that 
there had been one (Matthews) with a bad head, another 
(Lestock) with a worse hearty and four (the captains of the 
inactive ships) with na heart at alL' Among the numerous 
visits of form that I have received, one was from my Lord 
Sandys : as we two could only converse upon general topics, 
we fell upon this of the Mediterranean, and I made him 
allow, Hhat, to be sure, there is not so bad a court of 
justice in the world as the House of Commons ; and how 
hard it is upon any man to have his cause tried there I ' 

Sir Everard Falkner' is made secretary to the Duke, who 
is not yet gone : I have got Mr. Conway to be one of his 
Aide-de-Camps. Sir Everard has since been offered the Joint 
Postmastership, vacant by Sir John Eyles's ^ death ; but he 
would not quit the Duka It was then proposed to the 
King to give it to the brother : it happened to be a cloudy 
day, and he only answered, * I know who Sir Everard is,

rises. Hy Lcxrd Gnuaville's physicians have ordered him 
to go to the Spa, as, you know, they often send ladies to 
the Bath who are very ill of a want of diTorsion. It will 
scarce be possible for the present ministry to endure this 
jaont. Then they are losing many of their new allies : the 
new Duke of Beaufort*, a most determined and unwavering 
Jacobite, has openly set himself at the head of that party, 
and forced them to vote against the court, and to renounce 
my Lord Oower. My wise cousin, Sir John Phillipps, has 
resigned his place' ; and it is believed that Sir John €k>tton 
will soon resign : but the Bedford, Pitt, Lyttelton, and that 
squadron, stick dose to their places. Pitt has lately resigned 
his Bedchamber to the Prince, which, in friendship to 
Lyttelton, it was expected he would have done long ago. 
They have chosen for this resignation a very apposite passage 
out of Caio : 

'He tossed his arm aloft, and proudly told me 
He would not stay, and perisSi like Sempronius.' 

This was Williams's. Winnington says, 'Pitt is turned 
deist, and has renounced the Son for the Father' — but good 
divines would tell him, that upon this occasion the Father 
would not reward that compliment. 

Hy Lord Coke's match is broken off, upon some coquetry

The town flocks to a new play of Thomson's called 
Tancred and Stgiamunda : it is very dull ; I have read it. 
I cannot bear modem poetry ; these refiners of the purity 
of the stage, and of the incorrectness of English verse, are 
most wofully insipid I had rather have written the most 
absurd lines in Lee, than Leonidas or The Seasons; as 
I had rather be put into the round-house for a wrong-headed 
quarrel, than sup quietly at eight o'clock with my grand- 
mother. There is another of these tame genius's, a Mr« 
Akinside^ who writes Odes: in one he has lately published, 
he says, 'light the tapers, urge the fire.' Had not you 
rather make gods ' jostle in the dark,' than light the candles 
for fear they should break their heads? One Bussel, a 
mimic, has a puppet-show to ridicule operas ; I hear, very 
dull, not to mention its being twenty years too late : it con- 
sists of three acts, with foolish Italian songs burlesqued in 
Italian. 

There is a very good quarrel on foot between two 
duchesses: she of Queensberry sent to invite Lady Emily 
Lenox to a ball : her Grace of Bichmond, who is wonder- 
fully cautious since Lady Caroline's elopement, sent word, 
'she could not determine.' The other sent again the same 
night: the same answer. The Queensberry then sent word, 
that she had made up her company, and desired to be 
excused from having Lady Emily's ; but at the bottom of 
the card wrote, ' Too great a trust' You know how mad 
she is, and how capable of such a stroke. There is no 
declaration of war come out from the other Duchess ; but, 
I believe it will be made a national quarrel of the whole 
illegitimate royal family.

Well, I had aknost forgot to tell you a most extraordinary

three weeks ago, I received a letter by Monsieur Waaner*s ^*

that he has sent me seventy-seven antique gems to sell for 
him, by the way of Paris, not caring it should be known in 
Florence. He will have them sold altogether, and the 
lowest price two thousand pistoles. You know what no- 
acquaintance I had with him. I shall be as £rank as he, 
and not receive them. If I did, they might be lost in 
sending back, and then I must pay his two thousand dogpie

the notice I shall take of it

me great pain by telling me of your fever. My dearest Sir, 
it is terrible to have illness added to your other distresses !

brother will write you all the particulars ; for my part, you 
can't expect I should enter into the details of it. His 
enemies pay him the compliment of saying, * they do believe 
now that he did not plunder the public, as he was accused 
(as ffiey accused him) of doing, he having died in such 
circumstances.' If he had no proofis of his honesty but this, 
I don't think this would be such indisputable authority: 
not leaving immense riches would be scanty evidence of his 
not having acquired them, there happening to be such 
a thing as spending them. It is certain he is dead very 
poor: his debts, with his legacies, which are trifling, 
amount to fifty thousand pounds. His estate, a nominal 
eight thousand a year, much mortgaged. In short, his 
fondness for Houghton has endangered Houghton. If he 
had not so overdone it, he might have left such an estate 
to his family as might have secured the glory of the place 
for many years : another such debt must expose it to sale. 
If he had lived, his unbounded generosity and contempt of 
money would have run him into vast difficulties. However 
irreparable his personal loss may be to his Mends, he 
certainly died critically well for himself: he had lived to 
stand the rudest trials with honour, to see his character 
universally cleared, his enemies brought to infamy for their 
ignorance or villany, and the world iJlowing him to be the 
only man in England fit to be what he had been ; and he 
died at a time when his age and infirmities prevented his 
again undertaking the support of a government which 
engrossed his whole care, and which he foresaw was falling 
into the last confusion. In this I hope his judgement failed I 
His fortune attended him to the last ; for he died of the 
most painful of all distempers, with little or no pain. 

The House of Commons have at last finished their great 
affair, their inquiry into the Mediterranean miscarriage. It 
was carried on with more decency and impartiality than

ever was known in so tumultuous^ popular, and partial 
a court. I can't say it ended so ; for the Tories^ all but 
one single man, Toted against Matthews, whom they have 
not forgiven for lately opposing one of their friends in 
Monmouthshire, and for carrying his election. The greater 
part of the Whigs were for Lestock. This last is a Tory 
great man: his cause^ most unfriended, came before the 
House with all the odium that could be laid on a man 
standing in the light of having betrayed his countiy. His 
merit, I mean his parts, prevailed, and have set him in 
a very advantageous point of view. Harry Fox has gained 
the greatest honour by his assiduity and capacity in this 
affair. Matthews remains in the light of a hot, brave, 
imperious, dull, confused fellow. The question was to 
address the King to appoint a trial, by court-martial, of the 
two admirals and the four coward captaina Matthews's 
friends were for leaving out his name, but, after a very 
long debate, were only 76 to 218. It is generally supposed, 
that the two admirids will be acquitted and the captains 
hanged. By what I can make out, (for you know I have 
been confined, and could not attend the examination,) 
Lestock preferred his own safety to the glory of his country; 
I don't mean cowardly, for he is most unquestionably brave, 
but selfishly. Having to do with a man who, he knew, 
would take the slightest opportunity to ruin him, if he in 
the least transgressed his orders, and knowing that man too 
dull to give right orders, he chose to stick to the letter, when, 
by neglecting it, he might have done the greatest service. 

We hear of great news from Bavaria, of that Elector 
being forced into a neutrality ' ; but it is not confirmed. 

Mr. Legge is made Lord of the Admiralty, and Mr. Philip*

172. To HoBAOE Mank. 

Arlington Stroet, April 29, 1745. 

When you wrote your last of the 6th of this month, you 
was still in hopes about my father. I wish I had received 
your letters on his death, for it is most shocking to have all 
the thoughts opened again upon such a subject ! — it is the 
great disadvantage of a distant correspondence. There was 
a report here a fortnight ago, -of the new Countess^ coming 
over. She could not then have heard it. Can she be so 
mad? Why should she suppose all her shame buried in 
my Lord's grave? or does not she know, has she seen so 
little of the world, as not to be sensible that she will now 
return in a worse light than ever ? A few malicious, who 
would have countenanced her to vex him, would now treat 
her like the rest of the world. It is a private family affair ; 
a husband, a mother, and a son, all party against her, all 
wounded by her conduct^ would be too much to get over 1 

My dear child, you have nothing but misfortunes of your 
friends to lament. You have new subject by the loss of 
poor Mr. Chute's brother*. It really is a great loss! he

was a most risiiig man, and one of the besi-natured and 
most honest that ever lived. If it would not sound 
ridiculously, though, I assure you, I am far from feeling 
it lightly, I would tell you of poor Patapan's death: he 
died about ten days ago. 

This peace with the Elector of Bavaria may produce 
a general one. You have [given] great respite to my 
uneasiness, by telling me that Tuscany seems out of danger. 
We have for these last three days been in great expectation 
of a battle. The French have invested Toumay ; our army 
came up with them last Wednesday, and is certainly little 
inferior, and determined to attack them ; but it is believed 
they are retired : we don't know who commands them ; it is 
said, the Due d'Harcourt. Our good friend, the Count de 
Saxe, is dying* — by Venus, not by Mars. The King goes 
on Friday ; this may make the young Duke more impatient 
to give battle, to have all the honour his own. 

There is no kind of news; the Parliament rises on 
Thursday, and everybody is going out of town, I shall 
only make short excursions in visits ; you know I am not 
fond of the country, and have no call into it now ! My 
brother will not be at Houghton this year ; he shuts it up, 
to enter on new, and there very unknown, economy: he 
has much occasion for it ! Commend me to poor Mr. Chute !

already. We don't allow it to be a victory on the French 
side : but that is just as a woman is not called Mrs. till she 
is married, though she may have had half a dozen natural 
children. In short, we remained upon the field of battle 
three hours; I fear, too many of us remain there still I 
without palliating, it is certainly a heavy stroke. We never 
lost near so many officers. I pity the Duke, for it is almost 
the first battle of consequence that we ever lost By the 
letters arrived to-day, we find that Toumay still holds out. 
There are certainly killed Sir James Campbell*, (General 
Ponsonby', Colonel Carpenter, Colonel Douglas ^ young 
Boss', Colonel Montagu", Oee, Berkeley^, and Kellet

quality in the Guards are wounded. I have had the vast 
fortune to have nobody hurt, for whom I was in the least 
interested. Mr. Conway, in particular, has highly distin- 
guished himself; he and Lord Petersham*, who is slightly 
wounded, are most commended ; though none behaved ill 
but the Dutch horse. There has been but very little 
consternation here: the King minded it so little, that

So the whole hors de combat is above seven thousand three 
hundred. The French own the loss of three thousand; 
I don't believe many more, for it was a most rash and 
desperate perseverance on our side. The Duke behaved 
very bravely and humanely; but this will not have ad* 
vanced the peace. 

However coolly the Duke may have behaved, and coldly 
his father, at least his brother*® has outdone boijur^ He not

May 

Bbotheb, I am sorry you won't let me say. Dear Brother; 
but till you have still farther proved how impossible it 
IB for you to have any affection for me, I will never begin 
my letters as you do — * Sir/ 

Before I enter- upon your letter, I must be so impertinent 
even as to give my elder brother advice, and that is^ the 
next letter you write, to consider whether the person it 
is addressed to, has any dependence upon you, or, which 
I am sure your heart will tell you I have not, any obligation 
to you. If they have neither, they may happen to laugh 
at your style. 

Castle Eising is a Fanml/y Borough. This is your first 
proposition, but not very definite. It is a borough in our 
fiimily, but I never heard that it was parliamentarily 
entailed upon every branch of our family. If it was, how 
came Mr. Churchill to be always chosen there? However, 
before I ever undertake anything again, I will certainly 
examine our genealogical table, and be sure that Lord

Walpole, yourself, and all our eleven first cousins, have 
no mind to the same thing. 

Lard Orjbrffs son ought to he brought in there preferably to 
anybody. Lord Orford's son is but fifteen, and consequently 
incapable of being brought in anywhere these six years. 

Next to him J, and then you. N.B. We are both in 
already, though to be sure you are right in the order of 
succession, which you seem to be perfectly master of. 

Otherwise, as I have long wished it, I should ham spoke to 
my Lord long ago. I spoke to my Lord lately, and have got it 

I always thought he was bound to offer it to some one qf them. 
He does not seem to have been of your opinion. 

To give myself an additional credit and weight in PaHiamenL 
You might have left out c^dUionail. 

How you came never to think of me. For your sake I won't 
answer this. 

Or how you happened to imagine I was not to be consulted. 
I will ask you another question, how you happen to imagine 
it was necessary for me to consult you? Have you ever 
given me any encouragement to consult you in anything? 
How must I consult you? By letter? Tou never would 
see me either at your own house or here ! The authority 
you affect over me is ridiculous ; and for consulting you, 
good God I do you think you ever judge so dispassionately, 
as that any man living would consult you ! 

Whose birth and seniority give me so just and natural 
a pretension. To my fiither's estate before me, to nothing 
else that I know of. 

It is so contemptuous and arrogant a treatment. Those 
words I return you, being full as proper and decent from 
me to you, as from you to me, whose birth, though thank 
Ood not my seniority, is as considerable as yours. 

As to the desirableness of this affiair. Your whole para* 
graph may be very political but is not argumentative. 



1745] To the Hon. Edward Waipok 98 

Bui yimr conditd to me has dhoays been of the aomo land. 
As you are so kind afterwards as to explain what my 
conduct has always been to you, I shall certainly not 
endeavour to refute this passage, but submit myself to your 
own acknowledgments. 

Hie most iMXtfi/M thing in ihe world to have any commerce 
with yoiL I believe it, for I have always seen it, and in , 
vain endeavoured to make it more tolerable to you. 

Tou hanCy I must confess, showed a great diaporition to me 
and to my diildren at aU times. Thank you. 

Good naiurCf which I think and say you possess in a great . 
degree. Dear brother, I wish I could think the same of you. 

It has been mixed wUh what I dare say you canH help and 
never meant offence by. I may, if I please^ believe the same 
of your letter. 

A confidence and presumption of some land of superiority. 
This I must answer a little fuUer, as being the only thing* 
in your letter which you have not confuted yourself. I won't: 
appeal to everybody that has ever seen me with you, but 
to yourselC Lay your hand on your heart, and say, if 1 
I have not all my lifetime to this very instant^ treated 
you with a respect, a deference, an awe, a submission beyond 
what, I say to my shame, I ever showed my father ; and 
you ought to be ashamed too, who made it necessary for 
his peace and for my own, that I should treat you so; 
I never disputed your opinion, I never gave my own till you 
had yours : this was confidence and presumption I 

Tou have assumed to yourself a pre-eminence, from an 
imaginary disparity between us in point of abilities and ehar- 
acter. Who told you so ? not your eyes, but your jealousy, 
ni tell you, brother, the only superiority I ever pretended 
over you, was in my temper. 

AUhough you are a very great man. I leave that expression 
to support itself upon its own force, meaning, and elegance. 



94 To the Hon. Edward Wdpok [1745 

Since the conditions of your friendship and hindness are suc^ 
that I must 'be subject to direct injuries. What those direct 
injuries are, may be collected from what you have said 
above of my constant behaviour to you and your children 
at all times, or still more clearly from the next paragraph, 
wherein you call them, those hinds of hurts that a man feds 
most when they have the face of Mndness, This, by all truth, 
is the only hurt I am ever conscious of having done you. 

Before I take notice of the conclusion of your letter, 
I must mention a few other things. 

In your letter to our brother, who has still less deserved 
your monstrous behaviour to him, having always had that 
affection for you, which I was always desirous of having, 
you tell him he gives away his interest, and in the same 
letter are for recommending a friend of yours. Whatever 
your injustice may make you think of me and my friends, 
neither my brother Orford, nor I hope any man else, thinks his 
interest in worse hands, when given at my suit, than at yours. 
Tou tell him, too, your honour is concerned in this — 'tis 
a strange point of honour you have always laid down to 
yourself of opposing everything I wish. Tis your own fault 
that I rake up your wrongs with me. Because I was always 
silent, did you imagine I was always ignorant? In my 
mother's lifetime, you accused me of fomenting her anger 
against you. The instant she died, did I not bring you 
all my letters to her which she had kept ; in never in 
any one of which was your name mentioned, but to persuade 
her to continue that love to you, which your behaviour has 
always laboured to extinguish in the hearts of all your 
relations. As to my father, I well know how ill you 
always used him on my account Tour writing against 
Dr. Hiddleton, who came to make me a visit at Houghton 
of two days, is one instance among many. Your converting 
all the jealousy you used to have of Lady Mary, into a 



1746] To the Han. Edward WaJpole 95 

friendship with her, to prevent her loying me, is another. 
I only touch on these. Ejiow, brother, that you never 
came where my &ther was, that I did not beg and beseech 
him never to take notice of me before you. This I have 
living witnesses to prove. For your transports of jealousy 
about my speaking in Parliament, I will say nothing, but 
this—Was it reasonable I should be silent there, because 
you had an ambition of making a figure I Oh I brother, 
so far from having that self-conceit you attribute to me, 
all my family and acquaintance know, that no man has a 
greater opinion of your parts ; no man has commended you 
more. I have always said, all the world would love you 
if you would let them ; but for your love to your father, 
I have always declared, that of all his children I was 
convinced you loved him the best What have you said of 
me behind my back ? 

I have done, brother, though by this example believe 
I have not said the hardest things that I could to you. 

Tou conclude with disclaiming all friendship with, and 
relation to, me. After the vain pains I have taken to 
deserve that friendship, and the regard I have in vain had 
to that relation, I don't know whether I ought not readily 
to embrace this entire rupture. However, as I think you 
are good-natured when you are cool, and must have repented 
the unmerited ill-treatment, I can forgive you, and for this 
last time offer you my friendship ; at the same time assuring 
you that I despise your anger, and if you persist in dis- 
claiming my brotherhood, the only cover that you have for 
your abuse, I miist tell you that you shall treat me like 

a gentleman. 

Tours or not, as you please, 

Hob. Walfole. 

P.S. If I have entered upon more points than your letter 
led me to, it was from my heart being full of resentment 



96 To George Montagu [1745 

for a long series of your injustice to me, and from being 
glad to take the opportunity of making you sensible of it by 
this expostulation, which I have never been able to do by 
the most submissive behaviour, and by every instance I had 
in my power of showing you, how much I wished you 
would be my firiend. But that is past ; if you have anything 
farther to say to me, it must be in person, for I will not 
read any more such letters^ nor will I be affronted. 



176. To THE Hon. Edwabd WALPOiiE. 

DbaR BboTHEB, May 17, 1746. 

You have used me very ill without any provocation or 
any pretence. I have always made it my study to deserve 
your friendship, as you yourself own, and by a submission 
which I did not owe you. For consulting you in what you 
had nothing to do, I certainly did not, nor ever will, while 
you profess so much aversion for me. I am still ready to 
live with you upon any terms of friendship and equality ; 
but I don*t mind your anger, which can only hurt yourself, 
when you come to reflect with what strange passion you 
have treated me, who have always loved you, have always 
tried to please you, have always spoken of you with regard, 
and who will yet be, if you will let me,

Our army is still at Lessines, waiting for recruits from

gives me pleasure. I wish I could say the same to good

My fears for Tuscany are again awakened : the wonderful 
march which the Spanish Queen has made Monsieur de 
Gage * take, may probably end in his turning short to the 
left ; for his route to Oenoa will be full as difficult as what 
he has already passed* I watch eagerly every article from 
Italy, at a time when nobody will read a paragraph but 
from the army in Flanders. 

I am diverted with my Lady's account of the great riches 
that are now coming to her. She has had so many foolish 
golden visions, that I should think even the Florentines 
would not be the dupes of any more. As for her mourning, 
she may save it, if she expects to have it notified. Don't 
you remember my Lady Pomfret's having a piece of 
economy of that sort, when she would not know that the 
Emperor was dead, because my Lord Chamberlain had not 
notified it to her? 

I have a good story to tell you of Lord Bath, whose name 
you have not heard very lately; have you? He owed 
a tradesman eight hundred pounds, and would never pay 
him : the man determined to persecute him till he did ; and 
one morning followed him to Lord Winchilsea's, and sent 
up word that he wanted to speak with him. Lord Bath 
came down, and said, ' Fellow, what do you want with me ! ' 
— 'My money,' said the man, as loud as ever he could bawl, 
before all the servants. He bade him come the next 
morning, and then would not see him. The next Sunday 
the man followed him to church, and got into the next pew : 
he leaned over, and said, ' My money ; give me my money I ' 
My lord went to the end of the pew ; the man too : ' Give 
me my money ! ' The sermon was on avarice, and the text, 
' Cursed are they that heap up riches.' The man groaned

Dear Gboboe, Arlington street. May 26, 1746. 

I don't write to you now so much to answer your letter 
as to promote your diversion, which I am as much obliged 
to you for consulting me about, at least as much as about an 
affair of honour, or your marriage, or any other important 
transaction, any one of which you might possibly dislike 
more than diverting yoursel£ For my part, I shall give 
you my advice on this point with as much reflection as 
I should, if it were necessary for me, like a true friend, to 
counsel you to displease yourself. 

Tou propose making a visit at Englefield Green S and ask 
me, if I think it right ? Extremely so. I have heard 'tis 
a very pretty place. Tou love a jaunt ; have a pretty chaise, 
I believe, and, I dare swear, very easy ; in all probability, 
you will have a fine evening too ; and, added to all this, the 
gentleman you would go to see is very agreeable and good- 
humoured. He has some very pretty children, and a sensible, 
learned man that lives with him, one Dr. Thirlby *, whom 
I believe you know. The master of the house plays ex- 
tremely well on the bass-viol, and has generally other 
musical people with him. He knows a good deal of the 
private history of a late ministry ; and, my dear George,

you love memoires. — Indeed, as to personal acquaintance 
with any of the court beauties, I can't say you will find 
your account in him ; but, to make amends, he is perfectly 
master of all the quarrels that have been fashionably on 
foot about Handel, and can give you a very perfect account 
of all the modem rival paintera In short, you may pass 
a very agreeable day with him ; and if he does but take to 
you, as I can't doubt, who know you both, you will contract 
a great friendship with him, which he will preserve with 
the greatest warmth and partialiiy. 

In short, I can think of no reason in the world against 
your going there but one: do you know his .youngest 
brother? If you happen to be so unlucky, I can't flatter 
you so &r as to advise you to make him a visit, for there is 
nothing in the world the Baron of Englefield has such an 
aversion for as for his brother, and your most sincere friend,

My DEAB HaBBY, Arlington Street, May 27, 1746. 

As gloriously as you have set out, yet I despair of seeing 
you a perfect hero I Tou have none of the charming 
violences that are so essential to that character. You write 
as cooUy, after behaving well in a battle, as you fought in it. 
Can your friends flatter themselves with seeing you, one day 
or other, be the death of thousands, when you wish for peace 
in three weeks after your first engagement \ and laugh at 
the ambition of those men who have given you this oppor- 
tunity of distinguishing yourself? With the person of an

102 To the Hon. Henry Seymour Conway [1745 

Orondates', and the courage, you have all the compassion, 
the reason, and the reflection of one that never read a 
romance. Can one ever hope you will make a figure, when 
you only fight because it was right you should, and not 
because you hated the French or loved destroying mankind ? 
This is so un-English, or so un-heroic, that I despair of you ! 

Thank Heaven, you have one spice of madness! Tour 
admiration of your master ' leaves me a glimmering of hope, 
that you will not be always so unreasonably reasonable. Do 
you remember the Humorous Lieutenant^ in one of Beau- 
mont and Fletcher^s plays, that is in love with the king? 
Indeed, your master is not behind-hand with you ; you seem 
to have agreed to pu£F one another. 

If you are all acting up to the strictest rules of war and 
chivalry in Flanders, we are not less scrupulous on this side 
the water in fulfilling all the duties of the same order. The 
day the young volunteer ^ departed for the army (unluckily, 
indeed, it was after the battle), his tender mother Sisy- 
gambis°, and the beautiful Statira*, a lady formerly known 
in your history by the name of Arfcemisia, from her cutting 
off her hair on your absence, were so afflicted and so in- 
separable, that they made a party together to Mr. Graham's "^ 
(you may read lapis^ if you please) to be blooded. It was 
settled that this was a more precious way of expressing 
concern than shaving the head, which has been known to be 
attended with false locks the next day. 

For the other princess you wot of, who is not entirely so 
tall as the former, nor so evidently descended from a line of 
monarchs — I don't hear her talk of retiring. At present, 
she is employed in buying up all the nosegays in Govent

going away. The poor Signorormadre is in a terrible fright, 
and will not come to town till her daughter is gone again, 
which all advices agree will be soon. Another letter is to 
my Lady Townshend, telling her, 'that, as she knows her 
Ladyship's way of thinking, she does not fear the continuance 
of her friendship.' Another, a long one, to my Lord Chester- 
field ; another to Lady Isabella Scot ', an old friend of hers ; 
and one to Lady Pomfret This last says, that she hears 
from Uguccioni, my Lady O. will stay here very little time, 
having taken a house at Florence for three years. She is 
to come to my Lady Denbigh'. My brother is extremely 
obliged to you for all your notices about her, though he is 
very indifferent about her motions. If she happens to 
choose law (though on what foot no mortal can guess), he is 
prepared ; having, from the first hint of her journey, fee'd 
every one of the considerable lawyers. In short, this jaunt 
is as simple as all the rest of her actions have been hardy. 
Nobody wonders at her bringing no English servants with 
her — they know, and consequently might tell too much. 

I feel excessively for you, my dear child, on the loss of

The citadel of Toumay is gone ; our affairs go ill. Your 
brother Charles of Lorraine has lost a great battle grossly' ! 
He was constantly drunk, and had no kind of intelligence. 
Now he acts from his own head, his head turns out a very 
bad one. I don't know, indeed, what they can say in 
defence of the great general to whom we have just given the 
Gkurtar, the Duke of Saze Weissenfels; he is not of so 
serene a house but that he might have known something of 
the motions of the Prussians. Last night we heard that the 
Hungarian insurgents had cut to pieces two Prussian regi- 
ments. The King of Prussia and Prince Charles are so 
near, that we every day expect news of another battle. We 
don't know yet what is to be the next step in Flanders. 
Lord Cobham has got Churchill's^ regiment, and Lord 
Dunmore his government of Plymouth. At the Prince's 
court there is a great revolution : he, or rather Lord Gran- 
ville, or perhaps the Princess (who, I firmly believe, by all 
her quiet sense, will turn out a Caroline), have at last got 
rid of Lady Archibald *, who was strongly attached to the 
coalition. They have civiUy asked her, and grossly forced 
her to ask civilly to go away, which she has done, with 
a pension of twelve hundred a year. Lady Middlesex' is 
Mistress of the Robes : she lives with them perpetually, and 
sits up till five in the morning at their suppers. Don't 
mistake I not for her person, which is wondrous plain and 
little : the town says it is for her friend Miss Granville, one of 
the Maids of Honour ; but at least yet, that is only scandal.

to yoiL It is the charmingest place by nature, and the 
most trampery by art^ that ever I saw. The house stands 
on a high hill, on an arm of the sea, which winds itself 
before two sides of the house. On the right and left, at the 
very foot of this hill, lie two towns ; the one of market 
quality, and the other with a wharf where ships come up. 
This last was to have a church, but by a lucky want of 
religion in the inhabitants, who would not contribute to 
building a steeple, it remains an absolute antique temple 
with a portico, on the very strand. Gross this arm of 
the sea, you see six churches and charming woody hills in 
Suffolk. All this parent Nature did for this place ; but its 
godfathers and godmothers, I believe, promised it should 
renounce all the pomps and vanities of this world, for they 
have patched up a square house, full of windows, low rooms, 
and thin walls ; piled up walls wherever there was a glimpse 
of prospect ; planted avenues that go nowhere, and dug , 
fishponds where there should be avenue& We had very 
bad weather the whole time I was there; but however 
I rode about and sailed, not having the same apprehensions

If it were not for that one slight inconvenience, that 
I should probably be dead now, I should have liked much 
better to have lived in the last war than in this ; I mean 
as to the pleasantness of writing letters. Two or three 
battles won, two or three towns taken, in a summer were 
pretty objects to keep up the liveliness of a correspondence.

the tables are turned. After having learnt to spell out of 
the reigns of Edward the Third and Harry the Fifth, and 
begun lisping with Agincourt and Gressy, one uses one's 
self but awkwardly to the sounds of Toumay and Fontenoy. 
I don't like foreseeing the time so near, when all the young 
orators in Parliament wiU be haranguing out of Demosthenes 
upon the imminent danger we are in from the overgrown 
power of King Philip. As becoming as all that public 
spirit will be, which to be sure will now come forth, I can't 
but think we were at least as happy and as great when all 
the young Pitts and Lytteltons were pelting oratory at 
my father for rolling out a twenty years' peace, and not 
envying the trophies which he passed by every day in 
Westminster HalL But one must not ropine ; rather reflect 
on the glories which they have drove the nation headlong 
into. One must think all our distresses and dangers well 
laid out, when they have purchased us Glover's^ oration for 
the merchants, the Admiralty for the Duke of Bedford, and 
the reversion of Secretary at War for Pitt, which he will 
certainly have, unless the French ELing should happen to 
have the nomination ; and then I fear, as much obliged 
as that court is to my Lord Gobham and his nephews, they 
would be so partial as to prefer some illiterate nephew of 
Cardinal Tencin's, who never heard of Leonidaa or the 
Hanover troops. 

With all these reflections, as I love to make myself easy, 
especially politically, I comfort myself with what St £vre- 
mond a (favourite philosopher of mine, for he thought what 
he liked, not liked what he thought) said in defence of 
Cardinal Mazarin, when he was reproached with neglecting 
the good of the kingdom that he might engross the riches 
of it : ' Well, let him get all the riches, and then he will 
think of the good of the kingdom, for it will all be his own.'

Let the French but have England, and they won't want to 
conquer it. We may poBsibly contract the French spirit of 
being supremely content with the glory.of our monarch, and 
then — why then it will be the first time we ever were 
contented yet. We hear of nothing but your retiring \ and 
of Dutch treachery : in short, 'tis an ugly scene I 

I know of no home news but the commencement of the 
Gaming Act ', for which they are to put up a scutcheon at 
White's for the death of play ; and the death of Winnington's 
wife, which maybe an unlucky event formy Lady Townshend. 
As he has no children, he will certainly marry again ; and 
who will give him their daughter, unless he breaks off that 
affair, which I believe he will now very willingly make 
a marriage article ? We want him to take Lady Charlotte 
Fermor. She was always his beauty, and has so many 
charming qualities, that she would make anybody happy. 
He will make a good husband ; for he is excessively good- 
natured, and was much better to that strange wife than he 
cared to own. 

You wondered at my journey to Houghton ; now wonder 
more, for I am going to Mount Edgecumbe. Now my

All yesterday we were in the utmost consternation I an 
express came the night before from Ostend with an account 
of the French army in Flanders having seused Ghent and 
Bruges ^ cut off a detachment of four thousand men, sur- 
rounded our army, who must be cut to pieces or surrender 
themselves prisoners, and that the Duke was gone to the 
Hague^ but that the Dutch had signed a neutrality. Tou 
will allow that here was ample subject for confusion I To- 
day we are a little relieved by finding that we have lost but 
five hundred men instead of four thousand, and that our 
army, which is inferior by half to theirs, is safe behind 
a river. With this came the news of the Oreat Duke's 
victory over the Prince of Gonti': he has killed fifteen 
thousand, and taken six thousand prisoners. Here is already 
a third great battle this summer ! But Flanders is gone I

the Peace of Utrecht^ though we have. Beaides^ how could 
they rely on any negotiation with a people whose politics 
alter so often as ours ? Or why were we to &ncy that my 
Lord Chesterfield's parts would have more weight than my 
uncle had, whom, ridiculous as he was, they had never 
known to take a trip to Avignon to confer with the Duke of 
Ormond ? 

Our communication with the army is cut off through 
Flanders ; and we are in great pain for Ostend : the forti- 
fications are all out of repair. Upon Marshal Wade's 
reiterated remonstrances, we did cast thirty cannon and four 
mortars for it — and then the economic ministry would not 
send them. 'What! fortify the Queen of Hungary's 
towns ? there will be no end of that.' As if Ostend was 
of no more consequence to us, than lions or Namur 1 Two 
more battalions are ordered over immediately ; and the old 
pensioners of Chelsea College are to mount guard at home I 
Flourishing in a peace of twenty years, we were told that 
we were trampled upon by Spain and France. Haughiy 
nations, like those, who can trample upon an enemy country, 
do not use to leave it in such wealth and happiness as we 
enjoyed ; but when the Duke of Marlborough's old victorious 
veterans are dug out of their colleges and repose, to guard 
the King's palace, and to keep up the show of an army 
which we have buried in America, or in a manner lost 
in Flanders, we shall soon know the real feel of being 
trampled upon ! In this crisis, you will hear often from 
me ; for I will leave you in no anxious uncertainiy from 
which I can free you.

the chief concern of the Great Duke, (next to his own 
person,) in a battle. Our army is retreated beyond Brussels ; 
the French gather laurels and towns, and prisoners, as one 
would a nosegay. In the mean time you are bullying the 
King of Naples^ in the person of the English fleet ; and 
I think may possibly be doing so for two months after that 
very fleet belongs to the King of France ; as astrologers tell 
one that we should see stars shine for I don't know how 
long after they were annihilated. But I like your spirit ; 
keep it up ! Millamant, in The Way of the World, tells 
Mirabel, that she will be solicited to the very last ; nay, and 
afterwards. Hereplies, 'What? after the last !' 

I am in great pain about your arrears : it is a bad season 
for obtaining payment. In the best times^ they make 
a custom of paying foreign ministers ill; which may be 
very politic, when they send men of too great fortunes 
abroad, in order to lessen them : but, my dear child, Gk>d

I haye some extremely pretty dogs of King Charles's 
breed, if I knew how to convey them to you : indeed they 
are not Patapans. I can't tell how they would like travelling 
into Italy, when there is a prospect of the rest of their race 
returning from thence : besides, you must certify me that 
none of them shall ever be married below themselves ; for 
since the affidr of Lady Caroline Fox, one durst not hazard 
the Duke of Bichmond's resentment even about a dog and 
bitch of that breed. 

Lord Lempster is taken prisoner in the affair of the

that the Abb^ Niccolini and the eldest Pandolfini are coming 
to England : is it true ? I shall be very glad to be civil to 
them, especially to the latter, who, you know, was one 
of my friends. 

My Lady Orford is at Hanoyer, most graciously receiyed 
by 'the Father of all his people.' It puts me in mind of 
that text of Scripture, ' for Qod is not the God of the dead, 
but of the living.' In the papers of yesterday was this 
paragraph : ' Lady 0., who has spent several years in Italy, 
arrived here (Hanover) the 3rd, on her return to England, 
and was graciously received by his Majesiy.' Lady Denbigh 
is gone into the country; so I don't know where she 
is to lodge — perhaps at St. James's, out of regard to my 
M|l^s memory. 
>^Trust me, you escaped well in Pigwiggin's not accepting 
your invitation of living with you: you must have aired 
your house, as Lady Pomfret was forced to air Lady Mary 
Wortley's bedchamber. He has a most unfortunate breath : 
so has the Princess his sister. When I was at their country- 
house, I used to sit in the library and turn over books of 
prints : out of good-breeding they would not quit me ; nay, 
would look over the prints with me. A whiff would come 
from the east, and I turned short to the west, whence the 
Princess would puff me back with another gale full as richly 
perfumed as her brother's. A^ieu I

picked up by three or four hundred at a time. In short, we 
must step out of the high panUn^fles that were made by 
those cunning shoemakers at Poitiers and Bamillies, and go 
clumping about perhaps in wooden ones. My Lady Henrey, 
who you know dotes upon everything French, is charmed 
with the hopes of these new shoes^ and has abeady bespoke 
herself a pair of pigeon wood. How did the tapestry at 
Blenheim look ? Did it glow with victory, or did all our 
glories look overcast? 

I remember a very admired sentence in one of my Lord 
Chesterfield's speeches, when he was haranguing for this 
war — with a most rhetorical transition, he turned to the 
tapestry in the House of Lords ^, and said, with a sigh, he 
feared there were no historical looms at work now I — Indeed, 
we have reason to bless the good Patriots, who have been for 
^nploying our manufactures so historically ! The Oountess 
of that wise Earl, with whose two expressive words I began 
this letter, says, she is very happy now that my Lord had 
never a place upon the coalition, for then all this bad situa- 
tion of our affidrs would have been laid upon him ! 

Now I have been talking of remarkable periods in our 
annals, I must tell you what my Lord Baltimore thinks 
one: he said to the Prince t'other day, 'Sir, your Boyal 
Highness's marriage will be an area in English history.' 

If it were not for the life that is put into the town now 
and then by very bad news from abroad, one should be quite 
stupefied. There is nobody left but two or three solitary 
regents; and they are always whisking backwards and 
forwards to their villas; and about a dozen antediluvian 
dowagers, whose carcases have miraculously resisted the

the same disturbances here that were at your other house in ;

188. To Horace Mann. 

July 16, 1746. 

You will be suq>ri8ed at another from me so soon, when 
I wrote to you but four days ago. This is not with any 
news, but upon a private affiur. You have never said any- 
thing to me about the extraordinary procedure of Marquis 
Biocardi, of which I wrote you word. Indeed, as his letter 
came just upon my father's death, I had foigot it too ; so 
much so, that I have lost the catalogue which he sent me. 
Well, the other day I received his cargo. Now, my dear 
child, I don't write to him upon it, because, as he sent the 
things without asking my leave, I am determined never to 
acknowledge the receipt of them, because I will in no manner 
be liable to pay for them if they are lost, which I think highly 
probable; and as I have lost the catalogue, I cannot tell 
whether I have received all or not. 

I beg you will say just what follows to him. That I am 
extremely amazed he should think of employing me to sell 
his goods for him, especially without asking my consent: 
that an English gentleman, just come from France, has 
brought me a box of things, of which he himself had no 
account ; nor is there any letter or catalogue with them : 
that I suppose they may be the Marquis's collection, but 
that I have lost the catalogue, and consequently cannot tell 
whether I have received all or not, nor whether they are 
his : that as they came in so blind a manner, and have been 
opened at several custom-houses, I will not be answerable, 
especially having never given my consent to receive them, 
and having opened the box ignorantly, without knowing the 
contents: that when I did open it, I concluded it came from 
Florence, having often refused to buy most of the things, 
which had long lain upon the jeweller's hands on the Old 



1745] To Horace Mann 119 

Bridge S and which are very improper for sale here, as all 
the English for some years have seen them, and not thought 
them worth purchasing : that I remember in the catalogue 
the price for the whole was fixed at two thousand pistoles ; 
that they are full as much worth two-and-twenty thousand ; 
and that I have been laughed at by people to whom I have 
showed them for naming so extravagant a price : that nobody 
living would think of buying all together: that for myself, 
I have entirely left off making any collection ; and if I had 
not, would not buy things dear now which I have formerly 
refused at much lower prices. That, after all, though I can- 
not think myself at all well used by Marquis Biccardi, either 
in sending me the things, in the price he has fixed on them, 
or in the things themselves, which to my knowledge he has 
picked up from the shops on the Old Bridge, and were no 
family collection, yet, as I received so many civilities at 
Florence from the nobility, and in particular from his wife, 
Madame Biccardi, if he will let me do anything that is 
practicable, I will sell what I can for him. That if he will 
send me a new and distinct catalogue, with the price of each 
pieoe^ and a price considerably less than what he has set 
upon the whole, I will endeavour to dispose of what I can 
for him. But as most of them are very indifferent, and the 
total value most unreasonable, I absolutely will not under- 
take the sale of them upon any other terms, but will pack 
them up, and send them away to Leghorn by the fiist ship 
that saHs ; for as we are at war with France, I cannot send 
them that way, nor will I trouble any gentleman to carry 
them, as he might think himself liable to make them good if 
they met with any accident ; nor will I answer for them by 
whatever way they go, as I did not consent to receive them, 
nor am sure that I have received the Marquis's collection. 
My dear Sir, translate this very distinctly for him, for he 



120 To Horace Mmn [1745 

neyer shall receive any other notice from me ; nor will I give 
them up to Waaner or Pucci ■, or anybody elae, though he 
should send me an order for it ; for nobody saw me open 
them, nor shall anybody be able to say I had them, by 
receiving them from me. In short I think I cannot be too 
cautious in such a negotiation. If a man wiU send me 
things to the value of two thousand pistoles, whether they 
are really worth it or not, he shall take his chance for losing 
them, and shall certainly never come upon me for them. 
He must absolutely take his choice, of selling them at a 
proper price and separately, or of having them directly sent 
back by sea ; for whether he consents to either or not, I shall 
certainly proceed in my resolution about them the very 
instant I receive an answer from you ; for the sooner I am 
dear of them the better. If he will let me sell them without 
setting a price, he may depend upon my taking the best 
method for his service ; though really, my dear child, it will 
be for my own honour, not for his sake, who has treated me 
- ^i^ so impertinently. I am sorry to give you this trouble, but 
,^0 ' judge how much the fool gives me ! Adieu !

It is a pain to me to write to you, when all I can tell you

anywhere, where I should have my thoughts detached in 
some degree by distance and by length of time from England !

The French make no seeret of iheir intending to come 
hither ; the letters ftom Holland speak of it as a notoriety. 
Their Mediterranean fleet is oome to Bochfort, and they 
have another at Brest. Their immediate design is to attack 
our army, the very lessening which will be victory for them. 
Our six hundred men, which have lain cooped up in the 
river till they had contracted diseases, are at last gone to 
Ostend. Of all this our notable ministry still make a secret : 
one cannot learn the least particulars from them. This 
anxiety for my friends in the aimy, this uncertainty about 
ourselves, if it can be caUed uncertain that we are undone, 
and the provoking foUy that one sees prevail, have deter- 
mined me to go to the Hagua I shall at least hear sooner* 
from the army, and shall there know better what is likely 
to happen here. The moment the crisis is come I shall 
return hither, which I can do from Helvoetsluys in twelve 
hours. At all events, I shall certainly not stay there above 
a month or six weeks : it thickens too fast for something 
important not to happen by that time. 

You may judge of our situation by the conversation of 
Marshal Belleisle : he has said for some time, that he saw 
we were so little capable of making any defence, that he 
would engagp, with five thousand scullions of the French 
army, to conquer England — yet, just now, they choose to 
release him ! he goes away in a week \ When he was told 
of the taking Gape Breton *, he said, 'he could believe that, 
because the ministry had no hand in it/ We are making

Deab Geobge, 

I cannot help thinking you laugh at me when you say 
such very civil things of my letters, and jet, coming from 
you, I would fain not have it all fiattery : 

So much the more, as, from a little elf, 

I've had a high opinion of myself. 

Though sickly, slender, and not large of limb. 

With this modest prepossession, you may be sure I like 
to have you commend me, whom, after I have done with 
myself, I admire of all men living. — I only beg that you 
will commend me no more : it is very ruinous, and praise, 
like other debts, ceases to be due on being paid — one comfort 
indeed is, that it is as seldom paid as other debts. 

I have been very fortunate lately; have met with an

your sake, I wish I could have told you sooner, that there is 
in Belleisle's suite the Abb4 Perrin *, who published Madame 
S^vigny's letters^ and who has the originals in his hands. 
How one should have liked to have known him I The 
Marshal was privately in London last Friday — he is enter-

don't you believe it was to settle the binding the scarlet thread

possess it? I don't at all wonder at any shrewd observations 
the Marshal has made on our situation— the bringing him 
here at all, the sending him away now, in short, ttie whole 
series of our conduct convinces me, that we shall soon see as 
silent a change as that in The SehearsaH, of King Usher 
and King Physician. It may well be so, when the dis- 
position of the drama is in the hands of the Duke of

I would not for the world be so un-English as to do other- 
wise. I am persuaded that when Count Saxe, with ten 
thousand men, is within a day's march of London, people 
will be hiring windows at Charing Cross and Cheapside to 
see them pass by. Tis our characteristic to take dangers

I go to-morrow to Mount Edgecumbe. I don't think it

I met the revolution.' 

My Lady O. is set out for Hanover : her gracious sovereign

me this letter, which you will be so good as to send to

that we shall very soon be fit to kill 

Your brother has this moment brought me a letter from 
you, full of your good-natured concern for the Genoese. 
I have not time to write you anything but short paragraphs, 
as I am in the act of writing all my letters and doing my 
business before my journey. I can say no more now about 
the affair of your secretary. Poor Mrs. Gibbeme has been 
here this morning almost in fits about her son. She brought

silly boy's, who is ruined if he follows his own whims, and 
for your own sake, who will have so much trouble to get 
and form another, I must try to prevent your parting. I am 
persuaded, that neither the fatigue of writing, nor the in- 
clination of going to sea, are the boy's true motives. They 
are, the smallness of his allowance, and his aversion to 
waiting at table. For the first, the poor woman does not 
expect that you should put yourself to any inconvenience ;

I must tell you, my dear child, fairly, that in goodness to

be an insuperable obstacle to him that he is with you in the

stay virith you upon the terms I propose, I am sure, from 
the trouble it will save yourself, and the ruin from which 
it will save him, you will yield to this request; which

dissolves the imion between England and Scotland* But all 
this is not the worst ! Notice came yesterday, that there are 
ten thousand men, thirty transports, and ten men-of-war at 
Dunkirk. Against this force we have — I don't know what — 
scarce fears! Three thousand Dutch we hope are by this 
time landed in Scotland ; three more are coming hither.

a Serjeant of Cope's, with twelve men, put to flight two 
hundred, on killing only six or seven. Two hundred of the 
Monroe clan have joined our forces. Spirit seems to rise in 
London, though not in the proportion it ought ; and then 
the person* most concerned does everything to check its 
progress: when the ministers propose anything with regard 
to the Bebellion, he cries, ' Pho ! don't talk to me of that 
stuff.' Lord Granville has persuaded him that it is of no 
consequence. Mr. Pelham talks every day of resigning : he 
certainly will as soon as this is got over! — ^if it is got over. 
So, at least we shall see a restoration of Queen Sophia ^ 
She has laid-in of a girl ; though she had all the pretty boys 
in town brought to her for patterns. 

The young Chevalier has set a reward on the King's head : 
we are told that his brother is set out for Ireland. How- 
ever, there is hitherto little countenance given to the under- 
taking by France or Spain. It seems an effort of despair 
and weariness of the manner in which he has been kept in 
France. On the grenadiers' caps is written 'a grave or 
a throne.' He stayed some time at the Buke of Athol's', 
whither old Marquis TuUibardine ' sent to bespeak dinner ; 
and has since sent his brother word, that he likes the 
alterations made there. The Pretender found pine-apples 
there, the first he ever tasted. Mr. Breton ''y a great favourite 
of the Southern Prince of Wales, went the other day to visit 
the Duchess of Athol*, and happened not to know that she 
is x>arted from her husband : he asked how the Duke did ?

comes and puUs the boy by the sleeve ; ' Prence, here is 
another mon taken I ' then with all the dignity in the world, 
the boy hopes nobody was killed in the action ! Lord Bath 
has made a piece of a ballad, the Duke of Newcastle's speech 
to the Begency ; I have heard but these two lines of it : 

'Pray consider, my Lords, how disastrous a thing. 
To have two Prince of Wales's and never a King ! ' 

The merchants are very zealous, and are opening a great 
subscription for raising troops. The other day, at the City 
meeting to draw up the address, Alderman Heathcote* pro- 
posed a petition for a redress of grievances, but not one man 
seconded him. In the midst of all this, no Parliament is 
called ! The ministers say they have nothing ready to offer ; 
but they have nothing to notify ! 

I must tell you a ridiculous accident: when the magis- 
trates of Edinburgh were searching houses for arms, they 
came to Mr. Haule's ^^, brother of Lord Panmure, and a great 
friend of the Duke of Argyll. The maid would not let them 
go into one room, which was locked, and, as she said, full of 
arms. They now thought they had found what they looked I 
for, and had the door broke open — where they found an 
ample collection of coats of arms ! 

The deputy governor ^^ of Edinburgh Castle has threatened 
the magistrates to beat their town about their ears, if they 
admit the rebels. Perth is twenty-four miles from Edin- 
burgh, so we must soon know whether they will go thither ; 
or leave it, and come into England. We have great hopes 
that the Highlanders will not follow him so far. Very few

I should not be glad. However, do come soon, if you should

smugged up a closet or a dressing-room, I have always 
warning given me that my lease is out Four years ago 
I was mightily at my ease in Downing Street, and then the 
good woman, Sandys, took my lodgings over my head, and 
was in such a hurry to junket her neighbours, that I had 
scarce time allowed me to wrap up my old china in a little 
hay. Now comes the Pretender's boy, and promises all my

134 To Horace Mann [1745 

that an express came last night with an account of their 
being at Edinburgh to the number of five thousand ^ This 
sounds greaty to have walked through a kingdom, and taken 
possession of the capital ! But this capital is an open town ; 
and the Castle impregnable, and in our possession. There 
never was so extraordinary a sort of rebellion I One can't 
tell what assurances of suj^rt they may have from the 
Jacobites in England, or from the French* ; but nothing of 
either sort has yet appeared — and if there does not, never 
was so desperate an enterprise. One can hardly believe 
that the English are more disa£fected than the Scotch ; and 
among the latter, no persons of property have joined them : 
both nations seem to profess a neutrality. Their money is 
all gone, and they subsist merely by levying contributions. 
But, sure, banditti can never conquer a kingdom I On the 
other hand, what cannot any number of men do, who meet 
no opposition ? They have hitherto taken no place but open 
towns, nor have they any artillery for a siege but one- 
pounders. Three battalions of Dutch are landed at Gravesend, 
and are ordered to Lancashire: we expect every moment to 
hear that the rest are got to Scotland ; none of our own are 
come yet. Lord Granville and his (aciion persist in per- 
suading the King, that it is an affair of no consequence; 
and for the Duke of Newcastle, he is glad when the rebels 
make any progress, in order to confute Lord Granville's 
assertions. The best of our situation is, our strength at sea : 
the Channel is well guarded, and twelve men-of-war more 
are arrived from Bowley. Vernon, that simple noisy 
creature, has hit upon a scheme that is of great service ; 
he has laid Folkestone cutters all round the coast, which

are continually relieved, and bring constant notice of every* 
thing that stirs. I just now hear that the Duke of Bedford 
dedares he will be amused no longer, but will ask the 
King's leave to raise a regiment* The Duke of Montagu 
has a troop of horse ready, and the Duke of Devonshire is 
raising men in Derbyshire. The Torkshiremen, headed by 
th^ Archbishop' and Lord Malton^, meet the gentlemen of 
the county the day after to-morrow, to defend that part 
of England* Unless we have more ill fortune than is 
conceivable, or the general supineness continues, it is 
impossible but we must get over this. Tou desire me to 
send you good news : I confine myself to tell you nothing 
but what you may depend upon ; and leave you in a fright 
rather than deceive you. I confess my own apprehensions 
are not near so strong as they were ; and if we get over this, 
I shall believe that we never can be hurt ; for we never can 
be more exposed to danger. Whatever disaffection there is 
to the present family, it plainly does not proceed from love 
to the other. 

Hy Lady O. makes little progress in popularity. Neither 
the protection of my Lady Pomfret's prudery, nor of my 
Lady Townshend's libertinism, do her any service. The 
women stare at her, think her ugly, awkward, and dis- 
i^eeable ; and what is worse, the men think so too. For 
the height of mortification, the King has declared publicly 
to the ministry, that he has been told of the great civilities 
which he was said to show her at Hanover; that be protests 
he showed her only the common civilities due to any 
English lady that comes thither; that he never intended 
to take any particular notice of her ; nor had, nor would 
let my Lady Yarmouth. In fact, my Lady Yarmouth 
peremptorily refused to carry her to court here ; and when

where he got his red ribbon : Churchill, whose led-captain 
he was, and my Lord Harrington, had pushed him up to 
this misfortune. We have lost all our artillery, five hundred 
men taken — and three kiUed, and several officers, as you will 
see in the papers. This defeat has frightened everybody 
but those it rejoices, and those it should frighten most ; but 
my Lord Granville still buoys up the King's spirits, and 
persuades him it is nothing. He uses his ministers as ill as 
possible, and discourages everybody that would risk their 
lives and forttmes with him. Marshal Wade is marching 
against the rebels ; but the King will not let him take above 
eight thousand men ; so that if they come into England, 
another battle, with no advantage on our side, may deter- 
mine our fate. Indeed, they don't seem so unwise as to 
risk their cause upon so precarious an event ; but rather to 
design to establish themselves in Scotland, till they can be 
supported from France, and be set up with taking Edinburgh

are greatly guarded, and London kept in awe by the arrival 
of the Guards. I don't believe what I have been told this 
morning, that more troops are sent for from Flanders^ and 
aid asked of Denmark. 

Prince Charles has called a Parliament in Scotland for 
the 7th of October ; ours does not meet till the 17th, so that 
even in the show of liberty and laws they are beforehand 
with us. With all this, we hear of no men of quality or 
fortune having joined him but Lord Elcho*^, whom you 
have seen at Florence; and the Duke of Perth*, a silly 
race-horsing boy, who is eaid to be killed in this battle. 
But I gather no confidence from hence : my father always 
said, * If you see them come again, they will begin by their 
lowest people; their chiefs will not appear till the end.' 
His prophecies verify every day ! 

The town is still empty ; in this point only the English 
act contrary to their custom, for they don't throng to see 
a Parliament, though it is likely to grow a curiosity I 

I have so trained myself to expect this ruin, that I see it 
approach without any emotion. I shall suffer with fools, 
without having any malice to our enemies, who act sensibly

I AM still writing to you as Bdsident de sa Majeste 
Britannique ; and without the apprehension of your 
suddenly receiving letters of recall, or orders to notify to 
the Coxmcil of Florence the new accession. I dare say 
your fears made you think that the young Prince (for he 
is at least Prince of Scotland) had vaulted from Cope's neck 
into St. James's House ; but he is still at Edinburgh ; and 
his cousin Qrafton, the Lord Chamberlain, has not even 
given orders for fitting up this palace for his reception. 
The good people of England have at last rubbed their eyes 
and looked about them. A wonderful spirit is arisen in all 
counties, and among all sorts of people. The nobility are 
raising regiments, and everybody else is — being raised. 
Dr. Herring, the Archbishop of York, has set an example 
that would rouse the most indifferent : in two days after the 



140 To Horace Mann [1745 

news arrived at York of Ck>pe'8 defeat, and when they every 
moment expected the victorious rebels at their gates, the 
Bishop made a speech to the assembled county, that had as 
much true spirit, honesty, and bravery in it, as ever was 
penned by an historian for an ancient hero. 

The rebels returned to Edinburgh, where they have no 
hopes of taking the Castle, for old Preston \ the deputy- 
governor, and General Guest, have obliged them to supply 
the Castle constantly with fresh provisions, on pain of 
having the town fired with red-hot bullets. They did fling 
a bomb on Holyrood House, and obliged the boy to shift 
his quarters. Wade is marching against them, and will 
have a great army : all the rest of our troops are ordered 
from Flanders, and are to meet him in Yorkshire, with 
some Hessians too. That coimty raises four thousand men, 
besides a body of foxhunters, whom Oglethorpe has con- 
verted into hussars. I am told that old Stair, who certainly 
does not want zeal, but may not want envy neither, has 
practised a little Scotch art to prevent Wade from having 
an army, and consequently the glory of saving this country. 
This I don't doubt he will do, if the rebels get no foreign 
aid ; and I have great reason to hope they will not, for the 
French are privately making us overtures of peace. My dear 
child, dry your wet-hrown^pemess^ and be in spirits again I

Adieu ! my dear Sir. This account has put me so out of 
humour, and has so altered the strain of my letter, that 
I must finish. 



19& To Horace Mann. 

Arlington Street, Oct. 11, 1745. 

This is likely to be a very short letter; for I have nothing 
to tell you, nor anything to answer. I have not had one 
letter from you this month, which I attribute to the taking 
of the packet-boat by the French, with two mails in it It 
was a very critical time for our negotiations ; the ministry 
will say, it puts their transactions out of order. 

Before I talk of any public news, I must tell you what 
you will be very sorry for — ^Lady Granville is dead. She 
had a fever for six weeks before her lying-in, and could never 
get it o£F. Last Saturday they called in another physician, 
Dr. Oliver: on Monday he pronounced her out of danger. 
About seven in the evening, as Lord Pomfiret and Lady 
Charlotte were sitting by her, the first notice they had of 
her immediate danger, was her sighing and saying, ' I feel 
death come very fast upon me I' She repeated the same 
words frequently — remained perfectly in her senses and 
calm, and died about eleven at night Her mother and 
sister sat by her till she was cold. It is very shocking for 
anybody so young, so handsome, so arrived at the height of 
happiness, so sensible of it, and on whom all the joy and 
grandeur of her family depended, to be so quickly snatched 
away ! Poor Uguccioni I he will be very sorry and simple 
about it 

For the rebels, they have made no figure since their 
victory. The Castle of Edinburgh has made a sally, and 



1746] To Horace Mcmn 143 

taken twenty head of cattle, and about thirty head of High- 
landers. We heard yesterday, that they are coming this 
way\ The troops from Flanders are expected to land in 
Yorkshire to-morrow. A privateer of Bristol has taken a 
large Spanish ship, laden with arms and money for Scotland *. 
A piece of a plot has been discovered in Dorsetshire, and 
one Mr. Weld ' taken up. The French have declared to the 
Dutch, that the House of Stuart is their ally, and that the 
Dutch troops must not act against them; but we expect 
they shall. The Parliament meets next Thursday, and by 
that time, probably, the armies will too. The rebels are 
not above eight thousand, and have little artillery ; so you 
may wear what ministerial spirits you wilL 

The Venetian ambassador has been making his entries 
this week : he was at Leicester Fields to-day with the Prince, 
and very pretty compliments passed between them in 
Italian. 

Do excuse this letter : I really have not a word more to 
say ; the next shall be all arma wrumgue cano !

I HAD been almost as long without any of your letters as 
you had without mine ; but yesterday I received one, dated 
the 5th of this month, N.S. 

The rebels have not left their camp near Edinburgh, and, 
I suppose, will not now, unless to retreat into the Highlanda 
General Wade was to march yesterday from Doncaster for 
Scotland. By their not advancing, I conclude that either 
the boy and his council could not prevail on the Highlanders

to leave their own country, or that they were not strong 
enough, and still wait for foreign assistance, which, in a new 
declaration, he intimates that he still expects. One only 
ship, I believe, a Spanish one, is got to them with arms^ and 
Lord John Drummond ^ and some people of quality on board. 
We don't hear that the younger boy is of the number. 
Four ships sailed from Gorunna ; the one that got to Scot- 
land, one taken by a privateer of Bristol, and one lost on 
the Irish coast ; the fourth is not heard of. At Edinburgh 
and thereabouts they conmiit the most horrid barbarities. 
We last night expected as bad here : information was given 
of an intended insurrection and massacre by the Papists ; 
all the Guards were ordered out, and the Tower shut up at 
seven. I cannot be surprised at anything, considering the 
supineness of the ministry — ^nobody has yet been taken up I 

The Parliament met on Thursday. I don't think, con- 
sidering the crisis, that the House was very fulL Indeed, 
many of the Scotch members cannot come if they would. 
The young Pretender had published a declaration, threaten- 
ing to confiscate the estates of the Scotch that should come 
to Parliament) and making it treason for the English. The 
only points that have been before the House, the address 
and the suspension of the Habeas corpus, met with obstruc- 
tions from the Jacobites. By this we may expect what 
spirit they will show hereafter. With all this, I am far 
from thinking that they are so confident and sanguine as 
their friends at Bome. I blame the Chutes extremely for 
cockading themselves : why take a part, when they are only 
travelling? I should certainly retire to Florence on this 
occasion. 

Tou may imagine how little I like our situation ; but I 
don't despair. The little use they made, or could make of

their victory; their not having marched into England; 
their miscarriage at the Castle of Edinburgh ; the arrival of 
our forces, and the non-arrival of any French or Spanish, 
make me conceive great hopes of getting over this ugly 
business. But it is still an afGur wherein the chance of 
battles, or perhaps of one battle, may decide. 

I write you but short letters, considering the circumstances 
of the time ; but I hate to send you paragraphs only to 
contradict them again : I still less choose to forge events ; 
and, indeed, am glad I have so few to tell you. 

My Lady O. has forced herself upon her mother, who 
receives her very coolly : she talks highly of her demands, 
and quietly of her methods: the fruitlessness of either 
will, I hope, soon send her back — I am sorry it must be 
to you I 

You mention Holdisworth ' : he has had the confidence to 
come and visit me within these ten days ; and (I suppose, 
from the overflowing of his joy) talked a great deal and 
quick — with as little sense as when he was more tedioua 

Since I wrote this, I hear the Countess has told her 
mother, that she thinks her husband the best of our family, 
and me the worst — nobody so bad, except you I I don't 
wonder at my being so ill with her; but what have you 
done? or is it, that we are worse than anybody, because we 
know more of her than anybody does ? Adieu !

incidents worth mentioning. They have intrenched them-

selveB very strongly in the Duke of Buccleuch's park\ 
whose seat) about seven miles from Edinburgh, they have 
seized. We had an account last week of the boy's being 
retired to Dunkirk, but it was not true. Kelly*, who is 
gone to solicit succour from France, was seized at Helvoet, 
but by a stupid burgher released. Lord Loudon is very 
brisk in the north of Scotland, and has intercepted and beat 
some of their parties. Marshal Wade was to march from 
Newcastle yesterday. 

But the Rebellion does not make half the noise here that 
one of its consequences does. Fourteen lords (most of them 
I have named to you), at the beginning, offered to raise 
regiments ; these regiments, so handsomely tendered at first, 
have been since put on the regular establishment ; not much 
to the honour of the undertakers or of the firmness of the 
ministry, and the King is to pay them. One of the great 
grievances of this is, tiiat these most disinterested colonels 
have named none but their own relations and dependents 
for the officers, who are to have rank ; and consequently 
both colonels and subalterns will interfere with the brave 
old part of the army, who have served all the war. This 
has made great clamour. The King was against their having 
rank, but would not refuse it; yet wished that the House 
of Commons would address him not to grant it This 
notification of his royal mind encouraged some of the old 
part of the ministry, particularly Winnington and Fox, to 
undertake to procure this address. Friday it came on in the 
conmiittee ; the Jacobites and Patriots (such as are not in- 
cluded in the coalition) violently opx>osed the regiments 
themselves; so did Fox, in a very warm speech, levelled 
particularly at the Duke of Montagu, who, besides his old

regimenty has one of horse and one of foot on this new plan. 
Pitt defended them as warmly : the Duke of Bedford, Lord 
Gower, and Lord Halifju, being at the head of this job. At 
last, at ten at night, the thirteen regiments of foot were 
voted without a division^ and the two of horse carried by 
192 to 82. Then oame the motion for the address, and in 
an hour and half more, was rejected by 126 to 124. Of this 
latter number were seyeral of the old corps ; I among the 
rest It is to be reported to the House to-morrow, and will, 
I conclude, be at least as warm a day as the former. The 
Eling is now against the address, and all sides are using 
their utmost efforts. The fourteen lords threaten to throw 
up, unless their whole terms are complied with ; and the 
Duke of Bedford is not moderately insolent against such of 
the King's seirants as voted against him. Mr. Pelham 
espouses him ; not recollecting, that at least twice a week 
all his new allies are suffered to oppose him as they please. 
I should be sorry, for the appearance, to have the regiments 
given up ; but I am sure our affair is over, if our two old 
armies are beaten and we should come to want these new 
ones ; four only of which are pretended to be raised *. Pitt, 
who has alternately bullied and flattered Mr. Pelham, is at 
last to be Secretary at War ^ ; Sir William Tonge to be re-

between the mercenary views of these Patriot heroes^ the 
regiment factors, and of their acquiescent agents, the 
ministry, with the disinterested behaviour of my Lord 
Eildare', was drawn on Friday by Lord Doneraile; who 
read the very proposals of the latter for raising, clothing, 
and arming a regiment at his own expense, and for which 
he had been told, but the very day before this question, that 
the King had no occasion. — ' And how/ said Lord Doneraile,

I TOLD you in my last what disturbance there had been 
about the new regiments ; the affair of rank was again dis- 
puted on the report till ten at night, and carried by a 
majority of 23. The King had been persuaded to appear for 
it, though Lord Granville made it a party point against 
Mr. Pelham. Winnington did not speak. I was not there, 
for I could not vote for it, and yielded not to give any 
hindrance to a public measure (or at least what was called 
so) just now. The Prince acted openly, and influenced his

people against it ; but it only senred to let Mr. Pelham aee» 
what, like everything else, he did not know, how strong he 
i& The ELing will scarce speak to him, and he cannot yet 
get Pitt into place. 

The rebels are come into England: for two days we 
belieyed them near Lancaster, but the ministry now own 
that they don't know if they have passed Carlisle. Some 
think they will besiege that town, which has an old wall, 
and aU the militia in it of Cumberland and Westmoreland ; 
but as they can pass by it, I don't see why they should take 
it; for they are not strong enough to leave garrisons. Several 
desert them as they advance south; and altogether, good 
men and bad, nobody believes them ten thousand. By their 
marching westward to avoid Wade, it is evident that they 
are not strong enough to fight him. They may yet retire 
back into their mountains, but if once they get to Lancaster, 
their retreat is cut off; for Wade will not stir from New- 
castle, till he has embarked them deep into England, and 
then he will be behind them. He has sent (Jeneral Handa- 
syde from Berwick with two regiments to take possession of 
Edinburgh. The rebels are certainly in a very desperate 
situation: they dared not meet Wade; and if they had 
waited for him, their troops would have deserted. Unless 
they meet with great risings in their &vour in Lancashire, 
I don't see what they can hope, except from a continuation 
of our neglect That, indeed, has nobly exerted itself for 
them. They were suffered to march the whole length of 
Scotland, and take possession of the capital, ¥rithout a man 
appearing against them. Then two thousand men saUed to 
them, to run from them. Till the flight of Cope's army, 
Wade was not sent. Two roads still lay into England, and 
till they had chosen that which Wade had not taken, no 
army was thought of beiag sent to secure the other. Now 
Ligonier, with seven old regiments, and six of the new, is 



150 To Horace Mann [1745 

ordered to Lancashire : before this first division of the army 
could get to Coyentry, they are forced to order it to halt, 
for fear the enemy should be up with it before it was all 
assembled. It is uncertain if the rebek will march to the 
north of Wales, to Bristol, or towards London. If to the 
latter, Ligonier must fight them : if to either of the other, 
which I hope, the two armies may join and drive them into 
a comer, where they must all perish. They cannot subsist 
in Wales, but by being supplied by the Papists in Ireland 
The best is, that we are in no fear from France ; there is no 
preparation for invasions in any of their ports. Lord Clan- 
carty\ a Scotchman of great parts, but mad and drunken, 
and whose family forfeited 90,0002. a year, for King James,

to the land, and sa3rs he is tired of being a pen and ink man.

With the rebels in England, you may imagine we have 
no private news, nor think of foreign. From this accotmt 
you may judge, that our case is far from desperate, though 
disagreeable. The Prince, while the Princess lies-in, has

table, drinks and harangues to all this medley till nine at

Arlington Street, Not. 22, 1745. 
Fob these two days we have been expecting news of a 
battle. Wade marched last Saturday from Newcastle, and 
must have got up with the rebels if they stayed for him, 
though the roads are exceedingly bad and great quantities 
of snow have fallen. But last night there was some notice 
of a body of rebels being advanced to Penryth. We were 
put into great spirits by an heroic letter from the mayor of 
Carlisle, who had fired on the rebels and made them retire ; 
he concluded with saying, 'And so I think the town of 
Carlisle has done his Majesty more service than the great 
city of Edinburgh, or than all Scotland together.' But 
this hero, who was grown the whole fashion for four-and- 
twenty hours, had chosen to stop all other letters. The 
King spoke of him at his lev4e with great encomiums ; Lord 
Stair said, 'Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson has behaved very 
bravely.' The Duke of Bedford interrupted him ; ' My Lord, 



162 To Horace Mann [i745 

his name is not Ptttersan ; that is a Scotch name ; his name 
is Paiinson.* But, alack ! the next day the rebels returned, 
having placed the women and children of the country in 
waggons in the front of their army, and forcing the peasants 
to fix the scaling-ladders. The great Mr. Pattinson, or 
Patterson (for now his name may be which one pleases), 
instantly surrendered the town, and agreed to pay two 
thousand pounds to save it from pillage. Well ! then we 
were assured that the citadel could hold out seven or eight 
days; but did not so many hours*. On mustering the 
militia, there were not found above four men in a company ; 
and for four companies, which the ministry, on a report of 
Lord Albemarle, who said they were to be sent from Wade's 
army, thought were there, and did not know were not 
there, there was nothing but two, but of invalids. Colonel 
Durand, the governor, fled, because he would not sign the 
capitulation, by which the garrison, it is said, has sworn 
never to bear arms against the house of Stuart. The 
Colonel sent two expresses, one to Wade, and another to 
Ugonier at Preston ; but the latter was playing at whisk 
with Lord Harrington at Petersham *. Such is our diligence 
and attention ! AH my hopes are in Wade, who was so 
sensible of the ignorance of our governors, that he refused 
to accept the command, till they consented that he should 
be subject to no kind of orders from hence. The rebels 
are reckoned up to thirteen thousand ; Wade marches with 
about twelve ; but if they come southward, the other army 
will probably be to fight them ; the Duke is to command it, 
and sets out next week with another brigade of Ouards, 
and Ligonier under him. There are great apprehensions 
for Chester from the Flintshire men, who are ready to rise.

A quarter-master, first sent to Carlisle, was seized and 
carried to Wade; he behaved most insolently; and being 
asked by the General, how many the rebels were, replied, 
'Enough to beat any army you have in England.' A 
Mackintosh has been taken, who reduces their formida- 
bility, by being sent to raise two clans, and with orders, if 
they would not rise^ at least to give out they had risen, for 
that three clans would leave the Pretender, unless joined 
by those two. Five hundred new rebels are arrived at 
Perth, where our prisoners are kept. 

I had this morning a subscription-book brought me for 
our parish ; Lord Granville had refused to subscribe. This 
is in the style ot his friend Lord Bath, who has absented 
himself whenever any act of authority was to be executed 
against the rebels.

The Fox man-of-war of 20 guns is lost off Dunbar. One 
Beavor, the captain, had done us notable service : the Pre- 
tender sent to commend his zeal and activity, and to tell 
him, that if he would return to his allegiance, he should 
soon have a flag. Beavor replied, ' He never treated vrith 
any but principals ; that if the Pretender would come on 
board him, he would talk with him.' I must now tell you 
of our great Vernon: without once complaining to the 
ministry, he has written to Sir John Philipps, a dis- 
tinguished Jacobite, to complain of want of provisions ; yet 
they do not venture to recall him I Yesterday they had 
another baiting from Pitt, who is ravenous for the place of 
Secretary at War: they would give it him; but as a pre- 
liminary, he insists on a declaration of our having nothing 
to do with the continent. He mustered his forces, but did 



154 To Horace Mann [1745 

not notify his intention ; only at two o'clock Lyttelton said 
at the Treasury, that there would be business at the House. 
The motion was/ to augment our naval force, which, Pitt 
said, was the only method of putting an end to the re- 
bellion. Ships built a year hence to suppress an army of 
HighUnders, now marching through England I My uncle 
attacked him, and congratulated his country on the wisdom 
of the modem young men; and said he had a son of 
two-and-twenty, who, he did not doubt, would come over 
wiser than any of them. Pitt was provoked, and retorted 
on his negotiations and grey-headed experience. At those 
words, my unde, as if he had been at Bartholomew Fair, 
snatched off his wig, and showed his grey hairs, which 
made the august senate laugh, and put Pitt out, who, after 
laughing himself, diverted his venom upon Mr. Pelham. 
Upon the question, Pitt's party amounted but to thirty-six : 
in shorty he has nothing left but his words, and his haughti- 
ness, and his Lytteltons, and his Grenvilles. Adieu !

Arlington Street, Nov. 29, 1746. 
We have had your story here this week of the pretended 
Pretender, but with the unlucky circumstance of its coming 
from the Roman Catholics. With all the faith you have in 
your little spy, I cannot believe it ; though, to be sure, it 
has a Stuart-air, the not exposing the real boy to danger. 
The Duke of Newcastle mentioned your account this morn- 
ing to my uncle; but they don't give any credit to the 
courier's relation. It grows so near being necessary for the 
young man to get off by any evasion, that I am persuaded 
all that party will try to have it believed. We are so far 
from thinking that they have not sent us one son, that two 
days ago we believed we had got the other too. A small ship 



1746] To Horace Mann 1C6 

has taken the Soled privateer from Dunkirk, going to Mont- 
rose^ with twenty French officers^ sixty others^and the brother^ 
of the beheaded Lord Derwentwater ' and his son', who at 
fiist was believed to be the second boy. News came yester- 
day of a second privateer, taken with anns and money ; of 
another lost on the Dutch coast, and of Vernon being in 
pursuit of two more. All this must be a great damp to the 
party, who are coming on fast— fast to their destruction. 
Last night they were to be at Preston, but several repeated 
accounts make them under five thousand — none above 
seven; they must have diminished greatly by desertion. 
The country is so far from rising for them, that the towns 
are left; desolate on their approach, and the people hide and 
bury their effects, even to their pewter. Warrington bridge 
is broken down, which will turn them some miles aside. 
The Duke, with the flower of that brave army which stood 
all the fire at Fontenoy, will rendezvous at Stone, beyond 
Litchfield, the day after to-morrow: Wade is advancing 
behind them, and will be at Wetherby in Yorkshire to- 
morrow. In short, I have no conception of their daring to 
fight either army, nor see any visible possibility of their 
not being very soon destroyed. My fears have been great, 
for the greatness of our stake; but I now write in the 
greatest confidence of our getting over this ugly business. 
We have another very disagreeable affair, that may have 
fatal consequences : there rages a murrain among the cows ;

spread dreadfully; though hitherto it has not reached many 
miles from London. At first, it was imagined that the

pronounced it infectious, and brought from abroad.

Duke, and are gone in the greatest spirits; and on the 
paiiide^ as they began their march, the Guards vowed that 
they would neither give nor take quarter. For bravery, his 
\^ Royal Highness is certainly no Stuart, but literally loves to 
be in the act of fighting. His brother has so far the same 
taste, that the night of his new son's ^ christening, he had 
the citadel of Carlisle in sugar at supper, and the company 
besieged it with sugar plums. It was well imagined, con- 
sidering the time and the circumstances. One thing was 
very proper; old ICarshal Stair was there, who is grown 
child enough to be fit to war only with such artillery. 
Another piece of ingenuity of that court was on the report 
of Pitt being named Secretary at War. The Prince bates 
him, since the fall of Lord Granville : he said, ICiss Ghud- 
leigh *, one of the Maids, was fitter for the employment ; 
and dictated a letter, which he made her write to Lord 
Harrington, to desire he would draw the warrant for her. 
There were fourteen people at table, and all were to sign it : 
the Duke of Queensberry* would not, as being a friend of

Pitt, nor Mrs. Layton, one of the dressers : howeyer, it was 
actuaDy sent, and the footman ordered not to deliver it till 
Sir William Yonge was at Lord Harrington's — alas! it 
would be endless to tell yon all his CaligMsms ! A ridiculous 
thing happened when the Princess saw company : the new- 
bom babe was shown in a mighty pretty cradle, designed 
by Kent, under a canopy in the great drawing*room. Sir 
William Stanhope went to look at it; Mrs. Herbert^, the 
governess, advanced to unmantle it: he said, 'In wax, I 
suppose.' — * Sir I ' — * In wax. Madam ? ' — * The yoimg Prince, 
Sir.'— 'Tesy in wax, I suppose.' This is his odd humour : 
when he went to see this Duke at his birth, he said, ' Lord : 
it sees!' 

The good Provost of Edinburgh has been with Marshal 
Wade at Newcastle, and it is said is coming to London — he 
must trust hugely to the inactivity of the ministry I They 
have taken an agent there going with large contributions 
from the Soman Catholics, who have pretended to be so 
quiet ! The Duchess of Richmond, while her husband is at 
the army, was going to her Grace of Norfolk : when he was 
very uneasy at her intention, she showed him letters from 
the Norfolk, 'wherein she prays God that this wicked re- 
bellion may be soon suppressed, lest it hurt the poor Boman 
Catholica' But this wise jaunt has made such a noise that 
it is laid aside. 

Tour friend Lord Sandwich has got one of the Duke of 
Montagu's regiments ; he stayed quietly till all the noise was 
over. He is now Lord of the Admiralty, lieutenant-colonel 
to the Duke of Bedford, aide-de-camp to the Duke of Bich-

A Mend of mine, Mr. Talbot, who has a good estate in 
Cheshire, with the great tithes, whioh he takes in kind, and 
has generaUy fifteen hundred pounds stock, has expressly 
ordered his steward to bum it, if the rebels come that way : 
I don't think this will make a bad figure in Mr. Ohute's 
braye gazette. As we go on prospering, I will take care to 
furnish him with paragraphs, till he kills Biyiera ^ and all 
the faction. When my lovely eagle comes, I will consecrate 
it to his Soman memory ; don't think I want spirits more 
than he, when I beg you to send me a case of drams : I 
remember your getting one for Mr. Treyor. 

I guessed at haying lost two letters from you in the 
packet-boat that was taken : I haye receiyed all you mention, 
but those of the 21st and 28th of September, one of which 
I suppose was about Qibbeme : his mother has told me how 
happy you haye made her and him, for which I much thank 
you and your usual good-nature. Adieu I I trust all my 
letters will grow better and better. You must haye passed 
a lamentable scene of anxiety ; we haye had a good deal ; 
but I think we grow in spirits again. There neyer was so 
melancholy a town ; no kind of public place but the play- 
houses, and they look as if the rebels had just driven away 
the company. Nobody but has some fear for themselves, 
for their money, or for their friends in the army : of this 
number am I deeply ; Lord Bury' and Mr. Conway, two of 
the first in my list, are aide-de-camps to the Duke, and

I AM glad I did not write to you last post as I intended ; 
I should have sent you an account that would haye alarmed 
you, and the danger would have been over before the letter 
had crossed the sea. The Duke, from some strange want of 
intelligence, lay last week for four-and-twenty hours under 
arms at Stone, in Staffordshire, expecting the rebels every 
moment, while they were marching in all haste to Derby. 
The news of this threw the town into great consternation ^ ; 
but his Boyal Highness repaired his mistake, and got to 
IJorthampton, between the Highlanders and London. They 
got nine thousand pounds at Derby, and had the books 
brought to them, and obliged everybody to give them what 
they had subscribed against them. Then they retreated a 
few miles, but returned again to Derby, got ten thousand 
pounds more, plundered the town, and burnt a house of the 
Countess of Exeter*. They are gone again, and got back to 
Leake, in Staffordshire, but miserably harassed, and, it is 
said, have left all their cannon behind them, and twenty 
waggons of sick. The Duke has sent Qeneral Hawley ' with 

^^ Gtooige, eldest eon of George being oelled BUtek Friday, WdlpoU,

Mr. Conway to Marahal Wade^ to hasten his march upon 
the back of thenu They must either go to North Wales, 
where they will probably all perish, or to Scotland, with 
great loss. We dread them no longer. We are threatened 
with great preparations for a French invasion, but the coast 
is exceedingly guarded ; and for the people, the spirit against 
the rebels increases every day. Though they have marched 
thus into the heart of the kingdom, there has not been the 
least symptom of a rising, not even in the great towns of 
which they possessed themselves. They have got no recruits 
since their first entry into England, excepting one gentleman * 
in Lancashire, one hundred and fifty common men, and two 
parsons, at Manchester, and a physician from York. But 
here in London, the aversion to them is amazing : on some 
thoughts of the King's going to an encampment at Finchley, 
the weavers not only offered him a thousand men, but the 
whole body of the Law formed themselves into a little 
army, under the command of Lord Chief -Justice Willes, and 
were to have done duty at St. Jameses, to guard the royal 
family in the King's absence. 

But the greatest demonstration of loyalty appeared on the 
prisoners being brought to town from the Sc^ prize : the 
young man is certainly Mr. Badcliffe's son ; but the mob, 
persuaded of his being the youngest Pretender, could scarcely 
be restrained from tearing him to pieces all the way on the 
road, and at his arrival. He said he had heard of English 
mobs, but could not conceive they were so dreadful, and 
wished he had been shot at the battle of Dettingen, where 
he had been engaged. The father, whom they call Lord

We b^gin to take up people, but it is with as much caution

but in vain. However, nothing has been made out against 
him ; he is released ; and, what convinces me that he is not

I HAVB at last got your great letter by Mr. Oambier, and 
the views of the villas \ for which I thank you mudi. 
I can't say I think them too well done, nor the villas them- 
selves pretty, but the prospects are charming* I have since 
received two more letters from you, of November 30th and 
December 7tlL Tou seem to receive mine at last, though 
very slowly. 

We have at last got a spring-tide of good luck. The 
rebels turned back from Derby, and have ever since been 
flying with the greatest precipitation. The Duke, with all 
his horse, and a thousand foot mounted, has pursued them 
with astonishing rapidity ; and General Oglethorpe, with 
part of Wade's horse, has crossed over upon them. There 
has been little prospect of coming up with their entire 
body, but it dismayed them; their stragglers were picked 
up, and the towns in their way preserved from plunder, by 
their not having time to do mischief This morning an 
express is arrived from Lord Halton* in Yorkshire, who 
has had an account of Oglethorpe's cutting a part of them 
to pieces, and of the Duke's overtaking their rear and 
entirely demolishing it'. We believe all this ,- but, as it is 
not yet confirmed, don't depend upon it too much. The

to announce himself command^ for the French King in the 
war he designs to wage in England, and to propose a cartel 
for the exchange of prisonenu No answer has been made 
to this rebel ; but the King has acquainted the Parliament 
with this audacious message. We have a vast fleet at sea ; 
and the main body of the Duke's army is coming down to 
the coast to prevent their landing, if they should slip our 
ships. Indeed, I can't believe they will attempt coming 
hither, as they must hear of the destruction of the rebels 
in England; but they will, probably, dribble away to Scot- 
land, where the war may last considerably. Into England, 
I scarce believe the Highlanders will be drawn again ^— to 
have come as far as Derby— to have found no rising in their 
favour, and to find themselves not strong enough to fight 
either army, will make lasting impressions !

Yemon, I hear, is recalled for his absurdities, and at his 
own request, and Martin named for his successor. We had 
yesterday a yery remarkable day in the House: the King 
notified his haying sent for six thousand Hessians into 
Scotland. Mr. Pelham for an address of thanks. Loid 
Combury* (indeed, an exceedingly honest man) was for 
thanking for the notice, not for the sending for the troops ; 
and proposed to add a representation of the national being 
the only constitutional troops, and to hope we should be 
exonerated of these foreigners as soon as possible. Pitt, 
and that dan, joined him ; but the voice of the House, and 
the desires of the whole kingdom for all the troops we can 
getj were so strong, that, on the diyision, we were 190 to 
44 : I think and hope this will produce some Hanoyerians 
too. That it will produce a dismission of the Gobhamites 
is pretty certain ; the Duke of Bedford and Lord Gower 
are warm for both points. The latter has certainly re- 
nounced Jacobitism. 

Boetslaar is come again from Holland, but his errand not 
yet known. Tou will haye heard of another victory which 
the Prussian has gained over the Saxons'; very bloody on 
both sides : but now he is master of Dresden.

handsome, poor, and proper to get her five more. I saw^ 
the other day, a very good Irish letter. A gentleman in 
Dublin, full of the great qualities of my Lord Gheeterfield^ 
has written a panegyric on them, particularly on his a£Eii- 
bility and humility; with a comparison between him and 
the hauteur of all other lord-lieutenants. As an instance, 
he says, the Earl was invited to a great dinner, whither he 
went, fiy middk^ at one^ instead of three. The master was 
not at home, the lady not dressed, everything in confusion*

peeted in town eyery day'; but I stOl think it probaUe 
that he will go to Scotland. That country is yery clamoroua 
for it. If the Sling does send him, it cdiould not be with 
that sword of mercy with which the present fiunily haye 
goyemed those people. All the world agrees in the fitness 
of seyerity to highwaymen, for the sake of the innocent 
who suffer ; then, can rigour be ill placed against banditti 
who haye so terrified, pillaged, and injured the poor people 
in Cumberland, Lancashire, Derbyshire, and the counties 
through which this rebellion has stalked? There is a mili- 
tary magistrate of some fierceness sent into Scotland with 
Wade's army, who is coming to town ; it is General Hawley. 
He will not sow the seeds of fdture disloyalty by too easily 
pardoning the present. 

The French still go on with their preparations at Donkirk 
and their sea-ports ; but, I think, few people belieye now 
that they will be exerted against us : we haye a numerous 
fleet in the Channel, and a large army on the shores oppo* 
site to France. The Dutch fear that all this storm is to 
burst on them. Since the Queen's making peace with 
Prussia % the Dutch are applying to him for protection ; 
and, I am told, wake from ilieir neutral lethargy. 

We are in a good quiet state here in town ; the Parlia- 
ment is reposing itself for the holidays ; the ministry is in 
priyate agitation ; the Cobham part of the coalition is going 
to be disbanded ; Pitt's wild ambition cannot content itself 
with what he had asked, and had had granted^; and he has

oui I most give you some idea of this miin, who will give 
a morfcal blow to the pride of the Scotch nobility. He is 
called Lord Chief Justice ; frequent and sudden executions 
are his passion. Last winter he had intelligence of a spy to 
come from the French army t the first notice our army had 
of his arrival, was by seeing him dangle on a gallows in his 
muff and boots. One of the surgeons of the army begged 
the body of a soldier who was hanged for desertion^ to 
dissect : ^ Well/ said Hawley, ' but then you shall give me 
the skeleton to hang up in the guard-room.' He is very 
brave and able ; with no small bias to the brutaL Two 
years ago, when he arrived at Ghent, the magistrates, 
according to custom, sent a gentleman, with the offer of 
a sum of money to engage his favour. He told the gentle- 
man, in great wrath, that the King his master paid him, 
and that he should go tell the magistrates so ; at the same 
time dragging him to the head of the stairs, and kicking 
him down. He then went to the town-hall ; on their 
refusing him entrance, he burst open the door with his 
foot, and seated himself abruptly : told them how he had 
been afi^nted, was persuaded they had no hand in it, and 
demanded to have the gentleman given up to him, who 
never dared to appear in the town while he stayed in it. 
Now I am telling you anecdotes of him, you shall hear two 
more. When the Prince of Hesse, offr son-in-law, arrived 
at Brussels, and found Hawley did not wait on him, the 
IMnce sent to know if he expected the first visit? He 
replied, 'He always expected that inferior officers should 
wait on their commanders ; and not only that, but he gave 
hia Hif^ness but half an hour to consider of ii' The Prince

Dothey send you the Gazettes as they used to do? If you 
have them, you will find there an account of a$wOier betUe 
lost in Scotland \ Our arms cannot succeed there. Hawleyt 
of whom I said so much to you in my last, has been as 
unsuccessful as Ck>pey and by almost every circumstance the 
same, except that Hawley had less want of skill and mudi 
more presumption. The very same dragoons ran away at 
Falkirk, that ran away at Pkeston Pana Though we had 
seven thousand men, and the rebels but five^ we had scarce 
three regiments that behaved welL Qeneral Huske' and 
Brigadier Cholmondeley,my Lord's brother, shone eztr^nely: 
the former beat the enemy's right wing ; and the latter, by 
rallying two regiments, prevented the pursuit Our loss is 
trifling ; for many of the rebels fled as fast as the glorious 
dragoons : but we have lost some good officers, particularly 
Sir Bobert Monroe * ; and seven pieces of cannon. A worse 
loss is apprehended, Stirling CSastle, which could hold out 
but ten days; and that term expires to-morrow ^ The 
Duke is gone post to Edinburgh, where he hoped to arrive 
to-night ; if possibly, to relieve Stirling. Another battle 
will certainly be fought before you receive this : I hope with 
the Hessians in it, who are every hour expected to land in 
Scotland. With many other glories, the English courage 
seems gone too I The great dependence is upon the Duke ; 
the soldiers adore him, and with reason : he has a lion's

courage^ vast Tigilanoe and activity, and, I am told, great 
military geiiia& For my own particular, I am uneasy that 
he is gone ; Lord Bury and Mr. Conway, two of his aides-de- 
camp, and brave as he, are gone with him* The ill behaviour 
of the soldiers lays a double obligation on the oflSoers to set 
them examples of running on danger. The ministry would 
have kept back Mr. Conway, as being in Parliament ; which 
when the Duke told him, he burst into tears, and protested 
that nothing should hinder his going — and he is gone I 
Judge, if I have not reason to be alarmed I 

Some of our prisoners in Scotland (the former prisoners) 
are released. They had the privilege of walking about the 
town, where they were confined, upon their parole: the 
militia of the country rose and set them at liberty. General 
Hawley is so strict as to think they should be sent back ; 
but nobody here comprehends such refinement : they could 
not give their parole that the town should not be taken. 
There are two or three others, who will lay the government 
under difficulties, when we have got over the Bebellion. 
They were come to England on their parole ; and when the 
executions begin, they must in honour be given up — the 
question indeed will be, to whom? 

Adieu 1 my dear Sir I I write you this short letter, 
rather than be taxed with negligence on such an event; 
though, you perceive, I know nothing but what you will see 
in the printed papers. 

P.S. The Hessians would not act^ because we would not 
settle a cartel with rebels!

axmety about the Bebellion, when it had 8o long ceased to 
be formidable with us : but you have got all my letters, and 
are out of your pain. Hawley's defeat (or at least what was 
called so, for I am persuaded that the yictoiy was ours as 
far as there was any fighting, which indeed lay in a Tery 
small compass, the great body of each anny running away) 
will haye thrown you back into your terrors ; but here is 
a letter to cahn you again. All Monday and Tuesday we 
were concluding that the battle between the Duke and the 
rebels must be fought, and nothing was talked of but 
the expectation of the courier. He did arriye indeed on 
Wednesday morning, but with no battle ; for the moment 
the rebel army saw the Duke's, they turned back with the 
utmost precipitation'; spiked their cannon, blew up their 
magazine, and left behind them their wounded and our 
prisoners. They crossed the Forth, and in one day fled 
fouTnand-thirty miles to Perth, where, as they have strong 
intrenchments, some imagine they wiU wait to fight ; but 
their desertion is too great : the whole clan of the Maodonalds, 
one of their best, has retired <m the accidental death of 
their chief ^ In short, it looks exceedingly like the con- 
elusion of this business, though the French have embarked 
FitzJames's regiment at Ostend for Scotland. The Duke's 
name disperses armies, as the Pretender's raised them. 

The French seem to be at the eve of taking Antwerp and 
Brussels*, the latter of which is actually besieged. In this 
case I don't see how we can send an army abroad this 
summer, for there will be no considerable towns in Flanders 
left in the possession of the Empress^ueen. 

The new regiments, of which I told you so much, haye 
again been in dispute : as their term was near expired, the

yniTiiafay proposod to oontiiitte them for four months longer. 
This was last Friday, when, as we every hour expeeted the 
news of a oondusiye battle, which, if fayourable, would 
render them useless^ Mr. Fox, the general against the new 
regiments, begged it might only be postponed till the 
following Wednesday, but 170 against 89 voted them that 
very day. On the very Wednesday came the news of the 
flight of the rebels ; and two days before that, news from 
Chester of Lord Gower's new regiment having mutinied, on 
hearing that they were to be oontinued beyond the term for 
which they had listed. 

At court all is confusion: the King, at Lord Bathes 
instigation, has absolutely refused to make Pitt Secretary 
at War. How this will end, I don't know, but I don't 
believe in bloodshed : neither side is famous for being 
incapable of yielding. 

I wish you joy of having the Chutes again, though I am 
a little sorry that their bravery was not rewarded by staying 
at Bome till they could triumph in their turn : however, 
I don't believe that at Florence you want opportunities of 
exulting. That Monro* you mention was made travelling 
phjTsician by my father's interest^ who had great regard for 
the old doctor* : if he has any skill in quacking madmen, 
his art may perhaps be of service now in the Pretender's 
court. 

I beg my eagle may not come till it has the opportunity 
of a man-of-war : we have lost so many merchantmen lately, 
that I should never expect to receive it that way. 

I can say nothing to your opinion of the young Pretender 
being a cheat ; nor, as the Bebellion is near at an end, do 
I see what end it would answer to prove him original or

Bt the rotation I am going to make, you will think that 
I am describing Turkish, not English revolutions ; and will 
cast your eye upwards to see if my letter is not dated from 
Constantinople. Indeed, violent as the changes have been, 
there has been no bloodshed; no Grand Vizier has had 
a cravat made of a bowstring, no Janizaries have taken upon 
them to alter the succession, no Grand Signior is deposed^- 
only his Sublime Highnesses dignify has been a little im» 
paired, Oh ! I foigot ; I ought not to frighten you ; you 
will interpret all these fine allusions, and think on the 
Bebellion — phol we are such considerable proficients in 
politics, that we can form rebellions within rebellions, and 
turn a government topsy-turvy at London, while we are 
engaged in a civil war in Scotland. In short, I gave you 
a hint last week of an insurrection in the doset, and of Lord 
Bath having prevented Pitt from being Secietaiy at War. 
The ministry gave up that point ; but finding that a change 
had been made in a scheme of foreign politics, which they 
had laid before the King, and for which he had thanked 
them ; and perceiving some symptoms of a resolution to 
dismiss them at the end of the session, they came to 
a sudden determination not to do Lord Granville's business 



1746] To Horace Mann 175 

by carrying the supplieB, and then, to be turned out: 00 on 
Monday mornings to the astonbhment of eyerybody, the 
two Seeretaries of State ^ threw up the seals ; and the next 
day Mr. Pelham, with the rest of the Treasury, the Duke of 
Bedford with the Admiralty, Lord Gower, F^iyy Seal, and 
Lord Pembroke^ Groom of the Stole*, gave up too : the Dukes 
of Deronahire, Orafton and Biohmond, the Lord Chancellor', 
Winnington (Pajrmaster), and almost all the other great 
officers and offices, declaring they would do the same. Lord 
Granville immediately receiyed both seals, one for himself, 
and the other to give to whom he pleased. Lord Bath was 
named First Commissioner of the Treasury and Chancellor 
of the Exchequer; Lord Carlisle^ Privy Seal, and Lord 
Winchelsea reinstated in the Admiralty. Thus &r all went 
swimmingly ; they had only forgot one little point, which 
was, to secure a majority in both Houses : in the Commons 
they unluckily found that they had no better man to take 
the lead than poor Sir John Bushout, for Sir John Barnard 
refused to be Chancellor of the Exchequer ; so did Lord 
Chief Justice Willes to be Lord Chancellor ; and the wildness 
of the scheme soon prevented others, who did not wish ill 
to Lord Granville, or well to the Pelhams, from giving in to 
it Hop, the Dutch minister, did not a little increase the 
confusion by declaring that he had immediately dispatched 
a courier to Holland, and did not doubt but the States would 
directly send to accept the terms of France. 

I should tell you too, that Lord Bath's being of the 
enterprise contributed hugely to poison the success of it 
Li short, his lordship, whose politics were never characterised 
by steadiness, found that he had not courage enough to take

the Treasuiy. You may gaees how ill laid his achemes 
were, when he durst not indulge both his ambition and 
ayarice I In short, on Wednesday morning (pray mind, 
this was the very Wednesday after the Monday on which 
the change had happened) he went to the King, and told 
him he had tried the House of Commons, and found U 
would not dot Bounce I went all the project into shireiSy 
like the vessels in Ben Jonson's Alchemisij when they are 
on the brink of the plulosoi^er's stone. The poor King, 
who, from being fatigued with the Duke of Newcastle, and 
sick of Pelham's timidity and eompxomisee, had given in to 
this mad hurly-burly of alterations, was confounded with 
having floundered to no purpose, and to find himself more 
than ever in the power of men he hated, shut himself up in 
his doset, and refused to admit any more of ihe persons 
who were pouring in upon him wiih white sticks^ and 
golden keys, and commissions, &c. At last he sent for 
Wianington, and told him, he was the only honest man 
about him,, and he should have the honour of the reconcilia* 
tion, and sent him to Mr* Pelham to desire they would all 
return to their employments. 

Lord Granville is as jolly as ever ; laughs and drinks, and 
owns it was mad, and owns he would do it again to-morrow. 
It would not be quite so safe^ indeed, to try it soon again, 
for the triumphant party are not at all in the humour to be 
turned out every time his Lordship has drank a bottle too 
much ; and that House of Commons that he could not make 
do for him, would do to send him to the Tower till he was 
sober. This was the veiy worst period he could have 
selected, when the fears of men had made them throw them- 
selves absolutely into all measures of government to secure 
the government itself; and that temporary strength of 
Pelham has my Lord Oranville contrived to fix to him ; 
and people will be glad to ascribe to the merit and virtue 



1746] To Horace Mann 177 

of tbe ministryy what they would be ashamed to own, but 
was really the effect of their own apprehenaionfl. It was 
a good idea of somebody, when no man would accept a place 
under the new system, that Granville and Bath were met 
going about the streets, calling odd man ! as the hackney 
chairmen do when they want a partner. This little 
faction of Lord Granville goes by the name of the Orund- 
villains. 

There ! who would think that I had written you an entire 
history in the compass of three aides of paper? Vertot^ 
would have composed a volume on this event, and entitled 
it, the BevoJuHona of England. Tou wiU wonder at not 
having it notified to you by Lord Granville himself as is 
customary for new Secretaries of State : when they men- 
tioned to him writing to Italy, he said — * To Italy I no : 
before the courier can get thither, I shall be out again.' It 
absolutely makes one laugh : as serious as the consequences 
might be, it is impossible to hate a politician of such jovial 
good-humour. I am told that he ordered the packet-boat to 
be stopped at Harwich till Saturday, tiU he should have 
time to determine what he would write to Holland. This 
will make the Dutch receive the news of the double 
revolution at the same instant. 

The Duke and his name are pursuing the scattered rebels 
into their very mountains, determined to root out sedition 
entirely. It is believed, and we expect to hear, that the 
young Pretender is embarked and gone. Wish the Chutes 
joy of the happy conclusion of this affair ! 

Adieu I my dear child ! After describing two revolutions, 
and announcing the termination of a rebellion, it would be 
below the dignity of my letter to talk of anything of less 
moment. Next post I may possibly descend out of my

I KNOW I have missed two or three posts, but you have 
lost nothing: you perhaps expected that our mighty com- 
motions did not subside at once, and that you should still 
hear of struggles and more shocks : but it all ended at once ; 
with only some removals and promotions which you saw in 
the Gazette. I should have written, however, but I have 
been hurried with my sister's^ wedding; but all the 
ceremony of that too is over now, and the dinners and the 
visits, &C. 

The Rebellion has fetched breath ; the dispersed clans 
have reunited and marched to Inverness, from whence Lord 
Loudon was forced to retreat, leaving a garrison in the 
Castle, which has since yielded without firing a gun. Their 
numbers are now reckoned at seven thousand: old Lord 
Lovat* has carried them a thousand Frasers. The French 
continually drop them a ship or two : we took two, with the 
Duke of Berwick's ' brother on board : it seems evident that

they design to keep up our disturbances as long as possible, 
to prevent our sending any troops to Flanders. Upon the 
prospect of the Bebellion being at an end, the Hessians were 
ordered back, but luckily were not gone; and now are 
quartered to prevent the rebels slipping the Duke, (who is 
marching to them,) and returning into England. This 
counter-order was given in the morning, and in the evening 
came out the Gazette, and said the Hessians are to go away. 
This doubling style in the ministry is grown so characterized, 
that the French are actually playing a fiurce, in which 
Harlequin enters, as an English courier, with two bundles of 
dispatches fastened to his belly and his back ; they ask him 
what the one is? 'Ehl ces sent mes ordres.' — And what 
the other ? ^ Mais elles sont mes contre-ordres.' 

We have been a little disturbed in some other of our 
politics, by the news of the King of Sardinia having made 
his peace : I think it comes out now that he absolutely had 
concluded one with Frafice, but that the haughty court of 
Spain rejected it : what the Austrian pride had driven him 
to, the Spanish pride drove him from. Tou will allow that 
our afhirs are critically bad, when all our hopes centre in 
that honest monarch, the King of Prussia — but so it is ; and 
I own I see nothing that can restore us to being a great 
nation but his interposition. Many schemes are framed, of 
making him Stadtholder of Holland, or Duke of Burgundy 
in Flanders, in lieu of the Silesias^ or altogether, and that 
I think would follow — but I don't know how far any of 
these have been carried into propositions. 

I see by your letters that our fomentations of the Corsican 
rebellion have had no better success than the French tam- 
pering in ours — ^for ours, I don't expect it will be quite at an 
end, till it is made one of the conditions of peace, that they 
shall give it no assistanca

and her mother gives her two thousan pounds. I suppose 
this will send her back to you, added to her disappoint- 
ments in politics, in which it appears she has been tamper- 
ing. Don't you remember a very foolish knight, one Sir 
Bouchier Wrey^? Well, you do: the day Lord Bath was 
in the Treasury, that one day ! she wrote to Sir Bouchier at 
Exeter, to tell him that now their friends were coming into 
power, and it was a brave opportunity for him to come up 
and make his own terms. He came, and is lodged in her 
house, and sends about cards to invite people to come and 
see him at the Countess of Orford's. There is a little fracas, 
I hear, in their domestic ; the Abb^-Secretary has got one of 
the maids with child. I have seen the dama herself but 
once these two months, when she came into the Opera at the 
end of the first act, fierce as an incensed turkey-cock, you 
know her look, and towing after her Sir Francis Dashwood's

I HAVE no new triumphs of the Duke to send you : he has 
been detained a great while at Aberdeen bj the snows. The 
rebels have gathered numbers again, and have taken Fort 
Augustus, and are marching to Fort Willianu The Duke 
complains extremely of the hyal Scotch ; says he can get no 
intelligence, and reckons himself more in an enemy's country 
than when he was warring with the French in Flandera 
They profess the big professions wherever he comes, but 
before he is out of sight of any town^ beat up for volunteers 
for rebels. We see no prospect of his return, for he must 
stay in Scotland while the Bebellion lasts ; and the existence 
of that seems too intimately connected with the being of 
Scotland, to expect it should soon be annihilated. 

We rejoice at the victories of the King of Sardinia \ 
whom we thought lost to our cause. To-day we are to vote 
subsidies to the Electors of Cologne and Mentz. I don't 
know whether they will be opposed by the Electoral Prince^; 
but he has lately erected a new opposition, by the councils 
of Lord Bath, who has got him from Lord Granville : the 
latter and his faction act with the court. 

I have told you to the utmost extent of my political 
knowledge ; of private history there is nothing new. Don't 
think, my dear child, that I hurry over my letters, or 
neglect writing to you ; I assure you I never do, when I have

the French privateers have taken such numbers of our

P.S. I had sealed my letter, but break it open, to tell

I don't at all recollect what was in those two letters of

must be impatient for English news, I am sony you grow 
subject to these miscarriages ; but in general, I believe there 
is little of consequence in my correspondence. 

The Duke has not yet left Aberdeen, for want of his 
supplies ; but by a party which he sent out, and in which 
Mr. Conway was, the rebels do not seem to have recovered 
their spirits, though they have recruited their numbers ; for 
eight hundred of them fled on the first appearance of our

aB you know, and as much as you hare lately heard of 
Scotch finesse^ you will yet be startled at the refinements 
that nation have made upon their own pdiicy. Lord Fortrose, 
whose father ' was in the last Bebellion, and who has him-

the rebels. The head of the Mackintosh's is acting just the 
same pari The clan of the Grants, always esteemed the 
most Whig tribe, have literally in all the forms signed 
a neutrdmy with the rebels. The most honest instance 
I have heard, is in the town of Forfar, where they have 
chosen their annual magistrates; but at the same time 
entered a memorandum in their town-book, that they shall 
not execute their office ' till it is decided which King is to 
reign.' 

The Parliament is adjourned for the Easter holidays. 
Princess Caroline is going to the Bath for a rheumatism. 
The Countess, whose return you seem so much to dread, has 
entertained the town with an excellent vulgarism. She 
happened one night at the Opera to sit by Peggy Banks ', 
a celebrated beauty, and asked her several questions about 
the singers and dancers, which the other naturally answered, 
as one woman of fashion answers another. The next 
morning Sir Bouchier Wrey sent Miss Banks an opera- 
ticket, and my lady sent her a card, to thank her for her 
civilities to her the night before, and that she intended to 
wait on her very soon. Do but think of Sir B. Wrey's 
paying a woman of fashion for being civil to my Lady O. !

TouB triumphs in Italy are in high fashion : till very 
lately, Italy was scarce erer mentioned as part of the scene 
of war. The apprehensions of your great Eling making his 
peace began to alarm us ; and when we just belieyed it 
finished, we haye receiyed nothing but torrents of good 
new& The King of Sardinia has not only carried his own 
character and success to the highest pitch, but seems to have 
giyen a turn to the general face of the war, which has a much 
more fayourable aspect than was to be expected three months 
ago. He has made himself as considerable in the scale as 
the Prussian, but with real valour, and as great abilities, 
and without the infamy of the other's politics. 

The Bebellion seems once more at its gasp ; the Duke is 

marched, and the rebels fly before him, in the utmost want 

of money.

to make another great effort^ with an army of abore ninety 
thousand men ; that is, forty Dutch, above thirty Austrians, 
eighteen Hanoverians, the Hessians^ who are to return ;

running so glibly over eighteen thousand Hanoverians,

digestion has been much facilitated by the pill given to

debate on this subject, when we carried these troops by

religion that dispenses with oaths I Pitt was the only one 
of this omifioua band that opened his mouth, and it was to 
add impudence to profligacy ; but no criminal at the Place 
de Gr^ve was ever so racked as he was by Dr. Lee, a Mend 
of Lord Granville, who gave him the question both ordinary 
and extraordinary. 

General Hawley has been tried (not in person, you may 
believe) and condemned by a Scotch jury for murder, on 
hanging a spy. What do you say to this ? or what will you 
say when I tell you, that Ur. Batdiffe, who has been so 
long confined in the Tower, and supposed the Pretender's 
youngest son, is not only suffered to return to France^ but 
was entertained at a great dinner by the Duke of Bichmond 
as a relation ' ! The same Duke has refused his beautiful 
Lady Emily to Lord Kildare \ the richest and the first peer 
of Ireland, on a ridiculous notion of the king's evil being in 
the family — but sure that ought to be no objection : a very 
little grain more of pride and Stuartism might persuade all 
the royal bastards that they have a faculty of curing that 
distemper. 

The other day, an odd accidental discovery was made ; 
some of the Duke's baggage, which he did not want, was 
sent back from Scotland, with a bill of the contents. Soon 
after, another large parcel, but not specified in the bill, was 
brought to the captain, directed like the rest. When they 
came to the Custom House here, it was observed, and they 
sent to Mr. Poyntz ^, to know what they should do : he 
bade them open it, suspecting some trick ; but when they 
did, they found a large crucifix, copes, rich vestments, 
beads, and heaps of such-like trumpery, consigned from the 
titular primate of Scotland, who is wiih the rebels: they

Now I am telling you odd events, I most relate one of j 
the strangest I ever heard. Last week, an elderly woman 
gave Information against her maid for coining, and the trial ; 
came on at the Old Bailey. The mistress deposed, that i 
having been left a widow several years ago, with four ! 
children, and no possibility of maintaining them, she had : 
taken to coining: that she used to buy o]d pewter-pots, out j 
of each of which she made as many shillings, &c, as she ' 
could put off for three pounds, and that by this practice she i 
had bred up her children, bound them out prentices, and J 
set herself up in a little shop, by which she got a comfort- I 
able livelihood ; that she had now given over coining, and \ 
indicted her maid as accomplice. The maid in her defence 
said, * That when her mistress hired her, she told her that 
she did something up in a garret into which she must never 
inquire: that all she knew of the matter was, that her 
mistress had often given her moulds to clean, which she 
did, as it was her duty ; that, indeed, she had sometimes 
seen pieces of pewter-pots cut, and did suspect her mistress 
of coining; but that she never had had, or put ofif, one 
single piece of bad money.' The judge asked the mistress if 
this was true ; she answered, * Tes ; and that she believed 
her maid was as honest a creature as ever lived ; but that, 
knowing herself in her power, she never could be at peace ; 
that she knew, by informing, she should secure herself ; and 
not doubting but the maid's real innocence would appear, 
she concluded the poor girl would come to no hamL* The 
judge flew into the greatest rage; told her he wished he 
could stretch the law to hang her, and feared he could not . 
bring ofif the maid for having concealed the crime ; but, 
however, the jury did bring her in not guilty. I think I never 
heard a more particular instance of parts and villainy.

I met with the other day : ' My thoughts upon the reading 
your letter made me stop in Florence^ and go no farther, 
than to consider the happiness of them who live in that 
town, where the people come so near to angels in know- 
ledge, that they can counterfeit Heaven well enough to give 
their friends a taste of it in this life.' I agree to the happi* 
ness of living in Florence, but I am sure knowledge was 
not one of its recommendations, which never was anywhere 
at a lower ebb— I had forgot ; I beg Dr. Cocohi's pardon, 
who is much an exception ; how does he do ? Adieu I

it be a total yietory' over the rebels; with not only the 
boy, that is here, kiUed, but the other, that is not here,

number of prisoners ; all the Jacobite estates in England 
confiscated, and all those in Scotland — what would you 
have done with them? — or could you be content with 
something much under this? how much will you abate? 
will you compound for Lord John Drummond, taken by 
accident'? or for three Presbyterian parsons, who have 
very poor livings, stoutly refusing to pay a large contri- 
bution to the rebels? Come^ I will deal as well with you 
as I can, and for once, but not to make a practice of it, 
will let you have a victory I My friend. Lord Bury', 
arrived this morning from the Duke^ though the news was 
got here before him ; for, with all our victory, it was not 
thought safe to send him through the heart of Scotland ; 
so he was shipped at Inverness, within an hour after the 
Duke entered the town, kept beating at sea five days, and 
then put on shore at North Berwick, from whence he came 
post in lees than three days to London ; but with a fever 
upon him, for which he had been twice blooded but the 
day before the battle ; but he is young, and high in spirits, 
and I flatter myself will not suffer from this kindness 
of the Duke: the King has immediately ordered him a

I had forgot you have the gout, and consequently not the

the particulars, postpone it. 

On the 16th, the Duke, by forced marches, came up with 
the rebels, a little on this side Inyemess — by the way, the 
battle is not christened yet; I only know that neither 
Prestonpans^ nor Falkirk^ are to be godfathers. The 
rebels, who fled from him after their victory, and durst 
not attack him, when so much exposed to them at his 
passage ' of the Spey, now stood him, they seven thousand, 
he ten. They broke through Barril's regiment, and killed 
Lord Robert Kerr', a handsome young gentleman, who was 
cut to pieces with above thirty wounds ; but they were soon 
repulsed, and fled ; the whole engagement not lasting above 
a quarter of an hour. The young Pretender escaped; 
Mr. Conway says, he hears, wounded : he certamly was in 
the rear. They have lost above a thousand men in the 
engagement and pursuit; and six hundred were already 
taken ; among which latter are their French ambassador^ 
and Earl Kilmarnock^. The Duke of Perth and Lord

I now come to a more melancholy theme, though your 
joy will still be pure, except from what part you take in 
a private grief of mine. It is the death of Mr. Winning* 
ton", whom you only knew as one of the first men in 
England, from his parts and from his employment. But 
I was familiarly acquainted with him, loved and admired 
him, for he had great good-nature, and a quickness of wit 
most peculiar to himself: and for his public talents, he has 
left nobody equal to him, as before, nobody was superior to 
him but my &ther. The history of his death in a cruel 
tragedy, but what, to indulge me who am full of it, and 
want to vent the narration, you must hear. He was not 
quite fifty, extremely temperate and regular, and of a con- 
stitution remarkably strong, hale^ and healthy. A little 
above a fortnight ago he was seized with an inflammatory 
rheumatism, a common and known case, dangerous, but 
scarce ever remembered to be fatal. He had a strong 
aversion to all physicians, and lately had put himself into 
the hands of one Thompson, a quack, whose foundation of 
method could not be guessed, but by a general contradiction 
to all received practice. This man was the oracle of Mrs. 
Masham^*, sister, and what one ought to hope she did not

think o^ eo-heiiQSs to Mr. Winnington : his other edster is 
as mad in Methodism as this in physic, and never saw him. 
This ignorant wretch, supported by the influence of the 
[ sister, soon made such progress in £atal absurdities, as 
I purging, bleeding, and starving him, and checking all per- 
j spiration, that his friends Mr. Fox and Sir Charles Williams 
absolutely insisted on calling in a physician. Whom could 
/ they call, but Dr. Blozholme", an intimate old friend of 
/ Mr. Winnington, and to whose house he always went once 
I a 3rear? This doctor, grown paralytic and indolent, gave 
/ I in to everything the quack advised ; Mis. Masham all the 
while ranting and raving. At last, which at Icui came very 
speedily, they had reduced him to a total dissolution, by 
a diabetes and a thrush ; his friends all the time distracted 
for him, but hindered from assisting him ; so far, that the 
night before he died, Thompson gave him another purge, 
though he could not get it all down. Mr. Fox by force 
brought Dr. Hulse, but it was too late; and even then, 
when Thompson owned him lost, Mrs. Masham was against 
trying Hulse's assistance. In short, madly or wickedly, 
they have murdered ^* a man to whom nature would have 
allotted a far longer period, and had given a degree of 
abilities that were carrying that period to so great a height 
of lustre, as perhaps would have excelled most ministers, 
who in this country have owed their greatness to the great-

I HATB had nothing new to tell you since the yictory, 
relative to it, but that it has entirely put an end to the 
Sebellion. The number slain is generally believed much 
greater than is given oui Old TuUybardine* has sur* 
rendered himself ; the Lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino ', and 
Ogilvie ' are prisoners, and coming up to their trials. The 
Pretender is not openly taken, but many people think he 
is in their power ; however, I dare say he will be allowed 
to escape ; and some French ships are hovering about the 
coast to receive him. The Duke is not yet returned, but 
we have amply prepared for his reception, by settling on 
him immediately and for ever twenty-five thousand pounds 
a year, besides the fifteen which he is to have on the King's 
death. It was imagined that the Prince would have 
opposed this, on the reflection that fifteen thousand was 
thought enough for him, though heir of the Grown, and 
abounding in issue : but he has wisely reflected forwards, 
and likes the precedent, as it will be easy to find victories 
in his sons to reward, when once they have a precedent to 
fight with.

It was a very unpleasant reason for my not hearing from 
you last post, that you was ill ; but I have had a letter 
from you since of May 24th9 that has made me easy again 
for your health : if you was not losing the good Chutes, 
I should have been quite satisfied ; but that is a loss you 
will not easily repair, though I were to recommend you 
H/s^ every day. Sure you must have had flights of strange 
awkward animals, if you can be so taken with him ! I shall 
begin to look about me, to see the merits of England : he 
was no curiosity here; and yet Heaven knows there are

I am much obliged to you for the care you take in sending

We are in the height of festivities for the Serenity of 
Hesse, our son-in-law, who passes a few days here on his 
return to Germany. If you recollect Lord Elcho, you have 
a perfect idea of his person and parts. The great officers 
banquet him at dinner; in the evenings there are plays, 
operas, ridottos, and masquerades. 

You ask me to pity you for losing the Chutes: indeed 
I do ; and I pity them for losing you. They will often miss 
Florence, and its tranquillity and happy air. Adieu ! Com-

you won't allow my letters to be letters. Jesus I it sounds

22]. To George Montagu. 

Dear Geoeoe, Arlington Street, June 17, 1746. 

I wrote to you on Friday night, as soon as I could after 
receiving your letter, with a list of the regiments to go 
abroad ; one of which, I hear since, is your brother's. I am 
extremely sorry it is his fortune, as I know the distress it 
will occasion in your £uni1y. 

For the politics which you inquire after, and which may 
have given motion to this step, I can give you no satis- 
factory answer. I have heard that it is in consequence 
of an impertinent letter sent over by Van Hoey in favour 
of the rebels, though at the same time I hear we are 
making steps towards a peace ! There centre all my politics, 
all in peace! Whatever your cousin* may think, I am 
neither busy about what does happen, nor making parties 
for what may. If he knew how happy I am, his intriguing 
nature would envy my tranquillity more than his suspicions 
can make him jealous of my practices. 

Hy books, my virtu, and my other follies and amusements 
take up too much of my time to leave me much leisure to 
think of other people's affairs ; and of all affairs, those of 
the public are least my concern* 

You will be sorry to hear of Augustus Townshend's* 
death. I lament it extremely, not much for his sake, for 
I did not honour him, but for his poor sister MoUy's", whose

considering how delicate her health is. My I^dy T. has

of her child's distress, she kept me half an hour with 
a thousand histories of Lady Caroline Fitzroy and Major 
Johnson, and the new Paymaster's^ manage, and twenty 
other things, nothing to me, nor to her, if she could drop 
the idea of the Pay-Offioe. She said well to the Duchess of 
Bedford t'other day, who told her the Duke was wind-bound

We are impatient for letters from Italy, to confirm the

time is critical, and every triumph or defeat material, as 
they may raise or fall the terms of peace. The wonderful 
letters of Van Hoey and M. d'Argenson ', in favour of the 
rebels, but which, if the ministry have any spirit, must 
turn to their harm, you will see in all the papers. They 
have rather put off the negotiations, and caused the sending 
five thousand men this week to Flanders. The Duke is 
not yet returned firom Scotland, nor is anything certainly

power of speaking to him : I neyer heard a more melan-

Paris to Lord Lincoln to solicit his pardon ; but as he has 
distinguished himself beyond all the rebel commanders by 
brutality and insults and cruelty to our prisoners, I think 
he IB likely to remain where he is. 

Jack Spencer ^ old Marlborough's grandson and heir, is

Lord Brook, and Lord Clinton; but I don't know that 
this will be, because it is not past 

Tidings are every minute expected of a great searfight ; 
Martin is got between the coast and the French fleet, which 
has sailed from Brest. The victory in Italy is extremely 
big; but as none of my friends are aide-de-campe there, 
I know nothing of the particulars, except that the French 
and Spaniards have lost ten thousand men. 

All the inns about town are crowded with rebel prisoners, 
and people are making parties of pleasure, which you know 
is the English genius, to hear their trials. The Scotch, 
which you know is the Scotch genius, are loud in censuring 
the Duke for his great severities in the Highlands. 

The great business of the town is Jack Spencer's will, 
who has left Althrop and the Sunderland estate in reversion 
to Pitt ; after more obligations and more pretended friend- 
ship for his brother, the Duke, than is conceivable. The 
Duke is in the utmost uneasiness about it, having left the 
drawing of the writings for the estate to his brother and 
his grandmother, and without having any idea that himself 
was cut out of the entail. An additional circumstance of 
iniquity is that he had given a bond for Mr. Spencer for 
four thousand pound, which now he must pay, and the 
will and the bond are dated within three days of one 
another. 

I have heard nothing yet of Augustus Townshend's will : 
my Lady, who you know hated him, came from the Opera 
t'other night, and on pulling off her gloves, and finding 
her hands all black, said immediately, 

My hands are guilty, but my heart is free. 

Another good thing she said to the Duchess of Bedford, 
who told her the Duke was wind-bound at Yarmouth, 
' Lord ! he will hate Norfolk as much as I do.' 



1746] To George Montagu 207 

I wish, my dear George, you could meet with any man 
that could copy the Beauties in the Castle*: I did not 
care if it were even in Indian ink. Will you inquire? 
Eckardt has done your picture excellently welL What 
shall I do with the original ? Leave it with him till you 
come? 

Lord Bath and Lord Sandys have had their pockets 
picked at Guper's Gardens \ I fancy it was no bad 
scene, the ayarioe and jealousy of their peeresses on their 
return. 

A terrible disgraeia happened to Earl Cholmondeley / 
t'other night at Banelagh« Tou know all the history of j 
his letters to borrow money to pay for damask for his fine j 
room at Richmond. As he was going in, in the crowd, 
a woman offered him rosea — ^ Bight damask^ my Lord!' 
He concluded she had been put upon it. I was told, 
apropos, a hon^moi on the scene in the opera, where there 
is a view of his new room, and the fiurmer comes dancing 
out and shaking his purse ; somebody said, there was 
a tradesman had unexpectedly got his money. 

I think I deal in hon^mois to-day. Ill tell you now 
another, but don't print my letter in a new edition of Joe 
Miller's jests. The Duke has given Brigadier Hordaunt^ 
the Pretender's coach, on condition he rode up to London 
in it. ' That I will. Sir,' said he^ 'and drive till it stops 
of its own accord at the Cocoa Tree *.'

I wish extremely to accept your invitation, but I can't 
bring myself to it* If I have the pleasure of meeting Lord 
North ^ offcener at your house next winter, I do not know 
but another summer I may have courage enough to make 
him a visit ; but I have no notion of going to anybody's 
house, and have the servants look on the arms of the chaise 
to find out one's name, and learn one's hce from the 
Saracen's head. Tou did not tell me how long you stayed 
at Wroxton, and so I direct this thither. I have wrote one 
to Windsor since you left it. 

The new earls* have kissed hands, and kept their own 
titles. Dirty little Brook has taken no second title, to save 
three hundred pound, so, if ever he gets a little Brookling, 
it must be called Lord Grevil, and can never be called up to 
the House of Lords. The world reckon Earl Clinton obliged 
for his new honour to Lord Granville, though they made 
the Duke of Newcastle go in to ask it. 

Yesterday Mr. Hussey's friends declared his marriage with 
her Grace of Manchester', and said he was gone down to 
Englefield Green to take possession. I own that circum- 
stance makes it a little suspicious, for by what I saw of the 
palace there, and what one has heard of him, there is no 
room for even the material part of him.

times more extraordinary — it is Lord Coke with Lady Maiy

225. To HoBACJE Mann. 

Arlington Siroet, July 7, 1746. 

I HAVE been looking at the dates of my letters, and find 
that I have not written to you since the 20th of last month. 
As long as it seems, I am not in fault ; I now write merely 
lest you should think me forgetful of you, and not because 
I have anything to say. Nothing great has happened ; and 
for little politics, I live a good deal out of the way of them. 
I have no manner of connection with any ministry, or 
opposition to ministry ; and their merits and their faults are 
equally a secret to me. The Parliament sitting so long has 
worn itself to a skeleton ; and almost everybody takes the 
opportunity of shortening their stay in the country, which 
I believe in their hearts most are glad to do, by going down, 
and returning for the trials, which are to be on the 28th of 
this month. I am of the number ; so don't expect to hear 
from me again till that sera. 

The Duke is still in Scotland, doing his fiunily the only 
service that has been done for them there since their acces- 
sion. He daily picks up notable prisoners, and has lately 
taken Lord Lovat \ and Murray the secretary *. There are

flying reports of the boy being killed, but I think not 
certain enough for the father to £unt away again * — I bhune 
myself for speaking lightly of the old man's distress ; but 
a swoon is so natural to his character, that one smiles at it 
at first, without considering when it proceeds from cowardice, 
and when from misery. I heard yesterday that we are to 
expect a battle in Flanders soon : I expect it with all the 
tranquillity that the loye of one's country admits, when one's 
heart is entirely out of the question, as, thank Qod ! mine 
is : not one of my firiends will be in it. I wish it may be 
as magnificent a victory for us, as your giwmata di San

212 To Henry Fox [i746 

M J entertaining myself without music, which I don't love, and 
without seeing a thousand people for whom I don't care a 
straw; hut haying heen so unfortunate as neither to kill 
a brace of partridges, nor hook a dish of whitings, I am 
reduced to flatter her in a way as extraordinary as the other 
of recommending one's self by being natural and unaffected, 
to a woman who has been bred up in the kingdom of 
Henreys, Diveses, and Queensburys. Lady Caroline will 
give me leave to wonder at her being so awkward as to like 
to hear Lady Emily ' commended rather than herself ; and 
even you, who are so fond of that uncouth sense of hers, 
may be amazed that she thinks her sister handsomer than 
herself : but since she is so ungenteel, and has so many of 
those strange properties called good qualities, which being 
out of fashion and out of character, I can't help reckoning a 
want of knowing the world, I have e'en humoured her in 
her own way, and said of her sister what, if she had been 
like other people, I should naturally have said of herself. 

I wish, my dear Harry, you loved Lady Emily as well as 
your wife does, and then I should have no excuses to make 
for sending you the enclosed lines ', which I command Lady 
Caroline to like on pain of Dayrolles's^ eternal displeasure, 
but as a fit of poetry is a distemper which I am never 
troubled with but in the country, you will have no reason 
to apprehend much trouble of this sort : the trees at Yauxhall 
and purling basons of goldfish never inspire me. 

I can fairly say at least that Bigby makes me send you

the obliging things you say to me please me vastly. I find 
I have enough of the author in me to be extremely sensible 
to flattery, and were I iaa enough gone to publish a mis- 
cellany, there would certainly be one copy to my honoured 
friend Henry Fox on his commending my verses. But seriously, 
my dear Sir, you alarm me, with talking of making those I 
sent you public. I never thought poetry excusable but in 
the manner I sent you mine, just to divert anybody one 
loves for half an hour — and I know I must love anybody, 
to put myself so much in their power for their diversion. 
But to make anything one writes, especially poetry, public, 
is giving everybody leave under one's own hand to call one 
fooL You think me modest, but all my modesty is pride ; 
while I am unknown, I am as great as my own imagination 
pleases to make me ; the instant I get into that dreadful 
Ck>urt of Bequests you talk of, I am as silly a fellow as 
Thomson or Glover, — you even reduce me to plead that 
foolish excuse against being published, which authors make 
to excuse themselves when they have published, — that their 
compositions were made in a hurry or extempore. Bigby 
will assure you that what I sent you was literally wrote in 
less than three hours ; and, my dear Harry, I am not vain 
enough to think that I can write in three hours what would 
deserve to live three days. I will give you two more very 
material reasons for your suppressing my verses, and have 
done : one is, I don't care to make all the women in England 
my enemies, but sixteen, as their resentments would prob- 
ably hurt me more than the gratitude of my goddesses 
would do me good, with all their charms; and the other 
reason is, that the conclusion of the poem is more particular 
than I would choose publicly to subscribe to. 

I am content with your approbation and Lady Caroline's :

pray tell her the reason I said so little of Lady Emily in 
detail was what the critics^ a set of gentlemen she is happily 
not acquainted with, say in excuse for the heroes of the epic 
poems, who are yery little talked of in comparison with 
their livalsy but who are supposed to be celebrated enough, 
by surpassing those who are more amply commended; or 
you may tell her what will be more familiar to her than 
Homer and Virgil, that if I had said Mrs, Bethel ' was the 
ugliest woman in the world, I should not have specified her 
nose, her mouth, or her complexion. For the last line on 
Lady Emily, which you don't understand, it only means 
that it is a pity she is not as like Venus in being a mother, 
as she is in the rest of her merits. 

I beg your pardon for troubling you with a second letter 
so long, when I shall be in town the day after it, but I was 
so anxious about your talking of making my verses public, 
that I could not refrain a moment from begging you not. 
Rigby has left his kindest love for you : he is gone to a 
cricket-match, from which your letter has saved me. You 
have commended me so much, he begins to look on me in a 
higher light, and even deigns to treat my leisure as sacred. 

I am, my dear Sir, and always shall be, if you will sup> 

press my verses.

mo8t interesting sight, it was the most solemn and fine : a 
coronation is a puppet-show, and all the splendour of it idle ; 
but this sight at once feasted one's eyes and engaged all 
one's passions. It began last Monday ; three parts of West- 
minster Hall were inclosed with galleries, and hung with 
scarlet; and the whole ceremony was conducted with the 
most awful solemnity and decency, except in the one point 
of leaving the prisoners at the bar, amidst the idle curiosity 
of some crowd, and even with the witnesses who had sworn 
against them, while the Lords adjourned to their own House 
to consult. No part of the royal family was there, which 
was a proper regard to the unhappy men, who were become 
their victims. One hundred and thirty-nine Lords were 
present, and made a noble sight on their benches frequefU 
and JuU! The Chancellor^ was Lord High Steward; but 
though a most comely personage with a fine voice, his 
behaviour was mean, curiously searching for occasion to 
bow to the minister ' that is no peer, and constantly applying 
to the other ministers, in a manner, for their orders ; and 
not even ready at the ceremonial. To the prisoners he was 
peevish ; and instead of keeping up to the humane dignity 
of the law of England, whose character it is to point out 
favour to the criminal, he crossed them, and almost scolded 
at any offer they made towards defence. I had armed my- 
self with all the resolution I could, with the thought of their 
crimes and of the danger past, and was assisted by the sight 
of the Marquis of Lothian * in weepers for his son ^ who fell 
at GuUoden — but the first appearance of the prisoners 
shocked me I their behaviour melted me ! Lord Kilmarnock 
and Lord Gromartie are both past forty, but look younger.

person : his behaviour a most just mixture between dignity 
and submission ; if in an3rthing to be reprehended, a little 
affected, and his hair too exactly dressed for a man in his 
situation ; but when I say this, it is not to find £Etult with 
him, but to show how little &ult there was to be found. 
Lord Cromartie is an indifferent figure, appeared much 
dejected, and rather sullen : he dropped a few tears the first 
day, and swooned as soon as he got back to his cell. For 
Lord Balmerino, he is the most natural brave old fellow 
I ever saw: the highest intrepidity, even to indifference. 
At the bar he behaved like a soldier and a man; in the .'.5 
intervals of form, with carelessness and humour. He 
pressed extremely to have his wife, his pretty Peggy ^ with 
him in the Tower. But the instant she came to him, he 
stripped her and went to bed. Lady Cromartie only sees 
her husband through the grate, not choosing to be shut up 
with him, as she thinks she. can serve him better by her 
intercession without : she is^ig with child and/ery hand- 
some: so are their daughters. When they were to be 
brought from the Tower in separate coaches, there was some 
dispute in which the axe must go— old Balmerino cried, 
' Come, come, put it with me.' At the bar, he plays with 
his fingers upon the axe, while he talks to the gentleman- 
gaoler ; and one day somebody coming up to listen, he took 
the blade and held it like a fan between their &ces. During 
the trial, a little boy was near him, but not tall enough to 
see; he made room for the child and placed him near 
himself. 

When the trial began, the two Earls pleaded guilty; 
Balmerino not guilty, sajring he could prove his not being 
at the taking of the castle of Carlisle, as was laid in the 
indictment. Then the King's counsel opened, and Serjeant

whom afterwards the old hero shook cordially by the hand. 
The Lords withdrew to their House, and returning, demanded 
of the judges, whether one point not being proved, though 
all the rest were, the indictment was false ? to which they 
unanimously answered in the negative. Then the Lord 
High Steward asked the Peers severally, whether Lord 
Balmerino was guilty I All said, ' guilty upon honour,' and 
then adjourned, the prisoner having begged pardon for giving 
them so much trouble. While the Lords were withdrawn, 
the Solicito]>G^neral Murray (brother of the Pretender's 
minister") officiously and insolently went up to Lord Bal- 
merino, and asked him, how he could give the Lords so 
much trouble, when his solicitor had informed him that his 
plea could be of no use to him? Balmerino asked the 
bystanders who this person was ? and being told, he said, 
' Oh, Mr. Hurray I I am extremely glad to see you ; I have 
been with several of your relations ; the good lady, your 
mother', was of great use to us at Perth.' Are not you 
charmed with this speech ? how just it was ! As he went 
away, he said, 'They call me Jacobite; I am no more a 
Jacobite than any that tried me : but if the Oreat Mogul 
had set up his standard, I should have followed it, for I 
could not starva' The worst of his case is, that after the 
battle of Dunblain^^ having a company in the Duke of

since been pardoned. Lord Kihnamock is a Presbyterian,

Hall, to receiye sentence ; and being asked what they had to 
say, Lord Eilmamock, with a fine yoice, read a very fine 
speech, confessing the extent of his crime, but offering his 
principles as some alleviation, having his eldest son " (his 
second^' unluckily was with him), in the Duke's army, 
fighting for the Ubertiea of his country at CuHoden, where his 
unhapi^ father was in arms to destroy them. He insisted 
much on his tenderness to the English prisoners, which 
some deny, and say that he was the man who proposed 
their being put to death, when General Stapleton urged that 
he was come to fight, and not to butcher ; and that if they 
acted any such barbarity, he would leave them with all his 
men. He very artfully mentioned Van Hoey's letter, and 
said how much he should scorn to owe his life to such inter- 
cession. Lord Gromartie spoke much shorter, and so low, 
that he was not heard but by those who sat very near him ; 
but they prefer his speech to the other. He mentioned his 
misfortune in having drawn in his eldest son, who is prisoner 
with h\m ; and concluded with sajdng, * If no part of this 
bitter cup must pass from me, not mine, O God, but Thy will 
be done I ' If he had pleaded not guiUy, there was ready to 
be produced against him a paper signed with his own hand, 
for putting the English prisoners to death. 

Lord Leicester went up to the Duke of Newcastle, and 
said, ' I never heard so great an orator as Lord Kilmarnock !

the Tower for the prigoners ; he gave it to Lord Gomwallis ^^ 
the goyemor, who carried it to the House of Lords. It was 
a plea for the prisoners, objecting that the late Act for regu- 
lating the trials of rebels did not take place till after their 
crime was committed. The Lords very tenderly and rightly 
sent this plea to them, of which, as you have seen, the two 
Earls did not make use ; but old Balmerino did, and demanded 
counsel on it The High Steward, almost in a passion, told 
him, that when he had been offered counsel, he did not 
accept it. Do but think on the ridicule of sending them 
the plea, and then denying them counsel on it ! The Duke 
of Newcastle, who never lets slip an opportunity of being 
absurd, took it up as a ministerial point, in defence of his 
creature the Chancellor ; but Lord Granville moved, according 
to order, to adjourn to debate in the chamber of Parliament, 
where the Duke of Bedford and many others spoke warmly 
for their having counsel ; and it was granted. I said iheiry 
because the plea would have saved them all, and affected 
nine rebels who had been hanged that very morning; 
particularly one Morgan*^, a poetical lawyer. Lord Balmerino 
asked for Forester and Wilbraham ** ; the latter a very able 
lawyer in the House of Commons, who, the Chancellor said 
privately, he was sure would as soon be hanged as plead 
such a cause. But he came as counsel to-day (the third day), 
when Lord Balmerino gave up his plea as invalid, and sub- 
mitted, without any speech. The High Steward then made 
his, very long and very poor, with only one or two good 
passages ; and then pronounced sentence !

the Eixig's hand, and ask Lord Kilmarnock's life. The 
King is much inclined to some mercy ; but the Duke, who 
has not so much of GsBsar after a yictory, as in gaining it, is 
for the utmost severity. It was lately proposed in the City 
to present him with the freedom of some company ; one of 
the aldermen said aloud, 'Then let it be of the Butchers!' 
The Scotch and his Royal Highness are not at all guarded 
in their expressions of each other. When he went to Edin- 
burgh, on his pursuit of the rebels, they would not admit 
his guards, alleging that it was contrary to their privileges ; 
but they rode in, sword in hand ; and the Duke, very justly 
incensed, refused to see any of the magistrates. He came 
with the utmost expedition to town, in order for Flanders ; 
but found that the court of Vienna had already sent Prince 
Charles thither, without the least notification, at which both 
King and Duke are greatly offended. When the latter waited 
on his brother, the Prince carried him into a room that hangs 
over the wall of St James's Park, and stood there with his 
arm about his neck, to charm the gazing mob. 

Murray, the Pretender's secretary, has made ample con- 
fessions : the Earl of Traquair^ and Dr. Barry, a ph3n9ician, 
are apprehended, and more warrants are out ; so much for 
rebels! Your friend. Lord Sandwich, is instantly going

You have lost nothing by missing yesterday at the trials, 
but a little additional contempt for the High Steward ; and 
even that is recoverable, as his long paltry speech is to be 
printed; for which, and for thanks for it, Lord Lincoln 
moved the House of Lord& Somebody said to Sir Charles 
Windham, 'Oh I you don't think Lord Hardwicke's speech 
good, because you have read Lord Cowper's^' — * No,' replied 
he ; ' but I do think it tolerable, because I heard Seijeant 
Skinner'a' Poor brave old Balmerino retracted his plea, 
asked pardon, and desired the Lords to intercede for mercy. 
As he returned to the Tower, he stopped the coach at 
Charing Cross to buy honey-blobs, as the Scotch call goose- 
berries. He says he is extremely afraid Lord Kilmarnock 
will not behave well. The Duke said publicly at his levee, 
that the latter proposed the murdering the English prisoners. 
His Highness was to have given Peggy Banks a ball last 
night ; but was persuaded to defer it, as it would have rather 
looked like an insult on the prisoners, the very day their 
sentence was passed. Qeorge Selwyn says that he had begged 
Sir William Saunderson ' to get him the Lord High Steward's 
wand, after it was broke, as a curiosity ; but that he behaved 
so like an attorney the first day, and so like a pettifogger the 
second, that he would not take it to light his fire with: 
I don't believe my Lady Hardwicke is so high-minded. 

Tour cousin Sandwich is certainly going on embassy to 
Holland. I don't know whether it is to qualify him, by 
new dignity, for the head of the Admiralty, or whether 
(which is more agreeable to present policy) to satisfy him

have ten sons, though he has none yet, asked to have his

order to silence the avidity of his faction.

with you, and therefore en attendant Hurley House^ if you

say, ^ex qwms lignoJU Mereurius.' 

Murray' has certainly been discovering, and warrants are 
out ; but I don't yet know who are to be their prize. I begin 
to think that the ministry had really no intelligence till now. 
I before thought they had, but durst not use it Apropos to 
fwi daring ; I went t'other night to look at my poor favourite 
Chelsea ', for the little mad Newcastle * is gone to be dipped 
in the sea. In one of the rooms is a bed for her Duke, 
and a press bed for his footman ; for he never dares lie 
alone, and, tiU he was married, had always a servant set 
up with him. 

Lady Cromartie presented her petition to the King last 
Sunday. He was very civil to her, but would not at all 
give her any hopea She swocmed away as so<»i as he was 
gone. Lord Comwallis told me that her lord weeps every 
time anjrthing of his fate is mentioned to him. Old 
Balmerino keeps up his spirits to the same pitch of gaiety. 
In the cell at Westminster he showed Lord Ealmamock 
how he must lay his head ; bid him not winch, lest the 
stroke should cut his skull or his shoulders, and advised 
him to bite his lips. As they were to return, he begged 
they might have another bottle together, as they should 

never meet any more till , and then pointed to his 

neck. At getting into the coach, he said to the gaoler, 
* Take care, or you will break my shins with this damned 
axe.'

I am assured that the old Countess of ErroP made her 
son Lord Kilmarnock go into the Behellion on pain of 
disinheriting him. I don't know whether I told you that 
the man at the tennis-court protests that he has known him 
dine with the man that sells pamphlets at Storejr's €kte ; 
'and,' says he, 'he would often have heen glad if I would 
have taken him home to dinner.' He was certainly 
so poor, that in one of his wife's intercepted letters she 
tells him she has plagued their steward for a fortnight for 
money, and can get but three shillings. Can one help 
pitying such distress? I am vastly softened, too, about 
old Balmerino's relapse, for his pardon was only granted 
him to engage his brother's* vote at the election of Scotch 
peers. 

My Lord Chancellor has had a thousand pound in present 
for his High Stewardship, and has got the reversion of Clerk 
of the Crown (twelve hundred a year) for his second son' —

We have been a little lucky lately in the deaths of Kings, 
and promise ourselves great matters from the new monarch

drink the Bath waters ; that is the pretence for leaving her 
brutal husband, and for visiting the Duke and Princess 
Caroline, who love her extremely. She is of the softest, 
mildest temper in the world. 

We know nothing certainly of the young Pretender, but 
that he is concealed in Scotland, and devoured with dis- 
tempers : I really wonder how an Italian constitution can 
have supported such rigours I He has said, that ' he did not 
see what he had to be ashamed of ; and that if he has lost 
one battle, he had gained two.' Old Lovat curses Cope and 
Hawley for the loss of those two, and says, if they had done 
their duty, he had never been in this scrape. Cope is 
actually going to be tried ; but Hawley, who is fifty times 
more culpable, is saved by partiality: Cope miscarried by 
incapacity ; Hawley, by insolence and carelessness. 

Lord Cromartie is reprieved; the Pri&ce asked his life, 
and his wife made great intercession/though when he was

Duke Hamilton's intercession for Lord Kilmarnock has 
rather hurried him to the block. : he and Lord Balmerino 
are to die next Monday. Lord Kilmarnock, with the greatest 
nobleness of soul, desired to have Lord Cromartie preferred 
to himself for pardon, if there could be but one saved ,- and 
Lord Balmerino laments that he himself and Lord Lovat 
were not taken at the same time ; 'for then,' says he, 'we 
might have been sacrificed, and those other two brave men 
escaped.' Indeed Lord Cromartie does not much deserve

Pretender ; protesting that he had never feared death but 
that day, as he had been fighting against his conscience. 
Popularity has changed sides since the year '15, for now the 
City and the generality are very angry that so many rebels 
have been pardoned. Some of those taken at Carlisle 
dispersed papers at their execution, saying they forgave all 
men but three, the Elector of Hanover, the pretended Duke

I know how to send the bantams by it, but will leave them

I have been this morning at the Tower, and passed 
under the new heads at Temple Bar, where people make a 
trade of letting spying-glasses at a halfpenny a look. Old 
Lovat arrived last night. I saw Hurray, Lord Derwent- 
water, Lord Traquair, Lord Gromartie and his son, and 
the Lord Provost* at their respective windowa The other 
two wretched Lords are in dismal towers, and they have 
stopped up one of old Balmerino's windows because he 
talked to the populace; and now he has only one, which 
looks directly upon all the scaffolding. They brought in 
the death-warrant at his dinner. His wife fainted. He 
said, 'Lieutenant, with your damned warrant you have 
spoiled my Lady's stomach.' He has wrote a sensible letter 
to the Duke to beg his intercession, and the Duke has given 
it to the King; but gave a much colder answer to Duke 
Hamilton, who went to beg it for Lord Kilmarnock: he 
told him the affair was in the King's hands, and that he 
had nothing to do with it. Lord Kilmarnock, who has 
hitherto kept up his spirits, grows extremely terrified. It 
will be difficult to make you believe to what heights of 
affectation or extravagance my Lady Townshend carries her 
passion for my Lord Kilmarnock, whom she never saw but 
at the bar of his trial, and was smit with his falling 
shoulders. She has been under his window; sends mes* 
sages to him ; has got his dog and his snuff-box ; has taken 
lodgings out of town for to-morrow and Monday night, 
and then goes to Greenwich ; forswears conversing with the

insisted on Lord Heryey's promising her he would not 
sleep a whole night for my Lord Eilmamock, 'and in 
return,' says she, ' never trust me more if I am not as 
yellow as a jonquil for him.' She said gravely t'other day, 
' Since I saw my Lord Eilmamocky I really think no more 
of Sir Harry Nisbett than if there was no such man in the 
world.' But of all her flights, yesterday was the strongest 
G^i^e Selwyn dined with her, and not thinking her 
afiUction so entirely serious as she pretends, talked rather 
jokingly of the execution. She burst into a flood of tears 
and rage; told him she now believed all his father and 
mother had said of him; and with a thousand other re- 
proaches flung upstairs. George coolly took Mrs. Dorcas, 
her woman, and made her sit down to finish the bottle: 
' And pray, sir,' said Dorcas, ' do you think my Lady will be 
prevailed upon to let me go see this execution ? I have a 
friend that has promised to take care of me, and I can lie in 
the Tower the night before.' — My Lady has quarrelled with 
Sir Charles Windham for calling the two Lords nwiUfiicton, 
— The idea seems to be general ; for 'tis said Lord Cromartie 
is to be transported^ which diverts me for the dignity of the 
peerage. The ministry really gave it as a reason against 
their casting lots for pardon, that it was below their dignity. 
I did not know but that might proceed from Balmerino's 
not being an earl; and therefore, now their hand is in, 
would have them make him one. 

You will see in the papers the second great victory at

You will perceive by my date that I am got into a new

with me in the back part of my lozenge-coach \ and to be

I came from town ( for take notice, I put this place upon

rebel lords: I was not at it, but had two persons come 
to me directly who were at the next house to the scaffold : 
and I saw another who was upon it^ so that you may depend 
upon my accounts. 

Just before they came out of the Tower, Lord Balmerino 
drank a bumper to King James's health. As the clock 
struck ten, they came forth on foot. Lord Elilmamock all in 
black, his hair unpowdered in a bag, supported by Forster', 
the great Presbyterian, and by Mr. Home, a young clergy-

They were conducted to a house near the scaffold : the room

they parted 1 Balmerino embraced the other, and said, 
' My lord, I wish I could suffer for both ! ' He had scarce 
left him, before he desired again to see him, and then asked 
him, * My Lord Kilmarnock, do you know anything of the 
resolution taken in our army, the day before the battle of 
Gulloden, to put the English prisoners to death?' He 
replied, 'My Lord, I was not present; but since I came 
hither, I have had aU the reason in the world to believe 
that there was such order taken ; and I hear the Duke has

was a lie raised to excuse their barbarity to us.' — Take 
notice, that the Duke's charging this on Lord Ealmamock 
(certainly on misinformation) decided this unhappy man's 
&te ! The most now pretended is, that it would have oome 
to Lord Kilmarnock's turn to hafe given the word for the 
slaughter, as lieutenant-general, with the patent for which 
he was immediately drawn into the Rebellion, after having 
been staggered by his wife*, her mother ^ his own poverty, 
and the defeat of Cope. He remained an hour and a half in 
the house, and shed tears* At last he came to the scaffold, 
certainly much terrified, but with a resolution that pre- 
vented his behaving in the least meanly or unlike a gentle- 
man. He took no notice of the crowd, only to desire that 
the baize might be lifted up from the rails, that the mob might 
see the spectacle. He stood and prayed some time with 
Forster, who wept over him, exhorted and encouraged him.

He deliyered a long speech to the Sheriff, and with a noble 
Bianlineas stuck to the recantation he had made at his trial ; 
declaring he wished that all who embarked in the same ' 
cause might meet the same fate. He then took off his bag, ' 
coat and waistcoat, with great composure, and after some 
trouble put on a napkin-cap, and then several times tried / 
the block; the executioner, who was in white, with a' 
white apron, out of tenderness concealing the axe behind 
himsel£ At last the Earl knelt down, with a visible un-; 
willingness to depart, and after five minutes dropped his 
handkerchief the signal, and his head was cut off at once, 
only h^Tigifig by a bit of skin, and was received in a scarlet 
«loth by four of the undertaker's men kneeling, who 
wrapped it up and put it into the coffin with the body ; 
orders having been given not to expose the heads, as vsed 
to be the custom. 

The scaffold was immediately new-strewed with sawdust, 
the block new-covered, the executioner new-dressed, and 
a new axe brought Then came old Balmerino, treading 
with the air of a general. As soon as he mounted the 
scaffold, he read the inscription on his coffin, as he did 
again afterwards: he then surveyed the spectators, who 
were in amazing numbers, even upon masts of ships in the 
river; and pulling out his spectacles read a treasonable 
speech, which he delivered to the Sheriff, and said the 
young Pretender was so sweet a Prince, that flesh and 
blood could not resist following him; and lying down to 
try the block, he said, 'If I had a thousand lives, I would 
lay them all down here in the same cause/ He said, if he 
had not taken the sacrament the day before, he would have 
knocked down Williamson, the Lieutenant of the Tower, for • 
his ill usage of him. He took the axe and felt it, and asked 
the headsman how many blows he had given Lord Kilmar- 
nock ; and gave him three guineas. Two clergymen, who 



238 To Horace Mann [1746 

attended him, coming up, he said, ' No, gentlemen, I believe 
you have already done me all the service you can.' Then 
he went to the comer of the scaffold, and called very loud 
for the warder, to give him his perriwig, which he took off, 
and put on a night-cap of Scotch plaid, and then pulled off 
- his coat and waistcoat and lay down ; but being told he 
was on the wrong side, vaulted round, and immediately 
gave the sign by tossing up his arm, as if he were giving 
the signal for battle. He received three blows, but the first 
certainly took away all sensation. He was not a quarter 
of an hour on the scaffold; Lord Ealmamock above half 
a one. Balmerino certainly died with the intrepidity of 
a hero, but with the insensibility of one too. As he walked 
from his prison to execution, seeing every window and top 
of house filled with spectators, he cried out, 'Look, look, 
how they are all piled up like rotten oranges !' 

My Lady Townshend, who fell in love with Lord Kilmar- 
nock at his trial, will go nowhere to dinner, for fear of 
meeting with a rebel-pie ; she says, everybody is so bloody- 
minded, that they eat rebels I The Prince of Wales, whose 
intercession saved Lord Oromartie, says he did it in return 
for old Sir W. * (Lady Cromartie*s father), coming down out 
of his death-bed to vote against my fiither in the Chippen- 
ham election. If his Royal Highness had not countenanced 
inveteracy like that of Sir GK>rdon, he would have no 
occasion to exert his gratitude now in favour of rebels. 
His brother has plucked a very useful feather out of the cap 
of the ministry, by forbidding any application for posts in 
the army to be made to anybody but himself: a resolution, 
I dare say, he will keep as strictly and minutely as he does 
the discipline and dress of the army. Adieu !

WincUor, Sept 16, 1746. 
Ton have sent me Marquis Binuncini with as much 
secrecy as if you had sent me a present I was here : there 
came an exceedingly fair written and civil letter from you, 
dated last May : I comprehended by the formality of it, that 
it was written for the person who brought it, not for the 
person it was sent to. I have been to town on purpose to 
wait on him, and though you know he was not of my set, 
yet being of Florence, and recommended by you, and recol- 
lecting how you used to cuddle over a bit of politics with 
the old Marquis^, I set myself to be wondrous civil to 
Marquis Folco ; pray, fiiites vdloir mapolitesse ! Tou have no 
occasion to let people know exactly the situation of my villa ; 
but talk of my standing in campagna, and coming directly in

literally an entire week with him, carried him to see palaces 
and Richmond Gardens and Park, and Chenevix's shop, and 
talked a great deal to him alle conversaeionu It is a wretched 
time for him ; there is not a soul in town ; no plays ; and 
Ranelagh shut up. Tou may say I should have stayed 
longer with him, but I was obliged to return for fear of 
losing mtf vintage. I shall be in London again in a fort-

I was glad to see him — after I had got over being sorry to

Tour two last were of Aug. 23rd and 30th. In the latter 
you talk of the execution of the rebel lords, but don't tell me 
whether you received my long history of their trials. Tour 
Florentines guessed very rightly about my Lady O.'s reasons 
for not returning amongst you : she has picked up a Mr. 
Shirley', no great genius — ^but witli all her affectation of 
parts, you know she never was delicate about the capacity of 
her lovers. This swain has so little pretensions to any kind 
of genius, that two years ago being to act in the Duke of 
Bedford's company*, he kept back the play three weeks, 
because he could not get his part by heart, though it con- 
sisted but of seventeen lines and a half. With him she 
has retired to a villa near New Park, and lets her house 
in town. 

Tour last letter only mentions the progress of the King of 
Sardinia towards Qenoa: but there is an account actually 
arrived of his being master of it. It is very big news, and

Whitehed is grown leaner considerably, and is a very pretty

You ask me if I am really grown a philosopher. Beally 
I believe not; for I shall refer you to my practice rather 
than to my doctrine, and have really acquired what they 
only protend to seek, content. So far, indeed, I was a 
philosopher even when I lived in town, for then I was 
content too ; and all the difference I can conceive between 
those two opposite doctors was, that Aristippus loved 
London, and Diogenes Windsor: and if your master the 
Duke, whom I sincerely prefer to Alexander, and who 
certainly can intercept more sunshine*, would but stand out 
of my way, which he is extremely in, while he lives in the

Totr will have been alarmed with the news of another 
battle^ lost in Flanders, where we have no Elings of Sardinia. 
We make light of it ; do not allow it to be a battle, but call 
it 'the action near Li^ge.' Then we have whitUed down 
our loss extremely, and will not allow a man more than 
three hundred and fifly English slain out of the four 
thousand. The whole of it, as it appears to me, is, that 
we gave up eight battalions to avoid fighting ; as i^ New-

market people pay their forfeit when they foreeee they 
should loee the race ; though, if the whole army had fought, 
and we had lost the day, one might have hoped to have 
come off for eight battalions. Then they tell you that the 
French had four-and-twenty-pounders, and that they must 
beat us by the superiority of their cannon ; so that to me it 
is grown a paradox, to war with a nation who have a mathe- 
matical certainty of beating you ; or else it is still a stranger 
paradox, why you cannot have as large cannon as the 
French. This loss was balanced by a pompous account 
of the triumphs of our invasion of Bretagne * ; which, in 
plain terms, I think, is reduced to burning two or three 
villages and re-embarking: at least, two or three of the 
transports are returned with this history, and know not 
what is become of Leetock and the rest of the invasion. 
The young Pretender is landed in France, with thirty 
Scotch, but in such a wretched condition that his Highland 
Highness had no breeches. 

I have received yours of the 27th of last month, with the 
capitulation of Genoa, and the kind conduct of the Austrians 
to us their allies, so extremely like their behaviour whenever 
they are fortunate. Pray, by the way, has there been any 
talk of my cousin*, the Commodore, being blamable in 
letting slip some Spanish ships? — don't mention it as from 
me, but there are whispers of court-martial on him \ They 
are all the fiftshion now ; if you miss a post to me, I will

tence is not yet public, but it is believed not to be faeivourable. 
He was always a buUy, and is now tried for cowardice. 
Some little dash of the same sort is likely to mingle with 
the judgement on U Juribondo Matthews ; though his party 
rises again a little, and Lestock's acquittal begins to pass for 
a party affair. In short, we are a wretched people, and have 
seen our best days ! 

I must have lost a letter, if you really told me of the sale ' 
of the Duke of Hodena's pictures, as you think you did ; for

and qualifications of her knight, who in future stozy will be 
read of thus : Elmedorus was tall and perfectly well made, his 
fiice oYal, and features regularly handsome, but not effeminate ; 
his complexion sentimentally brown, with not much colour; 
his teeth fine, and forehead agreeably low, round which his 
black hair curled naturally and beautifully. His eyes were 
black too, but had nothing of fierce or insolent; on the 
contrary, a certain melancholy swimmingnees, that described 
hopeless love rather than a natural amorous languish. His 
exploits in war, where he always fought by the side of the 
renowned Paladine William of England, have endeared his 
memory to all admirers of true chivalry, as the mournful 
elegies which he poured out among the desert rocks of 
Caledonia' in honour of the peerless lady and his heart's 
idol, the incomparable Cynthia, will for ever preserve his 
name in the flowery annals of poesy.

Mb. Chuts and I ag^reed noi; to tell you of any new 
changes till we could teU you more of them, that you might 
not be ' put into a taking/ as you was last winter with the 
revolution of three days ; but I think the present has ended 
with a single fit. Lord Harrington ^ quite on a sudden, 
resigned the seals ; it is said, on some treatment not oyer 
gracious ; but he is no such novice to be shocked with that, 
though I believe it has been rough ever since his resigning 
last year, which he did more boisterously than he is accus- 
tomed to behave to Majesty. Others talk of some quarrel 
with his brother Secretary *, who, in complaisance, is all for 
drums and trumpets. Lord Chesterfield was immediately 
named successor ; but the Duke of Newcastle has taken the 
Northern Province, as of more business, and consequently 
better suited to his experience and abUities ! I flatter myself 
that this can no way affect you. Ireland is to be offered to 
Lord Harrington, or the Presidentship; and the Duke of 
Dorset, now President, is to have the other's refusal '• The 
King has endured a great deal with your old complaint ; 
and I felt for him, recollecting all you underwent. 

You will have seen in the papers all the histories of our 
glorious expeditions^ and invasions of France, which have 
put Cressy and Agincourt out of all countenance. On the 
first view, indeed, one should think that our fleet had been 
to victual ; for our chief prizes were cows and geese and 
turkeys. But I rather think that the whole was fitted out 
by the Boyal Society, for they came back quite satisfied with

we should boast of discovering something on the coast of

Matthews is broke at last Nobody disputes the justice of 
the sentence ; but the legality of it is not quite so authenti- 
cated. Besides some great errors in the forms, whenever 
the Admiralty perceived any of the court-martial inclined 
to favour him, they were constantly changed. Then, the 
expense has been enormous ; two hundred thousand pounds ! 
chiefly by employing young captains, instead of old half-pay 
officers; and by these means, double commissions. Then 
there has been a great fracas between the court-martial and 
Willes*. He, as Chief Justice, sent a summons, in the 
ordinary form of law, to Hayeme*, to appear as an evidence 
in a trial where a captain ^ had prosecuted Sir Chaloner Ogle 
for horrid tyranny: the ingenious court-martial sat down 
and drew up articles of impeachment^ like any House of 
Commons, against the Chief Justice, for stopping their pro- 
ceedings I and the Admiralty, still more ingenious, had 
a mind to complain of him to the House I He was charmed

same ingredients that fill a basket by the carrier, will not 
fill half a sheet of paper ; I could send you a cheese, or 
a hare; but I haye not a morsel of news. Mr. Chute 
threatened me to tell you the distress I was in last week, 
when I starved Niccolini and Pandolfini on h fast-day^ when 
I had thought to banquet them sumptuously. I had luckily 
giyen a guinea for two pine-apples, which I knew they had

yery far from reproying you for giying him a letter. Don't 
I giye letters for you eyery day to cubs, ten times cuhher

value your recommendation, by shoiinng how much I value

per meeeo di JPiiCci\ a letter from Marquis Biccardi, with 
orders to consign to the bearer all his treasure in my hands, 
which I shall do immediately with great satisfaction. There 
are four rings that I should be glad he would sell me ; but 
they are such trifles, and he will set such a value on them 
the moment he knows I like them, that it is scarce worth 
while to make the proposal, because I would give but a little 
for them. However, you may hint what plague I have had 
with his rcbOy and that it will be a geni%Uem to seU me

account of the poor boy's relation to my father ; of whom 
the world may judge pretty clearly already, from the abilities 
and disinterestedness of such of his enemies as have suc- 
ceeded ; and from their virtue in taking any opportunity to 
persecute any of his relations; in which even the public 
interest of their country can weigh nothing, when clashing 
with their malice. The King of Sardinia has written the 
strongest letter imaginable to complain of the grievous

one I received from you yesterday. You will excuse me, if 
I am not quite so transported as Mr. Chute is, at the 
extremity of Acquaviva^ I can't afford to hate people so 
much at such a distance: my aversions find employment 
within their own atmosphere. 

Einuncini returns to you this week, not at all contented 
with England: Niccolini is extremely, and turns his little 
talent to great account ; there is nobody of his own standard 
but thinks him a great genius. The Chutes and I deal

Old Loyat has been brought to the bar of the House of

has been so cried up. He saw Mr. Pelham at a distance 
and called to him, and asked him if it were worth while to 
make all this fuss to take off a grey head fourscore years 
old? In his defence he complained of his estate being 
seized and kept from him. Lord GranyiUe took up this 
complaint yery strongly, and insisted on haying it inquired 
into. Lord Bath went farther, and, as some people think, 
intended the Duke ; but I belieye he only aimed at the Duke 
of Newcastle, who was so alarmed with this motion, that he 
kept the House aboye a quarter of an hour in suspense, till 
he could send for Stone', and consult what he should do. 
They made a rule to order the old creature the profits of his

to come in, just as Mr. Davis brought his copy hither.

made me very happy for Mr. Davis, who has given me this 
charming picture. Do but figure to yourself a man of fifty 
years old, who was scarce ever out of the county of Norfolk, 
but when his hounds led him ; who never saw a tolerable 
picture till those at Houghton four years ago ; who plays

Oh I I must tell you : I was here last night, and saw my

best and honestest man in the world, with a good deal of 
jumbled knowledge : but not capable of conducting a party. 
However, the next day, the Prince, to reward him, and to 
punish Lord Archibald Hamilton, who voted with the 
ministry, told Lord Baltimore that he would not give him 
the trouble of waiting any more as Lord of the Bedchamber, 
but would make him Cofferer. Lord B. thanked him, but 
desired that it might not be done in a way disagreeable to 
Lord Archibald, who was then Cofferer. The Prince sent 
for Lord Archibald, and told him he would either make him 
Comptroller, or give him a pension of twelve hundred 
pounds a year : the latter of which the old soul accepted, 
and went away content; but returned in an hour with 
a letter from his wife', to say, that as his Royal Highness 
was angry with her husband, it was not proper for either of 
them to take their pensions. It is excellent I When she 
was dismissed herself, she accepted the twelve hundred 
pounds, and now will not let her husband, though he had 
accepted. It must mortify the Prince wondrously to have

The two courts growl again ; and the old question of settling 
the 60,0002. a year, talked ol The Tories don't list kindly 
under this new opposition ; though last week we had 
a warm day on a motion for inquiring into useless places 
and quarterings. Mr. Pitt was so well advised as to acquit 
my father pretty amply, in speaking of the Secret Com- 
mittee. My uncle Horace thanked him in a speech, and my 
brother Ned has been to visit him — Tant Sempressementy 
I think, rather shows an eagerness to catch at aay oppor- 
tunity of paying court to him ; for I do not see the so vast 
merit in owning now for his interest, what for his honour 
he should have owned five years ago. This motion was 
spirited up by Lord Bath, who is raving again, upon losing 
the borough of Heydon : from which last week we threw his 
brother-in-law Gumley, and instated Luke Bobinson, the old 
sufferer for my father, and the colleague of Mr. Ghute's 
brother ; an incident that will not heighten your indifference, 
any more than it did mina 

Lord Kildare is married to the charming Lady Emily 
Lenox, who went the very next day to see her sister Lady 
Caroline Fox, to the great mortification of the haughty 
Duchess-mother. They have not given her a shilling, but 
the King endows her, by making Lord Kildare a Viscount 
Sterling * : and they talk of giving him a pinchbeck-dukedom 
too, to keep him always first peer of Ireland. Sir Everard 
Falkener is married to Miss Churchill, and my sister is 
brought to bed of a son. 

Panciatici is arrived, extremely darkened in his person 
and enlivened in his manner. He was much in fashion at 
the Hague, but I don't know if he will succeed so well here :

for in such great cities as this, you know people affect not to 
think themselves honoured by foreigners ; and though we 
don't quite barbarize them as the French do, they are 
toujours des Strangers. Mr. Chute thinks we hare to the fiiU 
all the politeness that can make a nation brutes to the rest 
of the world. He had an excellent adventure the other day 
with Lord Holdemess, whom he met at a party at Lady 
Betty Germain's, but who could not possibly fatigue himself 
to recollect that they had ever met before in their lives. 
Towards the end of dinner Lady Betty mentioned remem- 
bering a grandmother of Mr. Chute who was a peeress": 
immediately the Earl grew as fond of him as if they had 
walked together at a coronation. He told me another good 
story last night of Lord Hervey *, who was going with them 
from the Opera, and was so familiar as to beg they would 
not call him my Lard and your Lordship, The freedom 
proceeded ; when, on a sudden, he turned to Mr. Whitehed , 
and with a distressed friendly voice, said, ' Now have you 
no peerage that can come to you by any woman ? '

(General ', who was one of the managers for the House of 
Commons, shone extremely; the Attorney-General', who 
is a much greater lawyer, is cold and tedioua The old 
creature's behaviour has been foolish, and at last indecent. 
I see little of parte in him, nor attribute much to that 
cunning for which he is so famous: it mig^t catch wild 
Highlanders ; but the art of dissimulation and flattery is so 
refined and improved, that it is of little use now where it is 
not very delicate. His character seems a mixture of tyranny 
and pride in his villainy. I must make you a little acquainted 
with him. In his own domain he governed despotically, 
either burning or plundering the lands and houses of his 
open enemies, or taking off his secret ones by the assistance 
of his cook, who was his poisoner in chief. He had two 
servanto who married without his consent ; he said, ' Tou 
shall have enough of each other,' and stowed them in 
a dungeon, that had been a well, for three weeka When 
he came to the Tower, he told them, that if he were not so 
old and infirm, they would find it difficult to keep him 
there. They told him they had kept much younger : * Yes,' 
said he, ' but they were inexperienced : they had not broke 
so many gaols as I have.' At his own house he used to say, 
that for thirty years of his life he never saw a gallows but it 
made his neck acha His last art was to shift his treason 
upon his eldest son', whom he forced into the Rebellion. 
He told Williamson, the Lieutenant of the Tower, ' We will 
hang my eldest son, and then my second ^ shall marry your 
niece.' He has a sort of ready humour at repartee, not very 
well adapted to his situation. One day that Williamson

complained that he could not sleep, he was so haunted with 
rats — ^he replied, * What do you say, that you are so haunted 
with Batdiffes?' The first day, as he was brought to his 
trial, a woman looked into the coach, and said, 'You ugly 
old dog, don't you think you wiU haye that frightful head 
cut off ? ' He replied, * You damned ugly olM>itcl^ I believe ^ 
I shall.' At his trial he affected great weaknclBS and in- * 
firmities, but often broke out into passions; particularly 
at the first witness, who was his yassal : he asked him how 
he dared to come thither I the man replied, to satisfy his 
conscience. Murray, the Pretender^s secretary, was the 
chief eyidence, who, in the course of his information, men- 
tioned Lord Traquair's haying conyersed with Lord Barry- 
more, Sir Watkyn Williams, and Sir John Cotton, on the 
Pretender's affairs, but that they were shy. He was pro- 
ceeding to name others, but was stopped by Lord Talbot, 
and the Court acquiesced — I think yery indecently* It is 
imagined the Duchess of Norfolk would haye come next 
upon the stage. The two knights were present, as was 
Macleod, against whom a bitter letter from Loyat was read, 
accusing him of breach of faith ; and afterwards Loyat 
summoned him to answer some questions he had to ask ; 
but did not. It is much expected that Lord Traquair, who 
is a great coward, will giye ample information of the whole 
plot. When Sir Eyerard Falkener had been examined^ 
against Loyat, the Lord High Steward asked the latter if he 
had anything to say to Sir Eyerard ? he replied, ' No ; but 
that he was his humble seryant, and wished him joy of his 
young wife.' The two last days he behayed ridiculously, 
joking, and making eyerybody laugh eyen at the sentence.

pour ma patrie^ et ne jn'en soucie gu^re/ When he with- 
drew, he said, ' Adieu I my Lorde, we shall never meet again 
in the same place.' He says he will be hanged ; for that his 
neck is so short and bended, that he should be struck in the 
shoulders. I did not think it possible to feel so little as 
I did at so melancholy a spectacle, but tyranny and viUainy 
wound up by buffoonery took off all edge of concern. The 
foreigners were much stcuck ; Niocolini seemed a great deal 
shocked, but he comforts himself with the knowledge he 
thinks he has gained of the English constitution. 

Don't thank Siccardi for me : I don't feel obliged for his 
immoderate demand, but expect very soon to return him his 
goods ; for I have no notion that the two Lords, who are to 
see them next week, will rise near his price. We have 
nothing h'ke news: all the world has been entirely taken up 
with the trial. Here is a letter from Mr. Whitehed to Ijord

ArUngton Street, AprU 10, 1747. 

I DEFERRED Writing to you as long as they deferred the 
execution of old Lovat, because I had a mind to send you 
some account of his death, as I had of his trial He was 
beheaded yesterday, and died extremely well, without 
passion, affectation, buffoonery, or timidity ; his behaviour 
was natural and intrepid. He professed himself a Jansenist ; 
made no speech, but sat down a little while in a chair on the 
scaffold, and talked to the people round him. He said, ' He 
was glad to suffer for his country, duke est pro patria mori ; 
that he did not know how, but he had always loved it, neado 
qud natcHe soltmi, 4*c. ; that he had never swerved from his 



268 To Horace Mann [1747 

principles ; that this was the character of his family, who 
had been gentlemen for five hundred years.' He laid down 
quietly, gave the sign soon, and was dispatched at a blow. 
I believe it will strike some terror into the Highlands, when 
they hear there is any power great enough to bring so 
potent a tyrant to the block. A scaffold fell down and 
killed several persons ; one, a man that had rid post from 
Salisbury the day before to see the ceremony ; and a woman 
was taken up dead with a live child in her arms. The body 
is sent into Scotland^ : the day was cold, and before it set 
out, the coachman drove the hearse about the courts before 
my Lord Traquair's dungeon, which could be no agreeable 
sight: it might to Lord Cromartie, who is above the chair^. 
Mr. Chute was at the execution with the Italians, who were 
more entertained than shocked : Panciatici told me^ ' It was 
a triste spectacle, mats qu'U ne lassoit cTeire beatk' Niccolini 
has treasured it up among his insights into the English 
constitution. We have some chance of a peer's trial that 
has nothing to do with the Bebellion. A servant of a college 
has been killed at Oxford, and a verdict of wilful murder by 
persons unknown brought in by the coroner's inquest 
These persons unknown are supposed to be Lord Aber- 
gavenny', Lord Charles Scot*, and two more, who had 
played tricks with the poor fellow that night, while he was 
drunk, and the next morning he was found with his skull 
fractured, at the foot of the first Lord's staircase. One 
pities the poor boys, who undoubtedly did not foresee the 
melancholy event of their sport

Mr. Chute gave you some account of the Independents ' : 
the committee have made a foolish affair of it, and cannot 
furnish a report. Had it extended to three years ago, Lord 
Sandwich and Grenville^ of the Admiralty would have 
made an admirable figure as dictators of some of the most 
Jacobite healths that ever were invented. Lord Doneraile, 
who is made Comptroller to the Prince, went to the com- 
mittee (whither all members have a right to go, though not 
to Yote, as it is select, not secret), and plagued Lyfctelton to 
death, with pressing him to inquire into the healths of the 
year '43. The ministry are now trembling at home, with 
fear of losing the Scotch bills ^ for humbling the Highland 
chiefs : they have whittled them down almost to nothing, 
in complaisance to the Duke of Argyll; and at last he

Dbab HaBBY, Arlington Street, April 16, 1747. 

We are all skyrockets and bonfires to-night for your 
last year's victory^ ; but if you have a mind to perpetuate 
yourselyes in the calendar, you must take care to refresh 
your conquests. I was yesterday out of town, and tiie very 
signs as I passed through the villages made me make very 
quaint reflections on the mortality of fame and popularity. 
I observed how the Duke's head had succeeded almost 
universally to Admiral Vernon's, as his had left but few 
traces of the Duke of Ormond's*. I pondered these things 
in my heart, and said unto myself, Surely all glory is but 
a sign'! 

You have heard that old Lovat's^ tragedy is over : it has 
been succeeded by a little farce, containing the humours of 
the Duke of Newcastle and his man Stone. The first event 
was a squabble between his Grace and the Sheriff about 
holding up the head on the scaffold— a custom that has been 
disused, and which the Sheriff would not comply with, as he 
received no order in writing. Since that^ the Duke has 
burst ten yards of breeches strings ^ about the body, which 
was to be sent into Scotland ; but it seems it is customary 
for vast numbers to rise to attend the most trivial burial. 
The Duke, who is always at least as much frightened at

doing right as at doing wrong, was three days before he got 
courage enough to order the burying in the Tower. I must 
tell you an excessire good story of G^rge Selwyn : Some 
women were scolding him for going to see the execution, 
and asked him, how he could be such a barbarian to see the 
head cut off? *Nay/ says he, 'if that was such a crime, 
I am sure I haye made amends, for I went to see it sewed 
1 on again/ When he was at the undertaker's, as soon as 
2 they had stitched him together, and were going to put the 
I body into the coffin, George, in my Lord Chancellor's voice, 
said, ' My Lord Loyat, your lordship may rise.' My Lady 
Townshend has picked up a little stable-boy in the Tower, 
which the warders have put upon her for a natural son of 
Lord Kilmarnock's, and taken him into her own house. 
You need not tell Mr. T.' this from me. 

We hare had a great and fine day in the House on the 
second reading the bill for taking away the Heritable 
Jurisdictions in Scotland. Lyttleton "^ made the finest oration

always been most remarkably fortunate : Captain Granville, 
the youngest of the brothers, was as unlucky ; he was killed 
by the cannon that was fired as a signal for their striking*. 
He is extremely conmiended : I am not partial to the family ; 
but it is but justice to mention, that when he took a great 
prize some time ago, after a thousand actions of generosity to 
his officers and crew, he cleared sixteen thousand pounds, of 
which he gave his sister ten. The King is in great spirits* 
The French fought exceedingly well. 

I have no other event to tell you, but the promotion 
of a new brother of yours. I condole with you, for they 
have literally sent one Dayrolle resident to Holland, under 
Lord Sandwich,

This curious minister has always been a led-captain to the 
Dukes of Grafton and Richmond ; used to be sent to auctions 
for them, and to walk in the Park with their daughters, 
and once went dry-nurse to Holland with them. He has 
belonged, too, a good deal to my Lord Chesterfield, to whom, 
I believe, he owes this new honour ; as he had before made 
him Black Rod in Ireland, and gave the ingenious reason, 
that he had a black faca I believe he has made him

make a wit of Jacky Barnard, and had the immrtinent

DoN^r be more fidghtened at hearing the Parliament is to 
be dissolved in a fortnight, than you are obliged to be as 
a good minister. Since this Parliament has not brought 
over the Pretender, I trust the death of it will not. You 
will want to know the reason of this sudden step : several 
are given, as the impossibility of making either peace or war, 
till they are secure of a new migority : but I believe the 
true motive is to disappoint the Prince, who was not ready 
with his elections. In general, people seem to like the 
measure, except the Speaker, who is very pompous about it, 
and speaks constitutional paragraphs. There are rumours 
of changes to attend its exit. People imagine Lord Chester- 
field is to quit^ but I know no other grounds for this 
belief, than that they conclude the Duke of Newcastle must 
be jealous of him by this time. Lord Sandwich is looked 
upon as his successor, whenever it shall happen. He is

certain games called cricketaliaf which have been celebrated 
this very evening in honour of him in a neighbouring 
meadow. 

Tou will think I have removed my philosophy firom 
Windsor with my tea-things hither ; for I am writing to 
you in all this tranquillity, while a Parliament is bursting 
about my ears. Tou knowit is going to be dissolved : lam 
told, you are taken care of, though I don't know where, nor 
whether anybody that chooses you will quarrel with me

of Rockingham did ' ; one of the calamities of my life which 
I have bore as abominably well as I do most about which 
I don't care. They say the Prince has taken up two 
hundred thousand pounds, to carry elections which he won't 
carry:— he had much better have saved it to buy the 
Parliament after it is chosen. A new set of peers are 
in embryo, to add more dignity to the silence of the House 
of Lords. 

I make no remarks on your campaign^, because, as you 
say, you do nothing at all; which, though very proper 
nutriment for a thinking head, does not do quite so well 
to write upon. If any one of you can but contrive to be

Though we have no great reason to triumph, as we have 
certainly been defeated, yet the French have as certainly 
bought their victoiy dear^: indeed, what would be very 
dear to us is not so much to them. However, their least 
loss is twelve thousand men ; as our least loss is five thousand. 
The truth of the whole is, that the Duke was determined to

Ton would think it strange not to hear from me after a

I could only repeat what that contains. The sum total is, 
that we would fight, which the French did not intend ; we 
gave them, or did not take^ the advantage of situation ; they 
attacked : what part of our army was engaged did wonders, 
for the Dutch ran away, and we had contrived to post the 
Austrians in such a manner that they could not assist us :

we killed twelve thousand of the enemy, and lost six our-

short sights mistaken a body of French for his own people. 
He behaved as bravely as usual ; but his prowess is so well 
established, that it grows time for him to exert other qualities 
of a general. 

We shine at sea ; two-and-forty sail of the Domingo fleet 
have fidlen into our hands, and we expect more. The 
ministry are as successful in their elections: both West- 
minster and Middlesex have elected court candidates, and 
the City of London is taking the same step^ the first time of 
many years that the two latter have been Whig ; but the 
non-subscribing at the time of the Bebellion has been most 
Sttccessfiilly played off upon the Jacobites ; of which stamp

whom, by the force of his parts, he had pushed so high, at

I CAME to town but last week ; but on looking over the 
dates of my letters, I find I am six weeks in arrear to you. 
This is a period that ought to make me blush, and beyond 
what I think I was ever guiliy ; but I have not had a tittle 
to teU you ; that is, nothing little enough has happened, nor 
big enough, ezoept Admiral Hawke's^ great victory '; and 
for that I must have transcribed the gazettes. 

The Parliament met this morning, the House extremely 
full, and many new fEkces. We have done nothing but 
choose a Speaker, and, in choosing him, flattered Mr. Onslow, 
who is re-chosen. In about ten days one shall be able to 
judge of the complexion of the winter; but there is not 
likely to be much opposition. The Duke was coming, but 
is gone back to Breda for a few days. When he does return, 
it will be only for three weeks. He is to watch the French 
and the negotiations for peace, which are to be opened— 
I believe not in earnest '• 

Whithed has made his entrance into Parliament ; I don't 
expect he will like it. The first session is very tiresome with 
elections, and without opposition there will be little spirit

Tou say so many kind things to me in your letter of 
Nov. 7ih, on my talking of a journey to Florence, that I am 
sorry I mentioned it to you. I did it to show you that my 
silence is far from proceeding from any forgetfulness of you ; 
and as I really think continually of such a journey, I name 
it now and then ; though I don't find how to accompUah it. 
In short, my affairs are not so independent of everybody, 
but that they require my attending to them to make them 
go smoothly: and unless I could get them into another 
situation, it is not possible for me to leave them. Some 
part of my fortune is in my Lord O.'s^ hands ; and if I were 
out of the way of giving him trouble, he has not generosity 
enough to do anything that would be convenient to me. 
I will say no more on this subject, because it is not a pleasant 
one ; nor would I have said this^ but to convince you that 
I did not mention returning to Florence out of gaieU de coetwr, 
I never was happy but there; have a million of times 
repented returning to England, where I never was happy, 
nor expect to be. 

For Mr. Chute's silence, next to mysdf, I can answer for 
him: he always loves you, and I am persuaded wishes

nothing more than himself at Florence. I did hint to him 
your kind thought about Venice, because, aa I saw no day- 
light to it, it could not disappoint him ; and because I knew 
how sensible he would be to this mark of your friendship. 
There is not a glimmering prospect of our sending a minister 
to Berlin ; if we did, it would be a person of far greater 
consideration than Sir James Grey; and even if he went 
thither, there are no means of procuring his succession for 
Mr. Chute. My dear child, you know little of England, if 
you think such and so quiet merit as his likely to meet 
friends here. Qreat assurance or great quality are the only 
recommendations. My father was abused for employing low 
people with parts — ^that complaint is totally remored. 

You reproach me with telling you nothing of Berg-op-Zoom : 
seriously, I know nothing but what was in the papers : and 
in general, on those great public events^ I must transcribe 
the Gazette, if you will have me talk to you. Tou will have 
seen by the King's Speech that a congress is appointed at 
Aix-la-Cbapelle, but nobody expects any elFect from it. 
Except Mr. Pelham, the ministry in general are for the 
war ; and, what is comical, the Prince and the opposition 
are so too. We have had but one division yet in the House, 
which was on the Duke of Newcastle's interfering in the 
Seaforth election. The numbers were, 247 for the court, 
against 96. But I think it very probable that, in a little 
time, a stronger opposition will be formed, for the Prince 
has got some new and very able speakers ; particularly a 
young Mr. Potter *, son of the last Archbishop ', who promises

Mr. Pitt. 

I sent Niocolini the letter ; and here is another from him. 
I haye not seen him this winter, nor heard of him : he is of 
very little consequence, when there is an3rthing else that is. 

I have lately had Lady Mary Wortley's Eclogues^ pub- 
lished ; but they don't please, though so excessively good. 
I say so confidently, for Mr. Chute agrees with me : he says, 
for the Epistle to Arthur Orey ', scarce any woman could 
have written it, and no man; for a man who had had 
experience enough to paint such sentiments so well, would 
not have had warmth enough left Do you know anything

sufficient, but what I flatter myself I need not repeat The 
town has been quite empty ; and the Parliament^ which met 
but yesterday, has been adjourned these three weeks. Except 
elections, and such tiresome squabbles, I don't beUeve it will 
produce anything: it is aU harmony. From Holland we 
every day hear bad news, which, though we dont beUeve at 
the present, we agree it is always likely to be true by 
to-morrow. Yet, with no prospect of success, and scarce 
with a possibility of beginning another campaign, we are 
as martial as ever : I don't know whether it is because we 
think a bad peace worse than a bad war, or that we don't 
look upon misfortunes and defeats abroad as enough our 
own, and are willing to taste of both at home. We are in 
no present apprehension from domestic disturbances, nor, 
in my private opinion, do I believe the French will attempt 
us, till it is for themselves. They need not be at the trouble 
of sending us Stuarts ; that ingenious house could not have 
done the work of France more effectuaUy than the Pelhams 
and the Patriots have. 

I will tell you a secret : there is a transaction going on to 
send Sir Charles Williams to Turin ; he has asked it, and it 
is pushed. In my private opinion, I don't believe Yillettes^ 
will be easily overpowered ; though I wish it, from loving 
Sir Charles and from thinking meanly of the other; but 
talents are no passports. Sir Everard Falkener* is going to 
Berlin. Oeneral Sinclair' is presently to succeed Went-

Lord Coke' has demolished himself very fast ; I mean his 
character : you know he was married but last spring ; he is 
always drank, has lost immense smns at play, and seldom 
goes home to his wife till eight in the morning. The world 
is yehement on her side ; and not only her family, but his 
own, give him up. At present, matters are patching up by 
the mediation of my brother, but I think can never go on : 
she married him extremely against her will, and he is at 
least an oulrpensioner of Bedlam : his mother's Ciunily * have 
many of them been mad.

sent^ when yon hear that Mr. L^ge^ has aetually kissed 
hands, and sets out on Friday for Berlin, as envoy extra-

Falkener sure ; but this has oome forth very unexpectedly. 
Legge is certainly a wiser choice ; nobody has better parts ; 
and if art and industry can obtain success, I know no one 
would use more : but I don't think that the King of Prussia, 
with half parts and much cunning, is so likely to be the 
dupe of more parts and as much cunning, as the people 
with whom Legge has so prosperously pushed his fortune. 
My father was fond of him to the greatest degree of 
partiality, till he endeavoured to have a nearer tie than 
flattery gave him, by trying to marry Lady Mary: after 
that my Lord could never beai- his nama Since that, he 
has wriggled himself in with the Pelhams, by being the 
warmest friend and servant of their new allies, and is the 
first favourite of the little Duke of Bedford. Mr. YiUiers* 
was desired to go to Berlin, but refused, and proposed him- 
self for the Treasury, till they could find something else for 
him. They laughed at this ; but he is as fit for one employ- 
ment as the other. We have a stronger reason than any 
I have mentioned against going to Venice ; which is, the 
excuse it might give to the Vine' to forget we were in 
being ; an excuse which his hatred of our preferment would 
easily make him embrace, as more becoming a good Christian

Admiral Vernon has just published a series of Letters to 
himself among which are several of Lord Bath, written in 
the height of his opposition : there is one in particular, to 
congratulate Vernon on taking Portobello, wherein this 
great virtuous Patriot advises him to do noting morej 
assuring him that his inactivity would all be imputed to 
my father. One does not hear that Lord Bath has called 
him to any account for this publication, though as villainous 
to these correspondents as one of them was in writing such 
a letter ; or as the Admiral himself was, who used to betray 
all his instructions to this enemy of the government. Nobody 
can tell why he has published these letters now, unless to get 
money. What ample revenge every year gives my &ther

it is to make a lasting impression on such a town as this.

of State. I think you need be under no apprehension from 
this change ; I should be frightened enough if you had the 
least reason, but I am quite at ease. Lord Chesterfield, who 
I believe had no quarrel but with his partner, is gone to 
Bath; and his youngest brother, John Stanhope', comes 
into the Admiralty, where Sandwich is now First Lord. 
There seems to be some hitch in Legge's embassy ; I believe 
we were overhasty. Proposals of peace were expected to be 
laid before Parliament, but that talk is vanished. The Duke 
of Newcastle, who is going greater lengths in ever^hing for 
which he overturned Lord Granville, is all military; and 
makes more courts than one ^ by this disposition. The Duke 
goes to Holland this week, and I hear we are going to raise 
another million. There are prodigious discontents in the 
army: the town had got a list of a hundred and fifty 
officers who desired at once to resign, but I believe this was 
exaggerated. We ^ are great and very exact disciplinarians ; 
our partialities are very strong, especially on the side of 
aversions, and none of these articles tally exactly with 
English tempers. Lord Bobert Bertie ' received a reprimand 
the other day by an aide-doKsamp, for blowing his nose as he

mons upon a sort of private affair between the Chief Justice 
Willes and the Orenvilles, who have engaged the ministry 
in an extraordinary step, of fixing the assizes at Bucking- 
ham by Act of Parliament in their favour. We have had 
three long days upon it in our House, and it is not yet 
over ; but though they will carry it both there and in the 
Lords, it is by a &r smaller majority than any they have 
had in this Parliament The other day, Dr. Lee and Mr. 
Potter had made two very strong speeches against Mr. Pel* 
ham on this subject; he rose with the greatest emotion, 
fell into the most ridiculous passion, was near crying, and 
not knowing how to return it on the two, fell upon the 
Chief Justice (who was not present), and accused him of 
ingratitude. The eldest Willes^' got up extremely moved, 
but with great propriety and cleverness told Mr. Pdham

I had begun my letter before the masquerade, but had 
not time to finish it : there were not above one hundred 
persons; the dresses pretty; the Duchess as mad as you 
remember her. She had stuck up orders about dancing, as 
you see at public bowling-gre^is ; turned half the company 
out at twelve ; kept those she liked to supper ; and, in 
short, contrived to do an agreeable thing in the rudest 
manner imaginable ; besides having dressed her husband in

in stronger terms than by the Quadruple Alliance*; and 
the cessation of arms to take place in all other parts of the 
world, as in the year 1712. The contracting powers agree 
to think of means of making the other powers come into 
this treaty, in case they refuse. 

This is the substance; and wonderful it is what can 
make the French give us such terms, or why they have lost 
so much blood and treasure to so little purpose I for they 
have destroyed very little of the fortifications in Flanders. 
Monsieur de St. S^verin^^ told Lord Sandwich, that he had 
full powers to sign now, but that the same courier that 
should carry our refusal, was to call at Namur and Bergen- 
op-Zoom, where are mines under all the works, which were 
immediately to be blown up. There is no accounting for 
this, but from the King's aversion to go to the army, and 
to Marshal Saxe's fear of losing his power with the loss of 
a battle. He told Count Flemming, the Saxon minister, 
who asked him if the French were in earnest in their offer 
of peace, ' II est ynd, nous demandons la paix conmie des 
lAches, et ne pouYons pas I'obtenir.' 

Stocks rise ; the ministry are in high spirits, and|>etf s'enfaui

two reasons that greatly advanced it are, the King's wanting to 
go to Hanover, and the Duke's wanting to go into a salivation.

accordingly has ventured to Banelagh, to the great improve-

a silver cup to be rowed for, which carried everybody upon 
the Thames, and yifterwards there was a great ball at 
Carleton House. yThere have two good events happened at 
that court : the town was alarmed t'other morning by the 
firing of guns, which proved to be only from a large 
merchantman come into the river. The City construed 
them into the King's return, and the Peace broke; but

Bootle, finding ber dressed, said, 'I have always heard, 
Madam, that women m ywr countrf^ have yery easy Ubours, 
but I could not have believed it was so well as I see.' The 
other story is of Prince Edward. The King, before he went 
away, sent Stainberg to examine the Prince's children in 
their learning. The Baron told Prince Edward, that he 
should tell the King what great proficiency his Highness 
had made in his Latin, but that he wished he would be 
a little more perfect in his German grammar, and that it 
would be of signal use to him. The child squinted at him, 
and said, 'German grammar I why any dull child can learn 
that.' — There, I have told you Royalties enough !/>

Guts and Gundy, Puss, Oat and Toe, sound so strange in 
the middle of a most formal banquet I The day the Peace 
was signed, his Grace could find nobody to communicate 
joy with' him : he drove home, and bawled out of the 
chariot to Lady Bachael, 'Gat I Cat!' She ran down, 
staring over the balustrade ; he cried ' Cat I Cat ! the Peace 
is made, and you must be very glad, for I am very glad.'

Arlington Street, June 7, 1748. 

Don't reproach me in your own mind for not writing, but 
reproach the world for doing nothing ; for making peace as 
slowly as they made war. When anybody commits an 
event, I am ready enough to tell it you ; but I have always 
declared against inyenting news ; when I do, I will set up 
a newspaper. 

The Duke of Newcastle is not gone ; he has kissed hands, 
and talks of going this week : the time presses, and he has 
not above three days left to fall dangerously ilL There 
are a thousand wagers laid against his going : he has hired 
a transport, for the yacht is not big enough to convey all 
the tables and chairs and conveniences that he trails along 
with him, and which he seems io think don't grow out of 
England. I don't know how he proposes to lug them 
through Holland and Germany, though any objections that 
the map can make to his progress don't count, for he is 
literally so ignorant, that when one goes to take leave of 
him, he asks your commands into the north, concluding 
that Hanover is north of Great Britain, because it is in 
the Northern Province, which he has just taken : you will 
scarce believe this, but upon my honour it is true. 

The preliminaries wait the accession of Spain, before 
they can ripen into peace. Niccolini goes to Aix-la-Chapelle, 
and will be much disappointed if his advice is not asked 
there : he talks of being at Florence in October.

Chuteheds agreed with me, that the house, which is most 
magnificently furnished, all the ornaments designed by 
Kent, and the whole Jestino, put us more in mind of 
Florence, than anything we had seen here. There were 
silver pharaoh and whisk for the ladies that did not dancOy 
deep basset and quinze for the men ; the supper very fine. 

I am now returning to my villa, where I have been 
making some alterations: you shall hear from me from 
Strawberry EiU, which I have found out in my lease is 
the old name of my house ; so pray, never call it Twicken- 
ham again. I like to be there better than I have liked 
being anywhere since I came to England. I sigh after 
Florence, and wind up all my prospects with the thought 
of returning there. I have days when I even set about 
contriving a scheme for going to you, and though I don't 
love to put you upon expecting me, I cannot help telling 
you, that I wish more than ever to be with you again. 
I can truly say, that I never was happy but at Florence, 
and you must allow that it is very natural to wish to be 
happy once more. Adieu !

If I write to anybody, I am forced to live upon what news 
I hoarded before I came out of town ; and the first article 
of thaty as I believe it is in everybody's gazette, must be 
about my Lord Coke. They say, that since he has been 
at Sunning Hill with Lady Mary, she has made him 
a declaration in form, that she hates him, that she always 
did, and that she always wilL This seems to have been 
a very unnecessary notification. However, as you know 
his part is to be extremely in love, he is very miserable 
upon it ; and rekting his woes at White's, probably at 
seven in the morning, he was advised to put an end to all 
this history and shoot himself— an advice they would not 
have given him if he were not insolvent. He has promised 
to consider of it. 

The night before I left London, I called at the Duchess 
of Richmond's, who has stayed at home with the apprehen- 
sion of a miscarriage. The porter told me there was no

informed me : ever since I have treated myself as Queen 
Dowager, and have some thoughts of being drawn so. 

There are no good anecdotes yet arrived of the Duke of 
Newcastle's travels, except that at a review which the Duke 
made for him, as he passed through the army, he hurried 
about with his glass up to his eye, crying, ' Finest troops I 
finest troops ! greatest general I ' then broke through the 
ranks when he spied any Sussex man, kissed him in all his 
accoutrements,— ' my dear Tom such an one ! ' chattered of 
Lewes races ; then back to the Duke with ' Finest troops I 
greatest general I ' — and in short was a much better show 
than any review. The Duke is expected over immediately ; 
I don't know if to stay, or why he comes— I mean, I do 
know, but am angry, and will not tell. 

I have seen Sir James Grey, who speaks of you with 
great affection, and recommends himself extremely to me 
by it, when I am not angry with you ; but I cannot possibly 
be reconciled till I have finished this letter, for I have 
nothing but this quarrel to talk of, and I think I have 
worn that out — so adieu I you odious^ shocking, abominable 
monster !

Histley, July 14, 1748. 
I CAME hither yesterday, having staid but three days 
in London, which is a desert ; but in those three days, and 
from all those Nobodies, I heard the history of Lord Coke 
three thousand different ways. I expect next winter to 
hear of no Whigs and Jacobites, no courtiers and Patriots, 
but of the Cokes and the Campbells — I do assure you, the 
violence is incredible with which this affair is talked over — 
as the Irish mobs used to cry, Butleraboo and Grumaboo, 
you will see the women in the assemblies will be holloaing 
Campbellaboo I— But with the leave of their violence^

I think the whole affair of sending Harry Ballenden first 
to bully Coke, and then to murder him, is a very shocking 
story, and so bad that I will not believe Lady Mary's 
&mily oould go so far as to let her into the secret of an 
intention to pistol her husband. I heard the relation in an 
admirable way at first, firom my Lady Suffolk \ who is one 
of the ringleaders of the Campbellaboos, and, indeed, a woful 
story she made of it for poor Coke, interlarding it every 
minute with very villainous epithets bestowed on his lord- 
ship by Noll Bluff, and when she had run over her string 
of rascal, scoundrel, &c., she would stop and say, Lcutp 
l>orothy\ do I tea your story right ; for you know I am very 
iofrf^ amd perhaps did not hear U exactly. I have compiled 
all that is allowed on both sides, and it is very certain, for 
Coke's honour, that his refusing to fight was till he could 
settle the afEair of his debts. But two or three wicked

(1781) she became Groom of the

influence, owing to the saperior 
abilities of the Queen, whose sneers

of her position. In 1788 a bequest 
from her fitther enabled her to retire 
from court to her irilla, Marble HiU 
at Twickenham, which she had built 
in 1724. In later life she became 
almost stone deaf, but her accurate 
memory rendered her society pecu-

information to supplement his own 
knowledge of transactions at the 
courts of George I and II, great part 
of which was afberwards embodied 
in his Be7niml9eeiieet. He was a fre- 
quent visitor at Harble Hill, and 
wrote to Lady Suffolk at intervals 
during his absence frmn home. She 
was not, apparently, clever, but was 
distinguished by tact and good sense, 
and was greatly esteemed by the 
most eminent men of her day. Pope 
and Peterborough celebrated her in 
verse (the former in the well-known

circumstances on t'other side, never to be got over, are 
Ballenden's stepping close up to him after C!oke had fired 
his last pistol, and saying, You UHle dog, now I wSU he Ae 
defUk of you, and firing, but the pistol missed — and what 
confirms the intention of these words is, its having come out 
that the Duke of Aigyll ' knew that Coke, on having been told 
that his Grace complained of his usage of Lady Mary, replied 
very well. Does he tdOc ! Why, it is impossible I should use my 
mfi worse than he did his. When Harry Ballenden left Coke 
on the road from Sunning the day before the duel, he crossed 
over to the Duke, which his Grace flatly denied, but Lord 
Gower proved it to his face, I have no doubt but a man 
who would dispatch his wife, would have no scruple at the 
assassination of a person that should reproach him with it

for I can't be angry when I see people unhappy. I found 
afterwards that my brother had intended to borrow it while 
I am here — I can conceive forgiveness; I can conceive 
using people ill — but how does one feel to use anybody 
very ill without provocation, and then ask favours of them ? 
— ^Well, he must think of that — I shall be glad if I can 
save the poor girl's life.

I had almost forgot to tell you a pleasant bit I had 
been to visit the Vere Beauclercs, at Hanworth^, and had 
pried about for a portrait of the black grandmother, but 
to no purpose. As to old Chambers's ' black leg, I did not 
expect to find him stepping it forth like the King of Clubs. 
I went another evening with Mrs. Leneve ; Lady Yere then 
carried us into all the lodging rooms; over one private 
bed-chamber chimney, what did I view but the most deplor- 
able sooty gentlewoman that was ever beheld. I imme- 
diately guessed that this was the black house-maid flattered, 
for it was not absolutely negro. I asked, Mrs. Leneve 
hemmed and coughed, and was ready to die — Lady Yere 
answered, ' It was her grandmother^s picture, a PortuguesCf 
that her grandfather had married at Fort St. George— a very 
bad likeness.'— Adieu ! Sigby sends you a great many com-

sumptuously banqueted ^ and imposed that yillainous fine

tower, that stands on a spacious mount raised on a high 
hill with a large foesd. It commands a fine prospect, and 
belongs to Hr« Ashurt, a rich citizen, who has built 
a trumpery new house dose to it. In the parish church 
is a fine square monument of black marble of one of the 
EarlS) and there are three more tombs of the family at 
Earl's Colne, some miles from the castle. I could see but 
little of them, as it was very late, except that one of the 
Countesses has a head-dress exactly like the description of 
Mount Parnassus, with two tops. I suppose you have 
heard much of Gosfield, Nugenfs seat. It is extremely in

that fall down a slope into it. The house is vast, built

but so ill done, that they look like caricatures done to 
expose them, since they have so much disgraced the virtues

but in patches, and in the bad taste that came between the 
charming venerable Gk>thic and pure architecture. There 
is a great deal and plenty of good furniture^ but no one 
room very fine ; no tolerable pictures. Her * dressing-room 
is very pretty, and furnished with white damask, china, 
japan, loads of easy-chairs, bad pictures, and some pretty 
enamels. But what charmed me more than all I had seen, 
is the library chimney, which has existed from the founda- 
tion of the house ; over it is an alto-relievo in wood, far 
from being ill done, of the battle of Bosworth Field* It is 
all white, except the helmets and trappings, which are gilt, 
and the shields, which are properly blazoned with the arms 
of all the chiefs engaged. Tou would adore it. We passed 
our time very agreeably; both Nugent and his wife are 
very good-humoured, and easy in their house to a degree. 
There was nobody else but the Marquis of Tweedale who 
indeed did not enliven us ; his new Marchioness ^, who is 
infinitely good-humoured and good company, and sung 
a thousand French songs mighty prettily; a sister of 
Nugent's, who does not figure ; and a Mrs. Eliot " (sister to 
Mrs. Nugent), who crossed over and figured in with Nugent : 
I mean she has turned Catholic, as he has Protestant She 
has built herself a very pretty small house in the park, and 
is only a daily visitor. Nugent was extremely communica-

As to my own history, the scene is at present a little 
gloomy: my Lord Orford is in an extreme bad state of

great feelings of affection for two men because they are

especially having been as much my enemy as it was in his 
power to be ; but I cannot with indifference see the family 
torn to pieces, and falling into such ruin as I foresee ; for 
should my brother die soon, leaving so great a debt» so 
small an estate to pay it off, two great places* sinking, 
and a wild boy of nineteen to succeed, there would soon 
be an end of the glory of Houghton, which had my &ther

Anne of Bohemia, to whom she had been Maid of Honour, 
introduced the fashion of piked homs^ or high heads, which 
is the very attire on this tomb, and ascertains it to belong 
to Bobert de Vera, the great Earl of Oxford, made Duke of 
Ireland by Richard the Second, who, after the banishment 
of this minister, and his death at Louvain, occasioned by 
a boar at a great hunting match, caused the body to be 
brought over, would have the coffin opened once more to 
see his favourite, and attended it himself in high procession 
to its interment at Earl's Colne. I don't know whether the 
Craftsman some years ago would not have found out that we 
were descended from this Yere^ at least from his name and 
ministry : my comfort is, that Lancerona was Earl Robert's 
second wife I But in this search I have crossed upon 
another descent, which I am taking great pains to yerify 
(I don't mean a pun), and that is a probability of my being 
descended from Chaucer, whose daughter, the Lady Alice',

hundred years of pedigree may find themselves descended

and soak with their led-captains till bed-time, and tell

334 To the Hon. Henry Seymour Contmy [1748 

In short, theee are the people I live in the midst o^ though 
not with ; and it is for want of more important histories 
that I have wrote to you so seldom ; not, I give you my 
word, from the least negligence. My present and sole 
occupation is planting, in which I have made great progress, 
and talk very learnedly with the nurserymen^ except that 
now and then a lettuce run to seed overturns all my botany, 
as I have more than once taken it for a curious West Indian 
flowering shrub. Then the deliberation with which trees 
grow, is extremely inconvenient to my natural impatience. 
I lament living in so barbarous an age, when we are come 
to so little perfection in gardening. I am persuaded that 
a hundred and fifty years hence it will be as common 
to remove oaks a hundred and fifty years old, as it 
is now to transplant tulip-roota I have even begun a 
treatise or panegyric on the great discoveries made by 
posterity in all arts and sciences, wherein I shall particularly 
descant on the great and cheap convenience of making troui- 
rivers — one of the improvements which Mrs. Eerwood 
wondered Mr. Hedges would not make at his countty-house^ 
but which was not then quite so common as it will be. I 
shall talk of a secret for roasting a wild boar and a whole 
pack of hounds alive, without hurting them, so that the 
whole chase may be brought up to table ; and for this secret, / 
the Duke of Newcastle's grandson, it he can ever get a botl/^ 
is to give a hundred thousand pounds. Then the delightfcu* 
ness of having whole groves of humming-birds, tame tigers 
taught to fetch and cany, pocket spying-glasses to see all 
that is doing in China, with a thousand other toys, which 
we now look upon as impracticable, and which pert posterity 
would laugh in one's fiice for staring at^ while they are 
ofiFering rewards for perfecting discoveries, of the principles 
of which we have not the least conception ! If ever this 
book should come forth, I must expect to have aU the 



1748] To the Han. Henry Seymour Conway 835 

learned in arms against me, who measure all knowledge 
backward : some of them have diacoTered symptoms of all 
arts in Homer; and Pineda' had so much faith in the 
accomplishments of his ancestors, that he believed Adam 
understood all sciences but politics. But as these great 
champions for our forefathers are dead, and Boileau not 
aliye to hitch me into a verse with Perrault *, I am deter- 
mined to admire the learning of posterity, especially being 
convinced that half our present knowledge sprung from 
discovering the errors of what had formerly been caUed so. 
I don't think I shall ever make any great discoveries myself 
and therefore shall be content to propose them to my 
descendants, like my Lord Bacon, who, as Dr. Shaw ^ says 
very prettily in his preface to Boyle, 'had the art of in- 
venting arts': or rather like a Marquis of Worcester", of 
whom I have seen a little book which he calls A Century 
o/Ifwentions, where he has set down a hundred machines to 
do impossibilities with, and not a single direction how to 
make the machines themselves. 

If I happen to be less punctual in my correspondence 
than I intend to be, you must conclude I am writing my 
book, which being desined for a panegyric, will cost me a 
great deal of trouble. >^e dedication, with your leave, shall 
be addressed to yxm son that is coming, or, with my Lady

All my sins to Mrs. Talbot you are to expiate; I am 
here quite alone, and want nothing but your fetching, to go 
to her. I haye been in town for a day, just to see Lord 
Bury, who is come over with the Duke ; they return next 
Thursday. The Duke is fatter, and it is now not denied 
that he has entirely lost the sight of one eye. This did not 
surprise me so much as a ban-ma^ of hia Oumley^ who 
you know is grown Methodist*, came to tell him, that as he 
was on duty, a tree in Hyde Park, near the powder magazine, 
had been set on fire ; the Duke replied, he hoped it was not 
by the new light. This nonsensical new light is extremely in 
fashion, and I shall not be surprised if we see a revivaJ of 
all the folly and cant of the last age. Whitfield preaches

fine tall figure, and very handsome : she spoke very justly, 
and with spirit Oarrick is to produce her next winter ; 
and a Miss Charlotte Bamsay^ a poetess, and deplorable 
actress. Oarrick, Barry, and some more of the players, 
were there to see these new comedians ; it is to be their 
seminary. 

Since I came home I have been disturbed with a strange, 
foolish woman, that lives at the great corner house yonder ; 
she is an attorney's wife, and much g^ven to her bottle. By 
the time she has finished that and daylight^ she grows afraid 
of thieves, and makes the servants fire minute guns out of

as I write merely to satisfy you, I shall take no care but not

You must know then, but did you know a young fellow 
that was caUed Handsome Tracy ^? He was walking in the 
Park with some of his acquaintance, and overtook three 
girls ; one was very pretty ; they followed them ; but the 
girls ran away, and the company grew tired of pursuing 
them, all but Tracy. — (There are now three more guns gone 
oflf successiyely — she must be very drunk.) He followed to 
Whitehall gate, where he gave a porter a crown to dog 
them : the porter hunted them, he the porter. The girls 
ran all round Westminster, and back to the Haymarket^ 
where the porter came up with them. He told the pretty 
one she must go with him, and kept her talking till Tracy 
arrived, quite out of breath, and exceedingly in love. He 
insisted on knowing where she lived, which she refused to 
tell him, and after much disputing, went to the house of 
one of her companions, and Tracy with them. He there 
made her discover her family, a butterwoman in Craven 
Street, and engaged her to meet him next morning in the 
Park ; but before night he wrote her four love-letters; and 
in the last ofiFered two hundred pounds a year to her, and 
a hundred a year to Signora la Hadre. Oriselda made 
a confidence to a staymaker's wife, who told her that the 
swain was certainly in love enough to marry her, if she 
could determine to be virtuous and refuse his offers — * Aye,' 
says she, 'but if I should, and should lose him by it.* 
However, the measures of the cabinet council were decided 
for virtue ; and when she met Tracy the next morning in 
the Park, she was convoyed by her sister and brother-in-law, 
and stuck dose to the letter of her reputation. She would

do nothing, Bhe would go nowhere. At last, as an instance 
of prodigious compliance, she told him, that if he would 
accept such a dinner as a butterwoman's daughter could 
give him, he should be welcome. Away they walked to 
Graven Street: the mother borrowed some silver to buy 
a leg of mutton, and they kept the eager lover drinking 
till twelve at night, when a chosen committee waited on 
the faithful pair to the minister of May Fair*. The doctor 
was in bed, and swore he would not get up to marry the 
King, but that he had a brother over the way who perhaps 
would, and who did. The mother borrowed a pair of 
sheets, and they consummated at her house ; and the next 
day they went to their own palace. In two or three days 
the scene grew gloomy ; and the husband coming home one 
night, swore he could bear it no longer — 'Bear! bear 
what?' — 'Why, to be teased by all my acquaintance for 
marrying a butterwoman's daughter. I am determined to 
go to France, and will leave you a handsome allowance.' — 
'Leave me I why you don't fancy you shall leave me ? I will 
go with you.'— 'What, you love me then?' — 'No matter 
whether I love you or not, but you shan't go without ma'

I HAVE two letters of yours to account for, and nothing to 
plead but my old insolvency. Oh ! yes, I have to scold you, 
which you find is an inexhaustible fund with me. You sent 
me your demiU^ with the whole city of Florence, and 
charged me to keep it secret — and the first person I saw 
was my Lord Hobart, who was full of the account he had 
received from you. You might as well have told a woman 
a bawdy secret, and expected to have it kept I but you may 
be very easy, for unless it reaches my Lady Pomfret or my 
Lady Orford, I dare say it will never get back to Florence ; 
and for those two ladies, I don't think it likely that they 
should hear it, for the first is in a manner retired from the 
world, and the world is retired from the second. Now 
I have vented my anger, I am seriously sorry for you, to be 
exposed to the impertinence of those silly Florentine women : 
they deserve a worse term than silly, since they pretend to

I am much obliged to Prince Beauyau for remembering 
me, and should be extremely pleased to show him all manner 
of attentions here : you know I profess great attachment to 
that fiunily for their civilities to me. But how gracious the 
Princess* has been to you! I am quite jealous of her 
dining with you : I remember what a rout thers was to get 
her for half of half a quarter of an hour to your assembly. 

The Bishop of London^ is dead ; having, luckily for his 
family, as it proves, refused the archbishopric We owe 
him the justice to say, that though he had broke with my 
father, he always expressed himself most handsomely about 
him, and without any resentment or ingratitude. 

Your brothers are coming to dine with me ; your brother

resemblance to you, but am grown to love him upon his

I SHALL write you a very short letter, for I don't know 
what business we have to be corresponding when we might 
be together. I really wish to see you, for you know I am 
convinced of what you say to me. It is few people I ask to 
come hither, and if possible, still fewer that I wish to see 
here. The disinterestedness of your friendship for me has 
always appeared, and is the only sort that for the future 
I will ever accept, and consequently I never expect any more 
friends — as to trying to make any by obligations, I have had 
such woful success, that, for fear of thinking still worse than 
I do of the world, I will never try more. But you are 
abominable to reproach me with not letting you go to 
Houghton: have not I offered a thousand times to carry 
you there? I mean, since it was my brother's: I did not 
expect to prevail with you before, for you are so unaccount- 
able, that you not only will never do a dirty thing, but you 
won't even venture the appearance of it. I have often 
applied to you in my own mind a very pretty passage that 
I remember in a letter of Ghillingworth ^ ; you would not do 
that for prrferment that you would not do hut for preferment.

Since I gave yoA the account of the Duchess of Ireland's 
piked hams among the tombs of the Veres, I have found 
a long account in Bayle of the friar, who, as I remember to 
have read somewhere, preached so vehemently against that 
fashion : it was called Henmn\ and the monk's name was 
Thomas Conecte. He was afterwards burnt at Borne for 
censuring the lives of the clergy. As our histories say that 
Anne of Bohemia introduced the fashion here, it is probable 
that the French learnt it from us, and were either long 
before they caught it, or long in retaining the mode, for the 
Duke of Ireland died in 1389, and Conecte was burnt in 
1434. There were, indeed, several years between his preach- 
ing down Hennins and Ins death, but probably not near five 
and forty years, and half tha( term was a long duration for 
so outrageous a fashion^XBut I have found a still more 
entertaining fashion in another place in Bayle, which was, 
the women wearing looking-glasses upon their bellies : I don't 
conceive for what use^ unless it was in the days of the huge 
codpieces. >&dieu I don't write any more, but come.

I am sorry our wishes clash so much. Besides that I have 
no natural inclination for the Parliament, it will particularly 
disturh me now in the middle of all my planting ; for which 
reason I haye never inquired when it vnll meet, and cannot 
help you to guess — but I should think not hastily — ^for 
I believe the Peace, at least the evacuations \ are not in so 
prosperous a way as to be ready to make any &gate in the 
King's Speech. But I speak from a distance ; it may all be 
very toward : our ministers enjoy the consciousness of their 
wisdom, as the good do of their virtue, and take no pains to 
make it shine before men. In the mean time, we have 
several collateral emoluments from the pacification : all our 
milliners, tailors, tavern-keepers, and young gentlemen are 
tiding to France for our improvement and luxury ; and as 
I foresee we shall be told on their return that we have lived 
in a total state of blindness for these six years, and gone 
absolutely retrograde to all true taste in every particular, 
I have already begun to practise walking on my head, and 
doing everything the wrong way. Then Charles Frederick ^

I HAVE laughed heartily at your adventure of Milord

sure that Biccardi's absurdity was not the best part of it. 
Where were the Rinundniw, the Panciaticis, and Pandolfinis ?

Tour brothers are just returned from Houghton, where 
they found my brother extremely recovered : my uncle too, 
I hear, is better ; but I think that an impossible recovery*. 
Lord Walpole is setting out on his travels: I shall be im- 
patient to have him at Florence ; I flatter myself you wiU 
like him : I, who am not troubled with partiality to my \ {> 
family, admire him much. Tour brother has got the two j 
books of Houghton \ and will send them by the first oppor- 
tunity: I am by no means satisfied with them; they are 
full of faults, and the two portraits ^ wretchedly unlike. 

The Peace is signed between us, France, and Holland, but 
does not give the least joy ; the stocks do not rise^ and the 
merchants are unsatisfied ; they say France will sacrifice us 
to Spain, which has not yet signed ^ : in short, there has not 
been the least symptom of public rejoicing ; but the govern-

Arlington Street, Dec 2, 174a 
OuB King is returned and our Parliament met : we ex- 
pected nothing but harmony and tranquillity, and lore of 
the peace ; but the very first day opened with a black cloud, 
that threatens a stormy session. To the great surprise of 
the ministry, the Tories appear in intimate league with the 
Prince's party, and both agreed in warm and passionate 
expressions on the treaty : we shall not have the discussioo 
till after Christmas. My uncle, who is extremely mended 
by soap, and the hopes of a peerage, is come up, and the 
very first day broke out in a Yolley of treaties : though he is 
altered, you would be astonished at his spirits. 

We talk much of the Chancellor's^ resigning the seals, 
from weariness of the fatigue, and being made President of 
the Council, with other consequent changes^ which I will 
write you if they happen; but as this has already been 
a discourse of six months, I don't give it you for certain. 

Mr. Chute, to whom alone I communicated Niccolini's

The burlettas are begun ; I think, not decisively liked or 
condemned yet : their success is certainly not rapid, though 
Pertici is excessively admired. Garrick says he is the best 
comedian he ever saw: but the women are execrable, not 
a pleasing note amongst them. Lord Middlesex has stood 
a trial with Monticelli for arrears of salary, in Westminster 
Hall, and even let his own handwriting be proved against

Lord Marchmont*s brother, a favourite advocate, and whom 
the ministry have pensioned out of the opposition into 
silence, was his counsel, and protested, striking his breast, 
that he had never set his foot but once into an opera-house 
in his life. This affectation of British patriotism is excel- 
lently ridiculous in a man so known : I have often heard 
my father say, that of all the men he ever knew, Lord 
Harchmont and Hume Campbell were the most abandoned 
in their professions to him on their coming into the world : 
he was hindered from accepting their services by the present 
Duke of Argyll, of whose faction they were not. They then 
flung themselves into the opposition, where they both have 
made great figures, till the elder was shut out of Parliament 
by his father's death, and the younger, being very foolishly 
dismissed from being Solicitor to the Prince, in favour of 
Mr. Bathurst*, accepted a pension from the court, and

twelve thousand pounds a year of the Percy estate after the 
present Duke's death; the other five, with the barony of 
Percy, must go to Lady Betty Smithson". I don't know 
whether you ever heard that, in Lord Granville's administra-

Northumberland to Sir Charles ; Lord Hertford represented 
against it ; at last the King said he would give it to whoever

indeed it is not in all the forms ; I haye stuck no laurel and 
holly in my windows, I eat no turkey and chine, I have no 
tenants to invite, I haye not brought a single soul with me. 
The weather is excessiyely stormy, but has been so warm, 
and so entirely free from frosts the whole winter, that not 
only seyeral of my honeysuckles are come out, but I haye 
literally a blossom upon a nectarine-tiee, which I belieye 
was neyer seen in this climate before on the 26th of 
December. I am extremely busy here planting; I haye 
got four more acres, which makes my territory prodigious 
in a situation where land is so scarce, and villas as abundant 
as formerly at Tiyoli and Baiie. I have now about fourteen 
acres, and am making a terrace the whole breadth of my 
garden on the brow of a natural hill, with meadows at the 
foot, and commanding the river, the village, Richmond Hill, 
and the Park, and part of Kingston— -but I hope never to 
show it you. What you hint at in your last, increase of 
character, I should be extremely against your stirring in 
now : the whole system of embassies is in confusion, and 
more candidates than employments. I would have yours 
pass, as it is, for settled. If you were to be talked of, 
especially for a higher character at Florence, one don't 
know whom the additional dignity might tempt. Here- 
after, perhaps, it might be practicable for you, but I would 
by no means advise your soliciting it at present. Sir Charles 
Williams is the great obstacle to all arrangement: Mr. Fox 
makes a point of his going to Turin ; the ministry, who do 
not love him, are not for his going anywhere. Mr. Yilliers

Admiralty. There were so many competitors, that at last 
Mr. Pelham said he would carry in two names to the King, 
and he should choose (a great indulgence!). Sir Peter 
Warren and Villiers were carried in ; the King chose the 
latter. I believe there is a little of Lord Oranville in this, 
and in a Mr. Hooper, who was turned out with the last 
ministry, and is now made a Commissioner of the Customs : 
the pretence is, to vacate a seat in Parliament for Sir Thomas 
Bobinson, who is made a Lord of Trade ; a scurvy reward 
after making the peace. Mr. Villiers, you know, has been 
much gojsetted, and had his letters to the King of Prussia 
printed ^ ; but he is a very silly fellow. I met him the other 
day at Lord Granville's, where, on the subject of a new play, 
he began to give the Earl an account of Coriolanus, with 
reflections on his history. Lord Granville at last grew 
impatient, and said, ' Well 1 well ! it is an old story ; it 
may not be true.' As we went out together, I said, ' I like 
the approach to this house*.' — 'Tes,' said Villiers, 'and I 
love to be in it ; for I never come here but I hear something 
I did not know before.' Last year, I asked him to attend 
a controverted election in which I was interested ; he told 
me he would with all his heart, but that he had resolved 
not to vote in elections for the first session, for that he

I told you in my last a great deal about old Someiset's 
will: they have sinoe found 150,0001. which goes, too, 
between tiie two daughters'. It had been feared that he 
would leave nothing to the youngest ; two or three years 
ago, he waked after dinner and found himself upon the 
floor; she used to watch him, had left him, and he had 
fallen from his couch. He forbade eyerybody to speak to 
her; but yet to treat. her with respect as his daughter. 
She went about the house for a year, without anybody 
daring openly to utter a syllable to her ; and it was neyer 
known that he had forgiven her. His whole stupid life 
was a series of pride and tyranny. 

There have been great contests in the Privy Council about 
the trial of the Vice-chancellor of Oxford : the Duke of 
Bedford and Lord Gower pressed it extremely. The latter 
asked the Attomey-G-eneral "^ his opinion, who told him the 
evidence did not appear strong enough : Lord Gower said, 
^Mr. Attorney, you seem to be very lukewarm for your 
party.' He replied, 'My lord, I never was lukewarm for 
my party, nor ever was hwt of one party.* There is a scheme 
for vesting in the King the nomination of the Chancellor of

I asked a/very intelligent person if there could be any 
foundation for the story of Niccolini's banishment taking 
its rise from complaints of our court : he answered very 
sensibly, that even if our court had complained, which was 
most unlikely, it was not at all probable that the court of 
Vienna would haye paid any regard to it. There is another 
paragraph in your same letter in which I must set you right : 
you talk of the sudden change of my opinion about Lord 
Walpole : I neyer had but one opinion about him, and that 
was always most fayourable : nor can I imagine what occa- 
sioned your mistake, unless my calling him a wUd &oy, where 
I talked of the consequences of his father^s death. I meant 
nothing in the world by wildj but the thoughtlessness of 
a boy of nineteen, who comes to the possession of a peerage 
and an estate. My partiality, I am sure, could neyer let me 
say anything else of him. 

Mr. Chute's sister is dead. When I came from town

the bet-book at White's (a MS. of which I may one day or 
other giye you an account), that the first baronet that will 
be hanged is this Sir William Burdett. About two months 
ago he met at St James's a Lord Gastledurrough^', a young 
Irishman, and no genius as you will find, and entered into 
conversation with him : the Lord, seeing a gentleman, fine, 
polite, and acquainted with everybody, invited him to dinner 
for next day, and a Captain Bodney ^*, a young seaman, who 
has made a fortune by very gallant behaviour during the 
war. At dinner it came out, that neither the Lord nor the 
Captain had ever been at any Pelham-levees. ' Good God ! ' 
said Sir William, Hhat must not be so any longer; I beg 
I may carry you to both the Duke and Mr. Pelham : I flatter 
myself I am very well virith both.' The appointment was 
made for the next Wednesday and Friday: in the mean 
time^ he invited the two young men to dine with him the 
next day. When they came, he presented them to a lady, 
dressed foreign, as a princess of the house of Brandenburg : 
she had a toad-eater, and there was another man, who gaye 
himself for a count After dinner Sir William looked at his

^for my part you know I abominate everything but pharaoh.* 
'I am very sorry. Madam/ replied he, very gravely, 'but 
I don't know whom your Highness will get to tally to you ; 
you know I am ruined by dealing.' 'Oh ! ' says she, 'the 
Count will deal to us.' ' I would with all my soul,' said the 
Count, 'but I protest I have no money about me.' She 
insisted : at last the Count said, ' Since your Highness com-

five hundred pounds of mine, that I am to pay away in the 
City to-morrow ; if he will be so good as to step to his bureau 
for that sum, I will make a bank of it' Mr. Bodney owns 
he was a little astonished at seeing the Count shuffle with 
the faces of the cards upwards; but concluding that Sir 
William Burdett^ at whose house he was, was a relation or 
particular friend of Lord Gastledurrough, he was unwilling 
to affront my Lord. In short, my Lord and he lost about 
a hundred and fifty apiece, and it was settled that they 
should meet for payment the next morning at breakfast at 
Banelagh. In the mean time Lord C. had the curiosity to 
inquire a little into the character of his new friend the 
baronet ; and being au faiif he went up to him at Banelagh 
and apostrophized him; 'Sir William, here is the sum I 
think I lost last night ; since that I have heard that you 
are a professed pickpocket^ and therefore desire to have no 
farther acquaintance with you.' Sir William bowed, took 
the money and no notice ; but as they were going away, he 
followed Lord Gastledurrough and said, ' Gkx)d GK>d, my Lord, 
my equipage is not come; will you be so good as to set 
me down at Buckingham Oate ? ' and without staying for an 
answer, whipped into the chariot, and came to town with 
him* If you don't admire the coolness of this impudence,

strawberry Hill, March i, 1749. 

I HATE been so shut up in the House ci Commons for 
this last fortnight or three weeks, that I have not had time 
to write you a line : we have not had such a session since 
the famous beginning of last Parliament. I am come hither 
for a day or two of rest and air, and find the additional 
pleasure of great beauty in my improvements : I could talk 
to you through the whole sheet, and with much more satis- 
&ction, upon this head ; but I shall postpone my own amuse- 
ment to yours, for I am sure you want much more to know 
what has been doing in Parliament than at Strawberry Hill. 
You will conclude that we have been fighting over the Peace ; 
but we have not. It is laid before Parliament, but will not 
be taken up ; the opposition foresee that a vote of approba- 
tion would pass, and therefore will not begin upon it, as they 
wish to reserve it for censure in the next reign — or perhaps 
the next reign does not care to censure now what he must 
hei-eafter maintain — ^and the ministry do not seem to think 
their treaty so perfect as not to be liable to blame, should it 
come to be canvassed. We have been then upon several 
other matters: but first I should tell you, that from the 
utmost tranquillity and impotence of a minority, there is at 
once started up so formidable an opposition as to divide 137 
against 203. The minority is headed by the Prince, who 
has continued opposing, though very unsuccessfully, ever 
since the removal of Lord Granville, and the desertion of 
the Patriots. He stayed till the Pelhams had bought off 
every man of parts in his train, and then began to form his 

1* K.B.— The letter which immediately Ibllowed this miacarried. WdipoU,

party. Lord Granville has never oome into it^ for fear of 
bieiddng with the Sjng ; and seems now to be patching up 
again with his old enemies. If Lord Bath has dealt with 
the Prince, it has been underhand. His ministry has had 
at the head of it poor Lord Baltimore, a very good-natured, 
weak, honest man ; and Dr. Lee, a civilian, who was of Lord 
Granville's Admiralty, and is still much attached to him. 
He is a grave man, and a good speaker, but of no very bright 
parts, and, from his way of hfe and profession, much ignorant 
of, and unfit for, a ministry. Tou will wonder what new 
resources the Prince has discovered — why, he has found 
them all in Lord Egmont^ whom you have heard of under 
the name of Lord Perceval ; but his father ^ an Irish Earl, is 
lately dead. As he is likely to make a very considerable 
figure in our history, I shall give you a more particular 
account of him. He has always earnestly studied our history 
and constitution and antiquities, with very ambitious views ; 
and practised speaking early in the Irish Parliament Indeed, 
this turn is his whole fund, for though he is between thirty 
and forty, he knows nothing of the world, and is always 
unpleasantly dragging the conversation to political disserta- 
tions. When very young, as he has told me himself, he 
dabbled in writing Craftamen and party papers ; but the first 
event that made him known, was his carrying the West- 
minster election at the end of my father's ministry, which 
he amply described in the history of his own family, a genea- 
logical work called The History of the House qf Yvery *, a work 
which cost him three thousand pounds, as the Heralds 
informed Mr. Chute and me, when we went to their office 
on your business ; and which was so ridiculous, that he has 
since tried to suppress all the copies. It concluded with the

deecription of the Westminster election, in these or some 
such words, 'And here let us leave this young nobleman 
struggling for the dying liberties of his country T When 
the change in the ministry happened, and Lord Bath was so 
abused by the remnant of the Patriots, Lord Egmont pub- 
lished his celebrated pamphlet^ called Faction Ddeded^ a work 
which the Pitts and Lytfceltons have never forgiven him ; 
and which, though he continued voting and sometimes 
speaking with the Pelhams, made him quite unpopular 
during all the last Parliament When the new elections 
approached, he stood on his own bottom at Weobly in 
Herefordshire ; but his election being contested, he applied 
for Mr. Pelham's support, who carried it for him in the 
House of Commons. This will always be a material blot 
in his life : for he had no sooner secured his seat^ than he 
openly attached himself to the Prince, and has since been 
made a Lord of his Bedchamber. At the opening of this 
session, he published an extreme good pamphlet, which has 
made infinite noise, called An Examination of the Frinc^pfes 
and Condud cfthe two Brothers (the Pelhams), and as Dr. Lee 
has been laid up with the gout, Egmont has taken the lead 
in the opposition, and has made as great a figure as perhaps 
was ever made in so short a time. He is very bold and 
resolved, master of vast knowledge, and speaks at once with 
fire and method. His words are not picked and chosen like 
Pitt's, but his language is useful, clear, and strong. He has 
already by his parts and resolution mastered his great un- 
popularity, so far as to be heard with the utmost attention, 
though I believe nobody had ever more various difficulties 
to combat All the old corps hate him, on my father's and 
Mr. Pelham's account ; the new part of the ministry on their 
own. The Tories have not quite forgiven his having left 
them in last Parliament : besides that, they are now governed 
by one Prowse^ a cold plausible fellow, and a great well-

wisher to Mr. Pelham. Lord Strange*, a busy Lord of a 
party by himselfy yet voting generally with the TorieSy 
eontinnally claahes with Lord Egmont ; and besides all this, 
there is a &ction in the Prince's family, headed by Nugent, 
who are for moderate measures. 

Nugent is most affectedly an humble servant of Mr. Pelham, 
and seems only to have attached himself to the Prince, in 
order to make the better bargain with the ministry : he has 
great parts, but they never know how to disentangle them- 
selves from bombast and absurdities. Besides these, there 
are two young men who make some figure in the rising 
opposition, Bathurst, Attorney to the Prince ; and Potter, 
whom I believe you have had mentioned in my letters of 
last year ; but he has a bad constitution, and is seldom able 
to be in town. Neither of these are in the scale of modera- 
tion. 

The opposition set out this winter with trying to call for 
several negotiations during the war; but the great storm 
which has so much employed us of late, was stirred up by 
Colonel Lyttelton^; who, having been ill-treated by the 
Duke, has been dealing with the Prince. He discovered to 
the House some innovations in the Mutiny Bill", of which, 
though he could not make much, the opposition have, and 
fought the bill for a whole fortnight ; during the course of 
which the world has got much light into many very arbitrary 
proceedings of the Gonmiander-in-Chief ^ which have been 
the more believed too by the defection of my Lord Town-

shend's eldest son ^, who is one of his aide-de-oamps. Though 
the ministry, bj the weight of numbers, have carried their 
point in a great measure, yet you may be sure great heats 
have been raised ; and &ose haye been still more inflamed 
by a correspondent practice in a new Navy Bill*, brought in 
by the direction of Lord Sandwich and Lord Anson, but 
vehemently opposed by half the fleet, headed by Sir Peter 
Warren, the conqueror of Cape Breton, richer than Anson, 
and absurd as Vernon. The bill has eyen been petitioned 
against) and the mutinous were likely to go great lengths, if 
the Admiralty had not bought off some by money, and 
others by relaxing in the material points. We began upon 
it yesterday, and are still likely to have a long affair of it — 
so much for politics; and as for anything else, I scarce 
know anything else. My Lady Huntingdon *, the Queen of 
the Methodists, has got her daughter named for Lady of the 
Bedchamber to the Princesses ; but it is all off again, as she 
will not let her play at cards on Sundays. It is equaUy 
absurd on both sides, to refuse it, or to insist upon it. 

Pray tell Dr. Cocchi that I shall be extremely ready to do 
him any service in his intended edition of the old physicians^ 
but that I fear it is a kind of work that will lie very little 
within my sphere to promote. Learning is confined to very 
narrow bounds at present, and those seldom within the 
circle in which I necessarily live ; but my regard for him 
and for you would make me take any pains. You see, I 
believe, that I do take pains for you — I have not writ such 
a letter to anybody these three years. Adieu !

Arlington Street, March 28, 17i9. 
OuB debates on the two military bills, the mival one of 
which is not yet fibaished, have been so tedious, that they 
have rather whittled down the opposition than increased it. 
In the Lords, the Mutiny Bill passed pretty easily, there 
happening a quarrel between Lord Bathurst and Lord Bath 
on the method of their measures ; so there never divided 
above sixteen in the minority, and those scarce any of the 
Prince's Lords. Duke William was there and voted, which 
was too indecent in a rigorous bill calculated for his own 
power. There is great disunion among the ministers on the 
naval bill : Mr. Pelham and Pitt (the latter out of hatred 
and jealousy of Lord Sandwich) gave up the Admiralty in 
a material point, but the paramount little Duke of Bedford 
has sworn that they shall recant on the report — what a 
figure they will make ! This bill was chiefly of Anson's 
projecting, who grows every day into new unpopularity. 
He has lately had a sea-piece drawn of the victory for which 
he was lorded, in which his own ship in a cloud of cannon 
was boarding the French Admiral. This circumstance, 
which was as true as if Mademoiselle Scud^ry had written 
his life (for he was scarce in sight when the Frenchman 
struck to Boscawen), has been so ridiculed by the whole tar- 
hood, that the romantic part has been forced to be cancelled, 
and one only gun remains firing at Anson's ship. The two 
Secretaries of State ^ grow every day nearer to a breach : the 
King's going abroad is to decide the contest. Newcastle, 
who Hanoverises more and more every day, pushes on the

At Leieester House the jars are as great: Dodington, who 
has just resigned the TreasoiyBhip of the Navy, in hopes of 
onee more goreming that court (and there is no court where 
he has not once or twice tried the same scheme !) does not 
succeed : Sir Francis Dashwood and Lord Talbot are strongly 
for him— could one conceive that he could stiD find a dupe ? 
Mr. Fox had a mind to succeed him, but both Sang and 
Duke have so earnestly pressed him to remain Secretary at 
War, that he could not refuse. The King would not hear 
of any of the newer court ; and Legge, who of the old was 
next oan, has managed the Prussian business so clumsily, 
that the King would not bear him in his closet : but he has 
' got the Navy Office, which Lytielton would haye had, but 
could not be rechosen at his borough \ which he had stolen 
by surprise from his old friend and brother Tom Pitt '. The 
Treasury is to be filled up with that toad-eater and spy to

There are two black Princes of Anamaboe' here, who are in

in by him, though Mr. Fox assured him that he had no

when my brother went to live at Frogmore, Mr. Fox desired 
him to employ his tradesmen at Windsor, by way of support-

went to the Duke of St. Albans", to whom he had never

we have reason to be glad or sorry, pleased or axigry. Last 
Tuesday it was proclaimed : the King did not go to St. Paul'% 
but at night the whole town was illuminated. The nesct 
day was what was called 'a jubilee-masquerade in the 
Venetian manner ' at Banelagh : it had nothing Venetian in 
ity but was by far the best understood and the prettiest 
qteetaole I ever saw: nothing in a fairy tale ever surpassed 
it One of the proprietors, who is a (German, and belongs to 
court, had got my Lady Yarmouth to x)er8uade the King to 
order it It began at three o'clock, and, about five, people 
of fashion began to go. When you entered, you found the 
whole garden filled with masks and spread with tents, which 
remained all night very oommoddy. In one quarter was a 
May-pole dressed with garlands, and people dancing round 
it to a tabor and pipe and rustic music, all masked, as weiie 
all the Tarious bands of music that were disposed in different 
parts of the garden ; some like huntsmen with French horns, 
some like peasants, and a troop of harlequins and scara- 
mouches in the little open temple on the mount On the 
canal was a sort of gondola, adorned with flags and streamen^ 
and filled with music, rowing about All round the outside 
of the amphitheatre were shops, filled with Dresden china, 
japan, &o., and all the shopkeepers in mask. The amphi- 
theatre was illuminated ; and in the middle was a circular 
bower, composed of all kinds of firs in tubs, from twenty to 
thirty feet high : under them orange-trees, with small lamps 
in each orange, and below them all sorts of the finest 
auriculas in pots ; and festoons of natural flowers hanging 
from tree to tree. Between the arches too were firs, and 
smaller ones in the balconies abova There were booths for 
tea and wine, gaming-tables and dancing, and about two 
thousand persons. In short, it pleased me more than any- 
thing I ever saw. It is to be once more, and probably

finer as to dressee, as there has since been a sabscriptioii- 
masquerade, and people will go in their rich habits. The 
next day were the fireworks, which by no means answered 
the expense, the length of preparation, and the expectation 
that had been raised: indeed, for a week before, the town 
was like a country fair, the streets filled from morning to 
night, scaffolds building whereyer you could or could not 
see, and coaches arriving from eyery comer of the kingdom. 
This hurry and lively scene, with the sight of the immense 
crowds in the Park and on every house, the guards, and the 
machine itself which was very beautiful, was all that was 
worth seeing. The rockets, and whatever was thrown up 
into the air, succeeded mighty well ; but the wheels, and all 
that was to compose the principal jMirt, were pitiful and ill- 
conducted, with no changes of coloured fires and shapes: 
the illumination was mean, and lighted so slowly that scares 
anybody had patience to wait the finishing ; and then, what 
contributed to the awkwardness of the whole, was the right 
pavilion catching fire, and being burnt down in the middle 
of the show. The King, the Duke, and Princess Emily saw 
it from the Library ^ with their courts: the Prince and 
Princess, with their children, from Lady Middlesex's; no 
place being provided for them, nor any invitation given to 
the Library. The Lords and Commons had galleries built 
for them and the chief citizens along the rails of the Hall: 
the Lords had four tickets apiece, and each Commoner, at 
first, but two, till the Speaker bounced and obtained a third. 
Very little mischief was done, and but two persons kiUed : 
at Paris, there were forty killed and near three hundred 
wounded, by a dispute between the French and Italians in - 
the management, who, quarrelling for precedence in lighting 
the fires, both lighted at once and blew up the whole. Our

a serenata at the Opera-house, called P^aee in Europe^ but it

You will conclude that^ after aD these diversions^ people 
begin to think of going out of town — no such matter: the

There are many private bills, no public ones of any £une. 
We were to have had some chastisement for Oxford, where, 
besides the late riots, the famous Dr. King', the Ptetender^s 
great agent, made a most violent speech at the opening of 
the Batclifife Library. The ministry denounced judgement^ 
but, in their old style, have grown firightened, and dropped it. 
However, this menace gave occasion to a meeting and union 
between the Prince's parfcy and the Jacobites, which Lord 
Egmont has been labouring all the winter. They met at 
the St. Alban's Tavern, near Pall-mall, last Monday morning^ 
an hundred and twelve Lords and Commoners. The Duke 
of Beaufort^ opened the assembly with a panegyric on the 
stand that had been made this winter against so corrupt an 
administration, and hoped it would continue^ and desiied 
harmony. Lord Egmont seconded this strongly, and begged 
they would come up to Parliament early next winter. 
Lord Oxford' spoke next; and then Potter with great 
humour, and to the great abashment of the Jacobites, said 
he was very glad to see this union, and £rom thence hoped, 
that if another attack like the last BebeUion should be made

on the Boyal Famfly, they would all stand by them. No 
reply was made to thia. Then Sir Watkyn Williama spoke. 
Sir Francis Dashwood, and Tom Pitt, and the meeting broke 
up. I don't know what this coalition may produce : it will 
require time with no better heads than compose it at pre- 
sent, though the great Mr. Dodington had carried to the 
oonferenoe the assistance of his. In France a very favour* 
able event has happened for us, the disgrace of Maurepas^ 
one of our bitterest enemies, and the greatest promoter of 
their marine. Just at the beginning of the war, in a very 
critical period, he had obtained a very large sum for that 
service, but which one of the other factions, lest he should 
gain glory and credit by it, got to be suddenly given away 
to the King of Prussia. 

Sir Charles Williams is appointed Envoy to this last 
King : here is an epigram which he has just sent over on 
Lord Egmont's opposition to the Mutiny Bill : 

Why has Lord Egmont 'gainst this bill 
So much declamatory skiU

The reason's plain: but t'other day

that Whitfield has recanted ?' 'No, Sir, he has only canted.' 

If you ever think of returning to England, as I hope it 
will be long first, you must prepare yourself with Methodism. 
I really believe that by that time it will be necessary : this 
sect increases as fast as almost ever any religious nonsense 
did. Lady Fanny Shirley " has chosen this way of bestow- 
ing the dregs of her beauty upon Jesus Christ ; and Mr. 
Lyttelton is very near making the same sacrifice of the 
dregs of all those various characters that he has worn. 
The Methodists love your big sinners, as proper subjects 
to work upon — and indeed they have a plentiful harvest — 
I think what you call flagrancy was never more in fashion. 
Drinking is at the highest wine-mark ; and gaming joined

Arlington Street, May 17, 1749. 
Wb have not yet done diverting ourselves: the night 
before last the Duke of Richmond gave a firework ; a codicil 
to the Peaca He bought the rockets and wheels that 
remained in the pavilion which miscarried, and took the 
pretence of the Duke of Modena being here to give a charm- 
ing entertainment. The garden ^ lies with a slope down to 
the Thames, on which were lighters, from whence were 
thrown up, after a concert of water-musiC; a great number 
of rockets. Then from boats on every side were discharged 
water^rockets and fires of that kind ; and then the wheels 
which were ranged along the rails of the terrace were 
played off ; and the whole concluded with the illumination 
of a pavilion on the top of the slope, of two pyramids on 
each side, and of the whole length of the balustrade to the 
water. Tou can't conceive a prettier sight; the garden 
filled with everybody of fashion, the Duke, the Duke of 
Modena, and the two black Princes. The King and Princess 
Emily were in their barge under the terrace ; the river was 
covered with boats, and the shores and adjacent houses 
with crowda The Duke of Modena played afterwards at 
brag, and there was a fine supper for him and the foreigners, 
of whom there are numbers here ; it is grown as much the 
fashion to travel hither as to France or Italy. Last week

is rather better than it used to be, for, instead erf wearing 
his wig down to his nose to hide the humour in his fiuMy 
he has taken to paint his forehead whitey which, howeyer, 
with the large quantity of red that he always wears on 
the rest of his face, makes him ridieolous enough. I oannot 
say his manner is more polished: Princess Emily asked 
him if he did not find the Duke much fatter than when he 
was here before? Hereplied, 'EnT^t^iln'estpassieffiroy*

I did not choose to sit waiting his r6veU in the face of the

here I was very unlucky, for of the only two persons I could 
recollect at his court to inquire after, one has been dead 
these four years, and the other, he could not remember any 
such man. Howeyer, Sabbatini, his Secretary of State, flat-

cost him five-and-thirty guineas, — ^actually disbursed out of his

You are going to see one of our court-beauties in Italy, 
my Lady Rochford ' : they are setting out on their embassy 
to Turin. She is large, but Tory handsome, with great 
delicacy and address. All the Boyals have been in lore 
with her; but the Duke was so in all the forms, till she 
was a little too much pleased with her conquest of his 
brother-in-law the Prince of Hesse. You will not find 
much in the correspondence of her husband: his person 
is^^food, and he will figure weU enough as an ambassador ; 
^iSetter as a husband where cicuMs don't expect to be mo- 
lested./ The Duke is not likely to be so happy with his 
new-|Mussion, Mrs. Pitt, who, besides being in lore with her 
husband, whom you remember (Lady Mary Wortle/s Gkorge 
Pitt), is going to Italy with him. I thmk you will find her 
one of the most glorious beauties you ever saw. You are to 
have another pair of our beauties, the Princess Borghese's 
Mr. Oreyille* and his wife, who was the pretty Fanny 
M'Cartney*. 

Now I am talking scandal to you, and court-scandal,

masquerade*. It is not quite unlucky for her: she had 
outUved the Prince's love and her own &Ge, and nothing 
remained but her love and her person, which was exceed- 
ingly bad. 

The graver part of the world, who have not been quite so 
much given up to rockets and maakiog, are amused with 
a book of Lord Bolingbroke, just published, but written 
long ago. It is composed of three letters, the first to Lord 
Combuty on the EjpirU qf Patriotism ; and two others to 
Hr. Lyttelton (but with neither of their names), on The 
Idea qf a Patriot King, and the State of Parties on the late 
King's accession. Mr. Lyttelton had sent him word that 
he begged nothing might be inscribed to him that was to 
reflect on Lord Orford, for that he was now leagued with 
all Lord Orford's friends: a message as abandoned as the 
book itself: but indeed there is no describing the impu- 
dence with which that set of people unsay what they have 
been saying all their lives, — I beg their pardons, I mean 
the honesty with which they recant ! Pitt told me coolly, 
that he had read this book formerly, when he admired Lord 
Bolingbroke more than he does now. The book by no 
means answered my expectation: the style, which is his 
fortej is very fine : the deduction and impossibility of draw- 
ing a consequence from what he is saying, as bad and 
obscure as in his famous Dissertation on ParHes : you must 
know the man, to guess his meaning. Not to mention the 
absurdity and impracticability of this kind of systems, there 
is a long speculative dissertation on the origin of govern- 
ment, and even that greatly stolen from other writers, and 
that all on a sudden dropped, while he hurries into his own

times, and then proaches (he, of all men !) on the duty of 
preserving decency I The last treatise would not impose 
upon an historian of five years old : he tells Hr. Lyttelton, 
that he may take it from him, that there was no settled 
scheme at ttie end of the Queen's reign to introduce the 
Pretender ; and he gives this excellent reason ; because, if 
there had been, he must have known it ; and another reason 
as ridiculous, that no traces of such a scheme have since 
come to light. What, no traces in all the cases of himself, 
Atterbury, the Duke of Oimond, Sir William Windham, 
and others! and is it not known that the moment the 
Queen was expired, Atterbury proposed to go in his lawn 
sleeves and proclaim the Pretender at Charing Gross, but 
Bolingbroke'is heart failing him, Atterbury swore, 'There 
was the best cause in Europe lost for want of spirit I ' He 
imputes Jacobitism singly to Lord Oxford, whom he exceed- 
ingly abuses; and who, so far from being suspected, was 
thought to have fEdlen into disgrace with that faction for 
refusing to concur with them. On my &ther he is much 
less severe than I expected ; and in general, so obliquely, 
that hereafter he will not be perceived to aim at him, 
though at this time one knows so much what was at his 
heart, that it directs one to his meaning. 

But there is a preface ^ to this &mous book, which makes 
much more noise than the work itself. It seems. Lord 
Bolingbroke had originally trusted Pope with the copy, to 
have half a dozen printed for particular friends. Pope, who 
loved money infinitely beyond any friend, got fifteen hun- 
dred copies printed privately, intending to outlive Boling- 
broke, and make great advantage of them : and not only 
did this, but altered the copy at his pleasure, and even 
made different alterations in different copies. Where Lord 
Bolingbroke had strongly flattered their common friend

380 To Horace Mann [i7i9 

Lyttelton, Pope suppressed the panegyric: where^ in oom* 
pliment to Pope, he had softened the satiie on Poi>e's great 
friend, Lord Oxford, Pope reinstated the abuse. The first: 
part of this transaction is recorded in the prehce ; the two 
latter facts are reported by Lord Chesterfield and Lyttelton, 
the latter of whom went to Bolingbroke to ask how he had 
forfeited his good opinion. Li short, it is comfortable to 
us people of moderate virtue to hear these demigods, and 
Patriots, and philosophers, inform the world of each other^s 
villanies'. What seems to make Lord Bolingbroke most 
angry, and I suppose does, is Pope's having presumed to 
correct his work. As to his printing so many copies, it 
certainly was a compliment, and the more profit (which 
however could not be immense) he expected to make^ the 
greater opinion he must have conceived of the merit of the 
work : if one had a mind to defend Pope, should not one 
ask if anybody ever blamed Virgil's executors for not burn- 
ing the JEneid, as he ordered them ' ? Warburton ^^ I hear» 
does design to defend Pope ; and my uncle Horace to answer 
the book : his style, which is the worst in the world, must 
be curious, in opposition to the other. But here comes foil 
as bad a part of the story as any : Lord Bolingbroke, to 
buy himself out of the abuse in the Duke of Marlborough's 
Life, or to buy himself into the supervisal of it, gave these 
letters to Mallet, who is writing this Life for a legacy in 
the old Duchess's will (and which, with much humour, she 
gave, desiring it might not be written in verse), and Mallet 
sold them to a bookseller for a hundred- and fifty pounds. 
Mallet had many obligations to Pope^ no disobligations to 
him, and was one of his grossest flatterers; witness the

Jacobitism of the Queen's four last years. They wanted 
to get Dover Oastle into their hands, and sent down Prior

was his brother", to persuade him to give it up. He sent 
Prior back with great anger, and in three weeks was turned

subjects with singing Ood Save ike King to them over the 
rails of the temoe. The Duke of Modena supped there, 
and the Duke was asked, but he answered, it was im- 
possible! In short, he could not adjust his dignity to a 
mortal banquet There was another admirable scene : Lady 
Burlington brought the Yiolette, and the Richmonds had 
asked Garrick, who stood ogling and sighing the whole time, 
while my Lady kept a most fierce look out *• Sabbatini, one 
of the Duke of Modena's court, was asking me who all the 
people were? and who is that ? 'C'est Miladi Hartington, la 
belle ^\le du Due de Deyonshire/ ' Et qui est cette autre dame 
ayec?' It was a distressing question ; after a little hesita- 
tion, I replied, ' Mais c'est Mademoiselle Violette — ' Et com- 
ment Mademoiselle Violette I j'ai connu une Mademoiselle 
Violette par exemple.' — I beg^^ed him to look at Miss Bishop. 

In the middle of all these principalities and powers was 
the Duchess of Queensberry, in her old forlorn trim, a white 
apron and white liood, and would make the Duke swallow 
all her undress. T'other day she drove to Lady Sophia

anecdote that I found f other day ii^n old French author, 
which is as great a drawback on beaux sentifnents and

giving an account of the Queen of Scots' execution ; he says, 
th^ night before, knowing her body must be stripped for her 
shroud, she would have her feet washed, because she used 
ointment to one of them which was sore. I believe I have 
told you, that in a very old trial of her, which I bought from 
Lord Oxford's collection, it is said that she was a large lame 
woman. Take sentiments out of their pantoufles, and 
reduce them to the infirmities of mortality, what a falling

into politics, and it was started that the national debt was 
a benefit. 'I am sure it is not,' said Mr. Townahend; 
' I can't tell why, but my brother Charles can, and I wfll 
send to him for arguments.' Charles was at supper at 
another tavern, but so much the dupe of this message, that 
he literally called for ink and paper, wrote four long sides of 
aiguments, and sent word that, when his company broke up, 
he would come and give them more, which he did at one 
o'clock in the morning. I don't think you will laugh much 
less at what happened to me: I wanted a print out of 
a book, which I did not care to buy at Osbom's " shop : 
the next day he sent me the print, and begged that when 
I had anything to publish, I would employ him. 

I will now tell you, and finish this long letter, how

getting Mackenzie's connections, and that he was formerly of

Your brothers Ned and Oal dined with me to-day, and 
I carried the latter back to Richmond : as I passed over the 
green, I saw Lord Bath, Lord Lonsdale, and half a dozen 
more of the White's Club sauntering at the door of a house 
which they have taken there, and come to every Saturday 
and Sunday to play at whisk. You will naturally ask why 
they can't play at whisk in London on these two days as 
well as on the other five ; indeed I can't tell you, except 
that it is so established a fashion to go out of town at the 
end of the week, that people do go, though it be only into 
another town. It made me smile to see Lord Bath sitting 
there, like a citizen that has left off trade ! 

Your brother Ned has not seen Strawberry Hill since my . 
great improvements ; he was astonished : it is pretty : you 
never saw so tranquil a scene, without the least air of 
melancholy : I should hate it, if it was dashed with that. 
I forgot to ask Oal what is become of the books of Houghton 
which I gave him six months ago for you and Dr. Cocchi. 
You perceive I have got your letter of May 23rd, and with 
it Prince Craon's simple epistle to his daughter^ : I have no 
mind to deliver it : it would be a proper recommendation of 
a staring boy on his travels, and is consequently very suit- 
able to my colleague. Master St. Leger ; but one hates to be

letter with me, and talking of my prudence, I shall not 
wonder if she takes me for his bear>leader, his travelling

always thinking of Uazoning your pedigree* in the noblest 
colours, has turned oyer all my library, till he has ta|^)ed 
a new and yeiy great &mily for you: in shorty by your 
mother it is very clear that you are descended from Hubert 
de Burgh, Orand Justiciary to Richard the Second : indeed 
I think he was hanged' ; but that is a misfortune that will 
attend very illustrious genealogies ; it is as common to them 
as to the pedigrees about Paddington and Blackheath. 
I have had at least a dozen great-great-grand&thers that 
came to untimely ends. AU your virtuosos in heraldry are 
content to know that they had ancestors who lived five 
hundred years ago, no matter how they died A match with 
a low woman corrupts a stream of blood as long as the 
Danube, — tyranny, villany, and executions are mere flea- 
bites, and leave no stain. The good Lord of Bath, whom 
I saw on Richmond Oreen this evening, did intend, I believe, 
to ennoble my genealogy with another execution: how low 
is he sunk now from those views I and how entertaining to 
have lived to see all those virtuous Patriots proclaiming 
their mutual iniquities! Tour friend Hr. Dodington, it 
seems, is so reduced as to be relapsing into virtue. In my last 
I told you some curious anecdotes of another part of the 
band, of Pope and Bolingbroke. The friends of the former 
have published twenty pamphlets against the latter ; I say 
against the latter, for, as there is no defending Pope, they 
are reduced to satirize Bolingbroke. One of them tells him 
how little he would be known himself from his own 
writings, if he were not immortalized in Pope's ; and still 
more justly, that if he destroys Pope's moral character, what 
will become of his own, which has been retrieved and 
sanctified by the embalming art of his friend ? However,

1749] To Horace Mann 389 

there are still new discoyerieB made every day of Pope's 
dirty selfishness. Not content with the great profits which 
he proposed to make of the work in question, he could not 
bear that the interest of his money should be lost till 
Bolingbroke's death ; and therefore told him that it would 
cost very near as much to have the press set for half a dozen 
copies as it would for a complete edition, and by this means 
made Lord Bolingbroke pay very near the whole expense of 
the fifteen hundred. Another story I have been told on 
this occasion, was of a gentleman who, making a visit to 
Bishop Atterbury in France, thought to make his court by 
commending Pope. The Bishop replied not : the gentleman 
doubled the dose: at last the Bishop shook his head, and 
said, ' Mens curva in corpore curve I ' The world will now 
think justly of these men : that Pope was the greatest poet, 
but not the most disinterested man in the world ; and that 
Bolingbroke had not all those virtues and not all those 
talents which the other so proclaimed; and that he did 
not even deserve the friendship which lent him so much 
merit; and for the mere loan of which he dissembled 
attachment to Pope^ to whom in his heart he was as 
perfidious and as false as he has been to the rest of the 
world. 

The Duke of Devonshire* has at last resigned, for the 
unaccountable and unenvied pleasure of shutting himself 
up at Ghatsworth with his ugly mad Duchess * ; the more 
extraordinary sacrifice^ as he turned her head, rather than 
give up a favourite match for his son. She has consented to 
live with him there, and has even been with him in town 
for a few days, but did not see either her son or Lady 
Hartington. On his resignation he asked and obtained an

Don't flatter yourself with your approaching year of jubilee; 
its pomps and vanities will be nothing to the shows and 
triumphs we have had, and are having. I talk like an 
Englishman : here you know we imagine that a jubilee is 
a season of pageants, not of devotion ; but our Sabbath has 
really been all tilt and tournament. There have been, 
I think, no less than eight masquerades, the fireworks, and 
a public act at Oxford : to-morrow is an installation of six 
Elnights of the Bath, and in August of as many Garters: 
Saturday, Sunday, and Monday next, are the banquets at 
Cambridge, for the instalment of the Duke of Newcastle as 
Chancellor \ The whole world goes to it : he has invited,

of Bedford has always been unwilling to take one, having 
tied himself up in the days of his patriotism to forfeit great 
sums if ever he did. The King told him one day this 
winter, that he would give none away but to him and to 
Anspach. This distinction struck him : he could not refuse 
the honour; but he has endeavoured to waive it, as one 
imagines, by a scruple he raised against the oath, which 
obliges the knights, whenever they are within two miles of 
Windsor, to go and offer. The King would not abolish the 
oath, but has given a general dispensation for all breaches of

the gracious intention. The Prince was at Kew, so the 
message was delivered to Prince G^rge himseli The child, 
with great good sense, desired the Bishop to give his duty 
and thanks, and to assure the King that he should always 
obey him ; but that, as his father was out of town, he could 
send no other answer. Was not it clever? The design of 
not giving one riband to the Prince's children had made 
great noise : there was a JRemembrancer* on that subject ready 
for the press. This is the draftsman of the present age, and 
is generally levelled at the Duke, and filled with very

they will give me infinite pleasure by a visit. I stay here

square gardens, opened lawns^ swelled out a bow-window, 
erected a portico, planted groves, stifled ponds, and flounced 
himself with flowering shrubs and Kent-fences. You may 
imagine that I have a little hand in all this. Since I came 
hither, I have projected a colonnade to join his mansion to 
the ofBces, have been the death of a tree that intercepted 
the view of a bridge, for which, too, I have drawn a new

In shorti I have occasioned great speculation^ and diverted 
myself with the important mysteries that have been alem- 
bicked out of a trifle. In short, he had seen my ^de$ 
Walpolianm at Sir Luke Sohaub's, and sent by him to desii'e 
one. I sent him one, bound quite in coronation robes^ and 
went last Sunday to thank him for the honour. There were 
all the new Knights of the Garter. Affcer the Prince had 
whispered through every curl of Lord Granville's periwig, 
I dare say about as errant trifles as to me, he turned to me, 
and said such a crowd of civil things that I did not know 
what to answer ; commended the style and the quotations ; 
said I had sent him back to his Livy ; in short, that there 
were but two things he disliked, one, that I had not 
given it to him of my own accord, and the other, that 
I had abused his friend Andrea del Sarto; and that he 
insisted, when I came to town again, I should come and see 
two very fine ones that he has lately bought of that master. 
This drew on a very long conversation on painting, every 
word of which I suppose will be reported at the other court 
as a plan of opposition for the winter. Prince George 
was not there: when he went to receive the riband, the 
Prince carried him to the closet door, where the Duke of 
Dorset received and carried him. Ayscough*, or Nugent, 
or some of the genius's, had taught him a speech \ the child 
began it, the Monarch bounced and cried ' No, na' When 
the poor boy had a little recovered a fright, which to be sure 
flattered Majesty, as nobody has felt a grain of it so long, he 
began again; but the same tremendous sounds were re- 
peated, and the oration still-bom. How could one exert

Certainly, I am bom to preferment ; I gave an old beggar 
woman a penny once, who prayed that I might live to 
be Lord Mayor of London ! What pleased me most in my 
travels was Dr. Sayer's parsonage at Witham ', which, with 
Southcote's help, whose old Boman Catholic father lives jnst 
by him, he has made one of the most charming villas in 
England. There are sweet meadows falling down a hill, and 
rising again on t'other side of the prettiest little winding

You did not at all surprise me with the relation of the

dowager's handmaid. His savage temper increases every 
day. Qeorge Boscawen * is in a scrape with him by a court- 
martial, of which he is one ; it was appointed on a young 
poor soldier, who to see his friends had counterfeited 
a furlough of leave only for a day. They ordered him two 
hundred lashes; but Kolkejumskoi, who loves blood like 
a leech, insisted it was not enough — has made them sit 
three times, though every one adheres to the first sentence,

I suppose, of his other amour with the Savoyard girL He 
sent her to Windsor and offered her a hundred pound, which 
she refused because he was a heretic ; he sent her back on

Should I not condole with you upon the death of the 
head of the Cues *• ? If you have not heard hia will, I will 
tell you. The settled estate of eight thousand a year is to 
go between the two daughters", out of which is a jointure 
of three thousand a year to the Duchess Dowager, and to that 
he has added a thousand more out of the unsettled estate, 
which is nine thousand. He gives, together with his 
blessing, four thousand per annum rent-charge to the Duchess 
of Manchester in present, provided she will contest nothing 
with her sister, who is to have all the rest, and the rever- 
sion of the whole after Lady Cardigan and her children : 
but in case she disputes. Lady Hinchinbrook " and hers are 
in the entail next to the Cardigans, who are to take the 
Montagu name and livery. I don't know what Mr. Hussy 
will think of the blessing, but they say his Duchess will 
be inclined to mind it ; she always wanted to be well with 
her father, but hated her mother. There are two codicils, 
one in favour of lus servants, and the other of his dogs, cats, 
and creatures ; which was a little unnecessary, for Lady 
Cardigan has exactly his turn for saving everything's life". 
As he was making the codicil, one of his cats jumped on 
his knee : Whatf says he, have you a mind to he a witness too t 
You can% for you are a party concerned. The Duchess was

from the Duke : she said * No, it was her own money, and

with it. In the interim the Duke died. Had the Manchester 
been a legatee, she had lost it^ but it will not be worth the

Tou have seen the death of the Duke of Montagu^ in aU 
the papers. His loss will be extremely felt ! he paid no less 
than 2,7001 a year in private pensions, which ought to be 
known, to balance the immense history of his places; of 
which he was perpetually obtaining new, and making the 
utmost of all : he had quartered on the Great Wardrobe no 
less than thirty nominal tailors and arras-workers. This 
employment is to be dropped ; his others are not yet given 
away. My father had great opinion of his understanding, 

Lrrm296.~i John, the la«t Duke of the Bath, Master of the Oxeat 
of IContagn, was Knight of the Wardrobe, Colonel of the Blneo, Ac,

and at the beginning of the war was most desirous of 
persuading him to be G^neralisaimo ; but the Duke was 
very diffident of himself and, having seen little aervioe, 
would not accept it. In short, witii some foibles, he was 
a most amiable man, and one of the most feeling I ever knew. 
His estate is 17,0002L a year; the Duchess of Manchester 
must have four of it ; all the rest he has given, after four 
thousand a year to the Duchess Dowager shall fall in, to 
his other daughter Lady Cardigan. Lord Vere Beauclero * 
has thrown his into the list of vacant employments: he 
resigned his Lordship of the Admiralty on Anson's being 
preferred to him for Vice- Admiral of England; but what 
heightened the disgust, was Lord Vere's going a party to 
visit the docks with Sandwich and Anson, after this was 
done, and yet they never mentioned it to him. It was not 
possible to converse with them upon good terms every day 
afterwards. Tou perceive our powers and places are in a 
very fluctuating situation : the Prince will have a catalogue 
of discontented ready to fill the whole civil list. My Lord 
Chancellor was terrified the other day with a vision of 
such a revolution : he saw Lord Bath kiss hands, and had 
like to have dropped the seals with the agony of not 
knowing what it was for — ^it was only for his going to Spa. 
However, as this is an event which the Chancellor has never 
thought an impossible one, he is daily making Christian 
preparation against it. He has just married his other 
daughter' to Sir John Heathcote-s son; a Prince little

say, there is a peerage already promised to him by the title 
of Lord Normanton. The King has consented to give two 
earldoms to replace the great families of Somerset and 
Northumberland in their descendants ; Lady Betty Smithson 
is to have the latter title after the Duke of Somerset's 
deaths and Sir Charles Windham any other appellation he 
shall choose. Tou know Lord Granville had got a grant of 
Northumberland for him, but it was stopped* These two 
hang a little, by the Duke of Somerset's wanting to have the 
earldom for his son-in-law ^ instead of his daughter '. 

Tou ask me about the principles of the Methodists : I have 
tried to learn them, and have read one of their books. The 
visible part seems to be nothing but stricter practice than 
that of our Church, clothed in the old exploded cant of 
mystical devotion. For example, you take a metaphor ; we 
will say our passions are toeeds ; you immediately drop every 
description of the passions, and adopt everything peculiar to 
weeds : in five minutes a true Methodist will talk with the 
greatest compunction of hoeing — this catches women of 
fashion and shopkeepers. 

I have now a request to make to you : Mrs. Gibbeme * is 
extremely desirous of having her son come to England for 
a short time. There is a small estate left to the {Bumly, 
I think by the uncle ; his presence is absolutely necessary : 
however, the poor woman is so happy in his situation with 
you, that she talks of giving up ever3rthing rather than 
disoblige you by fetching him to England. She has been 
so unfortunate as to lose a favourite daughter, that was just

Tou always let us draw upon you for such weight of

to show my attention, and the regard I have for Count 
Lorenzi*, yet it would be burning ingratitude not to repay 
you. I have aocordin^y been trying to be very civil to the 
Chevalier; I did see him once at Florenee. To-morrow 
I am to fetch him hither to dinner, from Putney, where the 
Hirepoix's have got a house. I gave Madame her father's 
simple lettei^ of ^rtueh she took no more notice than it 
deserved ; but Prince Beauvau has written her a very 
particular one about me, and is to come over himself in the 
winter to make me a visit : this has warmed their poUUesse. 
I should have known the Ambassadress anywhere by the 
likeness to her funily. He is cold and stately, and not

the last bd air, and spoke the freshest jargon. These 
people have scarce ever lived at Pans, are reasonable, and 
little amusing with follies. They have brought a cousin of 
his, a Monsieur de L4vi, who has a tantino of what I wanted 
to see. You know they pique themselves much upon their 
Jewish name, and call cousins with the Yligin Mary. They

There is nothing like news : Kensington Palace had like 
to have made an article the other night ; it was on fire : my 
Lady Yarmouth has an ague, and is forced to keep a con- 
stant fire in her room against the damps. When my Lady 
Suffolk lived in that apartment, the floor produced a con- 
stant crop of mushrooms. Though there are so many 
vacant chambers, the King hoards all he can, and has 
locked up half the palace since the Queen's death : so he 
does at St. James's, and I believe would put the rooms out 
to interest, if he could get a closet a year for them I Some- 
body told my Lady Yarmouth they wondered she would 
live in that unwholesome apartment, when there are so 
many other rooms : she replied, ' Mais pas pour moy.' 

The scagliuola tables are arrived, and only one has 
suffered a little on the edge: the pattern is perfectly pretty. 
It would oblige me much if you could make the friar make 
a couple more for me, and with a little more expedition. 

Don't be so humble about your pedigree: there is not 
a pipe of good blood in the kingdom but we will tap for 
you: Mr. Chute has it now in painting; and you may 
depend on having it with the most satisfactory proofs, as 
soon as it can possibly be finished. He has taken great 
pains, and fathomed half the genealogies in England for 
you. 

You have been extremely misinformed about my father's 
writing his own history : I often pressed it, but he never 
once threw a thought that way. He neither loved reading 
nor writing ; and at last, the only time he had leisure, was 
not well enough. He used to say, 'that but few men 
should ever be ministers, for it let them see too much of 
the badness of mankind.' Tour story, I imagine^ was in- 
oculated on this speech. Adieu I

I flatter myaelf that you are quite reooTered of your 
disorder, and that your siaters will not look with an evil 
eye on Strawberry Hill. 

Mr. Chute and I are returned from our expedition, 
miraculously well, considering all our distresses. If you 
loye good roads, convenienciBS, good inns, plenty of pos- 
tilions and horses, be so kind to yourself as never to go 
into Sussex. We thought ourselves in the northest part 
of England ; the whole eountry has a Saxon air, and the 
inhabitants are as savage, as if King George the Second 
was the first monarch of the East Angles. Coaches grow 
there no more than balm and spices ; we were forced to drop 
our post-chaise, in which we were thrice overturned, and hire 
a machine'that resembled nothing so much as Harlequin's 
calash ^ which was occasionally a chaise or a baker's cart 
We journeyed over Alpine mountains, drenched in clouds, 
and thought of Harlequin again, when he was driving the 
chariot of the sun through the morning clouds, and so was 
glad to hear the aqua vUte man crying a dram. At last we 
got to Arundel Castle, which was visibly built for defence 
in an impracticable country. It is now only a heap of 
ruins, with a new indifferent apartment dapt up for the 
Norfolks, when they reside there for a week or a fortnight. 
Their priest showed us about. There are i^e walls of a 
round tower where a garrison held out against Cromwell ; 
he planted a battery on the top of the church, and reduced 
them, lliere is a gloomy gateway and dungeons, in one of

feathered ; and two antique vases with bas-relieves, as per* 
feet and beautiful as if they were carved by a Orecian 
master. There is a noble Claud Lorrain, a very curious 
picture of the haughty Anne Stanhope', the Protector's 
wife, pretty, but not giving one an idea of her character, 
and many old portraits ; but the housekeeper was at London, 
and we did not learn half. The chapel is grand and proper.

with a whole-length picture of Sir Anthony Brown ^^ in the 
dress in which he wedded Anne of Cleves by proxy. 
He is in blue and white, only his right leg is entirely 
white, which was certainly robed for the act of putting into

I expect Sir Charles Williams to scold me excessively. 
He wrote me a letter, in which he desired that I would 
send you word by last night's post, that he expected to 
meet you here by Michaelmas, according to your promise. 
I was unfortunately at London; the letter was directed 
hither from Lord Bchester's, where he is; and so I did 
not receive it till this morning. I hope, however, this will 
be time enough to put you in mind of your appointment ; 
but while I am so much afiraid of Sir Charles's anger, I seem 
to forget the pleasure I shall have in seeing you myself; 
I hope you know that : but he is still more pressing, as he 
will stay so little time in England. Adieu I

are the wise people that build for him? Sir PhlUp Hobby' 
seems to be the only person likely to be benefited by this 
new extrayagance. I have just seoi a collection of tombs 
like those you describe; the house of RussdU robed in 
alabaster and painted. There are seven monuments in all ; 
one is immense, flaunting in marble, cherubim'd and sera- 
phim'd, crusted with bas*reliefs and titles, for the first Duke 
of Bedford' and his Duchess. All these are in a chapel 
of the church at Cheneys', the seat of the first Earls. 
There are but piteous fragments of the house remaining, 
now a farm, built round three sides of a court. It is 
dropping down, in several places without a roof, but in half 
the windows are beautiful arms in painted glass. As these 
are so totally neglected, I propose making a push, and 
begging them of the Duke of Bedford. They would be 
magnificent for Strawberry Castle. Did I tell you that 
I have found a text in Deuteronomy to authorize my future 
battlements? When thou bmldest a new house, then s^iaU 
thou make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not Uood 
upon thy house, if any manfaUfrom thence. 

I saw Cheneys at a visit I have been making to Hany

is large and bad, old but of a bad age ; finely situated on

would have taken him for Binaldo. Now I have dipped

could tell me little about it Tou know how out of humour

which is at least as wise as making a serious point of haran-

I ever contracted a moment's vanity from any of our dis- 
coveries, or ever prefeired them to anything but brag and

found out that there must go a million of ancestors in

Yon neyer was more oonveniently in fault in your life : 
I haye been going to make you ezousee these ten days for 
not writing ; and while I was inventing^ them, your humble 
letter of Oct. 10th arrives. I am so glad to find it is you 
that are to blame, not L Well, well, I am all good-nature, 
I forgive you ; I can overlook such little negligences. 

Hr. Chute is inde&tigable in your service, but Anstis has 
been very troublesome; he makes as many difficulties in 
signing a certificate about folks that are dead as if they 
were claiming an estate. I am sorry you are so pressed, for 
poor Hr. Chute is taken off from this pursuit: he was 
fetched from hence this day se'nnight to his infernal 
brother's, where a Mrs. Mildmay, whom you must have 
heard him mention, is dead suddenly : this may turn out 
a very great misfortune to our friend. 

Tour friend, Mr. Dodington, has not quite stuck to the 
letter of the declaration he sent you : he is first minister at 
Carlton House \ and is to lead the opposition ; but the mis- 
fortune is, nobody will be led by him. The whole court is 
in disorder by this event : everybody else laughs.

I never saw a creature so grateful I It is impossible not to 
be touched with the attachment he has for you. He talks 
of returning; and, indeed, I would advise it for his sake: 
he is quite spoiled' for living in England, and had entirely 
forgot what Visigoths his countrymen are. But I must 
drop him to thank you for the charming intaglio which you 
have stolen upon me by his means: it is admired as much

and the hurt did not deserve mentioning. The relation is 
so near tiie truth, that I need not repeat it ; and, indeed, 
the frequent repetition has been much worse than the 
robbery. I have at hist been relieved by the riots' at 
the new French theatre, and by Lord Coke's lawsuit*. 
The first has been opened twice; the latter to-day. The

a thousand times for having felt so much on my account* 
Gibbeme has been with me again to-day, as his mother was 
a fortnight ago: she talked me to death, and three times 
after telling me her whole history, she said, ^Well, then. 
Sir, upon the whole,' and began it all again. Upon (he tchdle, 
I think she has a mind to keep her son in England ; and he 
has a mind to be kept, though in my opinion he is very 
unfit for living in England — ^he is too polished ! For trade, 
she says, he is in a cold sweat if she mentions it ; and so 
they propose, by the acquaintance, he says, his mother has 
among the quality, to get him that nothing called some- 
thing. I assured them, you had too much friendship for 
him to desire his return, if it would be a prejudice to his 
interest — did not I say right? He seems a good creature ; 
too good to make his way here. 

I beg you will not omit sending me every tittle that 
happens to compose my Lady Pomfret's second volume. 
We see j)erpetual articles of the sale of the furniture in the 
Great Duke's villas: is there any truth in it? You would 
Imow me again, if you saw me pla3ring at pharaoh on one 
side of Madame de Mirepoiz, as I used to do by her mother : 
I like her extremely, though she likes nothing but gaming. 
His pleasure is dancing : don't you envy anybody that can 
have spirits to be so simple as to like themselves in a minuet 
after fifiy? Don't tell his brother, but the Chevalier Lorenzi 
is the object of the &mily's entertainment. With all the 
Italian thirst for English knowledge, he vents as many 
absurdities as if he had a passion for Ireland too. He saw 
some of the Florentine gesses at Lord Lincoln's ; he showed 
them to the Ambassadress with great transport, and assured 
her that the Great Duke had the originals, and that there 
never had been made any copies of them. He told her the 
other day that he had seen a sapphire of the size of her 
diamond ring, and worth more : she said that could not be.

I want to know Dr. Cocchi's and your opinion of two 
new French books, if you have seen them. One is Montes- 
quieu's Esprit des Lois ; which I think the best book that 
ever was written — at least I never learned half so much 
from all I ever read. There is as much wit as useful know- 
ledge. He is said to have hurt his reputation by it in 
France, which I can conceive, for it is almost the interest 
of everybody there that can understand it to decry it The 
other, far inferior, but entertaining, is Hainault's^ Ahr6g6 
Chronclogigue de THisUrire de France. It is very amusing, 
though very full of Frenehisms ; and though an abridgement, 
often so minute as to tell you when the Quinzevingts ' first 
wore flower-de-luces on their shoulders: but there are several 
little circumstances that give one an idea of the manners 
of old time, like Dr. Cocchi's treatise on the old rate of 
expenses. 

There has been nothing particular in Parliament: all 
our conversation has turned on the Westminster election, 
on which, after a vast struggle. Lord Trentham' had the 
majority. Then came on the scrutiny: after a week's 
squabbling on the right of election, the High Bailiff declared 
what he would take to be the right. They are now pro-

Lord Pembroke* died last night: he had been at the 
Bridge Committee' in the morning, where, according to 
custom, he fell into an outrageous passion; as my Lord 
Chesterfield told him, that ever since the pier sunk he has 
constantly been damming and sinking. The watermen say 
to-day, that now the great pier (peer) is quite gone. Charles 
Stanhope ' carried him home in his chariot ; he desired the 
coachman to drive gently, for he could not avoid those 
passions; and afterwards, between shame and his asthma, 
he always felt daggers, and should certainly one day or 
other die in one of those fits. ArundeF, his great friend 
and relation, came to him soon after: he repeated the con-

went near to destroy post-chaisee, on a quarrel with the 
postmaster at Hounslow, who, as he told the Bishop of 
Chichester'®, had an hundred devils and Jesuits in his 
belly. In short, he was one of the lucky English madmen 
who get people to say, that whatever extravagance they 
commit^ 'Oh, it is his way.' He began his life with 
boxing, and ended it with living upon vegetables, into 
which system avarice a little entered. At the beginning 
of the present war, he very honourably would resign his 
regiment, though the King pressed him to keep it, because 
his rupture hindered his serving abroad. My father, with 
whom he was always well, would at any time have given 
him the blue riband ; but he piqued himself on its being 
offered to him without asking it : the truth was, he did not 
care for the expense of the instalment. His great excellence 
was architecture: the bridge at Wilton is more beautiful 
than anything of Lord Burlington or Kent. He has left 
an only son, a fine boy about sixteen '^ Last week, Lord 
Crawford '' died too, as is supposed, by taking a large 
quantity of laudanum, under impatience at the badness 
of his circumstances, and at the seventeenth opening of the 
wound which he got in Hungary, in a battle with the 
Turks. I must tell you a story apropos of two noble 
instances of fidelity and generosity. His servant, a French 
papist, saw him fall; watched, and carried him off into 
a ditch. Lord Crawford told him the Turks would certainly

find them, and that, as he could not live himself, it was in 
vain for him to risk his life too, and insisted on the man 
making his escape. After a long contest, the servant retired, 
found a priest, confessed himself, came back, and told his 
lord that he now was prepared to die, and would never leave 
him. The enemy did not return, and both were saved. 
After Lord Crawford's death, this story was related to old 
Charles Stanhope, Lord Harrington's brother, whom I men- 
tioned just now : he sent for the fellow, told him he could 
not take him himself, but, as from his lord's afiGEurs he con- 
cluded he had not been able to provide for him, he would 
give him fifty pound, and did. 

To make up for my long silence, and to make up a long 
letter, I will string another old story, which I have just 
heard, to this. General Wade was at a low gaming-house, 
and had a very fine snuff-box, which on a sudden he missed. 
Everybody denied having taken it : he insisted on searching 
the company. He did : there remained only one man, who 
had stood behind him, but refused to be searched, unless the 
General would go into another room alone with him : there 
the man told him, that he was born a gentleman, was 
reduced, and lived by what little bets he could pick up 
there, and by fragments which the waiters sometimes gave 
him. ^ At this moment I have half a fowl in my pocket ; 
I was afraid of being exposed ; here it is I Now, Sir, you 
may search me.' Wade was so struck, that he gave the 
man a hundred poimds; and immediately the genius of 
generosity, whose province is almost a sinecure^ was very 
glad of the opportunity of making him find his own snuff- 
box, or another very like it, in his own pocket again.

the other night in Great Sussell Street, by nine men : the 
King gave her a gold watch and chain the next day. She 
says, 'the manner was all' — ^and indeed so it was, for 
I never saw a more frippery present ; especially considering 
how great a favourite she is, and my Lady Yarmouth's 
friend. The Monarch is never less generous than when he 
has a mind to be so: the only present he ever made my 
father was a laige diamond, cracked quite through. Once 
or twice, in his younger and gallant days, he has brought 
out a handful of maimed topaases and amethysts, and given 
them to be raffled for by the Haids of Honour. I told my 
Lady Yarmouth it had been a great loss to me that there 
was no Queen, for then I suppose I should have had a watch 
too when I was robbed. 

We have had nothing remarkable in Parliament, but 
a sort of secession the other day on the Mutiny Bill, when 
Lord Egmont and the opposition walked out of the House, 
because the ministry would go on upon the Report, when 
they did not like it It is a measure of the Prince's court 
to lie by, and let the ministry demolish one another, which 
they are hurrying to do. The two Secretaries' are on the 
brink of declaring war : the occasion is likely to be given 
by a Turnpike Bill, contested between the counties of Bed- 
ford and Northampton ; and it grows almost as vehement 
a contest as the famous one between Aylesbury and Buck- 
ingham*. The Westminster election is still hanging in 
scrutiny ; the Duke of Bedford paid the election ^ which 
he owns to have cost seven thousand pounds; and Lord 
€k>wer pays the scrutiny, which will be at least as much.

Morrioes*. The Duke^ espouses the Bedford; and Lord 
Sandwich is espoused by both. He goes once or twice 
a week to hunt with the Duke ; and as the Litter has taken 
a turn of gaming, Sandwich, to make his court — and fortune 
— carries a box and dice in his pocket ; and so they throw 
a main, whenever the hounds are at faulty ^ upon eyery green 
hill, and under every green tree.' 

But we have one shocking piece of news, the dreadful 
account of the hurricane in the East Indies': you will see 
the particulars in the papers ; but we reckon that we don't 
yet know the worst. Poor Admiral Boscawen' has been 
most unfortunate ^° during his whole expedition ; and what 
increases the horror is, that I have been assured by a very 
intelligent person, that Lord Anson projected this business 
on purpose to ruin Boscawen, who, when they came together 
from the victory off Cape Finisterre, complained loudly of 
Anson's behaviour. To silence and to hurt him, Anson 
dispatched him to Pondicherry, upon slight intelligence 
and upon improbable viewa 

Lord Coke's suit is still in suspense ; he has been dying : 
she was to have died, but has recovered wonderfully on his 
taking the lead. Mr. Chute diverted me excessively with 
a confidence that Chevalier Lorenzi made him the other 
night — I have told you the style of his hon-mots! He said

he should certainly return to England again, and that 
whenever he did, he would land at Bristol, because baths 
are the best places to make acquaintance, — just as if Mr. 
Chute, after living seven jears in Italy, and keeping the 
best company, should return thither, and land at Leghorn, 
in order to make Italian acquaintance at Pisa ! 

Among the robberies, I might have told you of the eldest 
Miss Pelham" leaving a pair of diamond earrings, which she 
had borrowed for the birth-day, in a hackney chair ; she had 
put them under the seat for fear of being attacked, and forgot 
them. The chairmen have sunk them. The next morning, 
when they were missed, the damsel began to cry; Lady 
Catherine^' grew fiightened, lest her infanta should vex 
herself sick, and summoned a jury of matrons to consult 
whether she should give her hartshorn or lavender drops ? 
Mrs. Selwyn^', who was on the panel, grew veiy peevish, 
and said, 'Phol give her brilliant drops.' Such are the

beyond what was ever known tfi any other country ; Italy is 
quite north with respect to us I — ^You know we hare had an 
earthquake. Mr. Chute's Fracoesco says, that a few evenings 
before it there was a bright cloud, which the mob called the 
bloody doud ; that he had been told there never were earth- 
quakes in England, or else he should have known by that 
symptom that there would be one within a week. I am 
told that Sir Isaac Newton foretold a great alteration in our 
climate in the year '50, and that he wished he could live to 
see it. Jupiter, I think, has jogged us three degrees nearer 
to the sun ; but I don't tell you this for gospel, though 
I talk as bad astronomy as if I were inspired. 

The Bedford Turnpike, which I announced to you in my 
last, is thrown out by a migority of fifty-two against the 
Duke of Bedford. The Pelhams, who lent their own persons 
to him, had set up the Duke of Orafton, to list their own 
dependents under against their rivaL When the Chamber- 
lain would head a party, you may be sure the opposite power 
is in the wane. The Newcastle is at open war, and has left 
off voting on the Duke, who espouses the Bedfords. 
Mr. Pelham tries to patch it up, and is getting the Ordnance 
for the Duke ^ ; but there are scarce any terms kept. Lord 
Sandwich, who governs the little Duke' through the Duchess, 
is the chief object of the Newcastle's hatred. Indeed there 
never was such a composition ! he is as capable of all little 
knavery, as if he was not practising all great knavery. 
During the turnpike contest, in which he laboured night 
and day against his friend Halifax, he tried the grossest 
tricks to break agreements, when the opposite side were 
gone away on the security of a suspension of action : and in 
the very middle of that I came to the knowledge of a cruel 
piece of flattery which he paid to his protector. He had 
made interest for these two years for one Parry, a poor

clergyman, schoolfellow and friend of his, to he Fellow of 
Eton, and had secured a majority for him. A Fellow died : 
another wrote to Sandwich to know if he was not to vote 
for Parry according to his engagement, — ^ No, he must vote 
for one who had been tutor to the Buke of Bedford,' who by 
that means has carried it. Hy Lady Lincoln' was not 
suffered to go to a ball which Sandwich made the other 
night for the Buke^ who tumbled do¥m in the middle of 
a country dance ; they imagined he had beat his nose flat, 
but he lay like a tortoise on the top shelly his &ce could not 
reach the ground by some feet Hy Lady Anson* was 
there, who insisted on dancing minuets, though against the 
rule of the night, with as much eagerness as you remember 
in my Lady Granville. Then she proposed herself for 
a louvre '; all the men vowed they had never heard of such 
a dance, upon which she dragged out Lady Betty Leve6on^ 
and made her dance one with her. 

At the last ball at the same house, a great dispute of 
precedence, which the Buchess of Norfolk had set on foot 
but has dropped, came to a trial Lord Sandwich oonifiotd 
to be on the outside of the door to hand down to supper 
whatever lady came out first Madame de Mirepoix and the 
Buchess of Bedford were the rival queens ; the latter made 
a faint offer to the ambassadress to go first ; she returned it 
and the other briskly accepted it ; upon which the ambassa- 
dress, with great cleverness, made all the other women go 
before her, and then asked the Buke of Bedford if he would 
not go too. However, though they continue to visit, the

wound is incurable: you don't imagine that a widow' of 
the House of Lonain, and a daughter of Princess Craon, can 
digest such an affront. It certainly was very absurd, as she 
is not only an ambassadress but a stranger ; and consequently 
all English women, as being at home, should give her place. 
King George the Second and I don't agree in our explication 
of this text of ceremony ; he approves the Duchess— so he 
does Miss Ghudleigh, in a point where ceremony is out of 
the question. He opened the trenches before her a fortnight 
ago, at the masquerade — ^but at the last she had the gout, 
and could not come ; he went away fart cross. His son is

he attends "as incessantly as Mrs. Cannon y The other 
morning the Princess came to call him to go to Eew ; he 
made her wait in her coach above half an hour at the door. 
Tou will be delighted with a hon-mot of a chair-maker*, 
whom he has discarded for voting for Lord Trentham ; one 
of his black-caps was sent to tell this Yaughan that the 
Prince would employ him no more; 'I am going to bid 
another person make his Boyal Highness a chair.' — 'With 
all my heart,' said the chair-maker ; ' I don't care what they 
make him, so they don't make him a throne.' 

The Westminster election, which is still scrutinizing, 
produced us a parliamentary event this week, and was very 
near producing something much bigger. Mr. Fox and 
Mr. Pitt moved to send for the High Bailiff to inquire into 
the delay. The opposition took it up very high, and on its 
being carried against them, the Court of Bequests was filled

next day with mob, and the House crowded, and big with 
exj)ectation. Nugent had flamed and abused Lord Sandwich 
violently, as author of this outrageous measure. When the 
Bailiff appeared, the pacific spirit of the other part of the 
administration had operated so much, that he was dismissed 
with honour ; and only instructed to abridge all dela]^ by 
authority of the House^^in short, ^we spit in his hat on 
Thursday, and wiped-^t off on Friday.' This is a new 
fashionable proverb which I must construe to you. About 
ten days ago, at the new Lady Cobham's'^ assembly, Lord 
Hervey ^ was leaning over a chair talking to some women, 
and holding his hat in his hand Lord Cobham came up 
and spit in it — yes, spit in it ! — and then, with a loud laugh, 
turned to Nugent, and said, 'Pay me my wager.' In short, 
he had laid a guinea that he committed this absurd brutaliiy, 
and that it was not resented. Lord Hervey, with great 
temj)er and sensibility, asked if he had any farther occasion 
for his hat? — 'Oh ! I see you are angry I* — *Not very well 
pleased.' Lord Cobham took the fatal hat, and wiped it^ 
made a thousand foolish apologies, and wanted to pass it for 
a joke. Next morning he rose with the sun, and went to 
visit Lord Hervey ; so did Nugent : he would not see them, 
but wrote to the Spitter (or, as he is now called. Lord 
Gh>b'em), to say, that he had affronted him very grossly 
before company, but having involved Nugent in it, he 
desired to know to which he was to address himself for 
satisfaction. Lord Cobham wrote him a most submissive 
answer, and begged pardon both in his own and Nugent's 
name. Here it rested for a few days ; till getting wind,

Lord Hervey wrote again to insist on an explicit apology 
under Lord Gobham's own hand, with a rehearsal of the 
excuses that had been made to him. This too was complied 
with, and the fair conqueror ^* shows all the letters. Nugent's 
disgraces have not ended here: the night of his having 
declaimed so furiously against Lord Sandwich, he was 
standing by Lady Catherine Pelham, at the masquerade, 
without his mask : she was telling him a history of a mad 
dog (which I belieye she had bit herself), young Leveson^', 
the Duchess of Bedford's brother, came up, without his 
mask too, and looking at Nugent, said, ' I have seen a mad 
dog to-day, and a siUy dog too.' — ' I suppose, Mr. Leveson, 
you haye been looking in the glass.' — 'No, I see him now.' 
Upon which they walked off together, but were prevented 
from fighting (if Nugent would have fought), and were 
reconciled at the side-board. Tou perceive by this that our 
factions are ripening. The Argyll carried all the Scotch 
against the turnpike : they were willing to be carried, for 
the Duke of Bedford, in case it should have come into the 
Lords, had writ to the sixteen peers to solicit their votes ; 
but with so little deference, that he enclosed all the letters 
under one cover, directed to the British Coffee-house \ ^^

to say that I voted in it for the continent of America I The 
destruction of the miserable inhabitants by the Spaniards 
was but a momentary misfortune, that flowed from the i 
discovery of the New World, compared to this lasting havoc 
which it brought upon AMca. We reproach Spain, and yet < 
do not even pretend the nonsense of butchering these poor 
creatures for the good of their souls ! 

I have just received your I<mg letter of Feb. 13th, and am 
pleased that I had writ this volume to return it. I don't 
know how almost to avoid wishing poor Prince Craon dead, 
to see the Princess end upon a throne". I am sure she 
would invert Mr. Yaughan's wish, and compound to have 
nothing else made for her, provided a throne were. 

I despise your UteraH enormously for their opinion of 
Montesquieu's book. Bid them read that glorious chapter 
on the subject I have been m^itioning, the selling of 
African slaves. Where did he borrow that ? In what book 
in the world is there half so much wit, sentiment, delicacy, 
humanity? 

I shall speak much more gently to you, my dear child,

only proper for magnificent and public buildings. Columns

crowded into a closet or a chee^ecake^house. The variety is 
little, and admits no charming irregularities. I am almost

My text is not literally true ; but as far as earthquakes go

more violent than the first ; and you must not be surprised 
if by next post you hear of a burning mountain sprung up in 
Smithfield. In the night between Wednesday and Thursday

flung up. I got up and found people running into the

two old houses flung down, several chimneys, and much

'Lord I one can't help going into the country ! ' The only 
visible effect it has had, was on the ridotto, at which, being 
the following night, there were but four hundred people. 
A parson, who came into White's the morning of earthquake 
the first, and heard bets laid on whether it was an earth- 
quake or the blowing up of powder-mills, went away ex-

The Middlesex election is carried against the Court '^i the

hallooed the voters on to Brentford '. The Jacobites are 
so transported, that they are opening subscriptions for all 
boroughs that shall be vacant — ^this is wise! They will 
spend their money to carry a few more seats in a Parliament 
where they will never have the minority, and so have none 
to carry the general elections* The omen, however, is bad 
for Westminster; the High Bailiff went to vote for the 
opposition.

hers ; that is, that will be very like hers, if hers is but like 
it. I will tell it you in as few words as I can. Madame la 
Mardchale de I'Hdpital was the daughter of a sempstress' ; 
a young gentleman fell in love with her, and was going to 
be married to her, . . / but the match was broken off. An 
old fermier'g6n^ralf who had retired into the province where 
this happened, hearing the story, had a curiosity to see the 
victim ; he liked her, married her, died, and left her enough 
not to care for her inconstant . . .^ She came to Paris, where 
the Mar6chal de rHdpital married her for her riches. Afiier 
the Mar^chal's death, Casimir, the abdicated King of Poland, 
who was retired into France, fell in love with the Hiardchale, 
and privately married her. If the event ever happens,

810. To HoBACE Mann. 

Arlington Street, April 2, 1750. 
Tou will not wonder so much at our earthquakes as at 
the effects they have had. All the women in town have 
taken them up upon the foot of Judgements ^ ; and the clergy, 
who have had no windfalls of a long season, have driven 
horse and foot into this opinion. There has been a shower 
of sermons and exhortations : Seeker, the Jesuitical Bishop of 
Oxford, began the mode. He heard the women were all 
going out of town to avoid the next shock ; and so, for fear 
of losing his Easter offerings, he set himself to advise them 
to await Gknl's good pleasure in fear and trembling. But 
what is more astonishing, Sherlock ', who has much better 
sense, and much less of the Popish confessor, has been 
running a race with him for the old ladies, and has written 
a pastoral letter, of which ten thousand were sold in two 
days ) and fiffy thousand have been subscribed for, since the 
two first editions. Tou never read so impudent, so absurd 
a piece! This earthquake, which has done no hurt, in 
a country where no earthquake ever did any, is sent, accord* 
ing to the Bishop, to punish ba w d y prints, bavid^ books (in 
one of which Mrs. Pilkington ' drew his Lordship's picture),

not, wliich he makee a principal ingredient in the composi- 
tion of an earthquake, because not haying been able to 
answer a late piece, which Middleton has writ against him, 
he has turned the Doctor over to God for punishment, even 
in this world. Here is an epigram, which this subject put 
into my head : 

When Whitfield preaches, and when Whiston writes, 
All cry, that madness dictates either's flights. 
When Sherlock writes, or canting Seeker preaches^ 
All think good sense inspires wluit either teaches. 
Why, when all four for the same gospel fight, 
Should two be crazy, two be in the right? 
Plain is the reason — every son of Eve 
Thinks the two madmen, what they teach, belieya 

I told you the women talked of going out of town : 
"several families are literally gone, and many more going 
to-day and to-morrow ; for what adds to the absurdity, is, 
that the second shock having happened exactly a month 
after the former, it prevails that there will be a third on 
Thursday next, another month, which is to swallow up 
London. I am almost ready to bum my letter now I have 
begun it, lest you should think I am laughing at you : but 
it is so true, that Arthur of White's told me last nighty 
that he should put off the last ridotto, which was to be 
on Thursday, because he hears nobody would come to it 
I have advised several who are going to keep their next 
earthquake in the country, to take the bark for it, as it 
is so periodic. Dick Leveson and Ur. Kigby, who had 
supped and stayed late at Bedford House the other night, 
knocked at several doors, and in a watchman's voice cried, 
* Past four o'clock, and a dreadful earthquake I ' But I have 
done with this ridiculous panic : two pages were too much 
to talk of it 
We have had nothing in Parliament but trade bills^ on

one of which the Speaker humbled the arrogance of Sir 
John Barnard, who had reflected upon the proceedings of 
the House. It is to break up on Thursday se'nnight, and 
the King goes this day fortnight. He has made Lord Yere 
Beauderc a baron*, at the solicitation of the PelhamSy as 
this Lord had resigned upon a pique with Lord Sandwich. 
Lord Anson, who is treading in the same path, and leaving 
the Bedfords to follow his father-in-law, the Chancellor, is 
made a privy councillor, with Sir Thomas Bobinson and 
Lord Hyndford. Lord Conway is to be an earl ', and Sir 
John Bawdon* (whose follies you remember, and whose 
boasted loyalty of having been kicked downstairs for not 
drinking the Pretender's health, though even that was 
false, is at last rewarded) and Sir John Yesey^ are to be 
Iiish. lords; and a Sir William Beauchamp Proctor, and 
a Mj:»4Ejoyd ', Knights of the Bath. 
y/jL was entertained the other night at the house of much 
such a creature as Sir John Bawdon, and one whom you 
remember too, Naylor. He has a wife who keeps the most 
indecent house of all those that are called decent : every 
Sunday she has a counterband assembly : I had had a card 
for Mondaif a fortnight before. As the day was new, 
I expected a great assembly, but found scarce six persons. 
I asked where the company was — I was answered, 'Oh! 
they are not come yet: they will be here presently ; they 
all supped here last night, stayed till morning, and I sup- 
pose are not up yet.' In the bedchamber I found two beds, 
which is too cruei to poor Naylor, to tell the whole town 
that he is t Wonly man in it who does not lie with his 
wife I y^

My Lord Bolingbroke has lost his wife^ When ehe 
was dying, he acted grief; flung himaelf upon her bed, 
and asked her if ahe could foxgiYO him. I never saw her, 
but have heard her wit and parts excessively commended. 
Dr. Middleton told me a compliment she made him two 
years ago, which I thought pretty. She said she was 
persuaded that he was a very great writer, for she under- 
stood his works better than any other English book, and 
that she had observed that the best writers were always the 
most intelligible. 

Wednesday. 

I had not time to finish my letter on Monday. I return 
to the earthquake, which I had mistaken ; it is to be to-day. 
This frantic terror prevails so much, that within these three 
days seven hundred and thirty coaches have been counted 
passing Hyde Park comer, with whole parties removing 
into the country. Here is a good advertisement which 
I cut out of the papers to-day : 

'On Monday next will be published (price 6d.) A true 
and exact List of all the Nobility and Gentry who have left, 
or shall leave, this place through fear of another Earthquake.' 

Several women have made earthquake gowns; that is, 
warm gowns to sit out of doors all to-night These are of 
the more courageoua One woman, still more heroic, is 
come to town on purpose : she says, all her friends are in 
London, and she will not survive them. But what will you 
think of Lady Catherine Pelham, Lady Frances Arundel ^^ 
and Lord and Lady Galway^, who go this evening to an

inn ten mileB out of town, whme they are to play at brag 
till five in the morning, and then come back — I suppose, 
to look for the bones of their husbands and fiamiliee under 
the rubbish. The prophet of all this (next to the Bidiop 
of Lond<Mi, whom Mr. Chute and I have agreed not to 
believe till he has been three days in a whale's belly) is 
a trooper of Lord Delawar's, who was yesterday sent to 
Bedlam. His cfiUmd sent to the man's wife, and asked her if 
her husband had ever been disordered before. She cried, ' Oh 
dear I my Lord, he is not mad now ; if your Lordship would 
but get any sensihle man to examine him, yon would find 
hA^ quite in his right mind.' 

y^I shall now tell you something more serious: Lord 
Dalkeith " is dead of the small-pox in three days. It is so 
dreadfully fatal in his family, that besides several uncles 
and aunts, his eldest boy^' died of it last year; and his 
only brother ^^ who was ill but two days, putrefied so fast 
that his limbs fell off as they lifted the body into the 
coffin. Lady Dalkeith^' is five months gone with child ; 
she was hurrying to him, but was stopped on the road by 
the physician, who told her that it was a miliary fever. 
They were remarkably haj^y.^^^-"^^ 

The King goes on Monday se'nnight ^* ; it is looked upon 
as a great event that the Duke of Newcastle has prevailed 
on him to speak to Mr. Pitt^ who has detached himself from 
the Bedfords. The Monarch, who had kept up his Hano- 
verian resoitments, ihough he had made him Paymaster, 
is now beat out of the dignity of his silence : he was to 
pretend not to know Pitt, and was to be directed to him by 
the Lord in Waiting. Pitt's jealousy is of Lord Sandwich,

who knows his own interest and unpopularity so well, that 
he will prevent any breach, and thereby what you fear, 
which yet I think you would have no reason to fear. Icould 
not say enough of my anger to your fieither, but I shall take 
care to say nothing, as I have not forgot how my zeal for 
you made me provoke him once before. 

Tour genealogical affair is in great train, and will be 
quite finished in a week or two. Ur. Chute has laboured 
at it inde&tigably : General Quise has been attesting the 
authenticity of it to-day before a Justice of the Peace. Tou 
will find yourself mixed with every drop of blood in England 
that is worth bottling up : the Duchess of Norfolk and you 
grow on the same bough of the tree. I must tell you 
a very curious anecdote that Strawberry Eang-at-Arms ^^ 
has discovered by the way, as he was tumbling over the 
mighty dead in the Heralds' Office. Tou have heard me 
speak of the great injustice that the Protector Somerset did 
to the children of his first wife, in favour of those by 
his second ; so much, that he not only had the dukedom 
settled on the younger brood, but, to deprive the eldest of 
the title of Lord Beauchamp, which he wore by inheritance, 
he caused himself to be anew created Viacouni Beauchamp. 
Well, in Vincent's Baronage, a book of great auttiority, 
speaking of the Protector's wives, are these remarkable 
words : Katherina, JUia et una Cdk. CM: FUki de FiOdl's 
HaU in Essex, uxor prima; rqpudiata, quia pater ^us post 
nuptias earn cognovit The Speaker has since referred me 
to our Journals, where are some notes of a trial in the reign 
of James the First, between Edward, the second son of 
Katherine the duttful, and the Earl of Hertford, son of 
Anne Stanhope, which in some measure confirms our MS. ; 
for it says, the Earl of Hertford objected, that John, the 
eldest son of all, was b^otten while the Duke was in

Edward Seymour, is disputed: my Lord Chancellor has 
refused him the writ, but referred his case to the Attorney-

^I shall now go and show you Mr. Chute in a different 
light from heraldry, and in one in which I believe you 
never saw him. He will shine as usual ; but, as a little 
more severely than his good-nature is accustomed to, I must 
tell you that he was provoked by the most impertinent 
usage. It is a parcel of epigrams on Lady Caroline Peter- 
sham, whose present fame, by the way, is ooupled with 
young Harry Vane. . . ."• 

What makes Clodio, who always was fond of new faces.

Fulvia the tall wears Nana on her arm, 

Both vain, both vamish'd, wanton both and warm^ 

Twin sisters both in everything but this: 

Nana leaps up and Fulvia stoops to kiss. 

WHO IS THIS? 

Her face has beauty, we must all confess, 

But beauty on the brink of ugliness : 

Her mouth 's a rabbit feeding on a rose ; 

With eyes — ten times too good for such a nose I 

Her blooming cheeks — what paint could ever draw 'em? 

That paint, for which no mortal ever saw 'euL 

Air without shape — of royal race divine

Do but think of my beginning a third sheet 1 but as the 
Parliament is rising, and I shall probably not write you 
a tolerably long letter again these eight months, I will 
lay in a stock of merit with you to last me so long. Mr. 
Chute has set me too upon making epigrams ; but as I have 
not his art, mine is almost a copy of Terses : the story he 
told me, and is literally true, of an old Lady Bingley ** : 

Gelia now had completed some thirty camjMugns, 
And for new generations was hammering chiuns; 
When whetting those terrible weapons, her eyes, 
To Jenny, her handmaid, in anger she cries, 
' Careless creature I did mortal e'er see such a glass 1 
Who that saw me in this, could e'er guess what I was I 
Much you mind what I say I pray how oft have I bid you 
Provide me a new one? how oft have I diid you?' 
^ Lord, Madam I ' cried Jane, ' you're so hard to be pleas'd ! 
I am sure every glassman in town I have teas'd : 
I have hunted each shop from Pall Mall to Cheapside: 
Both Miss Carpenter's man", and Miss Banks's ** Fve tried.' 
^ Don't tell me of those girls! — ^all I know, to my cost. 
Is, the looking-glass art must be certainly lost! 
One us'd to have mirrors so smooth and so bri^t, 
They did one's eyes justice, they heighten'd one's white^ 
And fresh roses diffiis'd o'er one's bloom — ^but, alas! 
In the glasses made now, one detests one's own face ; 
They pucker one's cheeks up and furrow one's brow, 
And one's skin looks as yellow as that of Miss Hows'*!'

short. It is said to be made by a cow. You must not

Livy :

A hot summer, a new King. 

Though the sting is very epigrammatic, the whole of the 
distich has more of the tmth than heoomee prophecy ; that 
is, it is false, for the spring is wet and cold. 

There is come from France a Madame Bocage *', who has 
translated Milton : my Lord Chesterfidd prefers the copy

who is the patron of had authors and had actors. She has 
written a play too, which was damned, and worthy my 
Lord's i^prohation* You would he more diverted with 
a Mrs. Holman, whose passion is keeping an aasemhly, 
and inviting literally everybody to it. She goes to the 
Drawing-room to watch for sneezes ; whips out a curtsey, 
and then sends next morning to know how your cold does, 
and to desire your company next Thursday. 

Mr. Whithed has taken my Lord Pembroke's house at

Lord himself was. He has bought some delightful pictures 
too, of Claude, Gaspar, and good masters, to the amount of 
four hundred pounds.

if I had not feared tiring you. We haye swarmed with 
sermons, essays, relations, poems, and exhortations on that

ances, as formerly eyerything was accounted for by Descartes's 
yortices, and Sir Isaac's grayitation. But they all take 
care, afiier accounting for the earthquake systematically, 
to assure you that still it was nothing less than a judgement. 
Dr. Barton, the Bector of St Andrews, was the only 
sensible, or at least honest diyine, upon the occasion. When 
some women would haye had him pray to them in his 
parish church against the intended shock, he excused him- j 
self on haying a great cold. ^And besides,' said he, 'you | 
may go to St James's Church ; the Bishop of Oxford is to 
preach there all night about earthquakes.' Turner, a great 
china-man, at the comer of next street^ had a jar cracked

his name when he was here, but on his being mobbed as 
he was going to Wanstead \ and the people's calling him 
the Prince of Bad-door-lock. He was still less noticed 
than he of Modena 

Lord Bath is as well received at Paris as a German 
Margrave in Italy. Everybody goes to Paris : Lord Mount- 
ford ^ was introduced to the Eang, who only said brutally 
enough, ^ Ma foi! %i est him nourri!* Lord Albemarle^ 
keeps an immense table there, with sixteen people in his 
kitchen ; his aide-de-camps invite everybody, but he seldom 
graces the banquet himself, living retired out of the town 
with his old Columbine '. What an extraordinary man ! 
with no fortune at all, and with slight parts, he has seven- 
teen thousand pounds a year from the government, which 
he squanders away, though he has great debts, and four 
or five numerous broods of children of one sort or other ! 

The &mous Westminster election is at last determined, 
and Lord Trentham returned: the mob were outrageous,

knew what solid happiness was till I was married. Tour 
Treyors and Bices dined with me last week at Strawberry 
Hill, and would have had me answer you upon the matri- 
monial tone, but I thought I should imitate cheerfulness in 
that style as ill as if I really were married. I have had another 
of your friends with me there some time, whom I adors^ 
Hr. Bentley * ; he has more sense, judgement, and wit, more 
taste, and more misfortunes, than sure ever met in any man. 
I have heard that Dr. Bentley, regretting his wanting taste 
for all such learning as his, which is the very want of taste, 
used to sigh and say, 'Tully had his Harcua' If the sons 
resembled as much as the fathers did, at least in vanity, 



s BiohardBenUey (1708-1782), son 
of the Ikmoiu Bcholar of the fame 
name. Bentley's wit and artistic 
talents were peculiarly acceptable to 
Horace Walpole. He lived for some 
time at Teddlngton, and became a 
frequent gaest at Strawberry Hill. 
Besidea nnmeroiu Gk»thic deei^^ns, 
ntilixed by Horace Walpole at Straw- 
berry Hill, Bentley made architeo- 
tnral drawings in that style for 
Lords Holdemesse and Strafford, 
Lady ICary Churchill, and others. 
He also illostrated the edition of 
Gray's Poems published by Horace 
Walpole in 1768. During Bentley's 
absence in Jersey (to avoid his credi- 
tors), Horace Walpole corresponded 
with him, and showed keen interest 
in his pecuniary affidrs and artistic 
pursuits. In 1761 their friendly rela* 
tions came to an end. Various 
reasons have been assigned for the 
quarrel — Bentley's impatience of 
patronage (according to his nephew 
Cumberland)— an attempt on Bent- 
ley's part to borrow money from 
Horace Walpole— or (according to the 
tatter's own account to Cole) Bent- 
ley's being * forward to introduce his 
wife at lus [Walpole's] house when 
people cf the first fashion were there.' 
Before their parting Walpole had 
procured for Bentl^ a smaU place, 
probably in the Custom House, which 



he afterwards resigned. Bentley's 
subsequent patrons were Lord Mel- 
combe (to whom he addressed a poem) 
and Lord Bute, through whom ha 
obtained two sinecures — a Commis- 
sionership of the Lottery, and a place 
in the Post Office. He died in Abing^ 
don Street, Westminster, in 1781, 
leaving Beveral children, for whose 
benefit Horace Walpole invested a 
sum of money in the funds, f^m 
a letter of George Hardinge to Wal- 
pole, dated July 17, 1780, it appears 
that Walpole assisted Bentley long 
after their acquaintance ceased »— 
* at Sir John Griffin's the other day 
I met ycmr Bentley, whom I was glad 
to see, as a very singnlar genius. I 
discovered by an accident that you 
are still generous to him.' (Nichols, 
iUtcae. JU<. HM., vol. iiL p. a07.) Be- 
sides translating Hentsner's 2Va«»b 
(printed at Strawberry HiU in 1767), 
Bentley wrote at least one paper in 
The Worlds as well as several un- 
successiul plays. Cole records Bent- 
ley's opinion of Walpole as a letter 
writer : — * Walpole was the best letter 
writer that ever took pen in hand ; 
... he wrote with the greatest ease 
imaginable, with company in the 
room, and even talking to other 
people at the time.' {Atke/UB Ocmta- 
Mgiemetf quoted by Nichols, Lit, 
Anee., vol viiL p. 678.) 



452 To George Montagu [i750 

I would be the modest agreeable Marcus. Mr. Bentlej teUs 
zne that you press him much to visit you at Hawkhurst^ 
I advise him, and assure him he will make his fortune under 
you there ; that you are an agent from the Board of Trade 
to the smugglers^ and wallow in contraband wine, tea, and 
silk handkerchiefa. I found an old newspaper t'other day, 
with a list of ouUawed smugglers ; there were John PricOi 
alias Miss Marjoram, Bob Plunder, Bricklayer lom, and 
Bobin Cursemother, all of Hawkhurst in Kent. ^When Miss 
Harriet^ is thoroughly hardened at Buxton, as I hear she 
is by lying in a public room with the whole Wells, from 
drinking waters, I conclude she will come to sip nothing but 
run brandy. >^'

that I had t'other night I shall relate it to you to show 
you the manners of the age, which are always as entertaining 
to a person fifty miles off as to one bom an hundred and 
fifty years after the time. I had a card from Lady Caroline 
Petersham to go with her to Vauxhall. I went accordingly 
to her house at half an hour after seven, and found her and 
the little Ashe ', or the pollard Ashe, as they call her ; they 
had just finished their last layer of red, and looked as hand- 
some as crimson could make them. On the cabinet stood 
a pair of Dresden candlesticks, a present from the virgin 
hands of Sir John Bland' ; the branches of each formed a

little bower oyer a cock and hen treading, yes, literally! 
We issued into the Mall to assemble our company, which 
was all the town, if we could get it ; for just so many had 
been summoned, except Harry Vane, whom we met by 
chance. We mustered the Duke of Kingston, whom Lady 
Caroline says she has been trying for these seven years, but 
alas! his beauty is at the fall of the leaf. Lord March ^, 
Mr. Whithed, a pretty Miss Beaudero, and a very foolish 
Miss Sparre^ These two damsels were trusted by their 
mothers for the first time of their liyes to the matronly 
conduct of Lady Caroline. As we sailed up the Mall with 
all our colours flying, Lord Petersham ', with his nose and 
legs twisted to every point of crossness, strode by us on the 
outside, and repassed again on the return. At the end of 
the Mall she called to him ; he would not answer : she gave 
a familiar spring, and, between laugh and confusion, ran up 
to him, ' My Lord, my Lord I why, you don't see us ! ' We ad- 
vanced at a little distance, not a little awkward in expectation 
how all this would end, for my Lord never stirred his hat, 
or took the least notice of anybody : she said, ' Do you go with 
us, or are you going anywhere else ? ' — ' I don't go with you, 
I am going somewhere else ' ; and away he stalked, as sulky 
as a ghost that nobody will speak to first We got into the 
best order we could, and marched to our barge, with a boat 
of French horns attending, and little Ashe singing. We 
paraded some time up the river, and at last debarked at 
VauxhalL There, if we had so pleased, we might have 
had the vivacity of our party increased by a quarrel, for a

Mis. Loyd^, who is supposed to be msnied to Lord 
Haddington, seeing the two girls following Lady C. and 
Hiss Ashe^ said aloud, * Poor girls, I am sorry to see them in 
such bad company.' Hiss Sparre, who desired nothing so 
much as the fun of seeing a duel, a thing which, though she is 
fifteen, she has never been so lucky to see, — ^took due pains 
to make Lord March resent this ; but he, who is very lively 
and agreeable, hiughed her out of this charming frolic with 
a great deal of humour. Here we picked up Lord Oranby, 
arrived very drunk fix)m Jenny's Whim" ; where, instead 
of going to old Strafford's catacombs to make honourable 
love, he had dined witti Lady Fitzroy^*, and left her and 
eight other women and four other men playing at brag. He 
would fjEun have made over his honourable love upon any 
terms to poor Miss Beauderc, who is very modest, and did 
npt know at all what to do with his whispers or his hands. 
''&e then addressed himself to the Sparre, who was very well 
disposed to receive both ; but the tide of champagne turned, 
he hiccupped at the reflection of his marriage, of which he 
is wondrous sick, and only proposed to the girl to shut 
themselves up and rail at the world for three weekSy/lf all 
the adventures don't conclude as you expect in the b^^ning 
of a paragraph, you must not wonder, for I am not making 
a history, but relating one strictly as it happened, and I

the next box, where he was enjoying himself with his Notsa 
and pdUe parties to help us mince chickens. We minced 
seyen chickens into a china dish, which Lady C. stewed over 
a lamp with three pats of butter and a flagon of water, 
stirring, and rattling, and laughing, and we every minute 
expecting to have the dish fly about our ears. She had 
brought Betty ^^ the fruit-girl, with hampers of strawberries 
and cherries from Bogers's, and made her wait upon us, and 
then made her sup by us at a little table. The conversation 
was no less lively than the whole transaction. — There was 
a Mr. O'Brien arrived from Ireland, who would get the 
Duchess of Manchester from Mr. Hussey, if she were still at 
liberty. I took up the biggest hautboy in the dish, and said 
to Lady Car., ' Madam, Mias Ashe desires you will eat this 
O'Brien strawberry'; she replied immediately, 'I won't, you 
hussey I' — Tou may imagine the laugh this reply occasioned. 
— After the tempest was a little calmed, the Pollard said, 
' Now, how anybody would spoil this story that was to repeat 
it, and say, I won't, you jade ! ' In short, the whole air of our 
party was sufficient, as you will easily imagine, to take up the 
whole attention of the garden ; so much so, that from eleven 
o'clock till half an hour after one we had the whole concourse 
round our booth : at last^ they came into the little gardens 
of each booth on the sides of ours, till Harry Vane took up 
a bumper, and drank their healths, and was proceeding to

paasagee. Lord Granb/s temper had been a little ruffled the 
night before : the Prince had invited him and Dick Lyttelton 
to KeWy where he won eleyen hundred pound of the latter, 
and eight of the former, then cut, and told them he would

that they were capable of losing more than th^ wotM like.

to town to consult his physician for a jaundice and swelled 
legs, symptoms which, the doctor tells him, and which he 
believes, can be easily cured; I think him visibly broke, 
and near his end. He lately advised me to marry, on the 
sense of his own happiness ; but if anybody had advised 
him to the contrary, at his time of life, I believe he would 
not have broke so fast. { f ^
