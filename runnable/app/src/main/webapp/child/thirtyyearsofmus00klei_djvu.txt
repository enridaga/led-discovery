PREFATORY  NOTE 

Not  the  least  valuable  asset  of  a  life  largely  spent 
among  artists  is  a  good  memory.  From  an  early 
age  I  cultivated  the  faculty  of  making  mental 
notes ;  and,  like  most  faculties,  innate  or  acquired, 
it  grew  until  it  developed  into  second  nature.' 
During  my  quarter  of  a  century's  work  as  a  Lon- 
don musical  critic,  I  seldom  found  it  necessary  to 
do  more  than  jot  down  a  word  or  two  in  the  mar- 
gin of  a  programme  as  a  preliminary  to  the  writing 
of  an  article.  I  accustomed  "my  eye  and  ear  to 
take  records  of  what  I  saw  and  heard;  and,  where 
I  happened  to  be  sufficiently  interested,  those 
records  assumed  a  more  or  less  permanent  form. 

Most  of  the  purely  personal  incidents  related  in 
these  pages  appear  in  print  for  the  first  time.  So, 
also,  do  the  letters  which  I  have  ventured  to  select 
for  publication  from  a  numerous  autograph  col- 
lection. Where  the  originals  of  these  letters  are 
in  a  foreign  tongue,  the  English  translation  only  is 
given.  I  have  endeavored,  save  in  one  or  two 
special  instances,  to  avoid  mere  biographical  de-

Prefatory   Note 


tails,  particularly  in  the  case  of  those  musicians, 
dead  and  living,  whose  careers  are  in  all  essential 
matters  familiar  to  the  public. 

My  object  is  rather  to  furnish  sketches  of  fa- 
mous musical  personages,  and  to  set  before  the 
reader  hitherto  unrecorded  scenes  and  events  in 
their  lives,  together  with  slight  studies  of  tem- 
perament and  character,  which  may  be  of  value 
in  so  far  as  they  tend  to  throw  a  side-light  upon 
the  personality  of  the  notable  individuals  with 
whom  they  deal.  At  the  same  time,  by  placing 
these  as  nearly  as  possible  in  chronological  order, 
and  supplementing  them  with  brief  accounts  of 
all  the  prominent  debuts  and  first  performances 
that  I  have  personally  witnessed,  the  outcome  is  a 
tolerably  complete  picture  of  operatic  and  musical 
life  in  England  during  the  last  three  decades  of 
the  nineteenth  century. 

By  far  the  most  important  feature  of  these 
chronicles  is  the  history  of  the  remarkable  re- 
naissance of  Opera  effected  through  the  ambitious 
spirit  and  energy  of  the  late  Sir  Augustus  Harris, 
impresario  of  the  Royal  Opera,  Covent  Grarden; 
manager  of  Drury  Lane ;  and  sometime  Sheriff  of 
London.  The  inception,  growth,  and  development 
of  that  interesting  movement  have  not,  so  far  as 
I  am  aware,  been  traced  by  any  other  writer ;  and 

xvi 


Prefatory    Note 


the  story  acquires  added  value  and  significance 
from  the  fact  that  the  scheme  of  fashionable 
Opera  evolved  by  Augustus  Harris  in  London 
is  absolutely  identical  with  that  so  ably  carried 
on,  until  the  spring  of  the  present  year,  by  Maurice 
Grau  in  New  York. 

I  trust  that  I  have  succeeded  in  accomplishing 
my  task  without  overstepping  the  border-line 
which  should  separate  the  friend  from  the  critic. 
I  have  always  watched  that  delicate  yet  important 
boundary  with  scrupulous  care ;  and,  happily,  I 
have  found  it  easy  to  observe  and  obey  without 
loss  of  good-will  or  esteem  on  either  side.  Hence 
the  existence  of  warm  friendly  ties  with  so  many 
of  the  distinguished  artists  whom  it  has  been  my 
privilege  to  meet — ties  very  dear  to  me,  yet  the 
delight  whereof,  under  less  well-balanced  condi- 
tions, I  should  regretfully  have  been  compelled  to 
deny  myself.

THIETY  YEARS  OF 
MUSICAL  LIFE  IN  LONDON 


THIRTY  YEARS  OF 
MUSICAL  LIFE  IN  LONDON 


CHAPTER   I 

Early  Norwich  days— A  famous  English  festival— My  school- 
master describes  Paganini  —  Jenny  Lind  —  Spohr  —  Juhus 
Benedict— Benedict  and  Beethoven— Theresa  Tietjens— A 
great  artist  and  a  brave  woman. 

I  WAS  born  in  the  musical  city  of  Norwich.  The 
epithet  ^'mnsicaP'  is  not  undeserved.  Search 
the  whole  United  Kingdom  through,  and  you  will 
scarcely  find  a  place  that  can  boast  an  older  or 
more  intimate  connection  with  the  *^  divine  art^^ 
than  the  ancient  capital  of  East  Anglia.  Its  noble 
cathedral,  its  threescore  churches,  its  chapels  with- 
out number,  are  ever  helping  to  create  and  sustain 
in  the  population  a  love  of  music.  Above  all,  it 
is  the  scene,  once  in  every  three  years,  of  a  famous 
musical  gathering.  The  ^^  Norfolk  and  Norwich 
Musical  Festival''  (to  give  the  full  title)  not  only 
vies  in  age  with  those  of  the  Three  Choirs,— Glou- 
cester, Worcester,  and  Hereford,— but  very  nearly 
ranks  in  importance  with  the  triennial  meetings  of 
its  richer  sisters,  Birmingham  and  Leeds. 

My  parents  were  not  musical  by  profession ;  but 
the  fact  that  both  were  engaged  in  professional 


Thirty  Years  of 


vocations,  coupled  with  their  ardent  love  of  the 
art,  brought  them  into  association  with  many  of 
the  operatic  and  vocal  celebrities  who  visited  the 
city  from  time  to  time.  Our  house  on  Elm  Hill 
stood  within  sound  of  the  cathedral  chimes,  and 
barely  a  stone's  throw  from  St.  Andrew's  Hall, 
the  quaint  old  Gothic  building,  half  church,  half 
concert-room,  in  which  the  festival  rehearsals  and 
performances  were  always  held. 

From  the  first  I  seemed  to  breathe  the  ^ '  festival 
atmosphere''  of  the  place.  On  the  very  evening  I 
was  born  (the  date,  I  may  mention,  was  July  23, 
1856)  there  was  a  rehearsal  of  Sir  Michael  Costa's 
^ '  Eli ' ' ;  and  as  the  voices  of  the  choir  were  wafted 
through  the  windows  on  the  hot  summer  air,  the 
question  arose  whether  it  would  not  be  appropriate 
to  name  me  after  the  venerable  priest  who  was 
the  hero  of  the  oratorio  then  being  interpreted. 
However,  it  had  been  determined  that  in  the  event 
of  my  being  a  boy  I  should  receive  my  father's 
name  of  Hermann.  Fortunately,  that  decision  was 
adhered  to,  and  I  was  spared  the  fate  of  being  ad- 
dressed by  my  intimate  friends  for  the  whole  of 
my  life  as  ' '  Eli. ' ' 

The  echoes  of  the  festival  proceedings  pene- 
trated even  the  thick  walls  of  my  school  class- 
rooms. For  the  worthy  principal  of  Opie  House 
School  (so  named  after  the  gifted  Norwich  painter, 
John  Opie,  who  had  once  occupied  the  red-bricked 
dwelling  which  still  stands  opposite  St.  Clement's 
Church)   was  a  highly  respected  member  of  the

festival  chorus.  He  owned  a  capital  bass  voice, 
and  was  a  first-rate  musician.  What  is  more,  he 
knew  a  good  singer  when  he  heard  one.  It  was  his 
delight  to  describe  to  us  how  superbly  Sims  Reeves 
had  sung  ^'Deeper  and  deeper  still' ^;  with  what 
thrilling  expression  Mile.  Tietjens  had  phrased  *'I 
know  that  my  Redeemer  liveth";  how  inimitable 
Mme.  Sainton-Dolby  had  been  in  '^He  was  de- 
spised"; and  what  a  remarkable  voice  he  had 
heard  in  the  bass  solos  of  the  ^^  Messiah ''—that  of 
the  famous  Weiss,  who  composed  the  music  of 
^^The  Village  Blacksmith." 

He  could  go  back  a  good  many  years,  too,  could 
my  musical  schoolmaster.  When  in  the  mood  he 
would  tell  us  how,  as  a  youth,  he  had  been  taken 
to  St.  Andrew's  Hall  to  hear  the  great  Paganini. 
With  an  air  of  awe  he  would  describe  the  weird 
aspect  and  lean,  lank  form  of  the  illustrious  fiddler, 
as  he  stood  upon  the  platform  in  his  closely  but- 
toned swallow-tailed  coat,  playing  amid  a  silence 
so  intense  that  his  auditors  almost  feared  lest  their 
breathing  might  break  the  spell. 

' '  Never  before  or  since, ' '  my  teacher  would  say, 
^^have  I  seen  an  audience  wrought  to  such  a  pitch 
of  excitement.  It  was  partly  the  influence  of  the 
individual  himself,  no  doubt;  but  it  was  also  due 
to  the  strangely  wonderful  beauty  of  the  tone  that 
he  obtained  from  his  instrument,  and  the  fascina- 
tion of  a  method  which  completely  concealed  the 
nature  of  the  difficulties  he  surmounted.  As  I 
listened  I  seemed  to  forget  that  Paganini  was  a 


Thirty  Years  of 


man.  Gradually  he  assumed  the  character  of  a 
magician,  an  executant  endowed  with  positively 
supernatural  powers!''  And  such  I  imagine  was 
the  impression  actually  produced  by  this  marvel- 
ous violinist  upon  nine  out  of  every  ten  persons 
who  heard  him. 

It  was  in  St.  Andrew's  Hall,  also,  that  I  was 
vouchsafed  as  a  boy  the  privilege  of  hearing,  on 
a  solitary  occasion  only,  one  of  the  greatest  artists 
the  world  has  ever  possessed.  I  refer  to  Jenny 
Lind.  The  close  association  which  existed  between 
that  gifted  and  noble  woman  and  the  city  of  Nor- 
wich is  a  matter  of  common  knowledge.  A  bishop 
of  Norwich  (Dr.  Stanley)  it  was  who  persuaded 
the  first  of  the  ^^ Swedish  Nightingales"  to  aban- 
don, on  religious  grounds,  the  operatic  stage; 
which  premature  and  much-regretted  event  oc- 
curred in  1849.  But  the  famous  singer  frequently 
visited  Norwich,  and  more  than  once  she  appeared 
at  concerts  given  on  behalf  of  the  funds  of  the 
Jenny  Lind  Infirmary  for  Children,  an  institution 
founded  by  her  and  still  flourishing  in  the  old  city. 

At  one  of  these  concerts,  some  time  during  the 
middle  ^^ sixties,"  I  heard  Jenny  Lind  sing.  The 
voice,  I  remember  perfectly,  was  as  exquisitely 
clear  and  fresh  as  a  young  girl's;  its  sweet  tones 
haunted  me  long  afterward.  Of  the  wondrous  art 
of  the  great  singer  I  was  too  young  to  judge ;  but 
I  shall, never  forget  what  she  sang,  or  the  rare 
wealth  of  religious  sentiment  with  which  she  in- 
vested the  prayer  of  Agathe  in  the  favorite  scena

from  ^^Der  Freischiitz/ '  Upon  the  stage,  of 
course,  the  heroine  of  Weher  's  opera  always  kneels 
while  uttering  her  touching  appeal  for  her  lover's 
safe  return,  and  Jenny  Lind  also  knelt  while  sing- 
ing the  same  passage  upon  the  platform  of  St. 
Andrew's  Hall  on  the  occasion  I  am  alluding  to.^ 

In  later  years  Mme.  Jenny  Lind-Goldschmidt 
used  to  be  a  conspicuous  figure  at  the  concerts  of 
the  London  Bach  Choir,  whereof  her  husband,  Mr. 
Otto  Goldschmidt,  was  the  first  conductor.  She 
would  modestly  take  her  place  in  the  front  row  of 
the  sopranos,  with  the  most  musical  of  the  Queen's 
daughters,  the  Princess  Christian  of  Schleswig- 
Holstein,  for  her  near  companion.  Moreover,  she 
took  an  active  part  in  the  training  of  the  female 
voices,  and  to  her  skilful  instruction  was  in  a  large 
measure  due  the  facility  and  brilliancy  with  which 
they  executed  the  difficult  passages  in  Bach's  B 
minor  Mass  (performed  for  the  first  time  in  Eng- 
land April  26,  1876).  The  great  singer  died  at 
Malvern,  November  2,  1887,  and  seven  years  later 
I  was  present  at  the  unveiling  of  the  tablet,  with 
medallion  portrait,  which  now  does  honor  to  her 
memory  in  the  south  transept  of  Westminster  Ab- 
bey. She  is  so  far  the  only  musical  artist,  other 
than  a  composer,  whose  lineaments  have  been  ex- 
posed upon  the  walls  of  that  ancient  fane. 

*  My  boyish  imagination  can  hardly  have  led  me  astray  in  this 
matter.  Besides,  it  was  precisely  the  kind  of  impulse  that  the 
emotional  exaltation  of  this  deeply  religious  woman  would  have 
prompted  her  to  yield  to,  regardless  of  the  every-day  convention- 
alities of  the  concert-room. 


Thirty  Years  of 


''If  Birmingham  had  its  Mendelssohn,  Norwich 
had  its  Spohr.'^  This  pardonable  boast,  familiar 
enough  to  my  boyish  ears,  had  reference  to  the  visit 
paid  by  Lonis  Spohr  to  Norwich  in  1839  (when  he 
conducted  his  oratorio  ''Calvary'^  and  played  a 
couple  of  his  violin  works), and  also  to  the  fact  that 
he  had  expressly  composed  his  oratorio  ' '  The  Fall 
of  Babylon'^  for  the  festival  of  1842.^  Some  thir- 
teen years  later  an  effort  was  made  to  persuade  the 
Cassel  composer  to  provide  another  novelty,  and 
my  father  was  requested  by  the  Festival  Committee 
to  carry  on  the  German  correspondence  with  him. 
Spohr  undertook  the  task,  and  promised  to  com- 
plete a  new  work  for  the  festival  of  1857.  But  at 
that  time  his  powers  were  beginning  to  decline,  and 
he  plainly  declared  himself  no  longer  satisfied  with 
what  he  wrote;  while  the  accident  which  at  that 
time  broke  his  arm  fairly  precluded  all  question  of 
further  progress  with  the  work.  Two  years  later 
he  died. 

*  It  is  interesting  to  recall  that  a  section  of  the  Norwich  clergy 
raised  a  tremendous  outcry  against  the  performance  in  the  con- 
cert-room of  *  *  Calvary, ' '  on  account  of  the  nature  of  the  libretto. 
It  was  declared  to  be  pure  sacrilege  thus  to  perform  a  musical 
illustration  of  the  events  of  the  Crucifixion.  Nevertheless,  the 
oratorio  was  duly  given  under  Spohr 's  direction,  and  was  received 
with  great  enthusiasm.  In  London,  in  1847,  the  same  opposition 
arose  when  a  series  of  Spohr 's  works  was  announced  by  the  Sa- 
cred Harmonic  Society.  This  time  it  proved  successful,  for  at 
the  last  moment  ''Calvary"  was  omitted  and  ''The  Fall  of 
Babylon"  given  in  its  place.  Thirty-five  years  later,  when 
Gounod's  "Kedemption"  was  produced  at  Birmingham,  the 
British  public  was  not  quite  so  squeamish.

Musical  Life  in  London 


One  of  the  proudest  moments  that  I  can  recall 
in  my  early  Norwich  life  was  my  being  presented 
to  Mr.  (afterward  Sir)  Julius  Benedict,  who  of- 
ficiated as  conductor  of  the  festivals  from  1842 
until  1878,  when  he  was  succeeded  by  the  present 
conductor,  Mr.  Alberto  Randegger.  By  the  light 
of  subsequent  experience,  I  learned  to  realize  that 
Benedict  was  one  of  the  worst  conductors  who  ever 
held  a  baton.  His  head  was  invariably  buried  in 
his  score;  his  arms  were  ever  uplifted,  as  though 
seeking  a  higher  level  than  the  shoulder-joints 
naturally  permitted.  He  rarely  gave  a  cue  until  it 
was  too  late  to  be  of  practical  value ;  and  he  entirely 
lacked  the  magnetic  power  and  the  sense  of  en- 
semble that  should  be  the  primary  gifts  of  a  good 
conductor.  But  at  the  time  I  am  speaking  of  these 
deficiencies  were  noted  only  by  the  few.  The  vast 
majority  of  East  Anglian  amateurs,  including  my 
youthful  self,  were  satisfied  to  look  upon  Sir  Julius 
not  only  as  a  great  conductor,  but  as  a  musician 
whose  cooperation  brought  honor  and  glory  to  the 
festival.  Was  he  not  the  favorite  pupil  and  friend 
of  Weber?  Had  he  not,  when  a  young  man  of 
twenty-three,  seen  and  shaken  hands  with  the  im- 
mortal Beethoven? 

I  have  been  introduced  to  Verdi  and  Gounod;  I 
have  known  and  spoken  with  Wagner;  but,  great 
as  those  privileges  undoubtedly  were,  I  do  not 
think  they  aroused  in  me  the  same  feelings  of 
mingled  pride  and  awe  that  I  experienced  when, 
as  a  boy,  I  was  first  addressed  by  a  man  who  had 

13 


Thirty  Years  of 


stood  face  to  face  with  Beethoven.  In  his  biog- 
raphy of  Weber,  Sir  Julius  Benedict  describes  in 
glowing  language  how  he  met  the  great  composer 
at  his  publishers*  in  Vienna,  and  expresses  the 
great  joy  and  surprise  that  he  felt  when  Beethoven 
** actually  condescended''  to  speak  with  him.  He 
adds: 

I  see  him  yet  before  me,  and  who  could  ever  forget 
those  striking  features?  The  lofty,  vaulted  forehead 
with  thick  gray  and  white  hair  encircling  it  in  the  most 
picturesque  disorder,  that  square  lion's  nose,  that  broad 
chin,  that  noble  and  soft  mouth.  Over  the  cheeks,  seamed 
with  scars  from  the  smallpox,  was  spread  a  high  color. 
From  under  the  bushy,  closely  compressed  eyebrows 
flashed  a  pair  of  piercing  eyes;  his  thick-set  Cyclopean 
figure  told  of  a  powerful  frame.  He  approached  me 
with  his  inseparable  tablet  in  his  hand,  and  in  his  usual 
brusque  manner  addressed  me:  ^'You  are  Weber's  pu- 
pil?" I  gave  an  affirmative  nod.  ' '  Why  does  n  't  he 
come  to  see  me?  Tell  him  to  come  to  Baden  with  Has- 
linger,"  pointing  to  Steiner's  partner.  Asking  for  his 
tablet,  I  wrote  in  it,  "May  I  come  too?"  He  smiled, 
replying,  *'Ja,  kleiner  naseweis"  (Yes,  you  saucy  little 
fellow). 

And  then  follows  an  account  of  the  visit,  too 
lengthy  for  quotation  here. 

It  was  at  the  suggestion  of  Malibran  that  Bene- 
dict left  Paris  and  went  to  England  in  1835.  He 
quickly  made  his  mark  as  an  operatic  composer, 
and  successfully  competed  with  Michael  Balfe  and 

14 


Musical  Life  in  London 


Vincent  Wallace  in  the  race  for  fame.  Like  them, 
he  wrote  and  produced  many  operas;  like  them, 
he  left  only  one  that  really  promises  to  survive. 
Indeed,  Benedict's  ^'Lily  of  Killarney''  is  the  sole 
English  opera  of  the  so-called  ^^ ballad"  type  that 
still  shares  popularity  with  ^'The  Bohemian  GirP' 
and  ^  *  Maritana. ' '  Although  such  a  mediocre  con- 
ductor, he  was  an  admirable  accompanist.  He  had 
studied  under  Hummel  at  Weimar  before  going  to 
Weber,  and  was  a  quite  capable  pianist.  His  repu- 
tation in  this  capacity  was  not  a  little  enhanced  by 
his  association  with  Jenny  Lind  on  her  memorable 
tour  in  the  United  States  (1850-52).  At  any  rate, 
after  his  return  to  London  his  services  ^^at  the 
piano''  were  in  request  at  every  kind  of  musical 
function,  and  he  was  practically  the  sole  accom- 
panist employed  at  the  Monday  Popular  Concerts 
during  the  first  twenty  years  of  their  existence. 

When  I  first  made  Benedict's  acquaintance  he 
was  not  far  short  of  seventy.  Still  a  hale  old  man 
and  a  wonderfully  hard  worker,  his  eyes  were  nev- 
ertheless beginning  to  give  him  trouble,  and,  when 
conducting,  the  distance  between  his  head  and 
the  score  was  growing  shorter  and  shorter.  He 
was  much  upset  by  the  financial  failure  of  the  Nor- 
wich festival  of  1869  and  the  comparatively  poor 
results  achieved  in  1872  and  1875.  The  latter  was 
the  first  of  these  meetings  at  which  I  performed  the 
functions  of  a  musical  critic,  as  the  representative 
of  my  uncle's  newspaper,  the  ^^ Norwich  Argus." 
When  it  was  over,  Sir  Julius  asked  me  to  come  and 


15 


Thirty  Years  of 


see  him,  in  order  to  talk  over  a  series  of  articles  pro- 
posing some  radical  modifications  in  the  festival 
management.  These  I  wrote,  and  they  duly  ap- 
peared in  the  '  ^  Argus, ' '  and  certain  of  the  sugges- 
tions were  carried  out  with  good  effect  at  the  fes- 
tival of  1878.  But,  as  it  turned  out,  that  was  the 
last  of  the  Norwich  festivals  that  Benedict  was  to 
direct.  He  shortly  afterward  underwent  an  opera- 
tion for  cataract,  and  then— married  again!  To 
add  to  his  troubles,  he  incurred  severe  losses  in  a 
provincial  operatic  speculation  with  the  then  im- 
presario of  Covent  Garden,  the  late  Frederic  Gye. 
He  gradually  relinquished  all  public  work,  and 
died  in  June,  1885,  at  the  ripe  age  of  eighty-one. 

Among  the  great  prime  donne  who  sang  in  Nor- 
wich during  the  ^^ sixties"  and  ^ ^ seventies, ' '  none 
was  more  deservedly  popular  than  Theresa  Tiet- 
jens.  Those  of  my  American  readers  who  saw  her 
when  she  appeared  with  Mr.  Mapleson^s  troupe  at 
the  Academy  of  Music,  New  York,  in  1876,  cannot 
fail  to  have  a  vivid  recollection  of  her  genius 
both  as  a  singer  and  an  actress.  Then,  however, 
she  was  just  approaching  the  tragical  climax  of 
her  brilliant  career.  When  I  first  heard  her,  at 
one  of  the  general  rehearsals  for  the  festival  of 
1866  (some  eight  years  after  her  debut  in  England), 
her  voice  was  not  only  fresh,  powerful,  and  pene- 
trating, but  it  possessed  in  a  greater  degree  than 
then  that  sympathetic  charm— that  curiously  dra- 
matic ^' human"  quality— which  was  perhaps  its 
most  notable  attribute.

TIETJENS 
AS  LUCREZIA  BORGIA 


Musical  Life  in  London 


Her  style  was  marked  by  the  same  rare  individ- 
uality. Her  phrasing  offered  a  curious  blending 
of  vigor  and  grace ;  and  she  had  a  trick  of  employ- 
ing the  portamento  when  approaching  a  high  note, 
which  in  any  other  singer  might  have  been  thought 
almost  ugly,  but  in  Tietjens  seemed  both  natural 
and  artistic.  At  the  same  time,  her  attack  was 
superb.  Never  have  I  heard  the  opening  phrase 
of  the  * '  Inflammatus ' '  in  Rossini 's  ' '  Stabat  Mater '  ^ 
delivered  with  such  magnificent  energy  and  such 
absolute  purity  of  tone.  To  hear  Tietjens  in  those 
days  sing  '^Let  the  bright  Seraphim '^  (especially 
to  the  trumpet  obbligato  of  Tom  Harper)  was  a 
treat  never  to  be  forgotten. 

Theresa  Tietjens  was  one  of  the  few  leading 
sopranos  of  her  time  ( Adelina  Patti  was  also  one ; 
Emma  Albani,  another)  who  could  be  regarded  as 
equally  distinguished  interpreters  of  oratorio  and 
opera.  If  Lemmens-Sherrington,  being  a  born 
Englishwoman,  could  claim  to  be  the  legitimate 
successor  of  Clara  Novello,  the  position  of  the  dra- 
matic ^^star'^  of  oratorio  was  no  less  truly  shared 
by  Rudersdorff  and  Tietjens,  until  the  former  took 
up  her  residence  in  the  United  States  (1872),  leav- 
ing her  friend  and  rival  to  reign  supreme.  Hear- 
ing Tietjens  as  I  did  in  oratorio,  then,  some  years 
before  I  knew  her  in  opera,  I  was  enabled  to  judge 
even  more  accurately  of  the  wonderful  effect  that 
resulted  from  the  combination  of  her  histrionic 
and  vocal  powers.  On  the  stage  she  was  a  trage- 
dienne in  the  highest  sense  of  the  term.    The  op- 


19 


Thirty  Years  of 


portunity  of  arriving  at  that  conclusion  was  af- 
forded me  by  the  artist  herself  when  I  was  in  my 
sixteenth  year.  And  the  memory  of  her  glorious 
impersonation,  on  that  occasion,  of  Valentine(^^lnes 
Huguenots'')  has  never  faded,  notwithstanding 
the  profound  impression  subsequently  created  by 
her  embodiments  of  Lucrezia  Borgia,  Norma, 
Medea,  Donna  Anna,  Semir amide,  Countess  Alma- 
viva,  Ortrud  (one  of  her  later  efforts),  and,  per- 
haps greatest  of  all,  Leonora  in  ^'Fidelio." 

I  witnessed  two  of  her  performances  as  Lucrezia 
Borgia  which  deserve  special  mention.  The  first 
of  these  (May  4,  1872)  took  place  at  Drury  Lane, 
and  was  remarkable  not  only  for  the  exceptional 
beauty  and  grandeur  of  Tietjens's  assumption,  but 
because  on  that  night  Italo  Campanini  made  his 
debut  in  London  as  Gennaro,  and  was  forthwith 
hailed  (somewhat  prematurely,  however)  as  the 
successor  of  Mario  and  Giuglini.  The  cast  further 
included  Faure  as  the  Duke  and  the  ever-delightful 
Zelia  Trebelli  as  Maffio  Orsini,  while  Sir  Michael 
Costa  was  the  conductor.  That  was  a  night  of 
triumphs. 

The  other  representation  (Her  Majesty's  Thea- 
tre, May  19,  1877)  is  fraught  with  sad  memories 
and  undying  admiration  for  a  courageous  woman 
and  a  true  artist.  It  had  been  known  for  some  time 
that  Theresa  Tietjens  was  suffering  from  cancer; 
and,  after  much  hesitation,  the  doctors  decided  to 
perform  an  operation  before  the  end  of  May. 
** Lucrezia"  was  announced  for  the  19th,  and 
among  the  prima  donna 's  friends  it  was  pretty  well 

20 


Musical  Life  in  London 


understood  that  this  would  be  her  last  appearance 
before  the  operation  was  performed. 

"When  the  day  arrived  Tietjens  was  far  too  ill 
to  be  really  fit  to  sing.  It  was  distinctly  against 
her  medical  advisers'  wish  that  she  insisted  upon 
keeping  faith  with  her  manager  and  the  public— 
a  practice  that  she  had  persistently  adhered  to 
throughout  her  career.  How  she  contrived  to  get 
through  the  opera  I  shall  never  understand.  It  can 
only  be  compared  to  some  splendid  example  of 
martyrdom.  She  fainted  after  each  of  the  acts, 
but  immediately  on  recovering  consciousness  de- 
cided to  proceed  with  the  performance.  Never  so 
much  as  a  look  or  gesture  betrayed  to  her  audience 
the  mortal  anguish  she  was  suffering.  Only  the 
initiated  knew  how  much  of  reality  there  was  in 
the  terrible  scream  of  agony  uttered  by  Liicrezia 
in  the  final  scene— when  she  perceives  that  her  son 
is  dead.  As  it  rang  through  the  house  the  audience 
shuddered.  Yet  the  brave  artist  would  not  shirk 
her  fall  at  the  end.  What  it  cost  her  could  be 
guessed,  however,  from  the  fact  that  after  the  cur- 
tain had  been  twice  raised  in  response  to  rapturous 
plaudits,  she  still  lay  motionless  upon  the  ground. 
She  had  once  more  become  insensible. 

In  the  following  week  the  operation  was  per- 
formed, but  the  case  was  hopeless,  and  on  October 
3,  1877,  Theresa  Tietjens  breathed  her  last.  She 
was  laid  to  rest  at  Kensal  Green  Cemetery,  in  the 
presence  of  a  vast  crowd,  amid  tokens  of  public 
grief  such  as  no  foreign  artist  before  her  had  ever 
been  vouchsafed  on  English  soil.

Youthful  work  and  experiences  in  London— My  brother  Max—

MY  real  musical  life  in  London  began  in  1874. 
Down  to  that  year  my  parents  had  never 
contemplated  my  entering  upon  a  musical  or  even 
a  journalistic  career.  When  they  left  Norwich  in 
1866  and  went  to  reside  in  the  metropolis,  I  re- 
mained behind  in  the  care  of  my  grandparents  and 
did  not  rejoin  them  until  nearly  three  years  later. 
Meanwhile  my  younger  brother,  Max,  had  shown 
considerable  aptitude  for  the  violin,  and  was  taking 
lessons  from  Louis  Ries,  the  well-known  ^^  second 
violin''  of  the  Monday  ^^Pops."  Afterward  he 
studied  under  the  late  J.  T.  Carrodus,  and  joined 
the  orchestra  of  the  Royal  Italian  Opera,  Covent 
Garden,  of  which  Carrodus  was  for  many  years

paniments  in  the  family  circle;  and  it  was  solely 
the  fraternal  spirit  of  emulation,  impelling  me  to 
try  to  shine  side  by  side  with  my  younger  brother, 
that  led  me  to  keep  up  my  study  of  music. 

The  terrors  of  the  Franco-Prussian  war  (1870- 
1871)  drove  to  London  large  numbers  of  refu- 
gees, many  of  them  celebrities  connected  with  the 
leading  musical  and  dramatic  institutions  of  Paris. 
Not  a  few  of  these  were  compelled  to  ' '  bring  grist 
to  the  mill'^  by  appearing  upon  the  stage  and  in 
the  concert-rooms  of  the  British  capital.  It  was  a 
golden  opportunity  for  hearing  and  seeing  some  of 
the  finest  artists  of  the  day ;  and,  thanks  mainly  to 
the  friendly  intercourse  existing  between  my  pa- 
rents and  certain  magnates  of  the  managerial 
world,  I  was  enabled  to  enjoy  in  an  exceptional  de- 
gree the  privileges  of  this  ** chance  of  a  lifetime.'' 
Not  least  of  these  managers  was  the  famous  John 
Mitchell,  of  Old  Bond  Street,  the  mainstay  of  the 
opera,  who  first  introduced  the  ^  ^  French  Plays ' '  in 
London,  and  taught  English  audiences  to  under- 
stand and  appreciate  the  consummate  art  of  their 
neighbors  across  the  Channel. 

Then  it  was  that  I  went  to  Covent  Garden  and 
heard  for  the  first  time  Adelina  Patti,  Pauline 
Lucca,  Scalchi,  Tamberlik,  Mario,  Bettini,  Faure, 
Cotogni,  Tagliafico;  or,  at  Her  Majesty's,  Chris- 
tine Nilsson,  Tietjens,  Trebelli,  Marimon,  lima 
di  Murska,  Mongini,  Gardoni,  Capoul,  Wachtel, 
Agnesi,  Rota,  Santley,  Foli,  Carl  Formes.  Then 
it  was  that  in  the  concert-room  I  listened  to  the 


25

still  marvelous  voices  of  Alboni,  Carlotta  Patti, 
and  Sims  Reeves;  heard  delightedly  the  glorious 
playing  of  such  violinists  as  Sivori,  Vieuxtemps, 
Wieniawski,  Neruda,  and  Joachim ;  and  reveled  in 
the  never-to-be-forgotten  art  of  Clara  Schumann 
and  Alfredo  Piatti.  Looking  back  after  thirty 
years,  and  with  every  wish  to  avoid  the  objection- 
able manner  of  the  laudator  temp  oris  acti,  it  seems 
to  me  that  that  was  a  veritable  ^^age  of  giants/'  a 
period  of  artistic  constellations  which,  as  far  as 
London  at  least  is  concerned,  has  never  since  been 
approached. 

Among  the  most  interesting  of  the  French  refu- 
gees of  1871  were  the  members  of  the  Comedie 
Frangaise.  They  gave  a  memorable  series  of 
representations  at  one  of  the  London  theatres,  se- 
lecting for  it  most  of  the  gems  of  their  matchless 
repertoire,  with  casts  that  included  such  artists  as 
Got,  Delauny,  Mounet-Sully,  Worms,  Febvre,  the 
Coquelins,  Mmes.  Sarah  Bernhardt,  Blanche  Pier- 
son,  Bartet,  Barretta,  lieichemberg,  and  Samary. 
If  I  am  not  mistaken,  it  was  during  this  season  that 
Sarah  Bernhardt  made  her  London  debut.  I  saw 
her  for  the  first  time  in  her  exquisite  embodiment 
of  Dona  Sol  in  Victor  Hugo's  ^^Hernani.''  My 
father,  who  saw  her  in  * '  Andromaque ' '  and 
'^Phedre,''  told  me  that  he  considered  her  little, 
if  aught,  inferior  to  the  celebrated  Rachel,  whose 
triumphs  he  had  often  witnessed  in  Paris  during 
the  ^ '  forties. ' ' 

Sarah  Bernhardt  at  this  period  of  her  career  re-

vealed  the  iire  of  genius  more  completely  as  an 
exponent  of  classical  tragedy  than  in  modern  roles. 
In  the  latter  she  had  then  to  contend  with  two 
very  distinguished  rivals,  Mme.  Fargueil  and  Mile. 
Aimee  Desclee,  both  of  whom  had  already  played 
in  London  under  John  Mitchell's  management.  I 
remember  how  delightful  Fargueil  was  at  the  St. 
James's  Theatre  in  the  plays  of  Alexandre  Dumas 
fils;  while  the  Camille  and  the  Frou-Frou  of  Aimee 
Desclee  (the  latter  her  original  creation)  have 
never  been  surpassed.  In  later  years,  however, 
Sarah  Bernhardt  proved  that  she  had  grasped  the 
exquisite  art  of  these  gifted  women  as  surely  as  she 
had  inherited  the  mantle  of  Rachel.  And  for  this 
reason  I  am  inclined  to  regard  her  as  the  great- 
est *  ^  all-round ' '  actress  that  the  world  has  ever 
known. 

Marietta  Alboni,  Contessa  di  Pepoli,  the  most 
famous  contralto  of  the  nineteenth  century,  was 
another  of  the  unwilling  exiles  who  found  a  home 
in  London  in  1871.  I  then  heard  her  sing  on  two 
occasions.  The  first  time  was  in  the  ^^Messe 
Solennelle"  of  her  beloved  teacher  and  friend, 
Rossini,  which  the  master  had  rescored  for  full 
orchestra  some  four  years  previous, — in  fact,  only 
a  few  months  before  he  died.*    Thirteen  years  had 

^At  Eossini's  funeral  in  Paris  (November  21,  1868)  the  prin- 
cipal musical  feature  was  the  singing  of  the  duet  '^Quis  est 
homo,"  from  his  ''Stabat  Mater,"  by  Adelina  Patti  and  Alboni. 
M.  Gustave  Choquet  remarks  (Grove's  Dictionary,  Vol.  Ill) :  ''To 
hear  that  beautiful  music  rendered  by  two  such  voices,  and  in 
the  presence  of  such  artists,  over  the  grave  of  the  composer,  was 


27 


Thirty  Years  of 


elapsed  since  Alboni  was  last  heard  in  London, 
and  some  time  since  she  had  retired  from  the  stage 
altogether.  Even  then  she  was  only  in  her  forty- 
ninth  year,  and,  despite  her  unusual  stoutness,  her 
tones  retained  well-nigh  all  their  pristine  charm 
of  quality  and  organ-like  richness  of  volume.  What 
a  magnificent  voice  it  was!  How  marvelous— for 
a  pure  contralto— its  evenness  and  range!  Mr. 
Julian  Marshall,  in  his  article  on  Alboni  in  Grove's 
Dictionary,  describes  her  compass  as  "fully  two 
octaves,  from  G  to  G.''  To  be  correct,  he  should 
have  added  quite  another  half-octave  to  the  head 
register  and  nearly  as  much  below ;  for  Alboni  sang 
with  perfect  ease  to  the  upper  C,  and  could  descend 
when  she  pleased  to  the  middle  space  of  the  bass 
clef —altogether  a  scale  extending  not  far  short  of 
three  octaves !  The  purity  and  fluency  of  her  style 
were  indescribable.  She  was  one  of  the  last  great 
exemplars  of  the  old  Italian  school. 

The  second  time  I  heard  Alboni  was  at  a  concert 
given  in  a  private  house  in  Welbeck  Street,  Cav- 
endish Square,  by  Alessandro  Romili,  a  young 
Italian  who,  prior  to  the  war,  had  acted  as  ac- 
companist in  Paris  to  the  well-known  singer  and 
teacher  Delle  Sedie.  I  recollect  how  perfectly  she 
sang  some  French  pieces  and  a  new  romanza  ("II 
primo  amore,"  I  think  it  was  called)   expressly 

to  feel  in  the  truest  sense  the  genius  of  Rossini,  and  the  part 
which  h*e  has  played  in  the  music  of  the  nineteenth  century. ' ' 
The  artists  referred  to  were  a  group  of  some  eighteen  fa- 
mous singers  who,  on  the  same  occasion,  took  part  with  the 
pupils  of  the  Conservatoire  in  the  "Prayer"  from  "Moi'se. "

composed  for  her  by  Romili.  But  what  dwells 
most  vividly  in  my  memory  in  connection  with  this 
concert  is  her  extreme  kindness  to  my  brother  Max, 
who  was  down  in  the  same  programme  for  a  violin 
solo.  The  great  artist  insisted  on  sitting  among 
the  audience  to  listen  to  the  little  English  fiddler 
(then  about  thirteen) ;  and  he  had  just  started 
his  solo  when  one  of  his  strings  broke.  He  gave 
one  glance  of  consternation  round  the  room  and 
then  incontinently  burst  into  tears.  The  audience 
looked  half  amused ;  but  Alboni  rose  from  her  seat, 
walked  to  my  brother,  and,  kissing  him  upon  the 
forehead,  said,  loudly  enough  for  every  one  to  hear, 
^'N'importe,  mon  petit  ami;  ne  pleurs  pas!  Get 
accident-la  aurait  pu  arriver  a  Sivori  lui-meme ! '  '^ 
Whereupon  the  boy  dried  his  tears,  mended  his 
string,  and  went  through  his  solo  with  entire 
success. 

In  the  spring  of  the  following  year  (1872)  Max 
obtained  a  letter  of  introduction  to  Joseph 
Joachim.  An  appointment  was  made,  and  one 
morning  we  found  ourselves  in  the  presence  of 
the  ^'king  of  violinists"  at  the  house  of  his  late 
brother,  Henry  Joachim,  with  whom  he  always  re- 
sided when  staying  in  London.  I  do  not  know 
which  of  us  was  the  more  nervous.  Max  or  myself 
(I  was  there  as  his  accompanist)  ;  but  I  do  know 
that  he  utterly  failed  to  do  himself  justice.  After 
he  had  played  a  page  or  two  of  one  of  Rode 's  con- 

^'^Never   mind,   my   little   friend;    don't   cry!      That   accident 
could  have  happened  to  Sivori  himself!"

certos,  Herr  Joachim  stopped  him  and  asked 
whether  he  intended  making  ^'fiddling''  his  pro- 
fession. ^^Yes,''  meekly  replied  my  brother. 
*^Well,  in  that  case,"  continued  the  great  man,  in 
not  unkindly  tones,  ^^I  don't  think  you  need  play 
to  me  any  more  for  the  present.  You  have  still  a 
great  deal  to  do,  apart  from  learning  how  to  hold 
your  violin  properly,  and  how  to  keep  your  elbow 
to  your  side  when  you  draw  your  bow  across  the 
strings.  But  you  have  talent.  When  you  have 
studied  hard  for  another  year  or  two,  I  shall  be 
glad  to  hear  you  play  again.''  After  which,  he 
came  to  see  us  out  at  the  front  door,  and  we  left 
the  house  in  a  not  altogether  enviable  frame  of 
mind.  Of  myself  he  barely  took  any  notice;  but 
six  years  later  we  were  destined  to  meet  under 
more  favorable  circumstances,  and  to  begin  a 
friendship  which,  I  am  proud  to  say,  has  endured 
without  break  dowa  to  the  present  time. 

It  was  during  this  particular  decade  that  the 
unique  powers  of  Joseph  Joachim  reached  their 
prime.  I  had  now  become  a  regular  attendant 
at  the  ^'Pops,"  and  it  was  often  my  privilege  to 
sit  there  beside  my  lamented  friend  James  W.  Da- 
vison, the  critic  of  the  *  ^  Times ' '  and  proprietor  of 
the  ' '  Musical  World ' ' ;  the  man  who  helped  Arthur 
Chappell  to  establish  those  famous  concerts,  and 
who  for  twenty  years  or  more  wrote  the  analytical 
programmes  which  constituted  one  of  their  most 
important  educational  features.  One  Saturday  af- 
ternoon I  was  sitting  by  Davison's  side  as  a  glori- 


32

ous  treat  was  nearing  its  close.  Joachim  liad  with 
marvelous  lire  led  one  of  the  ^  ^  Rasoumowsky " 
quartets;  he  had  played  the  Bach  ^^Chaconne" 
as  he  alone  in  the  world  could  play  it;  and  now 
he  was  taking  part  in  Schumann 's  noble  pianoforte 
quintet,  with  Mme.  Schumann,  Louis  Ries,  Lud- 
wig  Straus,  and  Piatti  for  his  companions. 

Just  before  the  finale,  the  old  critic  turned  to 
me  and  said  in  his  abrupt,  characteristic  way :  ^  ^  My 
boy,  mind  you  mark  this  day  with  a  red  letter !  I 
have  known  Joachim  ever  since  he  made  his  debut 
here  as  a  lad  of  thirteen,  under  Mendelssohn,  at 
the  Philharmonic  in  '44  [about  thirty  years  pre- 
vious], but  never  have  I  heard  him  play  as  he 
has  played  this  afternoon.  From  first  to  last  he 
has  been  like  one  inspired. '^  The  writer  of  these 
recollections  took  up  the  record  for  the  five  and 
twenty  years  that  were  to  follow.  Still  the  grand 
old  violinist  came  regularly  to  London,  after  his 
former  associates  one  by  one  had  dropped  ^'out 
of  the  running'';^  and  still  he  continued  to  play 

*  Mr.  Eies  is  the  sole  surviving  member  of  the  original  Monday 
' '  Pop ' '  Quartet.  Of  the  artists  named  above  Dr.  Joachim  is  hap- 
pily still  living;  but  he  no  longer  appears  at  these  concerts. 
Mme.  Schumann  died  in  1896,  Mr.  Ludwig  Straus  in  1899,  and 
Signor  Piatti  in  1901.  When  Mr.  Eies  retired  in  1897,  I  received 
from  him  the  following  letter:  ''Dear  Mr.  Klein:  I  gave  my- 
self the  pleasure  of  calling  upon  you  to-day,  but  was  not  fortunate 
enough  to  find  you  at  home,  and  therefore  write  these  few  lines, 
telling  you— what  perhaps  you  may  have  heard  already— that  I 
have  this  season  resigned  my  post  at  the  Popular  Concerts,  after 
holding  it  for  thirty-nine  years!  So  I  say  'LebewohP  to  you 
as  a  public  man,  and  thank  you  for  all  the  kindness  you  have

season  after  season,  with  all  the  supreme  art  of 
yore.  Yet  never  again  at  any  given  moment  did 
the  absolute  inspiration  of  that  afternoon  seem  to 
return  to  him  in  its  full  glory.  Davison  was  right. 
It  marked  the  very  apex  of  Joachim's  career. 

In  the  spring  of  1874  there  occurred  an  event 
which  was  destined  to  exercise  an  important  influ- 
ence upon  my  career.  Manuel  Garcia,  the  great 
teacher  of  singing,  came  to  live  under  my  parents' 
roof.  We  occupied  a  large  house  at  the  corner  of 
Bentinck  Street  and  Welbeck  Street,  Cavendish 
Square,— then,  as  now,  the  recognized  fashionable 
quarter  for  London  professional  people,— and 
Signor  Garcia^  took  the  entire  ground  floor  for  his 
^  ^  studio ' '  and  dwelling  apartments. 

I  should  like  to  describe  the  brother  of  Malibran 
and  Pauline  Viardot  as  he  was  at  that  time.  He 
had  just  entered  upon  his  seventieth  year,  but  in 
appearance  and  bearing  he  did  not  seem  much  past 
fifty.  He  had  a  light,  buoyant  step,  always  walked 
quickly,  and  had  a  keen,  observant  eye,  which,  when 
he  spoke,  would  light  up  with  all  the  fire  and  ani- 
mation of  youth.  His  dark  complexion  and  his 
habit  of  rapid  gesticulation  bespoke  his  Southern 

shown  me.  I  shall  now  be  amongst  the  audience  at  the  '  *  Pops, ' ' 
where  I  hope  to  have  the  pleasure  of  meeting  you  sometimes. 
With  kind  regards,  Yours  sincerely,  Louis  Kies.  September  30, 
1897." 

^  In  virtue  of  Garcia 's  Spanish  birth  and  descent,  the  prefix 
*^Senor"  is  frequently  used.  But  in  London,  where  he  settled 
down  in  1850,  he  is  always  spoken  of  as  "  Signor ' '  Garcia,  and 
is  so  described  in  the  archives  of  the  Eoyal  Academy  of  Music 
and  other  institutions  to  which  he  was  attached  as  a  professor.

origin ;  and  although  equally  at  home  in  Spanish, 
Italian,  French,  and  English,  he  always  betrayed 
a  decided  preference  for  conversing  in  the  French 
language.  His  modesty  was  remarkable.  He 
could  rarely  be  induced  to  talk  about  himself ;  but 
in  his  opinions  he  was  firm  almost  to  obstinacy, 
and  a  prejudice  once  formed  was  as  difficult  to  re- 
move as  a  liking.  In  argument  he  was  a  close  rea- 
soner,  and  would  be  either  a  doughty  opponent  or 
a  warm  advocate.  The  middle  line  never  attracted 
him.  But  at  all  times  he  was  a  true,  stanch,  and 
loyal  friend. 

Fortunately,  Signor  Garcia  took  a  considerable 
fancy  to  me.  He  was  fond  of  discussing  politics, 
but,  having  little  time  to  read  the  papers,  would 
generally  ask  me  for  the  latest  news.  He  openly 
expressed  his  disgust  with  the  policy  of  the  Liberal 
Government  of  that  day,  and  found  in  myself  a 
sympathetic  supporter  of  his  views.  About  music 
I  was  afraid  for  a  long  while  to  talk  with  him. 
One  day,  however,  he  heard  me  singing  in  a  dis- 
tant part  of  the  house,  and  told  my  mother  that  I 
had  a  very  agreeable  light  tenor  voice.  She  at 
once  asked  him  if  he  would  be  good  enough  to 
give  me  some  instruction.  He  readily  consented, 
and,  within  an  hour,  to  my  intense  delight,  I  found 
myself  taking  my  first  lesson  from  Manuel  Garcia. 

The  master  was  then  in  his  prime.  For  forty 
years  his  pupils,  from  Jenny  Lind  down,  had  in- 
cluded some  of  the  best  singers  that  Paris  and 
London  provided,  while  among  the  many  aspir- 

35 


Thirty  Years  of 


ants  for  vocal  fame  who  came  to  study  with  him 
at  our  house  in  Bentinck  Street  were  several  whose 
names  yet  enjoy  a  universal  reputation.  During 
the  eight  or  ten  years  that  he  lived  with  us,  I  studied 
with  him  for  nearly  four,  and  heard  him  give  many 
scores  of  lessons  beside  those  which  I  received. 
To  see  and  hear  Garcia  teach  was  ever  a  source 
of  unqualified  pleasure.  Even  when  annoyed  by 
a  pupil's  lack  of  ordinary  intelligence,  he  seldom 
became  abrujDt  or  impatient ;  and  he  never  worried 
or  confused  the  student  with  technicalities  not 
actually  essential  to  the  accurate  understanding 
of  his  method.  His  voice  had  virtually  gone,  but 
he  would  liberally  employ  its  heaux  restes  to  im- 
part the  idea  for  the  proper  emission  of  a  note  or 
the  phrasing  of  a  passage.  As  often  as  not,  the 
sounds  that  he  produced  would  be  positively  ugly ; 
but  they  never  failed  to  convey  the  desired  sug- 
gestion, and,  though  his  own  voice  might  tremble 
with  sheer  weight  of  years,  he  never,  to  my  know- 
ledge, brought  out  a  pupil  whose  tones  were 
marred  by  the  slightest  shade  of  vibrato. 

Nor  was  he  at  any  time  guilty  of  the  sin  of 
'^forcing''  a  voice.  I  say  so  with  all  possible  em- 
phasis, because  that  untrue  assertion  has  been 
made  on  various  occasions,  and  it  should  be  con- 
tradicted as  a  libel  upon  a  teacher  whose  first  rule 
was  ever  to  repress  the  breathing  power  and  bring 
it  into  proper  proportion  with  the  resisting  force 
of  the  throat  and  larynx.  The  contrary  proceed- 
ing would  have  been  altogether  inconsistent  with 

36 


Musical  Life  in  London 


the  system  of  the  old  Italian  school,  whereof 
Garcia  is  the  last  really  great  teacher. 

No  less  stupid,  but  rather  more  cruel,  has  been 
the  recent  onslaught— emanating  principally  from 
Paris— upon  the  act  of  vocal  mechanism  known  as 
the  coup  de  la  glotte,  a  term  created  by  Garcia  as 
the  result  of  his  observations  on  the  interior  of  the 
larynx  with  the  aid  of  the  laryngoscope,  of  which 
instrument  he  was  the  inventor.  This  term,  first 
employed  in  his  wonderful  ^'Traite  complet  de 
1  'Art  du  Chant, ' '  ^  was  merely  meant  to  describe 
the  movement  or  *  *  stroke ' '  of  the  glottis  in  the  act 
of  attacking  a  vocal  sound— a  movement  as  natural 
as  it  is  indispensable  to  the  clean,  definite  striking 
of  a  note  by  the  human  voice.  Possibly  the  prac- 
tice of  the  act  in  question  has  been  worked  to  ex- 
cess by  would-be  imitators  of  Garcia 's  method ;  but 
certainly  it  was  never  so  taught  by  him,  and  I  have 
never  come  across  one  of  his  pupils  who  had  suf- 
fered through  its  normal  employment.  Later  on, 
however,  I  shall  have  to  refer  to  this  subject  again, 
in  order  to  quote  in  their  proper  place  some  words 
used  by  the  master  to  refute  a  particularly  flagrant 
attack  upon  the  coup  de  la  glotte. 

I  was  barely  twenty-two  when  I  ceased  taking 
lessons  from  Signor  Garcia.  Our  relations  by  that 
time  were  those  of  very  close  friends.  We  used 
to  chat  freely  upon  musical  as  well  as  other  topics, 
and  I  loved  to  ' '  draw  him  out ' '  upon  the  respective

merits  of  the  great  Italian  singers  of  bygone  years. 
I  think  his  chief  object  of  admiration  was  the  cele- 
brated Pasta,  who  lived  the  most  brilliant  portion 
of  her  career  in  Paris  during  his  own  residence 
there. ^  He  would  often  speak  of  the  ravishing 
beauty  of  her  voice,  the  perfection  of  her  fiorituri, 
and  the  grandeur  of  her  dramatic  conceptions.  Yet 
in  his  inmost  heart,  I  fancy,  his  famous  sister,  Mali- 
bran,  reigned  supreme.  She  was  his  junior  by 
three  years,  but  at  the  period  here  referred  to  had 
achieved  triumphs  unsurpassed  by  any  singer  of 
her  time,  and  yet  she  had  been  dead  and  buried 
some  forty  years!  He  would  describe  her  as  the 
most  natural  genius  he  had  ever  encountered,  and 
also  the  most  precocious.  A  great  deal  that  has 
been  related  concerning  her  is  purely  imaginary; 
but  one  perfectly  true  story  is  that  of  an  incident 
which  happened  at  Naples  one  night  when,  a  little 
girl  of  five,  she  was  playing  the  part  of  the  child 
in  Paer's  masterpiece,  ^'Agnese." 

In  this  opera  there  occurs  a  scene  where  a  hus- 

^  Giuclitta  Pasta  was  one  of  the  greatest  Eossinian  sopranos 
of  her  time,  besides  being  a  superb  emotional  actress.  She  pos- 
sessed a  voice  of  immense  range  and  power,  and  a  remarkably- 
impressive  stage  presence.  She  was  born  in  1798,  made  her  debut 
in  1815,  and  died  in  1865. 

Curiously  enough,  it  was  when  acting  as  a  substitute  for  Pasta 
that  Garcia 's  elder  sister,  Malibran,  in  1824,  made  her  first  ap- 
pearance on  any  stage  at  the  King's  Theatre,  London,  as  Bosina 
in  "II  Barbiere. ' '  She  was  then  sixteen.  In  the  following  year 
the  whole  Garcia  family  went  to  America,  wiiere  they  met  with 
immense  success,  producing  no  less  than  eleven  new  operas  during 
their  first  year  in  New  York.

band  and  wife,  who  have  quarreled,  are  reunited 
through  the  agency  of  their  little  daughter.  The 
tiny  Malibran  had  attended  all  the  rehearsals,  and 
so  extraordinary  was  her  memory  that  she  knew 
the  whole  opera  by  heart.  On  the  night  of  the 
performance,  the  prima  donna,  in  the  episode 
above  mentioned,  either  forgot  her  part  or  hesi- 
tated a  moment,  when,  lo !  the  little  girl  by  her  side 
instantly  took  up  the  melody  and  sang  out  with 
such  vigor  and  resonance  that  the  entire  house 
heard  her.  The  prima  donna  was  about  to  inter- 
fere when  the  audience  shouted,  ^^Brava!  Don't 
stop  her.  Let  the  child  go  on!"  And  go  on  the 
child  did,  until  she  had  sung  through  the  entire 
scene,  amid  an  exhibition  of  true  Italian  enthu- 
siasm. 

How  strange  it  seems  when  one  reflects  that  the 
venerable  maestro  who  narrated  to  me  this  incident, 
which  he  witnessed  as  a  boy  of  eight,  is  still  alive 
and  enjoying  good  health,  and  in  full  possession  of 
his  faculties  and  his  wonderful  spirits !  He  resides 
with  Mme.  Garcia  (his  second  wife)  and  their 
two  daughters  at  Cricklewood,  one  of  the  north- 
western suburbs  of  London.  What  happened  yes- 
terday he  does  not  always  precisely  remember ;  but 
the  events  of  nearly  a  century  ago  he  never  forgets. 
On  March  17,  1904,  all  being  well,  Manuel  Garcia 
will  be  ninety-nine  years  of  age !

NEVER  having  seriously  contemplated  becom- 
ing a  public  singer,  it  was  no  great  disap- 
pointment when  I  found,  after  a  couple  of  years' 
study,  that  my  voice  gave  no  signs  of  developing 
to  proportions  requisite  for  a  stage  career.  Aut 
Ccesar,  aut  nullus!  I  would  either  be  an  operatic 
tenor  or  I  would  be  content  to  be  simply  a  good 
amateur.  The  concert-room  had  no  charms  for 
me.  Nevertheless,  while  continuing  my  lessons 
regularly  with  Signor  Garcia,  I  had  also  to  con- 
sider the  best  means  for  earning  a  livelihood ;  and, 
as  I  have  previously  hinted,  the  opportunity  pre- 
sented itself  in  a  highly  congenial  direction— that 
of  musical  journalism.  The  work  was  calculated 
to  aid  rather  than  impede  my  studies.  It  lay  in 
a  field  which,  at  the  time  I  speak  of,  was  far  less 
overrun  than  now,  and  it  afforded  me  an  entree 
to  every  kind  of  musical  performance,  which  in 
itself  was  a  liberal  education  for  a  young  man  with 
my  instincts  and  training.

Musical  Life  in  London 


I  commenced  active  work  as  a  journalist,  then, 
in  1875,  as  London  correspondent  of  my  uncle's 
paper,  the  ^  ^  Norwich  Argus. ' '  In  1877  I  undertook 
the  direction  of  a  publication  called  the  *^  Operatic 
and  Dramatic  Album, ' '  the  duties  of  which  brought 
me  into  personal  contact  with  some  of  the  foremost 
personages  in  the  lyric  and  theatrical  worlds.  A 
year  later  I  was  appointed  musical  and  dramatic 
critic  of  the  '^Citizen,''  which  post  (during  1879 
and  part  of  1880)  I  filled  while  acting  as  musical 
critic  upon  the  staff  of  that  fine  old  weekly  paper— 
long  since  defunct— the  '  ^  Examiner. ' '  Such,  briefly 
told,  is  the  history  of  my  first  five  years '  connection 
with  London  journalism. 

Two  memorable  events  occurred  in  1875.  One 
was  the  first  production  in  London  of  Wagner's 
^  ^  Lohengrin ' ' ;  the  other,  the  first  appearance  there 
of  the  Carl  Eosa  Opera  Company.  The  former  was 
regarded  almost  in  the  light  of  an  experiment. 
Never  before  had  an  opera  by  Wagner  been  per- 
formed at  Covent  Garden.  In  1870  his  ' '  Fliegende 
Hollander''  had  been  given  at  Drury  Lane,  under 
the  Italian  title  of  ^  ^  L 'Ollandese  Dannato"  (Luigi 
Arditi  conducting),  but  without  any  very  marked 
success.  And  now  here  was  ^  ^  Lohengrin, "  a  more 
advanced  example  of  the  composer's  method,  about 
to  claim  the  suffrages  of  a  public  still  notoriously 
unprepared  for  the  comprehension  or  enjoyment 
of  what  was  generally  described  as  the  ^*  music  of 
the  future. ' '  Yet,  thanks  to  the  growing  numbers 
of  the  German  community,  the  event  aroused  in- 


43 


Thirty  Years  of 


tense  excitement,  and  the  opera-house  was  packed 
to  overflowing.  I  think  it  was  the  worst  perf orm- 
a.nce  of  ^ '  Lohengrin '  ^  ever  seen  in  an  important 
theatre.  Albani  (then  in  her  third  season)  made 
a  sympathetic  Elsa;  Nicolini  presented  a  heroic- 
looking  Lohengrin  and  sang  wonderfully  well,  con- 
sidering how  completely  out  of  his  element  he  was 
in  Wagnerian  opera ;  and  Cotogni  did  creditably  as 
Telramund.  But  the  remainder  of  the  cast  were 
beneath  notice,  while  the  chorus  sang  dreadfully 
out  of  tune,  and  the  orchestra,  under  Vianesi,  did 
its  best  to  drown  the  singers  throughout. 

Yet,  in  spite  of  these  drawbacks,  the  beauty  of 
the  music  exercised  its  inevitably  powerful  sway, 
and  the  opera  was  received  with  a  warmth  that 
grew  and  grew  till  it  culminated  in  a  tremendous 
climax  of  enthusiasm.  The  '  ^  tooth-and-naiP '  op- 
ponents of  Wagner,  who  flourished  exceedingly  in 
London  at  this  time,  were  simply  dumf  ounded.  In 
all  probability,  ^  ^  Lohengrin ' '  was  as  new  to  them 
as  it  was  to  Covent  Garden  habitues,  and  they  did 
not  know  whether  to  be  more  astonished  at  the 
subtle  fascination  of  the  music  or  at  the  ease 
with  which  its  charm  and  significance  had  been 
grasped  by  an  '  ^  unripe '  ^  public.  In  vain  did  James 
Davison  print  Cassandra-like  utterances  in  the 
^' Times'^;  equally  in  vain  did  my  dear  and  val- 
ued friend  Joseph  Bennett  limit  himself  to  luke- 
warm admiration  in  the  columns  of  the  ^*  Tele- 
graph." The  success  of  ^'Lohengrin''  in  London 
was  complete.    So  great  was  the  demand  to  hear

the  opera  that  within  a  comparatively  brief  space 
Mr.  Mapleson  had  mounted  it  at  Her  Majesty's 
with  a  cast  including  Christine  Nilsson,  Tietjens, 
Campanini,  and  Galassi.  On  the  whole,  that  was 
perhaps  the  more  satisfactory  production  of  the 
two,  albeit  I  fancy  Sir  Michael  Costa  penetrated 
very  little  further  into  the  meaning  and  spirit  of 
Wagner's  score  than  did  his  worthy  countryman, 
Signor  Vianesi.  His  chief  interest  used  to  centre 
in  the  proceedings  of  the  swan,  of  which  he  inva- 
riably spoke  contemptuously  as  ^'Dat  goose!'' 

When  Carl  Rosa  first  brought  his  troupe  to  the 
Princess's  Theatre,  London,  in  September,  1875, 
English  opera  was  in  a  bad  way.  I  am  not  pre- 
pared to  assert  that  it  is  in  a  much  better  way  at 
the  present  moment.  Beyond  doubt,  however,  its 
fortunes,  through  the  instrumentality  of  this  la- 
mented impresario,  underwent  a  revival  that  was 
of  the  utmost  importance,  not  merely  in  its  influ- 
ence upon  the  popularity  of  opera  in  the  vernacu- 
lar, but  in  its  effect,  as  a  purely  educational  factor, 
upon  the  subsequent  course  of  operatic  enterprise 
both  in  England  and  America.  How  this  latter 
process  came  about  I  shall  show  later  on.  Mean- 
while let  it  be  said  that  Carl  Rosa  was  the  man 
who  first  sounded  the  knell  of  ^'ballad-opera"  as 
a  staple  form  of  amusement,  and  lifted  the  taste 
of  the  British  public  from  its  then  commonplace 
level  to  a  plane  more  closely  approaching  that  of 
the  cultivated  audiences  of  Germany,  Austria,  and 
France. 


47 


Thirty  Years  of 


No  one  could  have  been  better  fitted  for  the  task. 
Rosa  was  a  little  over  thirty,  energetic  and  indus- 
trious to  a  fault,  an  accomplished  musician,^  an  ex- 
cellent conductor,  and  an  experienced  operatic 
manager.  His  first  wife,  the  gifted  Mme.  Parepa- 
Rosa  (whom  he  met  and  married  in  New  York 
in  1867),  was  the  leading  artist  of  the  opera 
company,  which  for  several  years  achieved  such 
great  success  under  their  joint  direction  in  the 
United  States.  They  had  returned  to  London  in 
1873  with  the  intention  of  producing  ** Lohengrin" 
in  English  at  Drury  Lane,  but  that  project  was 
abandoned  in  consequence  of  the  death  of  Mme. 
Parepa.  The  prima  donna  had  been  an  intimate 
friend  of  my  cousin  Mrs.  J.  M.  Johnson,  and  it 
was  at  the  latter 's  house  on  Maida  Hill  that  I  first 
became  acquainted  with  Carl  Rosa.  I  met  him 
there  one  afternoon  while  his  memorable  season 
at  the  Princess's  was  in  progress.  He  had  just 
finished  a  long  rehearsal  and  still  had  to  conduct 
the  evening  performance;  but  I  remember  being 
much  struck  by  his  rare  spirits  and  the  irrepressible 
energy  with  which  he  threw  himself  into  an  argu- 
ment upon  the  subject  of  English  musical  taste. 

^ '  You  are  surprised, ' '  he  said,  ^  ^  because  they  are 
crowding  the  house  for  'Figaro'  and  the  *Water- 
Carrier,'  and  you  fancy  it  must  be  Santley  that 
is  the  draw  and  not  the  operas.  But  don't  deceive 
yourselves.     This  London  public  is  now  ripe  for 

^  Carl  Rosa  came  to  England  first  as  a  solo  violinist,  and  made  his 
debut  under  August  Manns  at  the  Crystal  Palace  in  1866.

Musical  Life  in  London 


English  opera  of  a  better  sort  than  Pyne  and  Har- 
rison provided.  It  longs  for  something  more  than 
ballad-operas  and  a  'star'  or  two.  It  wants  good 
works  and,  above  all,  a  good  ensemble.  See  how 
it  appreciates  the  'Figaro'  ensemble!^  Well,  next 
season  I  shall  produce  more  unfamiliar  operas  and 
a  still  stronger  company.  Then  gradually  I  shall 
introduce  Wagner  in  English,  beginning  with  '  The 
Flying  Dutchman,'  and  perhaps  even  test  whether 
London  can  stand  a  brand-new  opera  by  a  native 
composer." 

He  was  as  good  as  his  word.  In  the  following 
year,  at  the  Lyceum,  Carl  Rosa  brought  out  four 
novelties,  including  Frederic  H.  Cowen's  ''Pau- 
line'' (a  version  of  "The  Lady  of  Lyons")  and 
Wagner's  "Flying  Dutchman."  The  latter,  with 
Santley  in  the  title-role,  made  a  tremendous  hit. 
Coming  on  top  of  the  success  of  "Lohengrin" 
and  "Tannhauser"  (the  latter  had  been  produced 
in  Italian  at  Co  vent  Garden  just  four  months  pre- 
vious), it  helped  to  complete  the  foundation  for 
the  love  and  understanding  of  Wagner's  mwsic 
which  now  extend  throughout  the  United  King-

*  The  fine  performance  of  Mozart 's  ' '  Marriage  of  Figaro 
with  which  Carl  Eosa  opened  his  memorable  campaign  at  the 
Princess's  Theatre,  London,  on  September  11,  1875,  has  always 
been  referred  to  with  pride  as  the  best  ever  given  in  the  English 
language.  Certainly  I,  for  one,  never  heard  a  finer.  The  cast 
included  Santley  as  Figaro,  Campobello  (an  Italianized  Scotch- 
man) as  the  Count,  Aynsley  Cook  as  Bartolo,  Charles  Lyall  as 
Antonio,  Ostava  Torriani  (a  Hamburg  artist)  as  the  Countess,

Eose  Hersee  as  Susanna.

dom,  embracing  the  entire  range  of  the  master  ^s 
works. 

Carl  Rosa  was  one  of  the  most  restless  and  in- 
defatigable of  industrious  men.  His  plan  was  to 
mount  all  his  new  productions  in  the  provinces,  so 
as  to  bring  them  to  the  metropolis  smoothed  and 
polished  by  frequent  repetition.  No  sooner  had 
one  season  ended  than  he  began  preparing  for  the 
next.  In  1877  he  did  not  visit  London,  and  in  the 
October  of  that  year  he  wrote  me  from  Aberdeen : 

I  have  been  very  busy  bringing  out  "The  Merry 
Wives  of  AVindsor"  (Nicolai),  which  you  will  be  happy 
to  hear  was  a  very  great  success.  I  am  glad  to  learn 
that  you  are  getting  connected  with  the  London  press, 
and  will  be  happy  to  give  you  information  about  my 
future  doings  when  the  time  comes;  but  any  announce- 
ments at  present  would,  I  think,  be  premature. 

He  was  curiously  diffident  in  the  matter  of  ad- 
vertisement, and  his  habit  of  avoiding  rather  than 
seeking  publicity  offers  a  striking  contrast  to  the 
methods  of  the  impresario  of  to-day.  When  I 
knew  he  was  coming  to  the  Adelphi  Theatre  for 
a  spring  season  in  1878,  I  wrote  to  him  asking  for 
portraits  of  himself  and  Miss  Georgina  Burns 
(who  had  just  made  her  debut  as  Anne  Page  in 
'  ^  The  Merry  Wives, '  ^  and  subsequently  became  one 
of  the  most  popular  sopranos  on  the  English  stage) 
for  publication  in  the  ^^  Operatic  and  Dramatic  Al- 
bum.''   I  received  the  following  reply:

Royal  Amphitheatre,  Liverpool, 

January  8,  1878. 
Dear  Klein: 

Miss  Burns  has  no  biography.  She  is  quite  a  novice. 
Of  her  success  I  have  no  doubt,  but  under  the  circum- 
stances I  think  you  had  better  not  publish  her  picture, 
as  I  quite  understand  that  you  should  only  give  those 
of  well-known  artists. 

I  will  send  you  a  biography  of  myself  which  appeared 
in  the  ''Illustrated  London  News,"  and  which  you  can 
easily  alter  to  suit  your  taste.  But  do  you  think  le  jeu 
vaut  la  cha7idellef  Do  you  think  portraits  of  conductors 
and  managers  are  sufficiently  attractive  to  the  general 
public?    /  tJmik  not. 

Sincerely  yours, 

Carl  Rosa. 

Those  were  not  the  days  of  '^interviewers'*  or 
'^  snapshots, ' '  and  I  frequently  experienced  diffi- 
culty in  persuading  musical  and  dramatic  celebri- 
ties to  furnish  me  with  the  requisite  material  for 
writing  notices  of  their  careers.  The  portraits,  of 
course,  could  be  obtained  easily  enough,  but  the 
actresses  and  prima  donnas  always  used  to  be 
dreadfully  afraid  lest  I  should  want  to  publish 
their  exact  age.  Miss  Nelly  Farren,  for  instance, 
positively  refused  to  permit  a  word  to  be  written 
about  her,  and  her  portrait  went  into  the  ''Album'' 
without  a  line  of  biographical  detail.  Another 
well-known  actress,  Miss  Ada  Cavendish,  sent  me 
her  photo  and  autograph,  but  wrote :  "  I  must  say 


53 


Thirty  Years  of 


you  set  me  a  rather  difficult  task  when  you  ask  me 
for  a  biographical  sketch  of  my  career.  Is  it  ab- 
solutely necessary  that  you  should  insert  one?  I 
really  think  that  the  public  will  take  very  little  in- 
terest in  my  early  troubles  in  the  profession.  If, 
therefore,  you  can  do  without  it,  please  do  so. ' '  On 
the  other  hand,  I  sometimes  got  more  information 
than  I  really  needed,  or  else  I  received  corrections 
and  thanks  after  inadvertent  errors  had  appeared 
in  type.  Among  letters  of  this  kind  was  one  from 
the  eminent  conductor.  Sir  Michael  Costa,  who  was 
perhaps  the  severest  martinet  that  ever  wielded  a 
baton,  but  who  never  forgot  that  he  was  a  gentle- 
man and  could  be,  when  he  chose,  the  very  ^^pink 
of  politeness.''  As  a  rule,  he  did  not  pay  much 
attention  to  critics,  youthful  or  otherwise;  so,  in 
spite  of  the  inaccuracies,  I  felt  rather  flattered 
when  I  received  from  Sir  Michael  this  extremely 
courteous  note: 

59  EccLESTON  Square,  S.  W. 
Dear  Sir: 

I  have  received  the  biography  that  you  have  taken 
the  trouble  to  publish  and  kindly  sent  to  me,  for  which 
I  am  much  obliged.  Only  two  observations  you  will 
allow  me  to  make:  first,  that  I  composed  ''Eli"  and 
"Naaman"  for  the  Birmingham  Musical  Festivals  of 
1855  and  1864,  not  for  the  Sacred  Harmonic  Society; 
and,  secondly,  that  my  rank  in  Grand  Lodge  [of  Eng- 
lish Freemasons]  is  Past  Grand  Warden,  not  Grand 
Organist. 

I  do  not  hesitate  to  make  the  above  remarks,  knowing 


54 


Musical  Life  in  London 


how  correct  and  exact  you  are,  or  are  desirous  to  be, 
in  whatever  you  publish.    With  best  wishes,  I  remain, 

Sincerely  yours, 

M.  Costa. 

Of  Sir  Michael  Costa  it  is  certainly  not  too  much 
to  say  that  he  was  in  his  time  the  greatest  choral 
conductor  that  England  possessed.  He  was  a  born 
*  ^  leader  of  men, ' '  and  if  I  had  not  formed  this  im- 
pression on  my  early  visits  to  Exeter  Hall,  when 
he  was  directing  the  performances  of  the  old  Sa- 
cred Harmonic  Society,  I  should  assuredly  have 
done  so  at  my  first  Handel  Festival  in  1874,  when 
he  took  command  of  the  army  of  four  thousand 
singers  and  instrumentalists  who  obeyed  his  ample 
beat  with  such  marvelous  rhythmic  swing  and  pre- 
cision. From  the  institution  of  the  festival  in 
1857,  Costa  alone  had  trained  and  directed  this 
army ;  and  so  universal  was  the  idea  that  he  alone 
was  capable  of  keeping  it  under  control,  that  when 
the  announcement  of  his  serious  illness  came,  just 
before  the  festival  of  1883,  there  was  an  expression 
of  dismay  on  all  sides.  The  musician  who  filled  the 
breach  happily  proved  to  be  in  the  end  as  good  as 
his  predecessor.  Indeed,  August  Manns,  the  es- 
teemed and  talented  conductor  of  the  Crystal 
Palace  Concerts,  did  much  to  improve  the  quality 
of  his  vast  choir  and  to  raise  its  level  of  efficiency 
and  intelligence.  Still,  he  would  be  the  first  to 
admit  that  the  honor  and  glory  of  the  most  striking 
executive  achievement  known  to  music  stands  prin-

August  Manns— still  an  active  veteran,  though 
now  in  his  seventy-ninth  year— has  the  qualities 
of  a  i3urely  orchestral  conductor  in  a  far  higher 
degree  than  they  were  ever  possessed  by  Costa. 
His  work  at  the  Crystal  Palace  from  1855  to  1900, 
alike  in  its  educational  aspect  and  its  conspicuously 
beneficial  encouragement  of  native  art,  will  endure, 
a  lasting  monument  of  industry,  catholicity  of 
taste,  and  consistent  loftiness  of  purpose.  At  Syd- 
enham it  was  that  Arthur  Sullivan  was  first  prof- 
fered a  helping  hand  by  the  performance  of  his 
^^ Tempest''  music  on  his  return  from  Leipsic 
(April,  1862).  Thither  did  Sir  George  Grove— 
sometime  secretary  of  the  Crystal  Palace  Com- 
pany and  writer  of  the  luminous  analytical  notes 
that  so  materially  enhanced  the  enjoyment  of  the 
famous  Saturday  Concerts— convey  the  precious 
Schubert  manuscripts  which  he  had  rescued  from 
dust  and  oblivion  in  Vienna.  There,  under  the  aegis 
of  August  Manns,  was  solved  for  the  first  time  in 
England  the  problem  of  cheap  ^^ classical"  orches- 
tral concerts  that  should  attract  the  masses  and 
initiate  them  into  the  delight  of  listening  to  good 
music.  There  I  heard  my  first  symphony  (it  was 
Beethoven's  ^'Pastoral");  and  there,  Saturday 
after  Saturday,  I  heard  the  most  celebrated  solo- 
ists that  visited  our  British  shores— from  Rubin- 
stein and  Clara  Schumann  to  Paderewski,  from

Joachim  to  Sarasate,  from  Piatti  to  Hausmann 
and  Hugo  Becker.  To  attend  these  concerts  regu- 
larly was  a  musical  education  in  itself. 

In  central  London,  during  the  ^  ^  seventies, ' '  the 
best  medium  for  hearing  good  orchestral  music 
was  the  Promenade  Concerts  at  Covent  Garden. 
These  were  held  in  August  and  September,  under 
the  management  of  Messrs.  A.  and  S.  Gatti.  My 
old  friend  Signor  Luigi  Arditi  was  the  conductor 
for  the  first  few  seasons,  and  he  was  succeeded  in 
turn  by  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan  and  Mr.  F.  H.  Co  wen ; 
while  later  on  came  a  popular  Welsh  bandmaster, 
Mr.  Gwyllym  Crowe.  Much  that  was  interesting 
and  instructive  the  shilling  habitue  could  hear  at 
these  ^  ^  Promenades ' ' ;  but  for  me  the  most  notable 
recollection  associated  with  them  is  the  occasion 
when  Arditi  gave  the  first  performance  in  England 
of  the  ^'Trauermarsch"  from  ^ '  Gotterdammer- 
ung."  The  new  tubas  had  only  just  arrived,  and 
there  was  not  much  time  for  rehearsing.  Never- 
theless, it  seemed  to  me  that  the  wonderful  excerpt 
was  fairly  well  played,  though  I  was  too  breathless 
with  amazement  and  admiration  to  be  able  to  form 
a  cool  judgment.  But  I  do  know  that  the  audience 
hardly  waited  for  the  last  note  before  it  burst  into 
frantic  applause,  and  insisted  upon  having  the 
march  played  a  second  time. 

During  the  opera  seasons  of  1874-75,  there  ap- 
peared at  Drury  Lane  a  young  Polish  singer,  who 
met  with  emphatic  success  in  leading  barytone  parts

Balfe's  posthumous  opera  ^'11  Talismano,"  which 
was  produced  in  June,  1874,  with  Nilsson,  Tietjens, 
Campanini,  and  others  in  the  cast.  I  distinctly 
recollect  him  in  two  characters— Z)o^  Giovanni 
and  De  Nevers,  It  seemed  to  me  that  he  had  a 
beautiful  voice,  of  almost  tenor  quality,  and  both 
as  singer  and  actor  he  displayed  the  highest 
promise.  He  appeared  then  under  the  name  of 
* '  De  Eeschi. ' '  Twelve  years  later  he  was  to  return 
to  London  and  take  the  town  by  storm  under  his 
own  name  of  Jean  de  Eeszke.

IN  May,  1876,  I  saw  Verdi  conduct  his  Manzoni 
^^Eequiem'^  at  the  Royal  Albert  Hall.  This 
was  generally  supposed  to  be  his  third  visit  to  Lon- 
don, the  previous  occasions  being  when  he  came 
over  in  1847  for  the  production  of  the  opera  ^^I 
Masnadieri, ' '  which  he  wrote  expressly  for  Her 
Majesty's  Theatre;  and  again  in  1862  (the  Exhibi- 
tion year),  when  his  ^'Inno  delle  Nazioni"  was  per- 
formed at  the  same  theatre.  But,  according  to  his 
intimate  friend,  Mr.  Randegger,  the  maestro  also 
ran  over  from  Paris  one  summer,  without  letting 
any  one  into  the  secret,  for  the  purpose  of  hear- 
ing for  himself  what  the  world-famous  Handel 
Festival  was  like.  Mr.  Randegger  has  told  me  that 
his  surprise  was  indescribable  when  he  came  across 
Verdi  at  the  Crystal  Palace  with  a  score  of  ^  ^  Israel 
in  Egypt''  tucked  under  his  arm.  He  insisted, 
however,  that  his  presence  should  be  concealed; 
and  he  seems  to  have  returned  to  Paris  as  mysteri- 
ously as  he  came.

Thirty  Years  of 


At  the  period  of  the  ^^ Requiem''  visit  there  hap- 
pened to  be  residing  in  London  an  elderly  Italian 
musician  named  Deliguoro,  upon  whom  fortune 
had  not  smiled  very  kindly,  and  who  frequently  en- 
joyed the  hospitality  of  my  parents'  house.  An 
admirable  contrapuntist,  stuffed  full  of  musical 
learning,  he  had  the  technique  of  composition  at 
his  fingers'  ends;  but  of  individual  or  fresh  ideas 
his  brain  was  utterly  devoid.  Like  most  dis- 
appointed geniuses,  he  was  unable  to  perceive  his 
own  lack  of  originality.  Once  he  played  me  a 
melody  in  mazurka  rhythm— a  commonplace 
enough  Neapolitan  tune— which  he  fondly  re- 
garded as  an  inspiration ;  and  I  shall  never  forget 
the  old  gentleman's  horror  when,  a  day  or  two  af- 
terward, he  caught  me  strumming  his  piece  by  ear 
upon  the  piano.  I  had  to  swear  by  all  his  own  par- 
ticular saints  that  I  would  never  even  hum  his  tune 
again.  ^ '  Some  one  would  be  sure  to  steal  it. ' '  He 
was  utterly  oblivious  to  the  fact  that  he  had  vir- 
tually stolen  it  himself. 

The  announcement  of  Verdi's  coming  was  a 
great  event  for  Deliguoro,  inasmuch  as  the  master 
and  he  had  been  fellow-students  together  at  Milan, 
under  Lavigna  (1831-33).  This  was  just  after  the 
preposterous  refusal  of  the  authorities  at  the  Milan 
Conservatoire  to  admit  Verdi  as  a  pupil  at  that  in- 
stitution because  they  thought  he  did  not  display 
sufficient  promise  of  talent.  Deliguoro 's  delight  at 
the  prospect  of  meeting  his  old  friend  knew  no 
bounds.     He  had  not  seen  him  for  quite  thirty 

60 


Musical  Life  in  London 


years.  ^'Giuseppe  and  I  were  like  brothers.  We 
ate,  drank,  and  worked  together  the  whole  of  the 
time.  His  harmony  exercises  always  had  more  mis- 
takes than  mine,  and  he  could  never  master  the  art 
of  writing  a  really  good  fugue.  I  wonder  whether 
he  has  dared  to  put  one  into  his  ^  Requiem  M  We 
shall  see ;  for  I  am  going  to  write  and  ask  him  for 
a  ticket  to  hear  it.''  In  due  course  tickets  arrived 
for  the  rehearsal  and  the  concert,  and  Deliguoro 
showed  them  to  me  with  the  utmost  pride. 

Most  of  the  distinguished  musical  folk  in  London 
were  present  at  the  ^^ grand  rehearsal";  and  yet 
the  vast  auditorium,  capable  of  holding  10,000  per- 
sons comfortably,  looked  comparatively  deserted. 
I  sat  with  Deliguoro  not  far  from  the  orchestra. 
He  was  so  excited  that  I  had  the  utmost  difficulty  in 
restraining  him  from  climbing  over  the  barrier  and 
taking  Verdi  in  his  arms  there  and  then.  Nor 
were  my  own  feelings  altogether  calm  as  I  gazed 
for  the  first  time  upon  the  man  who  had  composed 
''Jjsl  Traviata,''  ^ '  Rigoletto, ' '  and  ^'Aida."  He 
was  then  sixty-three  years  of  age,  and  his  closely 
cut  beard  was  fast  turning  gray ;  but  he  was  as  ac- 
tive and  robust  as  a  youth,  his  eyes  were  keen  and 
bright,  and  his  clear,  penetrating  voice  when  he  ad- 
dressed the  choir  (in  French  or  Italian,  I  forget 
which)  could  be  heard  all  over  the  hall. 

At  the  end  of  the  fugal  chorus  "  Sanctus  Domi- 
nus,"  which  my  neighbor  declared  to  be  more 
scholarly  than  anything  he  had  anticipated,  Verdi 
came    around  to   speak  to    his    friends    among

Thirty  Years  of 


the  select  audience,  and  ere  long  I  could  see  that 
he  was  staring  in  an  uncertain  way  at  Deliguoro. 
Then  all  of  a  sudden  he  appeared  to  make  up  his 
mind,  and  took  a  ^'bee-line''  over  the  stall  chairs 
to  the  spot  where  we  were  standing.  ^  ^  Tu  sei  Deli- 
guoro, non  e  ver  ? ' '  exclaimed  the  maestro.  ^  ^  Si,  si, 
son  Deliguoro,^'  replied  his  old  friend,  his  eyes 
brimming  over  with  tears.^  And  then  followed  a 
close  embrace  that  I  thought  would  never  end.  It 
would  be  hard  to  say  which  of  the  two  former  class- 
mates evinced  the  fuller  measure  of  joy. 

But  in  the  midst  of  the  excitement  I  was  not  for- 
gotten. Deliguoro  presented  me  to  Verdi  as  '^the 
son  of  the  best  friends  he  had  in  London,  and  a 
youthful  but  modest  musical  critic. ' '  I  added  that 
I  had  been  indebted  to  Signer  Deliguoro  for  much 
good  teaching  and  advice  in  the  study  of  the  art. 
*^And  you  could  not  do  better,''  said  Verdi  in 
French,  as  he  shook  me  by  the  hand.  ^^  Deliguoro 
is  not  only  a  colossus  of  counterpoint,  but  he  has 
a  great  heart  (c'est  un  grand  coeur),  and  I  feel  per- 
sonally grateful  to  any  one  who  is  kind  to  him." 
Nor  did  the  great  man,  who  was  the  soul  of  gener- 
osity, forget  his  own  duty  in  the  matter ;  for,  prior 
to  leaving  London,  he  sent  a  substantial  money  gift 
to  the  less  fortunate  friend  of  his  youth,  who  was 
destined  to  survive  only  a  year  or  two  longer. 

Surely  none  who  heard  that  magnificent  perform- 
ance of  *  the  Manzoni  ^'Requiem"  can  have  ever

forgotten  the  combined  effect  of  the  beautiful  mu- 
sic, the  superb  singing  of  the  Albert  Hall  choir 
(trained  by  Barnby),  the  wonderful  voices  of  the 
soloists,  and,  pervading  all,  the  subtle  magnetic  in- 
fluence induced  by  the  presence  and  personal  guid- 
ance of  the  composer.  The  solo  artists  included 
three  members  of  the  original  quartet,  namely: 
Mme.  Stolz,  Mme.  Waldmann,  and  Signor  Masini. 
All  possessed  noble  organs ;  and  the  famous  tenor, 
who  has  never  been  heard  in  opera  in  England,  was 
then  quite  at  his  best.  But  the  undoubted  gem  of 
the  whole  performance  was  the  *  *  Agnus  Dei, ' '  with 
its  octave  unison  phrases  for  the  two  women's 
voices,  sung  by  Stolz  and  Waldmann  with  a  deli- 
cacy and  charm  of  simply  ethereal  loveliness.  Nor 
shall  I  forget  the  pains  taken  by  Verdi  at  rehearsal 
to  obtain  from  his  chorus  and  orchestra  of  eight 
hundred  a  pianissimo  in  fitting  proportion  to  the 
exquisite  tone  of  these  singers. 

A  YEAR  later  Richard  Wagner  came  to  London  to 
take  part  in  the  series  of  Wagner  Festival  Con- 
certs at  the  Eoyal  Albert  Hall,  which  had  been  ar- 
ranged with  a  view  to  paying  off  the  debt  on  the 
new  theatre  at  Bayreuth.^    The  events  of  this  visit 

^  It  will  be  remembered  that  there  was  a  deficit  of  something 
like  140,000  marks  ($35,000)  after  the  opening  season  of  1876, 
when  *'Der  Eing  des  Nibelungen'^  was  performed  for  the  first 
time  in  its  entirety.  London,  however,  did  little  toward  liqui- 
dating this  debt.  It  was  ultimately  paid  off  with  the  gross  re- 
ceipts of  some  cycles  of  **The  Eing"  at  Munich,  for  which  the 
performers  all  gave  their  services  gratuitously.

are  briefly  narrated  in  *^  Grove  *'  by  Mr.  Edward 
Dannreuther,  at  whose  house  in  Bayswater  Wag- 
ner stayed— from  April  30  to  June  4.  Evidently, 
however,  Mr.  Dannreuther  had  no  desire  to  dwell 
in  detail  upon  the  incidents  of  this  ^'London 
episode."  He  was  even  a  trifle  ashamed  that  his 
name  should  have  been  associated  with  it  in  Glase- 
napp's  biography  of  Wagner  *^and  elsewhere"; 
and  he  expressly  states  ^^that  he  had  nothing  what- 
ever to  do  with  the  planning  of  the  ^festival,'  nor 
with  the  business  arrangements."  All  he  did  was 
to  ^ '  attend  to  the  completion  of  the  orchestra  with 
regard  to  the  ^ extra'  wind-instruments,  and,  at 
Wagner's  request,  to  conduct  the  preliminary  re- 
hearsals. ' ' 

No  doubt  such  was  the  case.  But  thus  to  dis- 
claim all  connection  with  the  enterprise  has  always 
sounded  to  me  rather  like  a  slur  upon  the  good  in- 
tentions of  those  whose  devotion  to  Wagner 's  cause 
had  led  to  the  inception  and  organization  of  this 
affair.  That  Wagner  himself  was  annoyed  at  cer- 
tain things  which  occurred,  and  that  he  went  away 
on  the  whole  extremely  disappointed,  may  be  safely 
assumed,  if  only  from  what  was  subsequently  said 
by  his  native  champions  of  the  press  in  Bavaria 
*'and  elsewhere."  A  great  many  of  those  state- 
ments, however,  were  either  untrue  or  grossly  ex- 
aggerated. The  whole  truth  has  never  been  related, 
and  as  I  happened  to  have  been  *' behind  the 
scenes,"  more  or  less,  throughout  the  Wagner 
Festival   of  1877,   it  may  be   interesting  to  my

readers  if  I  now  endeavor,  as  concisely  as  possible, 
to  tell  the  story. 

To  make  matters  clear,  I  must  premise  that  the 
adversaries  and  supporters  of  Wagnerian  art  in 
London  were  then  ranged  in  three  distinct  camps. 
There  were  (1)  those  who  refused  to  accept  his 
music  under  any  conditions;  (2)  those  who  would 
accept  all  he  had  written  down  to  ^ '  Tannhauser ' ' 
and  ''Lohengrin'^;  and  (3)  those  who  worshiped 
both  at  the  temple  and  from  afar,  accepting  and 
rejoicing  in  everything.  The  first  of  these  sections 
was  gradually  dying  out,  or  was  being  absorbed  by 
the  second,  as  the  beauty  of  the  operas  heard  in 
London  within  the  previous  two  years  slowly  but 
surely  forced  its  way  into  the  heart  and  under- 
standing of  the  people.  The  prejudice  against  the 
later  works  still  prevailed,  however,  and  to  such  an 
extent  that  no  London  impresario  yet  dreamed  of 
mounting  ^  ^  Tristan, '  ^  or  ^ '  Die  Walkiire, ' '  or  ^ '  Die 
Meistersinger,''  despite  the  success  those  works 
were  then  meeting  with  in  many  Continental  cities. 
All  one  could  say  was  that  musicians  were  begin- 
ning to  display  an  interest  in  the  preludes  and  ex- 
cerpts occasionally  performed  in  the  concert-room ; 
while,  as  a  matter  of  course,  the  London  Wagner 
Society  was  constantly  growing  in  numbers  and 
strength,  and  working  a  steady  **  propaganda ' '  on 
behalf  of  the  cause. 

Among  the  most  popular  artists  appearing  in 
England  at  that  time  was  the  eminent  violinist,  Au- 
gust Wilhelmj,  who  was  one  of  Wagner's  most  ar- 

67 


Thirty  Years  of 


dent  disciples  and  tlie  leader  of  the  first  Bayrenth 
orchestra.  He  was  pretty  accurately  acquainted 
with  the  state  of  affairs,  and  he  it  was  who  origi- 
nally conceived  the  idea  of  inviting  Wagner  to  con- 
duct a  series  of  concerts  upon  a  festival  scale  in  the 
British  capital.  He  broached  the  subject  during 
the  autumn  of  1876,  and  at  first,  I  believe,  Wagner 
was  utterly  unwilling  to  consider  the  proposition. 
Twice  already  had  the  Meister  been  in  England— 
once  in  the  summer  of  1839,^  and  again  in  1855, 
when  for  a  single  season  he  took  the  baton  laid 
down  by  Costa  as  conductor  of  the  Philharaionic 
Society.  His  recollections  of  this  second  visit  can- 
not have  been  wholly  pleasant;  but  Wilhelmj 
showed  him  how  completely  the  aspect  of  things 
had  changed,  and  argued  that  there  was  now  an 
immense  curiosity  to  see  him  as  well  as  hear  more 
of  his  music.  Besides,  six  concerts  at  the  Albert 
Hall  would  assuredly  result  in  a  net  profit  of  as 
many  thousand  pounds.  The  temptation  was  too 
strong  to  be  resisted;  Wagner  ultimately  decided 
to  go. 

Wilhelmj,  delighted  at  having  secured  the  mas- 
ter's promise,  at  once  set  about  finding  a  respon- 

*  He  then  stayed  only  eight  days,  and  lodged,  together  with 
his  wife,  at  a  boarding-house  (since  pulled  down)  in  Compton 
Street,  Soho.  This  short  visit  Wagner  made  en  route  for  Paris, 
but  he  also  stopped  at  Boulogne,  where  he  made  the  acquaintance 
of  Meyerbeer  and  obtained  from  him  the  introductions  which 
gave  rise  to  Heine's  oft-quoted  remark:  ''Do  you  know  what 
makes  me  suspicious  of  this  young  man?  It  is  that  Meyerbeer 
recommends  him. ' '

sible  manager  who  would  undertake  the  arrange- 
ments and  advance  the  necessary  capital  for  the 
preliminary  outlay.  Herein  lay  the  initial  mistake. 
Instead  of  employing  some  well-known  concert 
agent,  the  violinist  placed  the  whole  business  in 
the  hands  of  a  very  respectable  but  inexperienced 
firm,  whose  place  of  business  was  at  the  Hengler 
Circus  building  in  Argyll  Street.  I  will  not  deny 
that  this  firm  worked  hard  and  did  their  best.  But 
unfortunately  both  they  and  Herr  Wilhelmj  were 
far  too  lavish  in  their  expenditure.  They  engaged 
Materna  and  the  pick  of  the  Bayreuth  artists  at  big 
prices.  The  orchestra,  with  Wilhelmj  as  leader, 
was  nearly  two  hundred  strong.  The  disburse- 
ments for  advertising,  printing,  programmes,  etc., 
were  enormous,  and  everything  was  done  in  the 
costliest  fashion.  All  this  might  have  been  justified 
had  the  attendance  at  the  festival  reached  the  ex- 
pected level.  But  unluckily  the  prices  charged  for 
seats  were  prohibitive,  and  the  public  refused  to 
come  in  anything  like  the  necessary  numbers. 

On  the  night  after  Wagner's  arrival  in  London 
a  dinner  was  given  in  his  honor  by  his  managers 
at  their  show-rooms  in  Argyll  Street.  Only  recog- 
nized friends  of  the  *^ cause''  were  invited,  and  I 
had  the  honor  of  being  among  the  number.  Toasts 
were  given  and  responded  to,  and  Wagner  made 
one  of  the  characteristic  little  speeches  for  which  he 
was  famous.  Late  in  the  evening  I  was  introduced 
to  him.  He  asked  me  to  sit  beside  him  a  few  min- 
utes, and  began  hj  demanding  in  German  my  age.

*^  Nearly  twenty- one, '  ^  I  replied. 

**Why,  you  were  not  born  when  I  was  last  here. 
I  suppose  you  know,  though,  that  your  critics  did 
not  display  any  great  affection  for  me  then.  Do 
you  think  they  are  better  inclined  toward  me  now  ? ' ' 

I  answered  that  I  fancied  he  would  perceive  an 
improved  attitude  all  round. 

*^I  hope  so,"  said  Wagner.  **I  know  that  some 
of  my  best  and  truest  friends  live  in  London,  and, 
sooner  or  later,  their  influence  must  begin  to  tell." 

I  ventured  to  remark  that  I  thought  his  music  in 
the  long  run  would  suffice  to  accomplish  the  desired 
conversion.  He  turned  his  keen  glance  toward  me 
for  a  moment,  and  paused,  as  though  wishing  to 
read  me  through.  The  inspection  appeared  to  be 
satisfactory ;  for  a  smile  suffused  his  features  as  he 
replied : 

^^Yes;  but  here  they  still  call  it  *  music  of  the 
future,'  and  in  this  land  of  oratorio  who  knows 
how  long  they  will  take  to  get  rid  of  their  preju- 
dices, unless  the  agitators  keep  stirring  them  up? 
Well,  we  shall  see  what  happens  next  week." 

Then  he  turned  to  speak  to  Wilhelmj,  and  the 
brief  chat  was  at  an  end.  I  sat  still,  however,  a 
minute  or  two  longer,  and  watched  with  intense 
interest  the  play  of  facial  expression,  the  eloquent 
curves  of  the  mouth,  the  humorous  light  in  the 
eyes,  the  quiet,  subtle  laugh,  while  he  addressed  in 
turn  the  various  friends  gathered  around  him. 
That  evening  Wagner  was  thoroughly  happy.  He 
felt  himself  in  a  congenial  atmosphere,  content  with

the  present,  and  hopeful— nay,  sanguine— of  the 
morrow.  I  was  glad  to  have  seen  him  in  that  beatific 
mood,  and  not  a  little  proud  to  have  spoken  with 
him.  What  a  pity  that  he  was  not  to  bid  a  final 
farewell  to  England  in  an  equally  satisfied  frame 
of  mind! 

The  final  rehearsal  for  the  opening  concert  of 
the  festival  took  place  at  the  Albert  Hall  on  May 
5.  Wagner  had  himself  chosen  the  programmes. 
He  was  to  conduct  each  first  part,  consisting  of 
selections  from  all  his  operas,  from  ^'Rienzi'^  to 
'^Tristan";  while  Hans  Richter,  who  now  made 
his  first  appearance  in  England,  was  to  direct  the 
excerpts  from  ^'Der  Ring  des  Nibelungen"  that 
formed  each  second  part.  Most  of  the  preliminary 
work  had  been  done  under  Mr.  Dannreuther,  in 
whom  Wagner  reposed  great  confidence.  All  that 
remained  was  to  give  the  finishing  touches  and  for 
the  composer-conductor  to  accustom  himself  to  the 
vast  auditorium  and  the  huge  ere  scent- shaped 
phalanx  of  orchestral  players  spread  before  him. 

From  the  outset,  as  it  seemed  to  me,  he  failed  to 
place  himself  en  rapport  with  either.  The  abnor- 
mal conditions  appeared  completely  to  upset  him. 
In  a  word,  he  succumbed  there  and  then  to  a  severe 
attack  of  Albert  Hall  stage  fright— an  illness  fa- 
miliar to  nearly  every  artist  on  stepping  for  the 
first  time  upon  the  platform  of  that  gigantic  amphi- 
theatre.^   However,  after  a  glance  of  astonishment 

^  Another   bad    sufferer   that    day  was   Frau   Materna.      I   was 
speaking  to  her  in  the  artists'  room  just  before  she  went  on  to

round  the  empty  hall,  and  a  few  whispered  words 
to  Wilhelmj,  and  yet  a  few  more  to  Hans  Richter 
(who  was  posted  beside  the  conductor's  desk),  the 
great  man  raised  his  baton  and  gave  the  signal  for 
the  start.  The  inaugural  piece  was  the  ^'Kaiser- 
marsch,"  and  it  was  well  chosen  for  the  purpose. 
Its  pompous  and  sonorous  strains,  proceeding  with 
stately  rhythmical  movement  throughout,  were 
perfectly  calculated  to  show  off  the  imposing  vol- 
ume of  the  big  orchestra  in  such  a  building  as  that. 
It  gave  no  trouble,  and  the  effect  was  superb.  But, 
unluckily,  instead  of  imbuing  Wagner  with  a  little 
confidence,  this  preludial  essay  left  him  more 
palpably  nervous  than  before. 

The  second  piece  on  the  list  was  the  overture  to 
the  ^'Fliegende  Hollander.''  Here,  I  confess,  I 
looked  for  something  exceptional.  I  had  always  un- 
derstood that  Wagner  was  a  fine  conductor,  at  least 
of  works  with  which  he  was  in  true  sympathy,  and 
I  expected  his  reading  of  the  '^ Dutchman"  over- 
ture to  be  in  the  nature  of  a  revelation.  Imagine, 
then,  my  disappointment  and  sorrow  when  it  re- 
sulted in  a  complete  breakdown!  Twice— nay, 
thrice— did  he  make  a  fresh  start,  while  Mr.  Dann- 
reuther  and  Mr.  Deichmann  (the  faithful  leader  of 
the  second  violins)  took  it  by  turns  to  translate  his 

rehearse,  and  she  was  positively  trembling  with  excitement  and 
fear  ''lest  she  should  be  unable  to  make  herself  heard  in  such  a 
huge  place. ' '  I  begged  her  to  sing  quite  in  her  usual  manner, 
and,  above  all  things,  not  to  ''force"  her  voice.  She  afterward 
thanked  me  and  said  that  she  had  been  simply  amazed  at  the 
ease  with  which  she  could  sing  in  the  hall.

complaints  and  instructions  to  the  orchestra.  But 
it  was  of  no  avail.  He  utterly  failed  either  to  in- 
dicate or  to  obtain  what  he  wanted,  and  at  last,  in 
sheer  desj^air,  he  threw  down  his  stick  and  re- 
quested Richter  to  do  the  work  for  him.  Well  do 
I  remember  the  sharp  round  of  applause  with  which 
the  band  greeted  the  Viennese  conductor  as  he 
mounted  the  rostrum.  It  was  thoughtless— unkind, 
if  you  will ;  for  it  must  have  smote  with  unpleasant 
sound  upon  the  ears  of  the  sensitive  composer. 
But  the  overture  went  without  a  hitch.  It  was 
played  as  I  had  never  heard  it  played  before. 

After  this  Wagner  decided  that  he  would  con- 
duct only  one  or  two  pieces  at  each  concert,  leaving 
all  the  rest  to  Eichter.  But  would  the  public  be 
satisfied!  They  were  paying  to  see  Wagner  as 
well  as  to  hear  his  music.  The  matter  was  dis- 
cussed, and  it  was  suggested,  as  a  compromise,  that 
when  he  was  not  conducting  he  should  sit  upon  the 
platform  in  an  arm-chair  facing  the  audience.  This 
course  was  actually  adopted.  At  each  of  the  six 
concerts  comprising  the  festival  scheme,  after  he 
had  conducted  the  opening  piece  and  acknowledged 
a  magnificent  reception,  he  sat  down  in  his  arm- 
chair and  gazed  at  the  assemblage  before  him  with 
a  sphinx-like  expression  of  countenance  that  I  shall 
never  forget.  He  must  have  felt  as  though  he  were 
being  exhibited,  like  some  strange,  interesting  ani- 
mal, for  all  the  world  to  stare  at ;  and  his  reflections 
doubtless  were  as  unenviable  as  his  situation. 

Obviously  it  would  have  been  unfair  to  estimate 


n 


Musical  Life  in  London 


Wagner's  ability  as  a  conductor  by  what  be  did  at 
these  concerts.  Yet  I  fear  some  of  his  critics  were 
not  wholly  considerate  in  that  respect,  for  the  com- 
ments uttered  in  several  quarters  showed  plainly 
that  no  allowances  had  been  made.  I  quite  agree 
with  Mr.  Dannreuther,  therefore,  when  he  says  that 
*'at  the  Albert  Hall,  Wagner  did  not  do  himself 
justice.  His  strength  was  already  on  the  wane. 
The  rehearsals  fatigued  him,  and  he  was  frequently 
faint  in  the  evening.  His  memory  played  him 
tricks,  and  his  beat  was  nervous. ' ' 

To  make  matters  worse,  it  was  quickly  perceived 
that  the  festival  was  going  to  prove  a  financial 
failure.  Nothing  could  have  been  more  discour- 
aging than  the  sight  of  numerous  unoccupied  boxes 
and  stalls,  and  in  the  cheaper  parts  a  ^  ^  beggarly  ar- 
ray of  empty  benches."  It  was  determined,  just 
in  time,  that  a  couple  of  extra  concerts  should  be 
given  at  reduced  prices,  the  artists  and  executants 
accepting  half-salary,  while  all  the  ^^ plums''  of 
the  festival  were  crowded  into  the  two  programmes. 
This  move  retrieved  the  fortunes  of  the  venture. 
A  heavy  loss  was  converted  into  a  profit  of  £700, 
which  sum  was  duly  handed  over  to  Wagner  for  his 
Bayreuth  fund.  But  it  was  a  miserable  result  in 
comparison  with  the  expected  thousands,  and,  not- 
withstanding the  polite  letters  of  thanks  which  he 
afterward  wrote  to  his  English  friends,  I  have 
more  than  a  vague  suspicion  that  he  always  looked 
back  upon  this  eventful  visit  with  mingled  feelings 
of  annoyance  and  regret.

A  rare  galaxy  of  talent— The  Richter  Concerts. 

IN  course  of  the  almost  daily  companionsliip 
which,  between  1874  and  1880,  it  was  my  privi- 
lege to  enjoy  with  Signor  Garcia,  we  used,  now  and 
then,  to  attend  together  some  important  musical 
function.  Two  of  these  occasions  dwell  in  my 
memory  with  peculiar  vividness. 

Early  in  1877,  the  University  of  Cambridge  de- 
cided to  confer  the  degree  of  ^^Mus.  Doc," 
honoris  causa,  upon  two  of  the  world's  greatest 
musicians,  Johannes  Brahms  and  Joseph  Joachim. 
The  distinguished  violinist  readily  accepted  this 
invitation,  together  with  the  customary  conditions 
therein  involved,— namely,  to  attend  in  person  to 
receive  the  degree,  and  to  furnish  some  new  com- 
position as  an  ^^ exercise''  to  be  performed  at  the 
university  on  the  day  of  the  ceremony.  To  Brahms 
the  intended  compliment  involved  a  good  deal  more. 
It  meant  a  long  journey  to  a  country  that  he  had 
never  visited,  and,  as  he  afterward  bluntly  ad- 

79 


Thirty  Years  of 


mitted,  had  never  had  the  smallest  desire  to  visit. 
He  looked  upon  England  as  probably  the  least 
musical  of  European  countries,  and  set  no  store 
whatever  upon  honorary  degrees,  even  when  be- 
stowed by  such  an  ancient  university  as  Cam- 
bridge.^ He  therefore  declined  the  invitation  to 
be  present,  but  expressed  his  willingness  to  receive 
the  degree  if  it  could  be  conferred  in  absentia;  and 
he  offered  as  his  doctor's  ^'exercise''  the  new 
symphony  in  C  minor.  No.  1,  which  had  been  per- 
formed for  the  first  time  in  the  previous  November 
at  Karlsruhe.  After  some  consideration  the  offer 
was  accepted,  and  March  8, 1877,  was  the  day  fixed 
for  the  ceremony  to  take  place  at  Cambridge. 

The  especial  significance  of  this  event,  apart 
from  its  immediate  interest,  lies  in  the  important 
bearing  that  it  had  upon  the  wider  understanding 
and  appreciation  of  Brahms 's  music  in  Great 
Britain.  Down  to  this  time  Johannes  Brahms  had 
been  known  to  the  general  mass  of  amateurs  as  a 
writer  of  chamber  music ;  and  by  all  but  the  culti- 
vated few  his  compositions  were  voted  abstruse 
and  dull,  if  undeniably  clever.  Indeed,  even  his 
own  countrymen  for  the  most  part  had  failed  as 
yet  to  grasp  the  true  tenor  and  might  of  his  genius. 
Writing  in  that  same  year,  one  of  his  biographers, 
Herr  A.  Maczewski,  said  of  Brahms  that  the  ^'in- 
dividual character  of  his  ideas  and  the  intellectual 

^  Brahlns  was  nevertheless  genuinely  pleased  when,  ten  years 
later,  the  Emperor  William  appointed  him  a  Knight  of  the 
Order   ''pour  le   merite"   for   Arts   and   Sciences.

qualities  of  his  nature  certainly  stand  in  the  way 
of  his  overcoming  opposition  and  gaining  the 
sympathies  of  the  large  mass  of  the  musical  public. 
.  .  .  With  him  beauty  seems  to  hold  a  place  sub- 
ordinate to  expression,  and  a  certain  harshness  is 
in  consequence  occasionally  met  with  in  his  har- 
mony which  must  hinder  the  popularity  of  his 
works"  (Grove's  Dictionary,  Vol.  I,  p.  270). 

If  the  ^'Deutsches  Requiem"  opened  the  eyes  of 
German  music-lovers,  it  was  assuredly  the  sym- 
phony in  C  minor  that  awakened  English  ears  to 
a  just  and  worthy  estimate  of  the  gifts  of  the 
Hamburg  composer.  The  impression  created  at 
Cambridge  was  to  spread  within  a  few  years  over 
the  entire  kingdom.  ^'What  a  masterpiece  for  a 
first  symphony!"  exclaimed  Garcia,  as  we  listened 
to  the  rehearsal  by  the  Cambridge  University  Mu- 
sical Society  under  Villiers  Stanford.  What  a 
masterpiece  indeed!  And  what  patience  for  such 
a  musician  to  have  waited  before  writing  it  until 
he  was  forty-three  years  old  and  could  inscribe 
' '  Op.  68 ' '  upon  the  score  of  his  symphony  No.  1 ! 
Of  course  we  all  smiled  when  the  opening  theme 
of  the  finale  suggested  that  unmistakable  resem- 
blance to  the  corresponding  subject  in  the  last 
movement  of  Beethoven 's  ^ '  Ninth, ' '  which  Brahms 
always  protested  he  could  not  perceive.  But  the 
trifling  similarity  mattered  naught  unless  to  lend 
the  new  work  a  greater  charm;  for  Brahms  was 
nothing  if  not  original,  and  the  soul  of  honesty 
itself.     His  beautiful  ' '  Schicksalslied "  was  also 


83 


Thirty  Years  of 


performed  at  this  concert,  and  it  helped  to  confirm 
the  deep  impression  created  by  the  symphony. 
Alas,  that  he  should  not  have  been  there  himself ! 

But  the  personal  tribute  paid  that  day  to  his  be- 
loved friend,  Joseph  Joachim,  was  in  every  way 
remarkable.  Well-known  musicians  came  from  dis- 
tant parts  of  the  country  to  be  present.  It  was  to 
do  honor  to  the  illustrious  violinist  whom  he  had 
known  long  years  that  my  own  venerable  master 
made  the  journey  from  the  metropolis— to  witness 
the  bestowal  upon  him  of  a  distinction  similar  to 
that  which  had  already  been  conferred  upon  him- 
self as  the  inventor  of  the  laryngoscope.  And 
never  has  the  Public  Orator  of  Cambridge  Univer- 
sity employed  terms  more  felicitous  or  more  eulo- 
gistic than  he  contrived  to  put  into  his  Latin  speech 
in  this  instance.  Dr.  Joachim's  ^^ exercise''  con- 
sisted of  his  fine  overture  in  memory  of  the  cele- 
brated poet  Heinrich  von  Kleist,  which  was  played 
under  his  own  direction.  He  also  gave  a  superb 
performance  of  the  Beethoven  violin  concerto,  of 
which  work  he  is,  by  common  consent,  admitted  to 
be  the  greatest  of  all  interpreters. 

In  the  summer  of  the  following  year— to  be  pre- 
cise, June  22,  1878— Signor  Garcia  accompanied 
me  to  the  first  performance  in  England  of  Bizet's 
'^Carmen."  It  was  not  an  easy  thing  at  that  time 
to  persuade  him  to  go  to  the  Opera.  The  singing 
that  he  heard  did  not,  as  a  rule,  please  him,  and 
he  was  content  to  dwell  undisturbed  with  the  mem- 
ories of  a  glorious  past.    An  opera  on  a  Spanish 

84 


Musical  Life  in  London 


subject,  however,  was  something  of  an  attraction, 
especially  if  it  touched  upon  bull-fighting,  which 
would  appear  to  stir  the  blood  of  every  Spaniard 
at  any  and  every  period  of  life.  Moreover,  I  fancy 
he  was  acquainted  with  Prosper  Merimee's  story, 
and  had  heard  some  accounts  of  Bizet's  music.  I 
reminded  him  that  *' Carmen '^  had  been  next  door 
to  a  failure  at  the  Opera-Comique  three  years  pre- 
vious. ^'I  know,''  he  replied,  ^^and  the  poor  com- 
poser died  of  a  broken  heart  three  months  later. 
That  is  the  way  France  generally  treats  rising 
talent,  including  her  own.  I  place  little  value  upon 
the  opinion  of  Paris  regarding  new  works." 

The  only  bit  of  ^^ Carmen"  then  known  in  Lon- 
don was  the  ''Habanera,"  which  had  been  sung 
for  a  year  or  so  with  notable  success  by  that  gifted 
artist,  Mme.  Trebelli.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  though, 
the  music  of  this  air  had  been  in  her  possession  for 
a  long  time ;  hence  I  am  inclined  to  believe  either 
that  it  is  a  genuine  Spanish  tune  which  Bizet 
adapted  and  arranged,  or  else  that  it  was  written 
by  him  some  time  before  the  opera.  The  ' '  Chanson 
du  Toreador,"  which  eventually  helped  so  much 
to  render  ' '  Carmen ' '  popular  in  every  country,  had 
not  yet  been  heard  in  England.  Indeed,  Bizet 
was  practically  an  unknown  composer,  while  the 
fact  of  his  being  a  Frenchman  was,  in  the  opinion 
of  a  Spaniard,  distinctly  against  him  as  an  indica- 
tion of  ability  to  write  or  imitate  Spanish  music.^ 

^The  general  feeling  on  this  subject  in  Spain  amounts  almost 
to    a    national    prejudice.      To    this    day    <' Carmen,"    although

1  recollect  that  Signor  Garcia  was  in  a  very  critical 
mood,  albeit  prepared,  with  his  customary  impar- 
tiality, to  allow  the  full  meed  of  praise  where  praise 
was  due. 

The  opera  was  well  cast  and  well  staged.  Mr. 
Mapleson  had  seen  it  at  the  Brussels  Monnaie  dur- 
ing the  preceding  winter,  and  it  was  on  the  strength 
of  the  success  won  there,  alike  by  the  work  and  by 
the  exponent  of  the  title-role,  that  he  had  deter- 
mined to  transfer  both  to  the  boards  of  Her  Maj- 
esty's. The  Carmen  in  question  was  no  other  than 
Miss  Minnie  Hauk,  the  young  American  prima 
donna  who  had  sung  at  Covent  Garden  one  autumn 
season  when  quite  a  girl,  but  had  not  been  heard 
again  in  London  until  the  present  year,  when  she 
made  her  rentree  as  Violetta  in  ''La  Traviata.^' 
Her  Carmen  was  already  famous.  It  was  consid- 
ered as  good  dramatically  as  that  of  Mme.  Galli- 
Marie,^  and  in  a  vocal  sense  far  superior.  Garcia 
was  simply  delighted  with  the  artistic  finish,  the  vi- 
vacity and  charm,  of  her  performance.  He  thought 
she  had  caught  with  marvelous  instinct  and  truth 
the  peculiarities  of  the  Spanish  type,  the  coquettish 
manners  and  the  defiant  devilry  of  the  wayward 

greatly  liked  and  frequently  performed,  is  less  intensely  popu- 
lar in  Spain  than  in  other  countries — certainly  less  so  than  the 
work  of  purely  Spanish  composers  such  as  Albeniz  and  Breton. 
At  the  same  time,  it  takes  a  born  Spaniard  to  recognize  the  ex- 
tremely delicate  nuances  that  distinguish  the  real  native  article 
from  the  clever  foreign  imitation. 

^  This  artist  created  the  character  in  Paris.  She  also  appeared 
in  it  at  Her  Majesty's,  with  a  French  company,  during  the  au- 
tumn of  1886.

gipsy.  He  admired  immensely  the  individuality 
of  an  assumption  which,  if  it  was  subsequently  fol- 
lowed upon  more  or  less  identical  lines  by  many 
excellent  artists,  has  been  equaled  only  by  three— I 
mean  Pauline  Lucca,  Emma  Calve,  and  Zelie  de 
Lussan. 

Nor  since  have  I  heard  a  sweeter,  gentler,  or  more 
persuasive  Michaela  than  Alwina  Valleria  (nee 
Miss  Lohmann,  of  Baltimore),  another  American 
soprano  who  was  just  beginning  to  win  her  way 
into  the  affections  of  the  English  public.  The 
Escamillo— and  an  altogether  ideal  one— was  that 
remarkably  fine  barytone,  Del  Puente,  who  in  after 
years  settled  down  in  New  York  as  a  singer  and 
teacher ;  while  Campanini  sang  and  acted  with  su- 
perb dramatic  power  as  Don  Jose.  It  was  a  strong 
cast,  therefore,  and  Sir  Michael  Costa  conducted 
the  opera  with  exemplary  care,  even  if  he  failed  to 
bring  into  full  relief  the  manifold  beauties  and  ex- 
quisitely delicate  touches  of  Bizet's  score.  But 
Signor  Garcia  was  simply  enthusiastic,  and  he  la- 
bored as  effectively  as  any  individual  in  the  whole 
theatre  to  bring  about  the  triumphant  reception 
that  greeted  ^'Carmen''  that  night.  The  subject 
and  its  treatment  alike  appealed  to  him ;  he  thought 
the  story  intensely  dramatic;  the  degree  of  real 
Spanish  color  in  the  music  quite  astonished  him. 
He  had  not  imagined  that  any  Spanish  opera  after 
^^Don  Giovanni"  and  ^'H  Barbiere"  could  please 
him  so  much. 

I  may  be  excused  for  thus  dwelling  at  length 

89 


Thirty  Years  of 


upon  the  premiere  of  ^'Carmen''  in  England,  be- 
cause from  that  moment  dates  the  real  popularity 
of  the  opera  in  Europe— a  popularity,  by  the  way, 
that  has  been  exceeded  by  one  opera  only,  Gounod 's 
'^ Faust.''  It  was  further  noteworthy  in  that  it 
first  brought  into  prominence  the  two  American- 
born  singers— Minnie  Hauk  and  Alwina  Valleria— 
who  were  to  be  most  closely  identified  with  the 
rapid  upward  progress  of  the  Carl  Rosa  opera  en- 
terprise from  1880  to  1886. 

I  made  the  acquaintance  of  Minnie  Hauk  in  Lon- 
don during  the  season  just  referred  to.  A  year  or 
so  later  she  married  a  well-known  traveler  and 
writer.  Baron  Ernst  von  Hesse- Wartegg.  It  was 
in  1880  that  she  joined  the  Carl  Rosa  troupe,  and 
appeared  at  Her  Majesty's  in  ^ ^ Lohengrin, "

an  admirable  Katharine  in  Goetz  's  ^  ^  Taming  of  the 
Shrew."  In  Wagner's  opera  she  was  ably  sup- 
ported by  Herr  Anton  Schott;  in  ^^Mignon,"  by 
that  admirable  singer,  Joseph  Maas,  the  best  Eng- 
lish stage  tenor  since  Sims  Reeves.  In  fact,  these 
were  all  representations  of  the  rarest  excellence; 
and  they  all  threw  into  a  strong  light  the  singular 
versatility  of  Minnie  Hauk,  who  could  bring  out 
the  poetry  of  Elsa  or  the  deep  passion  of  Aida  as 
completely  as  she  could  the  diablerie  of  Carmen  or 
the  petulant  tempers  of  Mignon  and  Katharine}

Musical  Life  in  London 


Besides  being  versatile  in  her  art  (she  could 
boast  a  repertory  of  unusual  dimensions),  Minnie 
Hauk  was  an  accomplished  musician,  a  facile  lin- 
guist, a  kindly  hostess,  and  the  most  interesting 
of  correspondents.  More  than  one  agreeable  sum- 
mer holiday  did  I  spend  with  Mme.  de  Wartegg 
and  her  mother  and  husband  at  their  Biningen- 
Schlossli  near  Basel,  in  Switzerland.  For  the  weary 
worker  it  was  an  ideal  spot  in  which  to  repose  and 
recuperate;  likewise  for  the  busy  prima  donna  to 
study  in  peace  and  find  inspiration  for  new  parts. 
She  wrote  me  once  from  Biningen : 

I  am  studying  very  diligently  a  new  role— or,  rather, 
an  old  one  that  I  have  never  yet  essayed— that  is,  Frau 
Fluth  (Mistress  Ford)  in  ''The  Merry  Wives  of  Wind- 
sor." I  have  also  to  freshen  up  for  my  coming  season 
in  Berlin  my  recollection  of  the  ''Domino  Noir,"  and 
Kose  Friquet  in  "Les  Dragons  de  Villars,"  besides  other 
operas  put  aside  for  several  years.  How  am  I  to  do  all 
this  if  I  cannot  manage  to  stay  at  home  for  once  in  the 
early  summer?  Since  we  have  had  the  Schlossli  I  have 
never  been  here  in  May  or  June,  and  it  has  been  a  de- 
light; for  I  have  never  seen  the  meadows  so  green  and 
beautiful,  or  heard  such  wonderful  warbling  all  day 
long  as  from  the  birds  in  the  park  here.  I  am  trying  to 
learn  from  them;  and  I  feel  more  and  more  convinced 
that  Wagner,  Bizet,  and  many  other  composers  have  been 
inspired  with  their  "motives"  by  listening  to  the  birds. 

joins  the  one  at  which  Wagner  resided  from  1866  until  1872,  and 
where  he  completed  ''Die  Meistersinger "  and  wrote  nearly  the 
whole  of  the  latter  half  of  the  ' '  Nibelungenring. "

Thirty  Years  of 


In  course  of  her  numerous  tours  in  different  parts 
of  the  world  (including  Japan,  where  she  was 
unluckily  ''caught"  in  an  earthquake  and  had  a 
most  providential  escape  from  destruction),  Mme. 
Minnie  Hauk  used  to  write  me  regular  accounts  of 
her  artistic  doings  and  her  varied  experiences. 
From  these  I  have  only  space  to  quote  the  follow- 
ing letter,  which  has  a  special  interest  on  account 
of  its  reference  to  the  scene  of  her  greatest  operatic 
triumph : 

Seville,  January  25,  1892. 
My  dear  Mr.  Klein  : 

What  a  world  of  antique  novelty  I  have  gone  through 
within  the  last  four  weeks !  I  have  lived,  as  it  were,  in 
the  atmosphere  of  the  Scriptures,  and  have  seen  sights 
most  marvelous.  We  left  Tangiers  four  days  ago,  and 
I  can  hardly  realize  that  I  have  seen  all  this  antiquated 
world  peopled  as  of  yore— walking,  breathing— in  fact, 
living  life  as  it  was  lived  nearly  two  thousand  years  ago ! 

And  now  what  a  change— Seville!  I  am  gratified  to 
find  the  cigarette  girls  just  as  gay  and  bright— with  flash- 
ing eyes  and  rose  in  hair — as  I  expected.  Not  as  pretty, 
perhaps ;  but  at  every  turn  one  can  imagine  a  Carmen- 
cita  (and  what  a  common  name  Carmen  is  here,  to  be 
sure !) .  The  city  is  a  dead  one,  so  to  speak ;  but  at  night 
it  livens  up,  and  at  the  theatres  the  castagnette-playing, 
the  dancing,  and  the  singing  have  the  true  old  Spanish 
ring.  There  is  something  very  fascinating  about  the  life 
here,  and  I  only  regret  I  cannot  see  it  in  the  spring-tide. 
To-morrow  we  leave  for  the  Alhambra,  stopping  on  the 
way  at  Cordova  to  see  the  great  Mosque. 

I  finished  my  American  season  of  four  months  (with 
Mr.  Abbey)  at  Boston,  and  sang  in  all  fifty-three  times

Musical  Life  in  London 


in  three  operas — ''Lohengrin,"  "Carmen,"  and  ''Caval- 
leria  Rusticana."  We  had  crowded  houses  all  the  time. 
It  was  a  most  interesting  season,  but  rather  fatiguing. 
I  think  I  have  deserved  my  holiday,  and  shall  rest  two 
months  before  fulfilling  my  engagements  at  Nice,  etc. 
With  united  best  regards. 

Ever  yours  faithfully, 

Minnie  Hauk-De  Wartegg. 

In  addition  to  the  events  already  recorded,  there 
belong  to  the  years  1877  and  1879  some  experiences 
which,  for  me  at  least,  will  ever  be  replete  with 
interest.  In  the  earlier  year  I  heard  for  the  first 
time  Anton  Rubinstein  and  Pablo  Sarasate,  and 
witnessed  the  debuts  of  Etelka  Grerster  and  Ga- 
yarre.  With  the  exception  of  a  brief  visit  in  1876, 
Rubinstein  had  not  been  in  London  for  seven  or 
eight  years.  I  now  heard  him  at  the  Philharmonic, 
at  the  Crystal  Palace  (where  I  saw  him  conduct— 
with  all  the  ^' extra"  movements  included— his 
grandiose  but  interminable  ^^ Ocean''  symphony), 
and  at  some  recitals  at  St.  James's  Hall.  He  was 
then  in  his  forty-eighth  year,  and  had  attained  the 
fullest  measure  of  his  extraordinary  powers. 

Universally  acknowledged  to  be  the  greatest 
pianist  of  his  time,  the  public  simply  worshiped 
Rubinstein  as  an  artist  and  gathered  in  crowds 
whenever  he  appeared.  His  technique  bordered 
upon  the  miraculous ;  his  interpretative  gifts  were 
worthy  of  a  musician  who  was  himself  no  mean 
creative  genius ;  his  style,  the  reflex,  as  it  were,  of 
his  massive  leonine  aspect,  was  at  once  the  most 


Thirty  Years  of 


noble  and  most  original  of  any  pianist  I  have  ever 
listened  to.  The  fire  and  passion  in  his  soul  poured 
out  at  his  fingers '  ends ;  and  yet  his  touch  could  be 
as  gentle  and  caressing  as  a  woman's.  In  private 
life  his  chief  amusement  was  a  game  of  whist.  He 
loved  the  game  and  played  it  well— as  I  discovered 
for  myself  one  evening  when  I  visited  him  at  the 
old  Hotel  Dieudonne,  in  St.  James 's.  Quite  a  num- 
ber of  friends  dropped  in  after  dinner,  but  Rubin- 
stein simply  ignored  their  presence  until  he  had 
finished  his  rubber.  Then  he  went  round  and 
warmly  welcomed  them.  After  a  time  he  sat  down 
to  the  piano,  and  never  left  it  till  midnight,  giving 
us  a  treat  that  will  never  fade  from  my  memory 
as  long  as  I  live.^ 

An  artist  of  entirely  different  calibre,  yet  barely 
less  serious  in  his  aims  and  certainly  not  less  re- 
markable for  the  flawless  perfection  of  his  technical 
gifts,  Senor  Sarasate  had  just  turned  thirty  when 
he  made  his  first  appearance  before  a  London  au- 
dience. Three  years  later  (October  13,  1877)  his 
rendering  of  Mendelssohn's  violin  concerto  at  the 
Crystal  Palace  fairly  took  the  town  by  storm,  and 
he  repeated  his  triumph  at  the  Philharmonic  in  the 
following  spring.    After  1885  he  became  an  almost

^  Eubinstein  visited  London  again  in  1881,  when  his  opera 
The  Demon"  was  produced  at  Covent  Garden,  and  yet  once 
more  (for  the  last  time)  in  1886,  when  he  gave  his  famous  series 
of  Histopieal  Recitals  at  St.  James 's  Hall.  As  an  operatic  com- 
poser he  never  won  success  in  England,  but  his  chamber  music 
and  songs  are  among  the  best-known  and  most  popular  in  the 
modern  repertory.

annual  visitor  to  England,  and  he  also  toured  sev- 
eral years  with  unvarying  success  in  the  United 
States. 

It  was  quite  late  in  the  season  of  1877  when 
Etelka  Gerster  made  her  debut  at  Her  Majesty's 
as  Amhia  in  ''La  Sonnambula. ' '  She  was  one  of 
Mr.  Mapleson's  surprises.  Beyond  a  very  high 
register,  no  one  expected  anything  extraordinary 
from  the  newcomer.  Imagine,  therefore,  the  de- 
light of  habitues  when  they  heard  for  the  first  time 
a  voice  of  exquisitely  musical  quality  and  bird-like 
tone,  trained  to  execute  the  most  difficult  fiorituri 
and  cadenzas  with  the  utmost  care,  and  capable  of 
running  up  comfortably  to  the  giddy  height  of  an 
F  in  alt.  Moreover,  the  Hungarian  soprano  proved 
to  be  a  good  actress  and  a  conscientious  artist,  so 
that  her  success  was  never  for  a  moment  in  doubt. 
In  the  following  season  she  accompanied  Mr.  Ma- 
pleson  to  America,  and  there  began  a  long  series  of 
triumphs  too  familiar  to  need  recalling. 

Gayarre  was  not  a  great  tenor  in  the  highest 
sense  of  the  term.  Nevertheless,  he  possessed  vocal 
and  histrionic  attributes  of  a  very  distinguished 
kind,  and  chance  so  willed  it  that  he  was  destined 
to  "bridge  over''  to  a  large  extent  the  interval 
that  separated  the  final  retirement  of  Mario  from 
the  advent  (as  a  tenor)  of  Jean  de  Reszke.  By 
birth  a  Spaniard,  and  hailing  from  Pampeluna 
(the  town  in  which  Sarasate  was  born),  Giuliano 
Gayarre  had  studied  and  won  his  early  successes  in 
Italy.    He  was  an  exponent  of  the  new  quasi-nasal

school  of  tenor  singers,  which  already  had  Ta- 
magno  for  one  of  its  leading  protagonists.  To 
my  ears  his  production,  on  the  night  he  made  his 
debut  at  Covent  Garden  (April  7,  1877),  sounded 
strange  and  not  wholly  pleasant.  Still,  the  voice 
traveled  well,  and  he  sang  the  music  of  Gennaro 
with  so  much  tenderness,  so  much  charm,  allied  to 
genuine  dramatic  feeling  and  expression,  that  the 
crowded  house  forthwith  accorded  him  a  splendid 
reception. 

I  declined  to  join  in  the  general  chorus  of  '^An- 
other Mario!''  It  struck  me  as  little  less  than 
sacrilege  to  compare  with  the  divine  voice  of  that 
tenor  an  organ  which  could  occasionally  descend, 
or  ascend,  to  the  utterance  of  tones  that  quickly 
earned  the  name  of  the  ^'Gayarre  bleat."  My 
criticism  drew  forth  several  rejoinders,  among 
them  the  following  from  the  Covent  Garden  con- 
ductor, Signor  Vianesi; 

Wait  to  hear  Gayarre  two  or  three  times.  You  will 
appreciate  him  as  a  true  artist.  If  I  can  correct  him  of 
too  much  dragging  (the  present  Italian  style),  he  will  be 
''Number  One"! 

In  a  measure,  this  prediction  proved  to  be  cor- 
rect. Of  the  operatic  tenors  heard  in  London  dur- 
ing the  succeeding  ten  years,  Gayarre  was  easily 
the  most  interesting.  Campanini  and  Fancelli  had 
finer  voices;  while  of  the  French  school  Nicolini 
and  Capoul  were  perhaps  more  attractive.    But  in 

lOO 


Musical  Life  in  London 


certain  operas  Gayarre  stood,  for  the  time  being, 
upon  an  eminence  by  himself.  As  Fernando  in  ^*La 
Favorita"  (his  best  part),  as  Jean  de  Leyden  in 
*^Le  Prophete,''  as  Enzo  in  Ponchielli's  ^^Gio- 
conda''  (his  original  creation),  and  as  Gennaro  in 
*^Lucrezia  Borgia,'^  he  was  for  a  long  time  posi- 
tively without  a  rival.  He  was  an  admirable  Lo- 
hengrin, and  was  the  first  singer  in  this  part  to 
vary  the  charm  of  the  love  music  in  the  bridal  duet 
by  the  judicious  employment  of  a  particularly 
lovely  mezza  voce.  He  was  also  excellent  in 
Glinka's  opera  ^'La  Vie  pour  le  Czar,''  which  he 
introduced  to  English  audiences  for  the  first  time 
at  Covent  Garden  in  1887. 

Eighteen  hundred  and  seventy-nine  was  the  busi- 
est musical  year  that  I  ever  experienced  in  London. 
We  had  opera  from  January  until  July,  and  again 
from  October  to  December.  Carl  Rosa  set  the  ball 
rolling  at  Her  Majesty's,  producing  ^^Rienzi"  for 
the  first  time  in  England,  and  ^  ^  Carmen, ' '  with  the 
piquant  Selina  Dolaro  in  the  title-role,  for  the  first 
time  in  the  vernacular.  Early  in  April,  Covent 
Garden  opened  under  the  sole  management  of 
Ernest  Gye,  whose  father  had  died  from  the  effects 
of  a  gun  accident  in  the  preceding  December.  Here 
the  peerless  Adelina  Patti  once  more  headed  the 
prime  donne;  Scalchi,  still  in  her  prime,  was  the 
principal  contralto ;  Gayarre,  Nicolini,  and  Capoul 
were  the  leading  tenors ;  and  to  such  barytones  as 
Graziani,  Cotogni,  and  Maurel  was  now  added  that 
superb  singer  Jean  Lassalle,  for  whom  was  pro-

duced  Massenet's  picturesque  but  unequal  opera, 
''Le  Roi  de  Lahore.'' 

When  Mr.  Mapleson  started  at  Her  Majesty's 
toward  the  end  of  April  it  was  with  one  of  the 
strongest  companies  that  he  had  ever  brought  to- 
gether. Christine  Nilsson— now  at  the  finest  period 
of  her  career— led  off  a  group  of  sopranos  that 
included  Minnie  Hauk,  Etelka  Gerster,  Clara 
Louise  Kellogg,^  Marie  Roze,  and,  last  but  not  least, 
Marie  Vanzandt,  a  youthful  debutante  whose  de- 
lightful singing  as  Zerlina  and  Amina  took  the 
London  world  completely  by  surprise.  Trebelli, 
unapproachable  as  ever  in  her  way,  stood  at  the 
head  of  the  contraltos;  Campanini  and  Fancelli 
were  the  best  tenors ;  and  among  the  barytones  and 
basses  were  Del  Puente,  Galassi,  Rota,  Behrens, 
and  Foli.  Some  of  the  artists  here  named  also  took 
part  in  the  autumn  season  which  Mr.  Mapleson 
gave  at  the  same  opera-house  in  the  Haymarket— 
now,  by  the  way,  the  site  of  Mr.  Beerbohm  Tree's 
theatre  and  the  Carlton  Hotel. 

Here  let  me  refer,  par  parenthese,  to  the  English 
debut  of  Edouard  de  Reszke.  That  event  properly 
belongs  to  1880,  when  he  appeared  for  the  first 
time  at  Covent  Garden  as  Indra  in  ^^Le  Roi  de 
Lahore."  He  was  then  about  twenty-six,  and  his 
noble  bass  voice  had  already  developed  in  full 

^  This  cTiarming  American  soprano  passed  an  exceerlingly  brief 
portion  of  her  operatic  career  in  England.  Her  talents,  however, 
were  very  warmly  appreciated,  and  in  her  favorite  roles  she  com- 
manded the  heartiest  admiration.

splendor  the  richness  of  timbre  and  amplitude  of 
volume  for  which  it  is  remarkable.  He  lacked  ex- 
perience, of  course ;  the  art  of  later  years  was  yet 
to  come.  Still,  the  sonority  and  grandeur  of  his 
tones  were  an  unalloyed  delight,  notably  in  such 
parts  as  Basilio,  St.  Bris,  Count  Rodolfo,  and 
Walter  ('^William  Tell"),  and  he  instantly  won 
hearty  favor.  He  returned  regularly  for  the  four 
succeeding  seasons. 

In  addition  to  the  concerts  of  the  old  Philhar- 
monic Society,  there  were  also  those  of  the  new 
Philharmonic,  which  in  1879,  on  the  resignation 
of  Dr.  Wylde,  came  under  the  exclusive  conductor- 
ship  of  Mr.  Wilhelm  Ganz,  and  survived  under  his 
direction  for  several  seasons  longer.  But  in  the 
concert  world  by  far  the  most  important  event  of 
1879  was  the  establishment  of  the  famous  Richter 
Concerts.  They  were  the  outcome  of  the  Wagner 
Festival  of  two  years  before,  and,  as  a  matter  of 
fact,  were  announced  for  this  preliminary  season 
as  a  series  of  three  ^  ^  Orchestral  Festival  Concerts. ' ' 
In  subsequent  years,  when  it  was  palpable  that 
Richter  had  become  a  power  in  the  land,  the  more 
ponderous  title  was  relinquished,  and  double  the 
number  of  concerts  were  given. 

The  credit  for  the  idea  of  starting  the  new  un- 
dertaking was  originally  due  to  Herr  Hermann 
Franke,  a  capable  violinist  (pupil  of  Joachim),  who 
had  been  residing  for  some  time  in  London,  and 
who  occasionally  gave  chamber  concerts  with  the 
aid  of  Scharwenka,  Robert  Hausmann,  and  other 


105 


Musical  Life  in  London 


artists.  Franke  had  been  very  useful  to  his  friend 
Wilhelmj  in  the  organization  of  the  Wagner 
Festival,  and  it  occurred  to  him  that  profit  could  be 
reaped  from  the  tremendous  impression  that  Kich- 
ter's  conducting  had  created  at  the  Albert  Hall. 
The  result  justified  his  expectation;  two  years 
later,  at  St.  James's  Hall,  Richter's  feat  of  con- 
ducting not  only  Wagnerian  fragments  but  Bee- 
thoven symphonies  entirely  from  memory  fur- 
nished an  absolute  novelty  and  created  quite  a  sen- 
sation. Thenceforth,  Hans  Richter's  popularity 
in  England  was  assured,  and  his  concerts,  given 
once,  and  sometimes  twice,  every  year,  became  a 
regular  feature  in  the  economy  of  London  musi- 
cal life.

I  MOW  pass  to  the  period  when  I  became  critic 
of  the  fine  old  London  weekly  known  as  the 
^'Sunday  Times."  This  welcome  rise  in  my  jour- 
nalistic status  came  about  by  a  stroke  of  pure  luck. 
Late  in  the  summer  of  1881  the  newspaper  changed 
hands,  and  the  new  editor,  anxious,  no  doubt,  to 
show  himself  a  man  of  action,  promptly  discharged 
every  member  of  the  literary  staff.  His  procedure 
almost  savored  of  heroism  (of  the  Quixotic  sort), 
for  he  was  totally  unsupplied  with  new  men  to 
take  the  place  of  those  whom  he  had  so  needlessly 
dismissed.  How,  I  should  like  to  know,  could  he 
have  hoped  to  find  a  more  trustworthy  dramatic 
critic  than  Joseph  Knight,^  or  a  more  brilliant 
yet  learned  writer  on  musical  subjects  than  the 
late  Desmond  L.  Ryan,  then  also  critic  of  the 
''Standard''? 

^Critic    for   many   years   of   the   London    "Globe'*   and    "Athe-

Thirty  Years  of 


However,  the  vacancy  existed,  and  when  Sep- 
tember arrived,  and  with  it  the  date  for  the  Nor- 
wich Festival,  the  ^^ Sunday  Times"  had  no  ap- 
pointed critic  to  represent  it  at  the  East  Anglian 
gathering.  In  this  dilemma  the  over-hasty  editor 
wrote  to  my  Norwich  uncle,  the  late  Philip  Soman, 
and  asked  him  to  recommend  some  one  who  could 
provide  an  article  upon  the  festival.  I  was  duly 
requested  to  essay  the  task.  A  few  weeks  later  I 
was  installed  as  the  regular  musical  critic  of  the 
''Sunday  Times,''  which  post  I  held  continuously 
until  I  resigned  it  in  November,  1901— a  period  of 
over  twenty  years. 

At  first  the  responsibilities  of  my  new  position 
weighed  somewhat  heavily  upon  me.  I  had  already 
won  my  spurs,  it  is  true ;  though  only  just  twenty- 
five,  I  felt  that  I  possessed  the  necessary  knowledge 
and  experience  for  my  work.  But  it  was  no  light 
matter  to  follow  a  clever  (and  then  still  living) 
writer  like  Desmond  Ryan,  who  in  turn  had  been 
preceded  by  the  present  doyen  of  English  musical 
critics,  Joseph  Bennett  (before  his  services  were 
wholly  required  by  the  ''Daily  Telegraph").  Ere 
long,  however,  I  was  to  receive  definite  assurance 
that  the  performance  of  my  labors  was  command- 
ing satisfaction.

decent  English,  avoids  libel  actions,  and  is  not 
guilty  of  exposing  a  lack  of  technical  knowledge 
of  his  subject,  he  has  little  to  fear  from  his  em- 
ployer. Strong  or  weak,  fearless  or  indifferent, 
honest  or  venal,  he  will  be  permitted  to  go  on  pub- 
lishing his  '^copy'^  from  one  year's  end  to  the 
other,  until  some  such  upheaval  occurs  as  that 
which  had  landed  me  in  my  present  position.  The 
artist,  the  teacher,  the  cultivated  amateur,  the  in- 
structed colleague— in  a  word,  those  who  do  not 
care  openly  to  find  fault,  even  when  they  dare— are 
alone  capable  of  judging  whether  or  not  the  critic 
has  done  his  work  well.  And  they  are  precisely 
the  people  whose  opinion  upon  the  question  is 
rarely,  if  ever,  asked. 

The  ^ '  Sunday  Times ' '  again  changed  hands,  for 
the  second  time  in  a  twelvemonth;  and,  instead 
of  being  dismissed,  I  was  requested  to  continue 
my  duties  with  ^^undiminished  energy  and  zeal.'' 
I  was  told  that  my  work  had  won  favorable  notice 
in  ^^ exalted"  quarters,  and  that  if  I  cared  to  re- 
linquish the  anonymous  first  person  plural  in  favor 
of  the  singular,  and  sign  articles  with  my  own 
initials,  I  was  at  liberty  to  do  so.  I  gladly  adopted 
this  course.  Journalistic  anonymity  is  advisable 
in  dealing  with  politics  and  the  general  run  of 
newspaper  topics.  But  where  art  is  concerned,  I 
prefer  to  conform  to  the  old  French  principle  that 
the  opinions  of  the  paper  should  be  put  forth  as 
those  of  an  individual. 

It  is  no  secret  that  the  purchasers  of  the  ' '  Sun-

day  Times''  in  this  instance  were  the  three  sons 
of  the  Duke  of  Cambridge— Captain  (now  Rear- 
Admiral)  FitzGeorge,  Colonel  Augustus  Fitz- 
George,  and  Colonel  George  FitzGeorge.  They  all 
took  a  deep  interest  in  the  then  varying  fortunes 
of  the  paper,  and  Colonel  George  FitzGeorge  per- 
sonally undertook  the  editorship,  in  addition  to 
the  even  more  onerous  duties  of  dramatic  critic.^ 
Frequently  the  three  brothers  would  come  down 
to  the  office  on  a  Saturday  evening  and  remain 
until  the  paper  was  ready  to  go  to  press.  The 
Colonel  had  the  true  instincts  of  a  journalist,  and 
would  write  a  bright,  chatty  article  every  week. 

The  Duke  of  Cambridge  himself,  too,  was  evi- 
dently interested.  I  met  his  Royal  Highness  more 
than  once  at  his  son's  house.  Well  do  I  recollect 
a  certain  New  Year's  eve,  and  the  zest  with  which 
he  joined  in  ^'Auld  Lang  Syne"  after  he  had  been 
sitting  by  the  piano  for  nearly  an  hour  listening 
to  my  songs.  In  his  genuine  love  of  music  he  fully 
shares  a  characteristic  that  distinguishes  the  whole 
of  the  royal  family.  Until  a  few  years  ago  the 
Duke  was  a  regular  attendant  at  the  opera.  He 
preferred  the  stalls  to  the  royal  box,  albeit,  if  the 
Princess  of  Wales  (Queen  Alexandra  now)  were 

*  In  this  branch,  however,  the  Colonel  soon  found  the  work  too 
heavy,  and  asked  me  to  assist  him,  as  far  as  I  could  do  so  without 
interfering  with  my  musical  duties.  These  contributions  I  signed 
with  the  iiom  de  guerre  of  ' '  Avant-scene, "  and  for  nearly  three 
years  (until  the  appointment  of  my  friend  Malcolm  Salaman,  a 
son  of  the  composer)  I  was  quite  as  closely  identified  with 
the  theatrical  as  with  the  musical  work  of  the  paper.

present,  he  would  never  fail  to  pay  her  Royal 
Highness  a  visit  and  enjoy  a  chat  between  the  acts. 
One  night,  at  a  performance  of  ^'Don  Giovanni,^* 
I  had  the  pleasure  of  sitting  next  the  duke.  His 
remarks  upon  the  artists  were  full  of  sensible 
criticism.  He  found  fault  where  censure  was  really 
deserved,  and  expressed  a  firm  conviction  that  the 
* '  Mozart  singers  ^ '  of  that  day,  with  the  exception 
of  Patti  and  one  or  two  others,  were  not  to  be  com- 
pared to  those  whom  he  had  heard  in  his  boyhood. 
At  this  time  the  venerable  Duchess  of  Cambridge, 
his  Royal  Highnesses  mother,  was  still  alive  and 
residing  at  St.  James's  Palace,  where  our  beloved 
Queen  Victoria  would  visit  her  regularly  on  the 
rare  occasions  of  her  coming  to  London.  Music 
was  the  soothing  balm  of  the  aged  Duchess's  de- 
clining days;  and  it  was  furnished  almost  ex- 
clusively by  my  friend,  the  well-known  song- writer, 
F.  Paolo  Tosti.  Every  afternoon,  toward  tea-time, 
with  the  regularity  of  clockwork,  Tosti  would  go 
to  St.  James's  Palace  and  entertain  the  Duchess 
with  that  exquisite  warbling^  of  his  own  charming 
songs,  for  which  he  was  then  enjoying  such  a  re- 
markable vogue.  I  had  already  known  him,  but  his 
intimacy  with  the  FitzGeorges  naturally  tended  to 
strengthen  the  bonds  of  friendship  between  us.  I 
remember    his    telling    me    how    sedulously    the 


^  I  can  find  no  better  word  to  express  the  unique  combination  of 
perfect  diction,  of  true  Italian  warmth  and  color,  with  the  pe- 
culiarly poignant  tones  of  the  voix  de  compositeur^  that  character- 
ized Tosti 's  singing  twenty  years  ago.

musical  columns  of  a  certain  paper  were  studied 
in  the  royal  palaces  every  Sunday ;  and  from  some 
words  graciously  uttered  to  me  by  Princess  Chris- 
tian many  years  afterward,  I  have  reason  to  know 
that  Tosti^s  statement  was  not  mere  flattery. 

Among  my  early  contributions  to  the  ^'Sunday 
Times  ^'  was  an  account  of  a  State  Concert  at  Buck- 
ingham Palace.  It  excited  considerable  curiosity, 
inasmuch  as  critics,  I  need  scarcely  say,  are  not  ad- 
mitted to  these  functions ;  indeed,  I  believe  that  the 
occasion  I  refer  to  was  the  last  as  well  as  the  first 
upon  which  a  description  of  a  State  Concert  has 
ever  been  written  and  published  by  a  musical  jour- 
nalist. It  was  generally  surmised  at  the  time  that  I 
had  obtained  the  privilege  of  entree  through  the  in- 
fluence of  my  editor.  That  was  not  so.  I  owed  it 
entirely  to  the  kindness  of  the  Queen's  late  *' Mas- 
ter of  the  Musick,''  Sir  William  George  Cusins, 
who  consented  to  arrange  for  my  presence,  on  con- 
dition that  I  would  not  reveal  his  share  in  the  trans- 
action so  long  as  he  remained  a  court  official.  And 
he  has  now  been  dead  some  nine  years. 

Cusins  never  realized  it,  but  he  was  distinctly 
one  of  fortune's  favorites.  The  fickle  goddess 
smiled  upon  him  from  the  day  he  won  the  King's 
Scholarship  at  the  Eoyal  Academy— I  think  he 
actually  won  it  twice,  by  the  way.  Throughout 
his  career  he  regarded  himself  as  an  underesti- 
mated genius.^    And  yet,  as  the  pupil  of  Sterndale 

*  This  was,  perhaps,  because  he  felt  a  certain   amount  of  dis- 
appointment in  his  aspirations  as  a  composer.     He  wrote  a  good

FACSIMILE   OF  A  STATE  CONCERT  PROGRAMME 


Musical  Life  in  London 


Bennett  and  Sainton,  he  won  success  both  as  a 
pianist  and  a  violinist ;  he  was  at  an  early  age  ap- 
pointed organist  to  the  Queen 's  private  chapel ;  he 
was  for  sixteen  years  (1867  to  1883)  conductor  of 
the  Philharmonic  Society ;  he  was  honored  in  vari- 
ous ways  by  the  leading  foreign  musical  societies ; 
and  in  1892  he  was  added  to  the  select  list  of 
musical  knights.  The  post  of  * '  Master  of  the  Mu- 
sick'^  to  the  sovereign,  to  which  he  was  appointed 
in  1870,  carried  with  it  many  privileges,  while  its 
duties  included  those  of  conductor  of  the  Queen's 
private  band,  as  well  as  of  director  of  the  State 
Concerts.  One  might  have  justly  thought  that  Sir 
William  Cusins  was  the  most  contented  musician 
in  the  land.  That  he  was  not  mattered  little;  his 
dissatisfaction  was  carefully  concealed  from  all 
but  his  best  friends,  and  a  temper  that  could  rage 
at  white  heat  was,  as  a  rule,  effectually  concealed 
beneath  a  calm,  dignified  exterior  and  the  manners 
of  a  refined  gentleman. 

One  day  he  asked  me  whether  I  would  care  to 
see  the  musical  library  of  Queen  Victoria  at  Buck- 
ingham Palace.  I  accepted  with  the  utmost 
pleasure,  and  spent  a  couple  of  delightful  hours 

deal;  his  compositions  comprising  an  oratorio,  ' 'Gideon/'  a 
*'Te  Deum, "  a  symphony,  two  overtures,  concertos  for  piano 
and  violin,  several  chamber  works,  and  songs;  besides  a  "Eoyal 
Wedding  Serenata"  written  for  the  wedding  of  the  Prince  and 
Princess  of  Wales  in  1863,  and  a  "Koyal  Jubilee  Cantata"  writ- 
ten for  the  jubilee  of  Queen  Victoria  in  1887.  Yet,  probably  the 
last  thing  that  English  amateurs  would  have  thought  of  doing 
was  to  regard  Cusins  as  a  composer.

with  him  looking  through  the  treasures  of  that  in- 
teresting collection.  He  showed  me,  among  other 
valuable  manuscripts,  one  of  the  original  scores  of 
the  *^ Messiah,"  on  which  he  had  shortly  before 
published  a  remarkably  clever  brochure,  throwing 
considerable  light  upon  the  details  of  HandePs  in- 
strumentation. '  ^  I  am  now  engaged, '  ^  he  told  me, 
**in  compiling  a  catalogue  of  this  wonderful  collec- 
tion. Her  Majesty  has  granted  me  permission,  and 
I  hope  in  good  time  to  be  able  to  let  the  world  know 
what  a  mass  of  precious  manuscripts  and  scores 
and  musical  works  of  all  kinds  there  are  in  the 
Queen 's  library. ' '  Whether  or  not  that  project  was 
carried  out  before  his  death  I  am  unable  to  say.  If 
not,  perhaps  his  successor.  Sir  Walter  Parratt,  will 
undertake  to  complete  it. 

After  our  visit  to  the  library,  Cusins  took  me 
through  the  handsome  reception-rooms  of  the 
palace.  It  was  then  that  I  conceived  the  idea  of 
asking  permission  to  accompany  him  once  to  a 
State  Concert.  At  first  he  replied  that  it  would  be 
impossible,  but  after  a  moment's  reflection  said, 
''Well,  I  fancy  I  might  manage  it  if  you  don't 
mind  coming  as  a  member  of  the  chorus."  I  an- 
swered that  I  should  be  only  too  happy.  *'Then 
I  will  send  you  a  '  command '  to  attend  rehearsal  at 
nine  o'clock  on  the  morning  of  the  next  concert^ 
and  all  you  have  to  do  is  to  be  sure  that  at  night 
you  wear  a  white  waistcoat.  I  wear  court  dress, 
and  the  band  have  their  own  uniform  of  black  with 
gold  buttons;  but  the  chorus  are  distinguished  by

nothing  more  elaborate  than  a  white  waistcoat  with 
ordinary  evening  dress."  So  everything  was  ar- 
ranged, and  before  we  parted  I  readily  gave  the 
requisite  promise  of  secrecy. 

Though  magnificent  to  the  eye,  and  a  sight  gor- 
geous and  dazzling  beyond  my  powers  of  descrip- 
tion, nevertheless  I  found  that  State  Concert  at 
Buckingham  Palace  one  of  the  slowest  and  most 
dispiriting  functions  that  it  was  ever  my  lot  to  wit- 
ness. From  my  place  in  the  orchestral  gallery  I 
commanded  a  perfect  view  of  the  entire  assem- 
blage. The  Queen  was,  of  course,  not  present.^ 
Her  Majesty  was  represented  by  the  Prince  of 
Wales,  who,  with  the  Princess  of  Wales  and  the 
other  members  of  the  royal  family,  occupied  seats 
—not  in  front,  as  formerly  had  been  the  custom, 
but  upon  a  high  dais  at  the  extreme  end  of  the  vast 
ball-room.  At  the  back  of  the  royal  group  sat  or 
stood  a  semicircle  of  high  officers  of  state  and  ladies 
and  gentlemen  of  the  household.  The  general  com- 
pany were  ranged  upon  either  side  of  the  room, 
facing  each  other,  in  rows  five  or  six  deep ;  and  be- 
tween them  was  a  gangway  or  passage  broad 
enough  to  keep  the  royal  view  of  the  performers  en- 
tirely free  from  cbstruction. 

The  concert  began  at  11  p.m.  with  the  singing 
of  the  national  anthem.  At  that  moment,  as  all 
present  rose  to  their  feet,  the  coup  d'ceil  was  su- 

^  Queen  Victoria  never  attended  either  a  State  Concert  or  a 
State  Ball  at  Buckingham  Palace  after  the  death  of  the  Prince 
Consort  in  1861.

perb  in  the  extreme.  The  women,  in  court  dress 
with  nodding  plumes  and  sparkling  tiaras,  their 
corsages  positively  coruscating  with  jewels  and 
gems  of  every  description ;  the  men,  in  their  various 
court,  naval,  and  military  uniforms,  their  breasts 
covered  with  the  ribands  and  stars  of  countless 
orders;  the  beautiful  tapestries  and  hangings,  the 
sumptuous  decoration  of  walls  and  ceiling,  and  the 
brilliantly  lighted  chandeliers— all  combined  to 
present  a  profusion  and  wealth  of  color,  a  superb 
effect  of  delicate  grandeur,  such  as  no  court  in  Eu- 
rope could  surpass.  But  beyond  that,  what?— the 
dullest  sort  of  musical  show  that  can  be  imagined. 
True,  the  artists  were  some  of  the  best  available; 
but  the  selection  of  pieces  was  necessarily  of  the 
miscellaneous  or  ad  captandum  order,  and  fol- 
lowed the  preference  at  that  time  for  any  but 
English  music.  Above  all,  by  the  rules  of  court 
etiquette  applause  was  strictly  forbidden.  Number 
succeeded  number  without  the  least  token  of  appre- 
ciation; each,  in  turn,  ending  amid  a  silence  that 
could  not  have  been  more  profound  had  the  locale 
been  a  church  or  the  audience  a  gathering  of  the 
deaf  and  dumb. 

Applause  being  the  ^^salt,''  not  only  of  the  ar- 
tist's existence,  but  of  any  musical  performance,  it 
naturally  follows  that  its  elimination  from  a  State 
Concejt  leaves  the  whole  thing  tasteless  and  insipid 
from  the  artist's  point  of  view.  Only  at  the  close 
of  the  programme  did  vitality  and  spontaneity 
characterize  the  proceedings.    For  then  the  '  *  royal-

ties''  descended  from  the  dais,  and,  with  stately 
tread  and  bows  right  and  left,  walked  the  entire 
length  of  the  apartment  toward  the  expectant  or- 
chestra. Then  the  singers,  who  had  already  de- 
scended from  the  platform,  received  from  gracious 
lips  the  words  of  praise  and  thanks  that  assured 
them  they  had  done  well.  It  was,  for  them,  by  far 
the  sweetest  morsel  of  the  entertainment.  The  com- 
pliments over,  the  royal  personages  retired,  and 
the  company  dispersed,  some  to  the  supper-room; 
others  to  some  ball  or  late  reception  elsewhere. 
For  my  own  part,  I  waited  patiently  and  discreetly 
in  the  background  until  I  caught  the  eye  of  the 
*  ^  Master  of  the  Musick. ' '  He  beckoned  me  to  him, 
took  me  by  the  arm,  and,  without  a  word,  led  me 
along  a  labyrinth  of  corridors  and  passages;  I 
thought  it  was  to  let  me  quietly  out  by  a  side  door, 
and  was  preparing  to  say  *  ^  Good-night, "  when 
suddenly,  to  my  astonishment,  I  found  myself  in 
a  spacious  and  comfortable  room  in  which,  at  a 
large  round  table,  just  ready  to  begin  supper,  were 
seated  the  principal  artists  who  had  taken  part  in 
the  concert!  ''So  much,"  thought  I,  ''for  the 
chance  of  keeping  secret  who  brought  me  here!" 
But  Cusins  was  both  sensible  and  discreet,  and  his 
manner  possessed  that  air  of  importance  and  au- 
thority which  would  have  carried  conviction  be- 
fore a  whole  posse  of  court  officials.  "Ladies  and 
gentlemen,"  he  said  in  his  most  impressive  tones, 
"permit  me  to  beg  that  you  will  make  room  for 
our  friend  Mr.  Klein.    I  have  been  requested  [it

might  have  been  by  the  Queen  herself]  to  see  that 
he  does  not  leave  the  palace  until  he  has  enjoyed 
a  good  supper  in  your  company."  And  I  did  en- 
joy it  thoroughly.  That  convivial  gathering  was 
for  me  by  far  the  pleasantest  feature  of  the  State 
Concert. 

Eighteen  hundred  and  eighty- two  was  London's 
great  Wagner  year.  Hitherto  we  had  been  slowly 
paving  the  way  only.  Now,  with  almost  startling 
suddenness,  the  metropolis  found  itself  the  scene  of 
two  weighty  enterprises  which  were  destined  to 
give  an  even  stronger  fillip  to  the  spread  of  the 
Bayreuth  master's  art  than  his  own  visit  in  1877. 

To  be  candid,  the  double  dose,  taken  well-nigh 
simultaneously,  proved  rather  too  heavy  for  the 
receptive  capacity  of  the  general  public.  But  the 
German  community  again  rallied  in  brave  numbers 
to  this  musical  call  from  the  Fatherland,  and,  alike 
with  money  and  plaudits,  proffered  substantial 
support  to  the  cause. 

Early  in  the  year  a  troupe  had  been  formed  by 
Herr  Angelo  Neumann  for  the  purpose  of  perform- 
ing ^^Der  Eing  des  Nibelungen"  in  the  leading 
cities  of  Germany,  Austria,  Holland,  England,  and 
Italy.  The  months  of  May  and  June  were  chosen 
for  the  London  visit,  and  Her  Majesty's  Theatre 
was  engaged.  In  all,  four  cycles  of  the  tetralogy 
were  given.  Of  these  I  attended  two,  and  then  for 
the  first  time  felt  that  I  was  beginning  to  obtain 
an  insight  into  the  real  scope  and  meaning  of  this 
gigantic  work.     The  casts  included  not  a  few  of

the  famous  artists  who  had  taken  part  in  the  initial 
representation  of  the  ''Ring''  at  Bayreuth  in 
1876,— among  them  Niemann,  linger,  the  Vogls, 
Hill,  Schlosser,  and  Lilli  Lehmann  (who  sang 
Woglinde,  Helmivige,  and  the  ''Bird"  music); 
with  that  admirable  artist,  Reicher-Kindermann,  as 
Brilnnhilde.  The  conductor  was  the  lamented  An- 
ton Seidl,  who  then  made  his  first  appearance  in 
London.  He  at  once  won  the  high  approval  of  con- 
noisseurs by  the  skill  which  he  displayed— with  by 
no  means  first-rate  material— in  bringing  out  with 
clearness,  refinement,  and  intellectuality  the  beau- 
ties of  Wagner's  colossal  score.  It  was  through 
no  fault  of  Seidl 's  that  the  representations  were  at 
many  points  open  to  criticism ;  nor,  we  may  be 
equally  sure,  was  he  responsible  for  the  number  of 
extensive  "cuts"  which  disfigured  the  last  two 
of  the  four  music-dramas. 

The  unexpected  announcement  of  "German 
Opera  at  Drury  Lane"  during  the  same  months 
owed  its  origin,  in  the  first  place,  to  the  extraor- 
dinary success  previously  earned  by  the  celebrated 
Meiningen  troupe  at  that  house ;  and,  in  the  second, 
to  the  renewed  activity  of  Hermann  Franke,  who, 
elated  by  the  good  fortune  that  had  attended  the 
Richter  concerts,  had  prevailed  upon  Herr  Pollini 
to  arrange  with  Augustus  Harris  for  a  series  of 
performances  at  Drury  Lane,  by  the  entire  troupe 
of  the  Hamburg  Opera  House,  and  with  the  very 
popular  Viennese  chef-d'orchestre,  Hans  Richter, 
as  principal  conductor.    It  turned  out,  from  every

point  of  view,  a  remarkable  achievement.  The  rare 
excellence  of  these  performances— doubly  valuable 
in  that  they  presented  under  perfect  conditions 
difficult  operas  mostly  new  or  unfamiliar  to  Eng- 
lish audiences— has  never  been  forgotten  by  any 
who  witnessed  them.  They  created  a  new  standard, 
a  new  mental  perspective,  not  only  for  the  rising 
generation  of  opera-goers,  but  for  those  critics 
whose  insular  experiences  had  been  confined  exclu- 
sively to  the  lyric  art  of  the  Italian  and  French 
schools.  Henceforward,  we  were  to  understand 
what  was  signified  by  Wagnerian  declamation  and 
diction  superimposed  upon  a  correct  vocal  method, 
as  distinguished  from  mere  shouting  and  a  persist- 
ent sacrifice  either  of  the  word  to  the  tone  or  of  the 
tone  to  the  word. 

These  inestimable  traditions  were  exemplified 
with  marvelous  fidelity  and  force  by  the  Hamburg 
artists,  who,  be  it  noted,  comprised  at  that  time 
several  whose  rare  merit  was  subsequently  to  earn 
for  them  world-wide  reputations.  Imagine  the  ad- 
vantage of  hearing  ^ '  Tristan  und  Isolde ' '  and  '  ^  Die 
Meistersinger"  for  the  first  time  with  such  a  noble 
singer  and  actress  as  Eosa  Sucher  as  Isolde  and 
Eva;  with  such  a  glorious  Tristan  and  Walther  as 
Winkelmann;  with  the  famous  Marianne  Brandt 
as  Brangaene;  with  that  fine  barytone,  Gura,  as 
Konig  Marks  and  Hans  Sachs!  Those  artists  were 
then  in*  their  prime,  and  sang  their  music  as  few 
German  singers  have  sung  it  since— as,  indeed,  it 
could  have  been  sung  only  by  artists  trained  in  the

purest  of  vocal  schools.  We  also  had  splendid 
revivals  of  Beethoven's  ^'Fidelio,"  with  the  de- 
lightful Therese  Malten  as  Leonora;  of  Weber's 
^'Der  Freischiitz"  and  "Euryanthe";  and,  natur- 
ally, of  the ' '  Fliegende  Hollander, "  "  Tannhauser, ' ' 
and  ^^ Lohengrin."  How  these  operas  were  con- 
ducted by  Hans  Eichter  I  need  hardly  say.  Enough 
that  the  ensemble  was  superb  and  the  mise  en  scene, 
generally  speaking,  beyond  reproach.  The  esthetic 
effect  of  the  entire  season  was  in  the  highest  de- 
gree beneficial.  It  also  proved  to  be  entirely  free 
from  financial  loss,  a  fact  which  no  doubt  induced 
the  similar  undertaking  at  Covent  Garden  two 
years  later,  when  Richter  was  again  conductor. 
But  the  success  in  that  instance  was  not  nearly  so 
marked.  The  time  when  German  opera  should  take 
abiding  root  in  the  affections  of  the  London  public 
was  yet  to  come. 

In  the  autumn  of  1882  Gounod  came  to  England 
to  conduct  the  first  performance  of  his  fine  sacred 
work,  ' '  The  Redemption. ' '  He  was  no  stranger  ' 
to  London.  One  of  the  refugees  of  1870,  he  had 
made  a  stay  there  of  considerable  duration,  and 
among  other  pieces  brought  out  his  cantata  ^^  Gal- 
lia,'' which  he  conducted  at  the  opening  of  the 
Royal  Albert  Hall  in  1871.  Even  previous  to 
this,  however,  he  had  sketched  his  design  for  the 
work  which  he  labeled  ^^Opus  vitae  meae,"  and 
there  is  ample  evidence  that  he  spent,  from  first 
to  last,  upward  of  a  dozen  years  upon  the  score 
of  *^The  Redemption."     Having  arranged  with

Thirty  Years  of 


Messrs.  Novello  &  Co.  for  its  publication  (at  tFe 
highest  price  ever  paid  at  that  time  for  an  ora- 
torio), Gounod  arrived  late  in  September  to  super- 
intend the  final  rehearsals  for  its  production  at 
the  Birmingham  Festival.  This  was  the  last 
of  the  Midland  gatherings  over  which  Sir  Michael 
Costa  presided,  and  I  owed  to  him  the  honor 
of  a  personal  introduction  to  the  composer  of 
^' Faust/'  who  was  then  sixty-four  years  of 
age. 

Gounod  was  one  of  the  most  fascinating  men  I 
have  ever  spoken  with.  His  manner  had  a  charm 
that  was  irresistible,  and  his  kindly  eyes,  soft  and 
melting  as  a  woman 's,  would  light  up  with  a  smile, 
now  tender,  now  humorous,  that  fixed  itself  inef- 
faceably  upon  the  memory.  He  could  speak  Eng- 
lish fairly  well,  but  preferred  his  own  language,  in 
which  he  was  a  brilliant  conversationalist ;  and  he 
could  use  to  advantage  a  fund  of  keen,  ready  wit. 
He  was  influenced  at  that  time  by  a  recrudescence 
of  that  religious  mysticism  which  had  so  strongly 
characterized  his  youthful  career;  but  his  tone, 
though  earnest  and  thoughtful  when  he  was  dwell- 
ing upon  his  art,  could  brighten  up  with  the  light- 
ness and  gaiety  of  a  true  Parisian.  He  was  rather 
upset,  on  the  morning  of  the  London  band  rehearsal 
at  St.  George's  Hall,  by  the  numerous  mistakes  in 
the  parts,  which  led  to  frequent  stoppages.  The 
trouble  reached  a  climax  in  the  ^^  March  to  Cal- 
vary," where,  after  about  the  ninth  or  tenth  stop, 
Gounod  turned  to  Costa  and  remarked : 


130 


Musical  Life  in  London 


^ '  Seulement  ici  puis-je  pardonner  tous  ces  arrets, 
quoiqu'ils  gatent  ma  musique.'^ 

^^Pourquoi  cela?"  inquired  Sir  Michael. 

^^Parceque,"  replied  Gounod,  ^'a  ce  point  il  y 
a  douze  stations,  et  a  chaque  station  il  faut  natu- 
rellement  un  arret. ' ' 

After  all  the  typographical  and  other  errors  had 
been  rectified,  the  march' was  tried  through  again 
and  went  so  magnificently  as  to  arouse  the  master 's 
undisguised  admiration,  which  deepened  with  as- 
tonishment when  Costa  informed  him  that  the  in- 
strumentalists had  never  seen  a  note  of  the  music 
until  that  morning.  Gounod  said  to  me  later, 
^'They  are  wonderful  readers,  these  English  play- 
ers. There  is  scarcely  a  mistake  that  is  due  to  inac- 
curate deciphering  of  the  notes.  And  what  makes 
it  even  more  remarkable  is  that  my  work  is  so  full 
of  awkward  chromatic  progressions.''  I  ventured 
to  observe  that  since  he  was  last  in  London  our 
orchestras  had  been  turning  their  attention  some- 
what extensively  to  Wagner. 

Gounod  retorted  quickly,  ^^Yes,  I  know  that. 
But  you  will  not  tell  me  that  Wagner's  four 
semitones  in  ^Tristan'  or  his  slurred  runs  (notes 
coulees)  in  ^  Tannhauser '  require  more  delicate  care 
than  my  ^  framework  of  the  augmented  fifth. '  "  ^ 
I  thought  I  detected  a  slight  touch  of  scorn  in  his 
voice,  and  made  no  attempt  to  argue  the  point. 

^An  allusion  to  the  peculiar  harmonic  structure  which  the  com- 
poser had  avowedly  employed  as  the  predominant  feature  of  the 
accompanying  chords  in  the  ^ '  Eedemption. " 


131 


Musical  Life  in  London 


At  that  same  rehearsal  Gounod  did  an  unusual 
amount  of  singing.  The  solo  vocalists  comprised 
what  the  new  critic  of  the  *^ Times/'  Dr.  Francis 
Hueif er,  was  then  fond  of  describing  as  the  ' '  repre- 
sentative English  quartet''— Albani,  Patey,  Ed- 
ward Lloyd,  and  Santley ;  nor  have  I  forgotten  how 
exquisitely  William  H.  Cummings  (now  principal 
of  the  Guildhall  School  of  Music,  London)  delivered 
the  touching  phrase  allotted  to  the  Penitent  Thief. 
But,  as  a  matter  of  fact,  Gounod,  with  his  sympa- 
thetic voix  de  compositeur,  was  singing  more  or 
less  all  through  the  rehearsal,  wisely  exercising  his 
rare  faculty  for  impressing  his  exact  ideas  upon  the 
interpreters  of  his  music.  And  what  beautiful 
music  it  was !  What  a  tremendous  effect  it  created 
at  Birmingham !  So  deeply  was  Gounod  impressed 
by  his  triumph  there,  that,  long  before  the  ^*  Re- 
demption ' '  had  been  produced  in  Paris,  he  set  about 
writing  his  second  great  sacred  work,  ^^Mors  et 
Vita,"  for  the  Birmingham  Festival  of  1885.  He 
was  paid  an  even  larger  price  for  this  than  for 
its  predecessor  (I  believe  the  exact  sum  was  £4000 
—$20,000),  and  he  fully  intended  to  come  over  to 
conduct  it.  In  the  meanwhile,  however,  an  action 
had  been  brought  against  him  in  the  English  courts 
by  Mrs.  Weldon,  and,  inasmuch  as  he  was  mulcted 
in  heavy  damages,  the  composer  deemed  that  **  dis- 
cretion is  the  better  part  of  valor,"  and  stayed  at 
home  in*  Paris.  He  never  ventured  across  the  Chan- 
nel again;  but  I  saw  him  in  his  native  city  three 
years  later,  as  will  be  related  in  due  time.

CHAPTER   VII 

Augustus  Harris:  actor,  metteur  en  scene,  dramatic  author, 
theatrical  manager,  operatic  impresario  —  A  great  stage- 
manager  and  his  military  aide — Harris  and  Carl  Rosa — Eng- 
lish opera  flourishes  at  Drury  Lane — Arthur  Goring  Thomas 
—Alexander  C.  Mackenzie— "Esmeralda."  "Colomba,"  and 
"Nadeshda." 

ENTER  Augustus  Harris!  For  some  time  al- 
ready has  the  figure  of  the  well-known  impre- 
sario been  looming  large  upon  the  operatic  horizon 
of  these  pages,  and  it  is  not  only  just  but  expedient 
that  he  should  now  make  his  actual  entry.  Accu- 
rately speaking,  I  am  aware  that  his  formal  mana- 
gerial connection  with  opera  dates  only  from  1887. 
He  himself,  however,  would  probably  have  dated  it 
from  his  cradle.  *'My  father  was  stage-manager 
at  Covent  Garden,  ^  *  he  would  say ;  ' '  and  if  any  in- 
fant ever  stage-managed  his  father,  I  was  that  in- 
fant. Almost  as  soon  as  I  could  run  alone  he  used 
to  take  me  with  him  to  the  theatre.  I  remember 
quite  well,  as  a  little  boy,  standing  in  the  wings  as 
he  walked  about  the  stage,  while  the  great  prima 
donnas  came  and  petted  and  kissed  me. '  ^  This  was 
in  the  '^sixties,''  when  Augustus  Harris,  Sr.,  was 
staging  the  heavy  Meyerbeer  revivals,  and  when 
that  brilliant  star,  Adelina  Patti,  had  not  long  been 

^25 


Thirty  Years  of 


shining  in  the  operatic  firmament.  It  is  only  liter- 
ally true,  therefore,  to  say  that  the  youthful  Au- 
gustus, or  ^^Gus,"  as  all  his  friends  were  wont  to 
call  him,  was  reared  in  the  very  atmosphere  of  the 
coulisses. 

He  was  educated  both  in  France  and  in  Ger- 
many, and,  as  a  matter  of  course,  he  went  con- 
stantly to  the  theatres  in  both  countries.  After  his 
return  to  England  at  the  age  of  seventeen,  one  of 
his  first  essays  as  an  actor  was  to  play  the  part  of 
the  boy  in  ^'Pink  Dominoes,''  under  (Sir)  Charles 
Wyndham's  management,  at  the  Criterion.  His 
earliest  acquaintance  with  the  duties  of  an  operatic 
stage-manager  was  when  he  accompanied  the  Ma- 
pleson  troupe  round  the  British  provinces  in  that 
capacity.  The  experience  was  invaluable;  but  his 
chief  ambition  was  to  become  lessee  of  Drury 
Lane  Theatre;  and,  with  the  assistance  of  his  fa- 
ther-in-law, he  was  enabled  to  fulfil  that  desire 
when  he  had  barely  attained  legal  age.  His  first 
pantomime  and  his  first  ''autumn  drama''  were 
both  successful,  and  ere  a  year  had  passed  he  could 
boast  that  he  was  paying  his  way  at  a  theatre 
which  had  "spelled  ruin"  for  more  than  one  astute 
manager. 

With  the  dramatic  productions  of  Augustus 
Harris  I  am  not  concerned.  I  have  simply  stated 
the  above  facts  in  order  to  show  the  association  of 
the  musical  and  theatrical  elements  in  his  nature 
at  the  earliest  period  of  his  career.  It  must  have 
been  late  in  1878  or  early  in  1879  when  I  was 

136 


Musical  Life  in  London 


introduced  to  this  remarkable  man  one  night  at  the 
Green  Koom  Club.  The  youthful  Drury  Lane  man- 
ager was  full  of  life  and  high  spirits,  and  I  found 
it  very  amusing  to  listen  to  his  vivacious  chatter. 
We  had  not  been  talking  two  minutes  before  the 
subject  turned  on  opera— for  even  then,  as  in  after 
years,  it  was  his  favorite  topic.  Why,  he  wanted 
to  know,  should  London  be  worse  off  than  the  small 
German  cities,  where  the  theatres  were  subsidized 
and  opera  was  being  performed  nearly  the  whole 
year  round?  Why  was  the  English  press  power- 
less in  this  matter?  Or  was  the  press  merely  in- 
different, like  the  people  whose  opinions  and  wishes 
it  was  supposed  to  voice  ?  I  told  him  I  thought  that 
neither  the  cities  nor  the  people  were  indifferent, 
but  that  the  love  of  opera  had  not  yet  become  in- 
grained in  the  hearts  of  the  nation ;  while,  as  to  the 
question  of  state  support,  I  was  doubtful  whether 
as  good  results  would  be  derived  from  it  as  from 
individual  enterprise  working  upon  independent 
lines  and  combining  artistic  with  commercial  con- 
sideration to  the  fullest  practicable  extent.  And 
then  followed  a  very  pretty  argument,  which  lasted 
well  into  the  * '  small  hours. ' ' 

Augustus  Harris  was  even  then  a  being  of  extra- 
ordinary temperament ;  brimming  over  with  energy 
and  new  ideas,  fond  of  innovations,  impatient  of 
the  smallest  delay  in  carrying  out  a  project;  the 
strangest  imaginable  mixture  of  conceit  and  mod- 
esty, rashness  and  discretion,  extravagance  and 
common  sense.    He  had  the  gift  of  imagination  in 


^37 


Thirty  Years  of 


an  uncommon  degree,  and  from  the  outset  he 
seemed  to  have  the  faculty  of  surrounding  himself 
with  clever  ^' heads  of  departments,"  with  useful 
assistants  and  with  loyal  friends.  He  was  neither 
a  first-rate  raconteur,  nor  even  a  fluent  speaker,  but 
he  loved  to  ^^ rattle  on''  upon  a  subject  that  inter- 
ested him,  and  he  would  invariably  lead  the  laugh 
over  his  own  jokes.  In  disposition  he  was  honest, 
frank,  and  kindly  in  the  extreme,  and  he  was  gen- 
erous to  a  fault.  Such,  briefly,  was  the  character 
of  the  man  who  was  subsequently  to  be  responsible 
for  the  renaissance  of  opera  in  England.  And  such, 
with  slight  developments  and  few  changes,  it  re- 
mained until  the  close  of  his  life.  Toward  the  end 
he  grew  more  ready  to  listen  to  the  voice  of  gossip, 
and  to  trust  his  own  judgment  less  than  that  of  his 
immediate  entourage.  Nevertheless,  so  correct 
were  his  perceptions  in  most  things,  that  he  made 
less  than  ten  per  cent,  of  the  errors  credited  to  him 
by  his  critics. 

If  Harris  inherited  his  father's  genius  as  a  met- 
teur  en  scene,  he  brought  to  it  something  more.  He 
possessed  much  higher  powers  of  organization.  He 
had  a  wholesome  capacity  for  disregarding  stupid 
and  worn-out  traditions.  He  learned  a  great  deal 
from  the  German  stage-managers,  and  especially 
from  the  Meiningen  troupe  which  he  brought  to 
Drury  Lane.  The  moving  and  the  grouping  of 
the  street  crowds  in  the  Meiningen  production  of 
*^  Julius  Caesar"  were  simply  marvelous,  and  Au- 
gustus Harris  was  wise  enough  to  make  the  most 

138 


Musical  Life  in  London 


of  that  object-lesson.  He  applied  it  to  every  branch 
of  his  work— pantomime,  melodrama,  comic  opera, 
and,  last  but  not  least,  grand  opera.  Where  he 
felt  that  special  technical  advice  and  aid  were 
necessary,  he  was  satisfied  with  none  save  the  best. 
During  the  preparation  of  one  of  his  autumn 
dramas  (I  think  it  was  ** Human  Nature'')  I  went 
to  Drury  Lane  while  a  rehearsal  was  in  progress, 
and  sat  down  in  the  stalls  to  watch  the  training 
of  an  army  of  supers  in  an  imaginary  fight  with 
some  African  natives.  In  due  course  this  was  fol- 
lowed by  a  home-coming  and  a  triumphal  march 
through  Trafalgar  Square,  with  the  hero  (dear  old 
Henry  Neville)  at  the  head  of  his  victorious  com- 
pany.   The  whole  business  was  splendidly  done. 

Actively  assisting  the  manager  in  these  opera- 
tions was  a  gentleman  in  a  frock  coat  and  tall  hat, 
of  undeniably  military  appearance,  who  impressed 
me  both  by  his  quiet,  masterful  manner  and  the 
imperturbable  patience  with  which  he  directed 
mancBuvres  to  be  repeated  over  and  over  again 
until  they  were  satisfactorily  executed.  After  the 
rehearsal  was  concluded  I  went  upon  the  stage. 
xVugustus  Harris  was  talking  to  his  military  ad- 
viser. He  beckoned  me  to  approach.  ^*  Klein,  I 
want  to  introduce  you  to  my  friend  Major  Kit- 
chener, who  has  been  kind  enough  to  come  and  help 
me  with  this  *  soldiering'  work.  "What  do  you  think 
of  it  ?  Did  you  ever  see  such  fighting  and  marching 
on  the  stage  before?"  I  certainly  never  had,  and 
I  offered  my  congratulations.    They  were  accepted. 


Thirty  Years  of 


with  a  murmur  of  thanks  and  a  shake  of  the  hand, 
by  the  man  who  was  afterward  to  be  the  hero  of 
Omdurman  and  the  victor  in  the  great  South 
African  war.  He  had  gladly  consented  to  place  his 
knowledge  and  experience  at  the  disposal  of  the 
popular  theatrical  manager. 

The  art-union  of  Augustus  Harris  and  Carl  Rosa 
was  an  outcome  of  an  affinity— of  a  peculiar  mag- 
netism which  brought  together  men  who  had  ideas 
in  common  and  could  definitely  work  them  out 
to  their  mutual  gain  and  for  the  benefit  of  the 
world  at  large.  Alas !  their  partnership  was  all  too 
brief.  What  it  would  have  achieved  had  it  endured 
another  ten  or  fifteen  years,  I  will  not  attempt  to 
guess,  though  undoubtedly  it  would  have  set  opera 
upon  a  far  more  solid  and  exalted  pedestal  than 
it  occupies  in  England  at  the  present  moment. 
Still,  as  it  was,  it  accomplished  much.  The  Carl 
Rosa  seasons  at  Drury  Lane  marked  a  distinct  for- 
ward stride  in  the  progress  of  opera  in  the  ver- 
nacular, particularly  in  the  evidence  that  they  af- 
forded of  the  existence  of  a  school  of  young  British 
composers  imbued  with  genuine  talent  and  evincing 
an  unsuspected  mastery  of  the  modern  forms  now 
essential  to  appreciation  and  success.  More  than 
this,  the  association  of  the  two  managers  helped  to 
develop  the  artistic  side  of  the  younger  man,  and 
to  mature  the  aspirations  which  eventually  were 
realized  in  the  brilliant  opera  revival  of  1887. 

It  was  at  Easter,  1883,  that  Carl  Rosa  inau- 
gurated his  first  season  at  Drury  Lane.    He  must 

140 


Musical  Life  in  London 

have  felt  it  a  great  relief  to  be  able  to  depend  upon 
his  new  partner  for  the  administration  of  all  mat- 
ters relating  to  the  stage  management  and  mise  en 
5ce we— departments  which  he  had  hitherto  kept  en- 
tirely under  his  own  personal  control.  Since  1880 
he  had  been  assisted  in  the  work  of  conducting  by 
Mr.  Randegger,  who  was  now  relinquishing  much 
of  his  time  as  a  teacher  for,  what  was  to  him,  the 
more  pleasurable  occupation  of  wielding  the  baton. 
Every  branch  of  the  undertaking  was  carefully 
supervised.  The  band  and  chorus  were  specially 
augmented,  and  the  company  was  an  excellent  one. 

Under  these  favorable  circumstances,  two  new 
operas  by  English  composers  were  brought  to  a 
hearing,  namely,  Arthur  Goring  Thomas's  ^^Esme- 
ralda'' and  Alexander  C.  Mackenzie's  ^^Colomba." 
It  was  purely  an  experiment,  and  Carl  Rosa  him- 
self had  little  faith  in  its  success.  I  remember  his 
saying:  *^I  look  upon  this  as  a  duty  that  I  owe  to 
native  art,  and  not  as  a  business  speculation.  Mind, 
both  these  operas  are  interesting  and  beautiful,  or 
I  should  not  have  accepted  them.  But  they  are 
by  British  composers— by  men  whose  names  are 
hardly  known  to  the  public.  How,  then,  can  I  dare 
hope  they  will  succeed?"  And  yet  they  did  suc- 
ceed—^'Esmeralda"  by  virtue  of  graceful,  emo- 
tional strains  allied  to  a  moving  and  ever-eifective 
drama;  ^^Colomba"  on  the  strength  of  musical 
merits  that  overcome,  temporarily  at  least,  the 
incubus  of  a  clumsy  and  ponderous  libretto. 

^* Esmeralda,"  indeed,  made  quite  a  hit  from  the

first.  *  ^  Who  is  Goring  Thomas ! '  ^  people  began  to 
ask.  Musicians  knew  him  as  a  Royal  Academy  stu- 
dent who  had  finished  his  education  in  Paris,  and 
had  become  so  intensely  imbued  with  the  manner- 
isms of  Gounod  and  Massenet  that  he  was  prac- 
tically incapable  of  putting  music  to  any  but  French 
lyrics.^  His  cantata  ^ '  The  Sun- Worshipers, ' '  pro- 
duced at  the  Norwich  Festival  of  1881,  was  so  un- 
original that,  despite  its  evident  talent,  it  had 
barely  escaped  ridicule.  ** Esmeralda''  showed  an 
immense  advance,  and  in  later  years  its  charm  was 
potent  enough  to  attract  the  favorable  notice  of 
Jean  de  Reszke,  Lassalle,  and  Melba,  who  appeared 
in  a  revised  version  of  the  opera  in  French  at  Co- 
vent  Garden  and  also  in  New  York.  The  original 
English  cast,  however,  was  not  to  be  despised: 
Georgina  Burns  as  Esmeralda,  Clara  Perry  (now 
Mrs.  Ben  Davies)  as  Fleur  de  Lys,  Barton  Mc- 
Guckin  as  Phoebus,  James  Ludwig  as  Claude 
Frollo,  Ben  Davies  (making  his  debut  in  opera)  as 
Gringoire,  and  Leslie  Crotty  as  Quasimodo— a 
first-rate  ensemble.  The  libretto  was  by  Messrs. 
Alberto  Randegger  and  Theo.  Marzials,  the  former 
of  whom  conducted  the  performance,  and  later 
superintended  the  production  of  the  opera  at 
Cologne. 

The  contrast  between  ** Esmeralda"  and  ^*Co- 
lomba''  was  very  striking;  the  methods  of  the  two 

^  He  told  me  this  himself  for  a  fact.  It  took  him  years  to 
learn  how  to  handle  English  poetry,  and  he  never  thoroughly  mas- 
tered the  knack  of  doing  so.

composers  were  ^^wide  as  the  poles  asunder.'' 
That  of  A.  C.  Mackenzie's  was  as  unmistakably 
Teutonic  as  Goring  Thomas's  was  purely  Gallic. 
The  subjects  both  had  been  taken  from  French 
sources ;  and,  sombre  though  it  might  be,  there  was 
no  reason  why  Prosper  Merimee's  ^'Colomba" 
should  not  have  furnished  material  for  an  opera- 
book  quite  as  effective  as  his  ^* Carmen."  But, 
whereas  the  authors  of  ^'Esmeralda"  continuallv 
introduced  bright  relief  in  their  opera.  Dr.  Francis 
Hueffer  in  ^^Colomba"  sought  to  emphasize  only 
the  darker  episodes  of  the  Corsican  vendetta,  while 
carrying  his  craze  for  accurate  *^ local  color"  to 
an  extreme  that  bordered  upon  the  absurd.  At 
that  time  there  was  no  gainsaying  the  dictum  of 
the  critic  of  the  ^ ^Times''— particularly  when  he 
trudged  about  the  stage  at  rehearsal,  umbrella  in 
hand,  now  communicating  his  ideas  to  the  perform- 
ers, now  ^Maying  down  the  law"  across  the  foot- 
lights to  the  poor  composer,  who  sat  in  his  place 
in  the  orchestra  patiently  awaiting  the  pleasure 
of  his  autocratic  collaborator.  Yet,  thanks  simply 
to  the  beauty  of  the  music  (the  orchestration 
was  especially  fine),  '^Colomba"  made  its  mark 
with  the  more  cultivated  section  of  the  public,  and 
opened  the  eyes  of  the  critics  to  the  rare  talent  of 
the  Scottish  musician  who,  five  years  later,  was  to 
succeed  Sir  George  Macfarren  as  principal  of  the 
Royal  Academy  of  Music.  The  title-role  was  ad- 
mirably created  by  Alwina  Valleria;  Barton  Mc- 
Guckin  played  the  hero,  Or  so;  and  that  capital

basso,  Franco  Novara,  whose  real  name  was  Nash, 
was  also  in  the  cast. 

The  success  of  these  operas  made  a  deep  im- 
pression upon  Carl  Rosa  and  Augustus  Harris. 
They  began  to  see  that  there  was  a  future  in  store 
for  the  rising  English  school.  The  two  composers 
were  each  commissioned  to  write  another  opera; 
and  meanwhile,  in  1884,  a  work  more  genuinely 
English  than  either  '^Esmeralda"  or  '^Colomba" 
—namely,  ^'The  Canterbury  Pilgrims"  of  Villiers 
Stanford— was  brought  out  at  Drury  Lane  with 
marked  success.  The  name  of  Mackenzie  also  de- 
rived wide  prominence  that  year  through  the  tri- 
umph of  his  fine  oratorio,  ' '  The  Rose  of  Sharon, ' ' 
at  the  Norwich  Festival,^  which  resulted  in  his  be- 
ing requested  to  write  a  work  (''The  Story  of 
Sayid'')  for  the  Leeds  Festival  of  1886.  With  so 
much  to  do,  no  wonder  Goring  Thomas  was  ready 
before  him  with  a  new  opera.  The  composer  of 
''Esmeralda"  had  been  fortunate  enough  to  dis- 
cover a  new  librettist  in  Mr.  Julian  Sturgis,  an 
American  litterateur  unknown  to  fame  in  England, 
who  had  submitted  a  promising  scenario  upon  a 
Russian  subject.  The  title  of  the  new  opera  was 
"Nadeshda."  Goring  Thomas  devoted  the  best 
part  of  1884  to  writing  the  music,  and  it  was  an- 


^  Always  to  be  remembered  as  the  occasion  of  the  debut  in 
England  of  Miss  Emma  Nevada,  who,  in  order  to  identify  herself 
completely^  with  her  part,  appeared  at  the  concert  as  the  Bose  of 
Sharon,  wearing  a  pink  costume,  with  pink  hat  and  gloves,  and 
with  her  copy  of  the  oratorio  bound  in  the  same  soft  tint — in  fact, 
everything  couleur  de  rose!

nounced  for  production  at  Dniry  Lane  in  April, 
1885.  Unusual  secrecy  was  observed  with  regard 
to  the  work,— almost  as  much,  in  fact,  as  in  the  case 
of  a  new  Savoy  opera,— but  I  persuaded  the  com- 
poser to  lend  me  an  advance  copy  of  the  book,  and 
published  a  notice  of  the  story  in  the  '^Sunday 
Times. '  ^  This  evoked  the  following  letter  from  the 
ever-nervous  Carl  B-osa: 

10  Warwick  Crescent,  Maida  Hill,  W. 

24th  March,  1885. 
Dear  Klein: 

I  saw  the  ''Nadeshda"  plot  to-day,  and  must  confess 
it  is  admirably  written.  But  where  did  you  get  the  ma- 
terial from— from  an  artist,  eh^  I  have  only  this  morn- 
ing sent  words  of  the  tenor  song  now  to  be  sung  to  the 
printer 's,  and  did  not  want  to  get  copies  in  the  hands 
of  the  press  before  the  book  was  complete. 

Sincerely  yours, 

Carl  Eosa. 

^ '  Nadeshda ' '  made  an  instantaneous  success.  It 
was  pronounced  immeasurably  stronger  than  *  ^  Es- 
meralda, ' '  the  music  showing  a  wonderful  advance 
alike  in  originality  and  dramatic  grip.  Hand- 
somely staged  by  Augustus  Harris,  splendidly  sung 
by  Alwina  Valleria,  Josephine  Yorke,  Barton  Mc- 
Guckin,  and  Leslie  Crotty,  it  achieved  the  hit  of 
the  season  and  evoked  eulogies  that  must  have  de- 
lighted the  soul  of  the  modest  composer.  During 
the  following  autumn  and  winter,  ^^Nadeshda'^  was 
brought   out  in   several   Continental   cities,   and,

knowing  how  little  Goring  Thomas  sought  adver- 
tisement on  these  occasions,  I  used  to  take  plea- 
sure in  letting  him  know  what  was  going  on.  Oc- 
casionally he  would  come  to  me  for  information; 
as  when  he  sent  me  this  letter : 

Eatton,  Willingdon,  Sussex, 

January  9,  1886. 
My  dear  Klein  : 

I  heard  accidentally  this  morning  from  Mme.  Viardot^ 
that  *'Nadeshda"  is  going  to  be  given  in  Berlin.  Can  you 
tell  me  when  ?  Her  late  pupil,  Mile.  Leisinger,  is  to  sing 
the  soprano  part,  and  wrote  to  her  to  ask  where  she 
could  get  a  score.  I  have  not  heard  anything  about  it, 
and  should  be  very  glad  if  you  could  give  me  any  news. 
Please  send  your  reply  to  52  Wimpole  Street,  as  I  am 
coming  up  on  Saturday. 

With  best  wishes  for  the  New  Year,  believe  me. 

Yours  truly, 

A.  Goring  Thomas. 

Mackenzie  was  less  lucky  in  his  second  attempt. 
Again  he  had  the  misfortune  to  be  hampered  by 
one  of  Dr.  Hueffer's  elephantine  librettos.  Hence 
'^The  Troubadour,''  with  its  ghastly  climax, 
wherein  the  erring  heroine  is  compelled  by  her  hus- 
band to  drink  a  goblet  filled  with  the  blood  of  the 
fascinating  Guillem  de  Cabestanh,  proved  too  much 
for  even  those  who  admired  the  melodic  charm  and 
dramatic  power  of  the  music.    This  was  the  novelty 

^  Pauline  Viardot-Garcia,  the  famous  singer  and  teacher,  then  re- 
siding in  Paris,  a  great  friend  of  the  young  English  composer.

for  1886.  Not  much  more  successful  was  Mr.  Fred- 
eric Corder^s  ^^Nordisa'*  in  the  following  year; 
but  the  ball  by  now  had  been  fairly  set  rolling,  and 
the  public,  both  in  London  and  the  provinces,  had 
awakened  to  the  fact  that  there  were  native  com- 
posers equal  to  the  task  of  writing  operas  to  which 
the  world  would  listen.  By  what  chain  of  untoward 
circumstances  the  progress  of  this  native  movement 
was  impeded,  if  not  stopped  altogether,  will  be 
made  clear  later.  But  let  me  say  here  that  the 
'^unkindest  cut  of  alP'  was  the  premature  and 
tragic  death  ^  of  the  gifted  Arthur  Goring  Thomas, 
one  of  the  most  lovable  men,  one  of  the  most 
inspired  lyrical  writers,  and  one  of  the  most  ear- 
nest, painstaking  musicians  that  England  ever  pro- 
duced. 

*  In  the  autumn  of  1891  he  sustained  a  severe  fall,  from  the 
effects  of  which  he  never  altogether  recovered.  On  the  evening 
of  March  20,  1892,  he  committed  suicide  by  throwing  himself 
under  a  train  at  the  West  Hampstead  station  of  the  Metropolitan 
Kailway.

CHAPTER   VIII 

Decay  of  old  Italian  opera— Rise  of  the  young  Italian  school— 
Masterly  mismanagement  and  financial  coUapse  at  Co  vent 
Garden— Pauline  Lucca— A  notable  dinner-party— Marcella

and  English  oratorio. 

THE  history  of  Italian  opera  in  London  during 
the  middle  ^' eighties'^  is  a  history  of  *' de- 
cline and  fall."  As  the  fortunes  of  English  and 
German  opera  improved,  so  did  the  glorious 
^^ palmy  days"  of  the  older  school  recede  deeper 
and  deeper  into  the  shadows  of  the  past.  There 
is  no  need  to  dwell  at  length  upon  this  process  of 
deterioration;  the  causes  thereof  are  well  known 
and  understood.  I  shall  note  rather  the  events 
which  ever  and  anon  revived  the  flickering  embers 
and  kept  them  burning  until  finally  the  requisite 
fuel  arrived  from  a  new  and  unsuspected  source. 

Interest  was  keenly  excited  by  the  production 
at  Her  Majesty's,  in  July,  1880,  of  Boito's  ^^Mefis- 
tofele."  The  work  had  been  much  talked  of 
since  its  revival,  in  revised  form,  at  Bologna  in 
1875,  and  Mr.  Mapleson  took  creditable  pams  to 
mount  it  in  such  fashion  that  there  should  be 
few  looijholes  for  criticism.    Truth  to  tell,  it  was 

152 


Musical  Life  in  London 


an  exceedingly  good  representation  all  round. 
Christine  Nilsson  's  embodiment  of  the  dual  role  of 
Margherita  and  Helen  of  Troy  had  much  of  poetry 
and  charm;  Trebelli  was  as  fascinating  and  artis- 
tic as  ever  in  the  contralto  parts ;  Campanini  made 
an  excellent  Faust;  and  Nannetti  lent  rare  sardonic 
color  and  alertness  to  the  part  of  Mefistofele,  Sir 
Michael  Costa  was  still  vigorous  enough  to  conduct 
Bo'ito's  opera  in  his  old  resolute,  vigilant  manner; 
and  very  delighted  he  was  over  its  success,  which 
lent  quite  a  special  distinction  to  the  season. 

At  this  time  there  was  little  thought  of  a  '^  young 
Italian  school.''  Nevertheless,  Verdi  had  been  si- 
lent since  ^^Aida";  ^  and  the  success  of  Boito  was 
bound  to  draw  attention  to  the  claims  of  Ponchi- 
elli.  The  Cremonese  musician  had  been  writing 
and  bringing  out  operas  for  a  quarter  of  a  century, 
two  of  which  at  least— ^ 'I  Lituani"  and  ^'La  Gio- 
conda''— had  met  with  emphatic  favor  in  Italy. 
Mr.  Ernest  Gye  now  determined  to  try  ^^La  Gio- 
conda"  at  Covent  Garden ;  and  he  produced  it  there 
in  May,  1883,  before  a  crowded  and  demonstrative 
house.  A  fine  cast  was  engaged— Gay arre  as  Enzo, 
Cotogni  as  Barnaba,  Edouard  de  Eeszke  as  Alvise, 
Scalchi  as  La  decay  and  an  American  soprano,  Ma- 
rie Durand,  who  had  already  won  fame  in  Italy,  as 
the  heroine.  La  Gioconda.  The  opera  was  warmly 
received,  and  for  a  few  representations  drew  good 
houses.  It  never  became  as  lastingly  popular, 
however,  as  either  ^'Aida''  or  '  ^  Mefistof ele, "  in

the  former  of  which,  by  the  way,  Josephine  de 
Reszke,  the  elder  sister  of  Jean  and  Edouard,  had 
sung  at  Covent  Garden  during  the  season  of  1881. 
Meanwhile,  the  strength  of  Mr.  Mapleson's 
combination  at  Her  Majesty's,  already  seriously 
affected  by  the  death  of  Tietjens,  received  a  fatal 
blow  through  the  secession  of  Christine  Nilsson, 
who  retired  from  the  operatic  stage  in  1881.  This 
gifted  artist,  the  second  and  last  of  the  great 
^^ Swedish  Nightingales,''  was  one  of  the  most  re- 
markable singers  of  her  time.  Her  voice,  a  pure 
soprano  of  very  lovely  quality,  possessed  a  singu- 
larly pathetic  timbre,  a  curious  commingling  of 
sweetness  and  power,  to  which  she  allied  a  charm 
of  expression  that  was  absolutely  haunting. 
Moreover,  she  was  a  born  actress,  and  her  charac- 
teristic spontaneity  was  of  a  kind  that  enabled 
her  to  stamp  such  characters  as  Mignon,  Ophelia, 
Marguerite,  Alice,  and  Elsa  with  the  most  marked 
and  refreshing  individuality.  Christine  Nilsson 
had  been  about  eight  years  before  the  public 
when  I  first  heard  her  in  1872  at  Drury  Lane  in 
**  Robert  le  Diable";  and  her  impersonation  of 
Alice— the  favorite  role  of  her  renowned  country- 
woman Jenny  Lind— shone  resplendent  amid  a 
constellation  of  stars  that  included  Mongini  as 
Roberto,  Gardoni  as  Rambaldo,  Foli  as  Bertramo, 
and  lima  di  Murska  as  Isabella.  She  had  then 
just  returned  from  a  prolonged  concert-tour  in 
America,  and  her  marriage  at  Westminster  Abbey 
with  M.  Auguste  Rouzeaud  was  one  of  the  promi- 


154 


Musical  Life  in  London 


nent  events  of  the  season  of  1872.  Sixteen  years 
later  she  bade  her  final  farewell  to  British  audi- 
ences at  a  concert  given  at  the  Royal  Albert  Hall. 

The  financial  collapse  of  the  ^' Royal  Italian 
Opera''  occurred  after  the  season  of  1884.  I  do  not 
pretend  to  lay  bare  the  secrets  of  the  masterly  mis- 
management that  led  to  the  failure  of  the  company 
which  then  held  the  sub-lease  of  Covent  Garden. 
The  late  Earl  of  Lathom— most  gracious  and  ami- 
able of  Lord  Chamberlains— was  not,  perhaps,  a 
sufficiently  strong  man  to  preside  over  such  an 
enterprise.  Neither  Ernest  nor  Herbert  Gye  (co- 
directors  of  the  company)  had  inherited  the  ad- 
ministrative talents  of  his  father;  and  it  is  gen- 
erally supposed  that  Ernest,  who  had  been  for  some 
years  the  husband  of  Mme.  Albani,  was  consider- 
ably influenced  in  his  management  of  the  concern 
by  the  advice  of  his  wife,  one  of  the  principal  prime 
donne  of  the  establishment.  Apart  from  this,  the 
only  real  explanation  is  that  society  had  begun  to 
lose  interest  in  the  opera  as  a  social  function,  and 
chose  to  be  conspicuous  by  its  absence  on  all  but 
the  ^'Patti  nights.''  For  the  career  of  the  cele- 
brated diva  was  now  at  its  zenith,  her  wondrous 
voice  in  its  prime,  and  her  incomparable  vocaliza- 
tion had  become  absolutely  perfect.  Not  even  so- 
ciety could  afford  to  remain  away  when  the  magic 
name  of  Adelina  Patti  was  *  ^  in  the  bill. ' ' 

Yet  there  were  other  great  artists  in  the  troupe 
beside  those  whose  names  have  been  mentioned  in 
the  last  page  or  two.    A  host  in  herself  was  the 


^57 


Thirty  Years  of 


accomplished  and  captivating  Pauline  Lncca,  who, 
after  an  absence  of  ten  years,  returned  to  Covent 
Garden  in  1882  to  gratify  opera-goers  once  more 
with  her  unrivaled  impersonations  of  Selika  in 
*  ^  L ^Af ricaine, ' '  Cheruhino  in  ^'Le  Nozze,^'  Zerlina 
in  ^^Fra  Diavolo,'^  Leonora  in  ^'La  Favorita,''  and 
other  characters.  Despite  her  twenty- three  years 
upon  the  stage,  this  brilliant  artist  was  now  also  at 
her  best;  her  voice  had  lost  none  of  its  freshness, 
and  the  piquant  grace  of  her  style  and  the  marked 
originality  of  her  conceptions  were  even  more 
striking  than  before.  Her  Selika^  I  can  best  de- 
scribe in  a  single  word  as  a  ^' dream ''—a  supreme 
achievement  to  be  mentioned  in  the  same  breath 
with  the  Bosina  of  Adelina  Patti  and  the  Mar- 
guerite of  Christine  Nilsson.  Supported  by  Mier- 
zwinsky  as  Vasco  da  Gama,  Lassalle  as  NeluskOy 
Bagagiolo  as  Pedro,  and  Valleria  as  Inez,  Pauline 
Lucca's  performance  in  ^ ' L 'Af ricaine ' '  is  to  be 
folded  in  the  lavender  of  one's  memory.  She  was 
also  heard  here  then  for  the  first  time  in  ^^  Car- 
men''; and  her  impersonation  of  Bizet's  heroine, 
while  differing  in  many  essentials  from  Minnie 
Hank's,  was  distinguished  by  all  the  attributes  of 
voluptuous  charm,  subtle  power,  and  dramatic  in- 
tensity that  the  character  demands. 

I  owe  to  Pauline  Lucca,  or  Baroness  WallhofPen, 
as  she  then  was  in  private  life,  a  recollection  of  one 

*  Pauline  Lucca  studied  the  role  of  Selika  under  Meyerbeer, 
and  sang  it  on  the  first  production  of  ' '  L 'Af ricaine  "  in  England 
in  1865,  two  years  after  her  first  appearance  at  Covent  Garden.

of  the  most  enjoyable  evenings  I  have  ever  spent. 
During  the  summer  of  1884  she  graciously  ex- 
pressed a  wish  to  give  a  dinner  in  my  honor.  In 
mid-season,  however,  the  hard-worked  critic  has 
little  time  to  spare,  so  it  was  first  arranged  that 
the  dinner  should  come  off  on  a  Sunday.  After- 
ward it  was  found  necessary  to  postpone  the  date 
until  the  following  Wednesday.  Unfortunately,  a 
performance  of  ^  ^  Tristan ' '  was  announced  for  that 
day,  and,  as  I  felt  in  duty  bound  to  attend  it,  I 
wrote  the  baroness  a  letter  expressing  my  regret 
that  I  should  be  compelled  either  to  ask  for  a  fur- 
ther postponement,  or  else  deny  myself  the  pleasure 
of  coming  to  her  dinner.  In  reply  I  received  the 
following  characteristic  note: 


[Translated  from  the  German.] 

June  25,  1884. 
I  beg  you,  worthy  friend,  not  to  be  angry — it  is  im- 
possible for  me  to  choose  another  day.  You  can  go  on, 
anyhow,  to  the  opera  for  two  hours  afterward.  You 
know  "Tristan  und  Isolde"  is  long;  thus  you  will  not 
be  neglecting  your  duty,  for  which  I  should  never  for- 
give myself  were  I  the  cause.  We  will  sit  down  punctu- 
ally to  table.    With  hearty  greetings  from  house  to  house, 

Yours  truly, 

Pauline  Wallhoffen. 


It  was  impossible  to  resist  so  polite  and  persua- 
sive an  invitation.     I  went  to  the   dinner,   and

made  up  my  mind  not  to  miss  the  last  act  of 
' '  Tristan.  ^  ^  But  I  had  not  exactly  reckoned  upon 
the  nature  of  the  attractions  from  which  I  should 
have  to  tear  myself  away.  In  point  of  fact,  it  was 
a  remarkable  gathering.  Beside  the  prima  donna 
and  her  husband,  the  party  comprised  Mme.  Mar- 
cella  Sembrich  and  Herr  Stengel  (to  whom  then 
she  had  not  been  long  married),  Signor  and  Mme. 
Bevignani,  M.  Mierzwinsky,  M.  Edouard  de  Reszke, 
and  others.  The  meal  was  extremely  merry,  and  it 
lasted  a  couple  of  hours.  When  we  had  joined  the 
ladies  I  made  signs  indicative  of  an  early  depart- 
ure; but  my  hostess  simply  laughed  and  said: 
*'Now  we  have  got  you  here,  we  mean  to  keep 
you.  No  ^  Tristan '  to-night !  I  have  requested  a  fair 
young  violinist  to  play  expressly  for  you,  and  the 
Chevalier  Emil  Bach^  has  been  good  enough  to 
come  round  for  the  purpose  of  accompanying  her. '  ^ 
This  rather  chilled  me.  To  listen  to  ^  ^  fair  young 
violinists''  was  no  particular  novelty,  and  I  began 
to  feel  that  I  should  prefer  ** Tristan.''  But  I 
could  say  nothing,  and  waited  with  as  much  grace 
as  I  could  command.  In  due  time  the  *  *  young  vio- 
linist" was  announced.  The  door  opened,  and, 
who  should  enter,  fiddle  in  hand,  with  a  solemn 
bow,  but  Mme.  Sembrich,  laughing  mischievously 

*  Then  quite  a  newcomer  in  London.  He  settled  down  there 
as  a  pianist  and  teacher,  and  composed  the  operas  *  *  Irmengarda ' ' 
and  ' '  The  Lady  of  Longford,  ^ '  both  of  which  Sir  Augustus 
Harris  mounted  at  Covent  Garden.  Mr.  Bach  died  quite  suddenly 
in  1902.

and  ready  to  begin  her  solo.  I  then  remembered 
that  the  vivacious  little  Galician  lady,  who  had 
been  delighting  London  for  the  past  four  seasons, 
was  an  accomplished  violinist  as  well  as  a  brilliant 
singer.  She  played  us  piece  after  piece,  and  under 
the  spell  of  her  art  I  fear  duty  was  too  quickly 
forgotten.  My  hostess  was  right.  There  was  no 
*' Tristan"  for  me  that  night. 

In  this  year  (1884)  I  made  the  acquaintance  of 
Antonin  Dvorak,  who  came  to  London  for  the  pur- 
pose of  conducting  a  performance  of  his  ^'Stabat 
Mater. '^  The  work  had  made  a  great  sensation 
when  given  in  the  previous  year  by  the  London 
Musical  Society  under  Barnby.  It  was  again  per- 
formed at  the  Worcester  Festival  of  1884,  under 
the  composer ^s  direction;  and  he  came  over  yet  a 
third  time  to  conduct  his  cantata  ^^The  Spectre's 
Bride, ' '  which  he  wrote  expressly  for  the  Birming- 
ham Festival  of  1885.  During  this  last  visit, 
Dvorak  came  to  my  house  in  London  with  the  ob- 
ject of  giving  me  some  particulars  of  his  early 
life,  which  duly  appeared  in  the  ^  ^  Sunday  Times. ' ' 
His  name  at  that  period  was  scarcely  to  be  found 
in  a  single  musical  dictionary,  and  though  the  omis- 
sion has  since  been  rectified,  the  dates  and  details 
are  so  often  incorrect  that  it  may  be  worth  while 
for  me  to  give  here  the  story  of  Dvorak 's  romantic 
career,  told  as  nearly  as  possible  in  his  own  words : 

**Iwas  born  in  1841  at  Miihlhausen  (in  Bohemian, 
Nelahozeves),  about  four  miles  from  Kralup.  My 
parents  were  poor.    My  father  was  a  butcher  and 

163 


Thirty  Years  of 


intended  me  for  his  trade.  At  the  age  of  thirteen 
I  was  taking  lessons  in  singing  and  the  violin  from 
our  village  schoolmaster,  Josef  Spitz,  and  sang  in 
the  choir  on  Sundays.  At  fourteen,  perceiving  that 
I  had  musical  talent,  my  father  sent  me  to  live  with 
my  uncle  at  a  place  called  Zlonic  (near  Schau), 
where  I  was  taken  in  hand  by  the  organist,  Anton 
Liehmann,  and  in  1856  I  began  to  study  the  piano. 

*^In  Bohemia  every  child  must  learn  music  and, 
if  possible,  sing  in  church.  I  think  this  law  explains 
the  development  of  so  much  natural  talent  for 
music  in  my  country.  It  is  not  only  the  gipsies 
and  their  music  that  are  the  responsible  factors. 
There  are  the  beautiful  national  *  chorales,'  which 
the  people  so  dearly  love.  They  sing  them  as  they 
work  in  the  fields,  and  the  spirit  of  music  enters 
their  souls.  Of  course  they  love  to  dance — are 
they  not  Slavs?  Why,  after  church  they  revel  in 
music  and  dancing,  sometimes  until  early  morning ! 
In  fact,  it  is  the  favorite  amusement  of  the  race. 
Admission  to  these  dance-meetings  is  always  free, 
but  a  collection  is  made  afterward  for  the  musi- 
cians. I  used  to  be  among  the  fiddlers  and  received 
my  share,  which  I  always  gave  to  my  father. 

**  When  my  father  came  to  live  at  Zlonic  in  1856- 
1857,  he  taught  me  his  trade,  and  I  learned  how  to 
buy  sheep  and  kill  them.  But  I  liked  my  musical 
studies  better,  especially  now  that  I  could  begin 
to  read  a  little  and  dip  into  the  scores  of  such 
masses  as  Haydn's  in  D  minor,  Mozart's  in  C  ma- 
jor, and  Cherubini's  in  D  minor.    The  feeling  de-

veloped ;  I  wanted  to  try  to  write  something ;  but 
the  different  keys  for  the  clarinets,  the  bass  trum- 
pet, the  horns,  and  the  trombone  worried  me 
greatly.  Still,  I  was  too  proud  to  ask  for  these  to 
be  explained.  At  last  I  managed  to  write  a  polka, 
and  showed  it  to  my  teacher.  He  found  only  one 
mistake— in  the  trumpet  part,  which  should  have 
been  in  F  major.  I  carried  my  piece  home  in  tri- 
umph, and  it  was  tried  by  the  band.  But,  alas !  the 
whole  thing  to  my  ears  sounded  totally  wrong. 

^  ^  Then  I  began  to  work  at  counterpoint  and  the 
organ,  teaching  myself  most  of  the  time.  I  got 
hold  of  a  big  book  on  counterpoint,  full  of  '  figured 
bass, '  the  meaning  of  which  was  not  explained ;  but 
as  soon  as  I  understood  I  used  to  read  whole  masses 
from  the  'figured  bass.'  At  last  some  of  my  fa- 
ther's friends,  believing  that  I  possessed  real  talent, 
persuaded  him  to  send  me  to  Prague.  I  stayed 
with  some  relations,  and  was  allowed  eight  gulden 
(about  $3.60)  per  month  during  part  of  the  two 
years  (1857  to  1859)  that  I  spent  in  the  capital. 
I  entered  a  college  which  still  exists  for  the  instruc- 
tion of  organists  and  musical  directors,  and  be- 
came a  pupil  of  Josef  Pitsch.  On  his  death  I 
studied  under  his  successor,  a  very  clever  musician 
named  Krejci,  who  was  choirmaster  at  a  large 
church  and  took  me  there  to  sing  with  his  best 
pupils. 

*'My  studies  now  ended.  Of  instrumentation, 
it  is  true,  I  understood  very  little.  As  for  Mozart 
and  Beethoven,  I  only  just  knew  they  had  existed.

But  I  had  to  earn  a  living  somehow.  And  how 
was  it  to  be  done  1  Well,  I  thought,  I  can  play  the 
violin  decently,  I  must  try  to  get  a  place  in  a  band. 
So  I  went  to  a  Kapellmeister,  who  had  a  band  of 
eighteen  or  twenty,  and  asked  him  whether  he 
would  take  me.  He  engaged  me  to  play  the  viola 
at  twenty- two  gulden  ($9.90)  a  month,  and  I  was 
delighted.  I  also  joined  a  sextet  that  used  to  per- 
form regularly  at  a  lunatic  asylum,  and  there  I  was 
engaged  to  play  the  organ  for  the  Sunday  services. 
We  used  to  play  at  various  cafes,  giving  potpourris 
and  overtures  of  every  description;  and  I  remem- 
ber that  the  overture  to  ' '  Maritana ' '  was  frequently 
in  our  programme.    This  was  in  1860. 

^^One  Sunday  I  went  to  hear  ^Der  Freischiitz' 
at  the  German  Theatre.  The  Bohemian  National 
Theatre  was  not  yet  in  existence.  Bohemian  artists 
then  had  to  sing  in  German,  but,  as  a  concession, 
were  allowed  to  sing  an  opera  in  their  own  lan- 
guage every  Sunday  afternoon.  The  *  Freischiitz ' 
made  an  enormous  impression  on  me;  but  I  could 
not  afford  the  necessary  ten  kreutzers  (40  cents) 
very  often.  I  used  to  contrive,  however,  to  hear 
good  concerts  occasionally  by  slipping  into  the 
orchestra  and  hiding  behind  the  drums.  In  this 
way  I  saw  Spohr  in  1859,  when  he  conducted  a 
grand  concert  to  celebrate  the  fiftieth  anniversary 
of  the  Prague  Conservatoire ;  and  then  it  was  that 
I  heard  Beethoven's  ^choral'  symphony  for  the 
first  time. 

^'In  1861  I  wrote  my  first  two  serious  composi- 

i66

tions,  the  string  quintet  in  G  and  the  quartet  in  A 
minor.  I  persuaded  some  friends  to  play  the 
quintet,  and  they  were  rather  pleased  with  it.  It 
reminded  them  of  Haydn,  Mozart,  and  early  Bee- 
thoven. Thereupon  I  showed  it  to  my  teacher, 
Krejci,  and  was  very  proud  when  he  expressed 
himself  contented.  Next  year  the  new  National 
Theatre  was  built,  and  I  was  engaged  to  play  in 
the  orchestra.  The  first  operas  given  were  Bellini 's 
^Capuletti  ed  i  Montecchi'  and  'Norma,'  Rossini's 
'Otello,'  and  Cherubini's  'Water-Carrier.'  In 
1863  I  went  to  Hamburg  to  play  in  the  band  at  the 
exliibition.  At  home  in  Prague  we  all  lived  in  the 
same  house,  and  my  companions  used  to  laugh  at 
me  for  working  so  hard  at  composing— one  espe- 
cially who  is  now  a  Kapellmeister  and  conducts  my 
operas.  But  I  persevered,  and  had  the  good  for- 
tune to  make  the  acquaintance  of  a  valuable  musical 
friend  in  Karl  Bendl,  who  used  to  lend  me  his 
scores.  Among  other  works,  I  studied  the  quartets 
of  Onslow  and  Beethoven's  septet,  and  so  gradu- 
ally developed  fresh  ideas. 

"Most  of  my  compositions  of  that  epoch  are  long 
since  torn  up  or  burned;  and  I  wrote  quantities 
of  stuff  after  I  had  thrown  up  my  theatre  engage- 
ment and  taken  to  teaching  in  order  to  have  more 
time  to  compose.  I  had  now  (1871)  a  great  am- 
bition to  write  an  opera.  I  found  a  libretto  en- 
titled 'Konig  und  Kohler'  (King  and  Collier)  and 
set  to  work  upon  it.  In  due  time  I  submitted  the 
score  to  the  manager  of  the  National  Theatre,  who 

167 


Thirty  Years  of 


ordered  it  to  be  tried  at  rehearsal.  I  confess  it 
was  very  Wagnerian.  I  had  heard  'Die  Meister- 
singer,'  and  the  new  influence  was  very  strong 
upon  me.  My  music  was  horribly  difficult.  At  the 
piano  rehearsals  the  singers  could  make  little  of  it ; 
with  the  chorus  it  was  still  worse— infinitely  more 
difficult,  they  said,  than  Wagner.  Ultimately  every- 
body laughed  at  me,  and  my  opera  was  refused.^ 
Four  years  later  I  completely  rewrote  the  score, 
more  in  the  national  style,  and  made  it  easy  to  sing 
and  play.  It  was  then  produced  with  great  suc- 
cess, and  helped  my  reputation  materially. 

''In  1874  I  was  appointed  organist  of  St.  Adal- 
bert's Church,  at  the  enormous  salary  of  one  hun- 
dred and  sixty  gulden  ($72)  per  annum,  for  which 
I  had  to  get  up  at  half-past  five  o  'clock  every  morn- 
ing. The  payment  worked  out  at  about  two 
kreutzers  (eight  cents)  per  mass.  Meanwhile,  too, 
I  had  indulged  in  the  luxury  of  taking  to  myself 
a  wife,  a  very  musical  Prague  lady,  who  for  many 
years  sang  contralto  in  one  of  the  churches. 

"At  last,  in  1875,  I  was  granted  the  'artist'  sti- 
pend of  four  hundred  gulden  (for  one  year  only) 
from  the  Kultusministerium  at  Vienna.  To  ob- 
tain this  I  had  sent  in  as  'exercises'  my  opera  and 
my  symphony  in  F,  Op.  25.  The  second  year  I 
sent  in  my  'Stabat  Mater'  and  my  grand  opera 

^  Dvorak'  was  not  ashamed  to  acknowledge  that  he  was  at  this 
time  very  much  influenced  in  his  harmony  and  instrumentation  by 
Wagner.  He  saw  him  conduct,  and  used  to  follow  the  master 
as  he  walked  the  streets  of  Prague.     He  admired  him  immensely.

*  Wanda/  which  was  played  a  few  months  later 
with  immense  success.  Yet  from  these  works  no 
stipend  resulted  [!].  I  tried  again  by  adding  my 
pianoforte  concerto,  the  piano  variations  in  A  flat, 
and  the  string  quartet  in  D  minor,  and  this  time 
was  favored  with  an  allowance  of  five  hundred 
gulden.  Next  year,  through  the  influence  of  Jo- 
hannes Brahms,  Edward  Hanslick,  and  Herbeck, 
the  sum  was  raised  to  six  hundred  gulden. 

^^I  now  wrote  to  Brahms  and  asked  him  if  he 
would  Idndly  use  his  influence  with  some  publishers 
to  bring  out  my  compositions.  He  replied  that  he 
would  be  happy  to  do  so,  and  a  little  later  on  I 
received  a  satisfactory  communication  from  Sim- 
rock,  of  Berlin,  who  afterward  told  me  I  was  the 
first  person  on  whose  behalf  Brahms  had  yet  in- 
terested himself.  Simrock  paid  me  nothing  for  my 
^  Marischen '  duets,  but  he  asked  me  to  compose  the 
'Slavische  Tanze,'  and  gave  me  three  hundred 
marks  ($75)  for  them.  That  was  the  first  money 
I  ever  received  for  a  composition. ' ' 

And  here  Dvorak 's  narrative  ceased.  I  need  add 
naught  to  it  concerning  the  years  that  came  after, 
for  their  history  is  as  an  ^^open  book''  both  to  the 
Old  and  to  the  New  World,  where  the  gifted  Bohe- 
mian has  been  a  leading  light  and  a  familiar  figure. 
One  of  the  most  original  and  remarkable  creative 
musicians  of  our  era,  he  is  also  one  of  those  whom 
success  has  not  spoiled.  But  if  the  pen  of  this  great 
and  modest  genius  be  less  active,  less  prolific,  than 
of  yore,  it  is  only  necessary  to  glance  at  the  story

Thirty  Years  of 


of  those  strenuous  early  days  to  understand  why 
Antonin  Dvorak  is  a  little  tired,  and  not  unwilling 
to  continue  the  otiiim  cum  dignitate,  or  at  least  to 
work  lightly  and  at  his  ease,  during  the  remaining 
years  of  his  existence. 

Another  famous  contemporary  composer  whom 
I  am  proud  to  count  among  my  best  friends  is 
Camille  Saint- Saens.  I  was  introduced  to  him  by 
Signor  Garcia,  whom  he  used  to  visit  at  Bentinck 
Street  whenever  he  came  to  London.  At  that  period 
he  was  regarded  by  English  amateurs  (ignorant  as 
yet  of  the  very  existence  of  Cesar  Franck  and  his 
disciples)  as  the  leader  of  the  advanced  French 
school.  Orthodox  musicians  considered  him  ec- 
centric ;  more  modern  thinkers  admired  his  mixture 
of  Teutonic  severity  with  the  ultra-saccharine 
melodiousness  of  Gounod.  Both  parties  agreed  to 
recognize  in  the  then  organist  of  the  Paris  Made- 
leine (a  post  held  by  Saint-Saens  from  1858  until 
1877)  a  musician  of  prodigious  talent,  endowed 
with  a  versatility  that  enabled  him  to  shine  in  every 
branch  of  his  art,  and  possessed  of  a  mastery  of 
technique  that  could  adapt  itself  to  whatsoever 
style  he  might  for  the  moment  choose  to  exploit. 
He  was  as  brilliant  a  pianist  as  he  was  an  organist, 
—his  habit  of  playing  the  one  instrument  never 
spoiled  his  exquisite  touch  for  the  other,— and  his 
gift  of  improvisation  was  marvelous. 

Saint-Saens  made  his  debut  in  London,  in  1871, 
at  the  Musical  Union ;  but  I  did  not  hear  him  until 
1879,  when  he  played  his  own  pianoforte  concerto

in  G  minor  at  the  Philharmonic.  He  was  then 
anxiously  canvassing  the  chances  of  mounting  his 
new  opera,  *^  Samson  et  Dalila/'  which  had  been 
produced  at  Weimar  in  1877,  under  the  auspices  of 
his  friend  Franz  Liszt,  but  had  not  yet  been 
granted  a  hearing  in  the  composer's  own  country.^ 
He  quickly  learned,  however,  that  our  puritanical 
laws  precluded  all  likelihood  of  his  biblical  opera 
finding  its  way  to  the  English  stage.  During  the 
next  few  years  we  became  very  close  friends.  I 
always  called  upon  him  when  I  went  to  Paris,  and 
he  rarely  missed  coming  to  see  me  when  he  was  in 
London. 

One  of  these  visits  happened  at  a  very  sad  mo- 
ment. I  was  out  when  M.  Saint-Saens  called  at 
Bentinck  Street,  and  he  found  the  members  of  my 
family  in  a  state  of  terrible  agitation.  One  of  my 
younger  brothers  had  been  playing  with  a  pistol 
and  had  accidentally  shot  himself  through  the 
head.  He  had  expired  only  a  few  minutes  before. 
The  youngest  boy,  Manuel,^  who  had  witnessed  the 

^ ' '  Samson  et  Dalila ' '  was  not  actually  heard  in  France  until 
1890,  when  it  was  brought  out  at  Eouen  with  the  late  Elena  Sanz 
as  Dalila.  This  clever  artist  also  took  part  in  the  first  concert 
representation  of  the  work  in  England  during  the  Promenade 
Concert  season  at  Covent  Garden  in  1893.  ''Samson"  has  never 
yet  been  performed  upon  the  stage  in  England. 

^  Some  ten  years  later  Manuel  went  to  reside  in  New  York, 
where  our  brothers  Alfred  and  Charles  had  already  earned  promi- 
nent positions — the  first  as  an  actor,  the  second  as  a  dramatist. 
Deciding  to  adopt  a  musical  career,  Manuel  seriously  took  up  the 
study  of  composition,  and  in  due  time  published  several  songs 
and  pianoforte  pieces  which  met  with  favor.    His  first  substantial

mishap,  endeavored  to  explain  what  had  occurred 
to  M.  Saint-Saens.  He  caught  the  words  ^'mon 
frere''  and  ''inort,"  and  immediately  jumped  to 
the  conclusion  that  it  was  I  who  was  dead.  He 
burst  into  tears,  and  was  so  much  affected  that 
some  time  elapsed  before  he  could  be  made  to  un- 
derstand that  I  was  not  the  victim.  Later  in  the 
day  we  met,  and  the  warm-hearted  Frenchman 
gave  me  an  embrace  that  showed  plainly  his  glad- 
ness at  once  more  seeing  me  in  the  flesh. 

Finding  that  England  was  a  much  likelier  ground 
for  oratorio  than  opera,  he  arranged  through 
Messrs.  Novello  for  the  performance  of  his  at- 
tractive setting  of  Psalm  xix,  '^The  Heavens  de- 
clare,'' which  was  duly  performed  (and  very  badly 
into  the  bargain)  by  the  Sacred  Harmonic  Society 
at  St.  James's  Hall  in  1885.  Two  years  later  a 
much  better  rendering  of  the  psalm  was  given  at 
the  Norwich  Festival  under  Mr.  Randegger.  Mean- 
while Saint-Saens  had  expressed  to  me  his  desire 
to  write  an  oratorio  upon  the  subject  of  Moses,  and 
asked  me  whether  I  would  furnish  him  with  the 
necessary  biblical  text.  I  readily  consented,  and, 
after  arranging  the  plan  with  him,  set  to  work  upon 
my  task.  In  a  few  weeks  I  sent  the  text  to  Paris. 
He  was  not  entirely  satisfied,  and  returned  it  for 
alterations.    These  evidently  answered  the  purpose, 

success,  however,  was  the  musical  piece  ''Mr.  Pickwick,'^  which 
he  wrote  in  collaboration  with  Charles  and  conducted  during  its 
run  at  the  Herald  Square  Theatre,  New  York,  in  the  winter  of 
1903.

for,  toward  the  end  of  1886,  he  wrote  me :  ^  ^  I  find 
that  now  it  is  all  right.  The  monotony  which  made 
me  uneasy  exists  no  longer. '^  After  this  I  heard 
nothing  until  he  came  to  London  in  the  following 
June.  He  then  gave  some  recitals,  and  accom- 
plished his  memorable  feat  of  performing  his  own 
four  pianoforte  concertos  at  one  sitting,^  which, 
as  it  took  place  on  the  anniversary  of  Waterloo, 
was  generally  supposed  to  be  intended  as  a  revenge 
for  the  defeat  of  the  French  in  that  immortal  battle. 
During  the  holidays  I  called  upon  the  wayward 
master  when  passing  through  Paris,  but  he  was 
out  of  town.  Still  without  news  of  ^^ Moses,''  I 
wrote  him  a  long  account  of  the  success  of  his  psalm 
at  Norwich,  and  that  I  was  hoping  to  arrange  for 
the  production  of  the  new  oratorio  there.  I  re- 
ceived in  reply  the  following  letter: 

[Translated  from  the  French.] 

Paris,  October  18,  1887. 
My  dear  Friend: 

Nothing  could  be  more  agreeable  than  the  news  you 
give  me  of  my  Psalm.  I  cannot  console  myself  for  not 
having  gone  to  hear  it;  I  was  detained  in  Paris  by  some 
business  at  the  opera.  When  you  were  in  Paris  I  was 
compelled  to  leave  hurriedly  for  Boulogne.  I  sent  you 
a  telegram  from  Creil  asking  you  to  come  and  dine  with 
me  the  following  day;  but,  whether  through  a  mistake 
in  the  address,  or  some  other  cause,  the  telegram  never 
reached  you. 

^St.  James's  Hall,  June  18,  1887;  Mr.  W.  Ganz,  conductor.

Should  the  oratorio  be  arranged  for  Norwich,  I  shall 
be  very  glad.  I  shall,  as  you  say,  have  all  the  necessary 
time  for  devoting  myself  entirely  to  it,  which  seems  to 
me  indispensable  for  a  work  of  this  magnitude.  You 
will  undertake  to  negotiate  with  a  publisher;  I  should 
very  much  like  Novello.  .  .  .  ''Moi'se"  will  probably  be 
my  last  work.    It  must  worthily  crown  my  career ! 

Your  faithful  and  affectionate, 

C.  Saint-Saens. 

But  the  Fates  were  not  kind  to  ^^Moi'se."  The 
Norwich  authorities  were  unwilling  to  pledge  them- 
selves so  long  beforehand  to  accept  a  work  of  un- 
known proportions.  I  then  opened  negotiations 
with  the  Leeds  committee ;  but  difficulties  were  also 
raised  in  that  direction,  and  in  the  midst  of  the 
delay  it  came  to  the  ears  of  Saint-Saens  that  Anton 
Rubinstein  was  just  completing  a  biblical  opera  in 
eight  tableaux,  entitled  ^^ Moses/'  which  would 
shortly  be  produced  at  St.  Petersburg  or  Moscow.^ 
This  was  enough  for  the  French  composer.  He 
at  once  relinquished  all  idea  of  writing  an  oratorio 
upon  the  subject.  I  asked  him  to  return  my  text, 
and  after  a  few  weeks  it  came  back  accom^Danied 
by  the  following  brief  epistle : 

Voici  ''Moise,"  et  avec  lui  mes  meilleurs  amities. 

C.  Saint-Saens. 

^  As  a  matter  of  fact,  Rubinstein  had  been  engaged  for  nearly 
twenty  ye5,rs  upon  this  big  work,  which,  however,  Avas  not  produced 
until  1894.  It  was  then  mounted  at  Riga  with  a  company  of  no 
fewer  than  four  hundred  performers,  and  upon  a  scale  of  the 
utmost  scenic  grandeur.

THERE  was,  for  musical  dwellers  in  London, 
something  almost  providential  in  the  visit 
paid  by  Franz  Liszt  during  the  spring  of  1886.  He 
had  not  stood  upon  British  soil  for  forty-five  years. 
There  seemed  to  be  but  the  remotest  likelihood  that, 
at  the  age  of  seventy-five,  he  would  ever  trouble 
himself  again  to  travel  over  land  and  sea  to  a  coun- 
try whose  attitude  toward  him  and  his  works  had 
invariably  been  chilly  and  unsympathetic.  But  the 
persuasions  of  his  pupil  and  protagonist,  Walter 
Bache,  who  worked  so  long  and  lovingly  to  obtain 
recognition  and  appreciation  for  his  master's 
works,  at  last  proved  effectual.  On  the  evening 
of  April  3  he  arrived.  On  the  morning  of  the  20th 
he  departed.  Three  months  later— on  the  night  of 
July  31— he  died  at  Bayreuth  of  pneumonia,  re- 
sulting from  a  bronchial  cold,  which  he  aggravated 
by  attending  one  of  the  first  performances  of 

177 


Thirty  Years  of 


'' Tristan  und  Isolde,"  given  at  his  old  friend 
Richard  Wagner's  Biihnenfestspielhaus. 

I  was  one  of  a  party  of  guests  invited  to  meet 
the  Abbe  Liszt  on  the  night  of  Saturday,  April  3, 
at  Westwood  House,  Sydenham,  where  he  was  to 
be  the  guest  of  Mr.  Henry  Littleton  (then  head  of 
the  firm  of  Novello  &  Co.)  during  his  stay  in  Eng- 
land. I  went  early,  and  was  just  in  time  to  see  him 
welcomed  by  his  host  after  a  fatiguing  journey 
from  Paris.  He  had  been  met  at  Dover  by  Mr. 
Alfred  Littleton,  the  eldest  son  and  present  head 
of  the  house,  who  gave  me  an  interesting  account  of 
the  trip.  There  could  be  no  doubt  that  Liszt  was 
extremely  dubious  concerning  our  real  feelings 
toward  him.  In  fact,  the  position  was  very  much 
akin  to  that  in  which  Wagner  had  stood  nine  years 
before,  only  with  this  important  difference:  that 
Wagner  came  ^'professionally,"  for  the  purpose 
of  extracting  British  gold  from  British  pockets, 
whereas  Liszt  was  here,  purely  in  a  private  capa- 
city, to  attend  some  performances  of  his  works.  He 
was  simply  nervous,  therefore,  lest,  being  no  longer 
a  public  artist,  he  should  be  shining  in  the  reflected 
light  of  his  past  glories  as  a  virtuoso  in  an  at- 
mosphere that  was  uncongenial  to  him  as  a  cre- 
ative musician. 

An  hour  after  his  arrival  he  entered  the  vast  oak- 
paneled  apartment  which  had  just  been  added  as 
a  music-room  to  Westwood  House.  It  was  crowded 
with  all  the  musical  notabilities  then  in  London, 
every  one  of  them  anxious  to  gaze  upon  the  visage 

178 


Musical  Life  in  London 


of  the  man  who  was  then  perhaps  the  most  inter- 
esting musical  figure  in  the  world.  Dressed  in  his 
semi-priestly  garb,  the  venerable  abbe  walked 
slowly  down  the  steps  leading  to  the  floor  of  the 
room,  and  smiled  graciously  upon  the  groups  that 
saluted  him  as  he  passed.  He  looked  somewhat 
tired,  and  it  was  remarked  by  those  who  knew  him 
that  he  had  aged  considerably  during  the  last  few 
years.  But  his  still  bright  eye,  his  still  brilliant 
powers  of  conversation,  his  still  industrious  habits, 
all  precluded  the  smallest  suspicion  that  the  end 
was  so  near.  His  attention  that  evening  was 
largely  monopolized  by  old  friends;  still,  many 
new  ones  were  brought  to  his  notice,  and  I  had  the 
pleasure  of  being  introduced  with  a  kind  word  or 
two  by  the  loyal  and  indefatigable  Walter  Bache, 
who,  with  others,  took  part  in  a  programme  of  his 
compositions. 

Liszt  himself  did  not  then  play,  though,  when 
spending  subsequent  evenings  at  home  in  the  Lit- 
tleton family  circle,  he  almost  always  went  to  the 
piano  of  his  own  accord  and  enchanted  them  with 
some  piece  or  improvisation  of  his  own.  Once  he 
surprised  them  by  extemporizing  marvelously  upon 
themes  from  his  oratorio  ^'St.  Elizabeth,"  per- 
formances of  which  he  attended  both  at  St.  James 's 
Hall  and  the  Crystal  Palace.  The  welcome  he  re- 
ceived everywhere  exceeded  in  warmth  and  spon- 
taneity the  expectations  of  his  most  fanatical 
admirers.  Still  more  did  the  scenes  enacted  dur- 
ing his  stay  astonish  this  most  petted  and  feted

of  septuagenarians,  with  whom— anywhere  outside 
^^cold,  unmusical  England"— such  outbursts  of 
enthusiasm  had  been  the  concomitants  of  a  life- 
time. 

I  first  heard  him  play  on  April  6,  when  he  went 
to  the  Royal  Academy  to  hand  over  to  the  com- 
mittee of  management  the  sum  of  £1100,  raised 
through  the  efforts  of  Walter  Bache  for  the  founda- 
tion of  a  ^' Liszt  scholarship"  at  that  institution. 
The  shout  of  joy  uttered  by  the  students  when  he 
sat  down  at  the  piano  was  something  to  remember. 
It  was  followed  by  an  intense  silence.  Then  the 
aged  but  still  nimble  fingers  ran  lightly  over  the 
keys,  and  I  was  listening  for  the  first  time  in  my 
life  to  Franz  Liszt.  To  attempt  to  describe  his 
playing,  after  the  many  well-known  Weimar  pupils 
and  distinguished  writers  who  have  tried  to  ac- 
complish that  task,  would  be  mere  presumption  on 
my  part.  Even  at  seventy-five,  Liszt  was  a  pianist 
whose  powers  lay  beyond  the  pale  to  which  sober 
language  or  calm  criticism  could  reach  or  be  ap- 
plied. Enough  that  his  greatest  charm  seemed  to 
me  to  lie  in  a  perfectly  divine  touch,  and  in  a  tone 
more  remarkable  for  its  exquisitely  musical  qual- 
ity than  for  its  volume  or  dynamic  force,  aided 
by  a  technique  still  incomparably  brilliant  and 
superb. 

Two  days  later  Liszt  proceeded  to  Windsor 
Castle,  where  he  was  received  with  the  utmost  cor- 
diality by  Queen  Victoria.  He  played  several  pieces 
to  Her  Majesty,  who  told  him  that  she  cherished  a

vivid  recollection  of  his  playing  when  he  last  visited 
London  in  1841.  On  his  return  to  town  in  the 
evening,  he  attended  a  reception  given  in  his  honor 
at  the  Grosvenor  Gallery  by  Walter  Bache.  This 
was  in  some  respects  the  most  striking  function 
of  the  series.  The  gathering  was  in  every  sense 
a  representative  one,  and  the  famous  abbe,  as  he 
went  round  chatting  from  group  to  group,  seemed 
positively  radiant  with  happiness.  To  repeat  his 
own  words,  addressed  to  myself:  ''You  have  so 
overwhelmed  me  with  kindness  in  this  country  that 
I  shall  be  quite  sorry  when  the  time  comes  for 
me  to  leave  you. ' '  The  programme  comprised  his 
' '  Angelus ' '  for  strings,  a  chorus  for  female  voices, 
a  pianoforte  piece,  and  some  songs;  and  finally, 
amid  a  scene  of  great  excitement,  he  himself 
played  the  finale  of  Schubert's  ''Divertissement 
a  la  Hongroise ' '  and  his  own  Hungarian  rhapsody 
in  A  minor.  This  glorious  treat  furnished  the 
crowning  feature  of  a  memorable  evening— doubly 
memorable  because  it  was  the  last  time  but  one 
that  Franz  Liszt  touched  his  instrument  in  the 
presence  of  a  public  or  quasi-public  assemblage. 

It  was  a  very  strange  coincidence  that  the  season 
which  witnessed  Liszt's  final  adieu  to  England 
should  have  likewise  been  the  occasion  of  Anton 
Eubinstein's  last  visit.  The  one  left  in  April;  the 
other  came  in  May.  Wjthin  a  period  of  six  weeks 
we  heard  and  saw,  for  the  last  time,  the  two  great- 
est pianists  that  the  world  had  then  known.  The 
leonine  Russian  gave  at  St.  James's  Hall  that  won-

derful  series  of  ^^ Historical  Recitals''  which  has 
since  become  historical  in  every  sense— that  mar- 
velously  comprehensive  cycle  wherein  he  illustrated 
the  progress  and  development  of  pianoforte  music 
from  its  earliest  epoch  down  to  the  penultimate 
decade  of  the  nineteenth  century.  It  was,  alike 
mentally  and  physically,  an  extraordinary  tour  de 
force.  No  one  save  Eubinstein  would  have  at- 
tempted the  Herculean  feat  involved  in  the  execu- 
tion of  such  programmes.  What  must  the  task 
have  been  for  the  executant,  if  the  bare  labor  of 
listening  was  an  exhausting  process!  But  Eubin- 
stein was  a  giant,  and  the  considerations  that  ap- 
plied to  ordinary  pianists  did  not  arise  in  his  case. 
These  recitals  yielded  the  largest  sum  ever  taken 
at  St.  James's  Hall  for  a  series  of  seven  concerts, 
the  gross  receipts  amounting  to  £6000  ($30,000). 
An  extra  recital  was  given,  and  out  of  the  proceeds 
Rubinstein  divided  £300  ($1500)  among  various 
charitable  institutions. 

The  fortunes  of  Italian  opera  were  now  at  their 
lowest  ebb.  The  season  of  1885  had  been  al- 
most wholly  barren,  and  that  of  1886  was  little 
better.  Incapacity  and  indifference  reached  their 
climax  with  the  disgraceful  and  humiliating  scene 
that  occurred  at  Her  Majesty's  Theatre  on  the 
night  of  March  6,  1886.  Some  unknown  person, 
evidently  without  experience  as  a  manager,  had 
there  started  a  season  of  Italian  opera  with  a  com- 
pany of  incompetent  artists.  On  the  fourth  night 
it  completely  collapsed  under  circumstances  un-

precedented  in  the  annals  of  opera  in  a  great 
city.  I  quote  my  own  description^  of  what  oc- 
curred. 

The  second  act  of  ''Faust"  had  concluded  when  the 
orchestra  refused  to  proceed  further  unless  their  salaries 
were  instantly  paid.  Their  claims  were  partly  satisfied, 
and,  after  an  interval  of  inordinate  length,  in  the  course 
of  which  the  audience  displayed  the  noisiest  impatience, 
the  opera  proceeded  for  another  act,  with  the  accom- 
paniment of  about  half  the  band.  But  the  crisis  had 
only  been  deferred.  After  the  curtain  had  fallen  again 
there  was  another  long  "wait,"  and  the  disturbances 
recommenced.  At  length,  in  response  to  deafening  calls, 
the  stage-manager  came  forward  and  announced  that  it 
was  impossible  to  proceed.  The  stage-carpenters  had 
refused  to  set  the  next  scene,  and  the  opera  could  not, 
therefore,  go  on.  A  howl  of  derision  and  anger  greeted 
this  statement;  but  the  audience,  having  made  up  its 
mind  to  the  worst,  was  preparing,  amid  a  fearful  din, 
to  depart,  when  the  curtain  rose  once  more  and  a  whole 
army  of  stage  assistants  came  down  to  the  footlights  with 
outstretched  arms  and  aprons,  as  though  to  implore  the 
charity  of  the  house.  The  gestures  were  understood,  and, 
with  one  accord,  the  remaining  occupants  of  the  gallery 
and  upper  tiers  began  flinging  a  shower  of  coppers  and 
small  silver  coins  down  on  to  the  stage,  uttering  the 
while  all  sorts  of  satirical  and  uncomplimentary  epithets. 
However,  the  occupation  was  too  expensive  to  last  long, 
and  in  a  minute  or  two  this  disgraceful  episode  came 
to  a  termination,  ending  also  a  night  of  horrors  that  will 
never  be  forgotten  by  those  who  witnessed  it.

Thirty  Years  of 


After  this  Her  Majesty's  remained  closed  for  over 
a  year.  Mapleson  was  too  much  in  debt  to  dare 
start  upon  any  fresh  speculation;  and,  indeed, 
so  sore  was  his  plight  that  his  old  friend  Mme. 
Patti  felt  constrained  to  come  forward  later  in 
the  year  and  appear  in  a  performance  of  '  ^  II  Bar- 
biere'^  at  Drury  Lane  for  the  benefit  of  the  un- 
lucky impresario.  Meanwhile  Covent  Garden  was 
tenantless,  and  it  seemed  in  the  highest  degree 
probable  that  we  should  experience  the  novelty  of 
a  London  season  completely  without  Italian  opera. 
The  man  who  prevented  that  calamity  (if  calam- 
ity it  may  be  termed)  was  Signor  Lago,  formerly 
regisseur  at  Covent  Garden  under  the  management 
of  the  Gyes,  father  and  son.  With  the  support 
of  the  tenor  Gayarre  and  some  financial  backing, 
the  new  impresario  contrived  to  form  a  capital 
troupe  and  to  give  a  short  but  respectable  sea- 
son of  opera.  Although  he  brought  out  no  nov- 
elties, he  introduced  several  new  artists  worth 
hearing— among  them  Ella  Russell,  Giulia  Valda, 
and  Francesco  D  'Andrade,  all  of  whom  made  their 
mark.  The  company  also  included  artists  like  Al- 
bani,  Scalchi,  Cepeda,  Gayarre,  Pandolfini,  and 
Maurel,  with  Bevignani  as  the  conductor.  Of 
course,  a  solitary  undertaking  such  as  this  could 
not  suffice  to  retrieve  the  fortunes  of  Italian  opera. 
It  served,  however,  to  prove  that  the  genus,  if 
moributid  in  Great  Britain,  was  not  yet  utterly 
extinct,  and  its  repetition  in  the  following  year 
helped  still  further  to  reawaken  public  interest

and  engender  the  confidence  which  ultimately 
made  possible  the  real  revival.  In  his  way,  there- 
fore, Signor  Lago  did  palpable  service  to  the 
cause  of  opera  in  London ;  but  he  had  neither  the 
Napoleonic  spirit  nor  the  administrative  ability 
and  courage  for  carrying  his  mission  through  to 
the  true  goal. 

It  is  worth  pausing  for  a  moment  to  note  how 
quickly  the  popularity  of  Wagner  was  rising  at  this 
period.  Only  the  distant  onlooker  could  perceive 
how  large  a  place  the  master  was  beginning  to  fill 
in  the  hearts  of  English  music-lovers.  Failing  the 
opportunity  for  hearing  his  complete  works  upon 
the  stage,  they  had  perforce  to  be  content  to  hear 
them,  either  whole  or  in  part,  upon  the  concert 
platform.  The  demand  for  this  kind  of  thing  be- 
came remarkable,  and  it  was  satisfied  by  the  most 
conservative  as  well  as  the  most  advanced  musical 
institutions.  Imagine  two  concert  performances 
of  ^^ Parsifal"  (with  very  few  cuts,  moreover)  be- 
ing given  in  London  only  a  couple  of  years  after 
the  first  production  of  that  glorious  music-drama 
at  Bayreuth!  Yet  this  was  actually  done  in  the 
autumn  of  1884  by  the  Royal  Choral  Society,  under 
Joseph  Barnby,  with  Therese  Malten  (the  orig- 
inal Kiindry),  Gudehus,  and  Scaria  in  the  principal 
parts.  And  really  the  exacting  work  was  very 
creditably  interpreted.  By  the  way,  Malten  and 
Gudehus  were  again  in  London  in  1886,  when  they 
sang  at  the  Richter  Concerts  in  long  excerpts  from 
^ '  Tristan ' '  and  ' '  Siegfried, ' '  supported  by  Pauline

Cramer  and  Georg  Henschel.  I  never  cared  par- 
ticularly for  the  tenor— his  voice  was  always  hard 
and  metallic;  but  Malten's  noble  organ  was  never 
in  grander  condition,  and  she  sang  with  a  degree 
of  dramatic  intensity  and  emotional  warmth  that 
was  absolutely  thrilling. 

The  success  of  Hans  Richter  in  England  contin- 
ued to  be  extraordinary.  Indeed,  after  a  time  it 
began  to  create  something  of  a  feeling  of  jealousy 
among  those  purely  British  musicians  who  then 
held,  and,  perhaps,  not  unjustly,  that  their  country 
had  too  long  been  the  happy  hunting-ground  of 
^'distinguished  foreigners"  generally,  and  of  for- 
eign conductors  in  particular.  The  feeling,  how- 
ever, did  not  find  expression  openly  until  after  the 
appointment  of  Richter  to  succeed  the  late  Sir 
Michael  Costa  as  conductor  of  the  Birmingham 
Festival.  This  proceeding  evoked  a  display  of 
actual  resentment.  For  my  own  part,  I  failed  to 
see  that  it  was  called  for  in  the  case  of  a  man  of 
such  commanding  genius;  so  I  plainly  stated  that 
I  approved  the  appointment  and  could  not  sym- 
pathize with  those  who  objected  to  it.  My  remarks 
brought  me  a  shoal  of  deprecatory  letters— among 
them  the  following  one  from  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan :

Musical  Life  in  London 


I  think  all  this  musical  education  for  the  English  is 
vain  and  idle,  as  they  are  not  allowed  the  opportunity 
of  earning  their  living  in  their  own  country.  Foreigners 
are  thrust  in  everywhere,  and  the  press  supports  this 
injustice.  If  we  had  no  men  who  could  do  the  work  I 
should  say  nothing — but  we  have. 

Yours  very  truly, 

Arthur  Sullivan. 

Now  let  me  say  at  once  that  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan 
was  incapable  of  entertaining  sentiments  of  mean 
and  petty  jealousy.  As  conductor  of  the  Leeds 
Festival,— a  post  which  brought  all  the  honor  and 
labor  that  he  sought  in  this  direction,— he  did  not 
desire  Birmingham  for  himself.  Neither  did  he 
refuse  to  admit  the  application  to  his  own  art  of 
the  essentially  British  principle  of  ''free  trade. ^' 
His  motto  was  simply,  ' '  Charity  begins  at  home ' ' ; 
and,  if  he  felt  strongly  on  the  subject,  it  was  be- 
cause he  had  seen  in  the  course  of  his  career  too 
much  of  that  ''thrusting  in  of  foreigners"  which 
was  the  curse  of  English  musical  life  during  the 
greater  part  of  the  nineteenth  century.  As  prin- 
cipal of  the  National  Training  Schoolfor  Music,^ 
he  had  had  practical  experience  of  the  difficulty 
in  finding  lucrative  employment  for  young  native 
executants.  Hence  his  conviction  that  if  money 
were  spent  upon  their  education,  it  was  only  fair 

^  Opened  in  1876  with  eighty-two  free  scholarships  and  car- 
ried on  until  1882,  when  it  was  absorbed  by  the  larger  institution 
now  flourishing  under  the  title  of  the  Eoyal  College  of  Music. 
Eugen  d 'Albert  was  among  the  pupils  trained  at  the  earlier 
school.

that  they  should  enjoy  preference  over  musicians 
of  foreign  birth  and  training.  Happily,  he  lived 
long  enough  to  see  this  patriotic  aspiration  in  a 
large  measure  fulfilled. 

I  did  not  reply,  either  by  writing  or  in  print,  to 
Sir  Arthur  Sullivan's  letter,  but  went  to  see  him  on 
the  following  Sunday,  when  we  threshed  the  whole 
matter  out  to  our  mutual  satisfaction.  That  was 
the  first  of  the  many  Sunday-afternoon  chats  that 
I  enjoyed  in  the  library  of  his  comfortable  apart- 
ment in  Victoria  Street.  He  was  an  inveterate 
cigarette-smoker,  and  from  the  moment  I  entered 
until  the  time  I  left,  a  cigarette  was  scarcely  ever 
out  of  his  mouth.  He  was  a  bright,  interesting 
talker,  full  of  genuine  Irish  mother-wit,  yet  withal 
earnest,  emphatic,  and  impressive  when  he  wished. 
He  was  devotedly  attached  to  a  parrot  that  was 
also  a  good  talker,  and  would  amuse  him  by  in- 
sisting on  spelling  Polly  with  only  one  ^^1.'^  At 
the  period  to  which  I  am  referring  he  was  already 
a  sufferer  from  the  painful  malady  which  even- 
tually carried  him  off;  but  his  hair  had  not  yet 
turned  gray,  he  still  wore  the  familiar  bushy  whis- 
kers shown  in  his  early  portraits,  and  he  was 
robust  enough  to  indulge  frequently  in  his  favorite 
pastime,  lawn-tennis. 

Sullivan  was  not  naturally  what  one  would  term 
a  born  worker.  He  turned  to  labor  not  so  much 
for  love  of  it  as  through  sheer  necessity.  The  most 
successful  and  popular  English  musician  of  his 
day,  a  great  favorite  with  royalty,  the  enfant  gate

of  society,  the  demands  upon  his  time  were  so  ex- 
cessive that  it  was  a  marvel  how  he  managed  to 
get  through  his  long  list  of  public  and  private  en- 
gagements. At  this  period,  much,  if  not  the 
greater  part,  of  his  composing  was  done  between 
midnight  and  four  or  ^ve  o^clock  in  the  morning. 

^^I  find  it  impossible,"  he  would  tell  me,  *^to 
settle  down  to  a  score  during  the  daytime.  I  wait 
till  every  one  is  in  bed ;  then  I  go  to  my  desk,  and 
perhaps  finish  the  instrumentation  of  a  whole  num- 
ber before  I  finally  lay  down  my  pen.  The  streets 
are  so  quiet,  the  atmosphere  is  so  peaceful,  and  I 
have  no  fear  that  I  am  going  to  be  disturbed  every 
few  minutes. ' '  The  rate  at  which  he  could  ^  ^  score  ^ ' 
was  prodigious;  and,  notably  in  the  case  of  his 
comic  operas,  he  would  leave  certain  mechanical 
details  till  nearly  the  last  moment,  knowing  that 
by  dint  of  an  extra  spurt  he  could  always  finish  in 
time. 

On  the  other  hand,  there  were  scores  over  which 
he  lingered  tenderly  and  long,  as  over  a  true  ^  *  labor 
of  love. ' '  One  of  these  was  '  ^  The  Golden  Legend. ' ' 
He  showed  it  to  me  during  one  of  our  Sunday 
chats,  and  pointed  with  pride  to  what  he  hoped 
would  be  some  novel  effects  in  the  prologue— the 
wailing  ^^ diminished''  chords  for  the  violins,  the 
exulting  clang  of  the  bells,  the  blare  of  the  brass 
instruments,  the  poignant  cry,  ^^Oh,  we  cannot!'' 
uttered  by  the  disappointed  demons,  and,  lastly, 
the  contrast  when  the  organ  comes  in  and  the  monks 
chant  their  grand  hjrnan  in  broad  unison.    Novel, 


195 


Thirty  Years  of 


indeed,  did  these  effects  prove  in  the  rendering- 
strokes  of  pure  originality  on  the  part  of  a  com- 
poser who  had  heretofore  ventured  slightly,  if  at 
all,  beyond  the  limits  of  treatment  laid  down  in 
the  scores  of  his  beloved  masters,  Schubert  and 
Mendelssohn.^  My  outspoken  admiration  won  for 
me  the  promise  of  a  copy  of  the  full  score  of  ^  ^  The 
Golden  Legend''  as  soon  as  it  should  be  published; 
and  in  due  time  that  copy  arrived,  with  the  com- 
poser's autograph  upon  the  title-page. 

This  beautiful  work  was  written  for  and  brought 
out  at  the  Leeds  Festival  of  1886.  There  can  be  no 
doubt  that  it  immensely  enhanced  the  reputation 
of  the  composer,  whose  genius  as  a  writer  of  comic 
operas  had  been  brilliantly  exemplified  eighteen 
months  before  by  the  production  of ' '  The  Mikado. ' ' 
The  laurels  yielded  by  the  Savoy  operas  were  of 
necessity  shared  by  Sir  Arthur  with  his  talented 
collaborator,  Mr.  W.  S.  Gilbert.  In  regard  to  the 
Leeds  cantata,  the  composer  certainly  owed  much  to 
Longfellow's  lovely  poem  and  to  Mr.  Joseph  Ben- 
nett's adroit  adaptation  thereof;  but,  this  apart, 
there  was  no  one  to  divide  with  him  the  glory  of 
a  supreme  triumph,  of  an  artistic  achievement  that 
stood  ^  ^  head  and  shoulders ' '  above  all  his  previous 

*  Seven  years  later  I  saw  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan  alone  in  a  pit 
tier  box,  at  Covent  Garden,  listening  to  a  performance  of  ''Die 
Meistersinger. ' '  After  the  second  act  I  went  to  speak  to  him, 
and  noticed  that  he  had  before  him  a  full  score  of  Wagner 's  work. 
Presently  he  pointed  to  it  and  remarked:  ''You  see  I  am  taking 
a  lesson.  Well,  why  not?  This  is  not  only  Wagner's  master- 
piece, but  the  greatest  comic  opera  that  was  ever  written.^'

efforts.  The  overwhelm  in  g  success  at  Leeds  was 
the  more  remarkable  in  that  it  came  at  the  close 
of  the  greatest  festival  ever  held  there— following 
new  works  of  such  calibre  as  Dvorak's  oratorio 
^^St.  Ludmila,"  A.  C.  Mackenzie's  cantata  *'The 
Story  of  Sayid, "  and  Villiers  Stanford's  fine 
choral  ballad  ''The  Revenge,"  not  to  speak  of  a 
phenomenal  performance  by  the  Yorkshire  cho- 
rus of  Bach's  great  Mass  in  B  minor,  never  before 
attempted  at  a  provincial  festival.  The  most  tre- 
mendous ovation  of  all,  though,  was  that  which 
greeted  the  composer  of  ''The  Golden  Legend" 
when  he  laid  down  his  baton  at  the  close  of  the 
noble  choral  epilogue.  Such  ringing  British 
cheers  had  not  been  heard  in  that  magnificent  hall 
since  Queen  Victoria  opened  it  in  the  "fifties." 

It  was  on  such  occasions  as  this  that  Sullivan's 
native  modesty  stood  out  most  conspicuously. 
Only  with  difficulty  could  he  be  persuaded  to  re- 
turn twice  to  the  platform ;  he  complained  that  the 
girls  of  the  choir  had  pelted  him  with  too  many 
nosegays  the  first  time.  When  he  retired  to  the 
artists '  room  I  followed  him,  and  heard  his  words 
of  gratitude  to  the  singers— Albani,  Patey,  Lloyd, 
and  Frederic  King— who  had  so  loyally  carried 
out  his  ideas.  To  Mme.  Patey  he  was  even 
apologetic.  He  said  to  the  gifted  contralto:  "I 
am  sorry  I  did  not  write  you  something  that  was 
worthier  of  you  ;^  but  I  was  in  pain  the  whole  time, 

^  Kef  erring  to   the   air   ' '  Virgin   who   lovest, ' '   in   the   last   scene

and  I  am  bound  to  say  the  music  exactly  illustrates 
the  torments  that  I  suffered."  He  literally  told 
the  truth.  The  number  in  question  is  the  only  one 
in  the  cantata  that  does  not  faithfully  reflect  the 
spirit  of  the  text. 

If  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan  had  a  weakness,  it  was 
his  notable  penchant  for  the  turf.  He  dearly  loved 
to  go  to  the  races,  and  was  a  regular  attendant  at 
the  meetings  held  at  Newmarket,  Sandown,  and 
elsewhere.  He  once  owned  two  or  three  race- 
horses—a luxury  to  which  his  fairly  wealthy  po- 
sition quite  entitled  him.  But  I  believe  I  am  cor- 
rect in  saying  that  he  never  succeeded  in  winning 
a  stake.  Nor  did  I  find  him  particularly  success- 
ful as  a  ^'tipster,''  though  few  men  had  so  many 
intimate  friends  among  the  members  of  the  Eng- 
lish Jockey  Club.  The  last  time  I  ever  saw  him 
was  at  one  of  the  suburban  race-meetings,  three 
months  before  he  died.  As  we  walked  away  to- 
gether he  remarked  sententiously,  ^'I  have  n't 
backed  a  single  winner.  My  luck  is  out.  But 
never  mind ;  I  have  seen  the  winner  of  next  year 's 
Derby,  and  when  the  time  comes  I  mean  to  back 
him."  That,  alas!  he  never  lived  to  do.  Which, 
perhaps,  explains  why  Mr.  William  C.  Whitney 
won  the  ''blue  riband"  of  the  English  turf  with 
Volodyovski,  the  horse  to  which  Sir  Arthur  re- 
ferred.

tribute  to  the  memory  of  the  musician  whose  loss 
the  whole  world  still  deplores.  Sullivan  was  a  man 
of  singularly  sweet  and  amiable  disposition.  There 
was  much  more  impulsive  warmth  and  emotional 
depth  to  his  Irish  nature  than  one  would  have 
judged  from  his  manner,  which  impressed  most 
people  as  ,being  cold  and  reserved.  He  had  un- 
common powers  of  self-repression,  and  he  used 
them  more  than  he  really  needed.  As  a  conduc- 
tor, this  was  no  doubt  to  his  disadvantage;  yet 
if  magnetism  were  lacking,  neither  sympathy  nor 
control  was,  and  his  slightest  sign  was  instantly 
obeyed.  Only  those  who  saw  him  work  at  re- 
hearsal could  tell  how  completely  he  was  master 
of  the  situation.  At  the  performance  he  pur- 
posely avoided  a  demonstrative  style;  hence  was 
his  beat  often  described  as  ^  *  lethargic ' '  by  those 
who  studied  his  manner  instead  of  the  effects  that 
he  produced. 

And,  after  all,  modesty  was  the  true  secret  of 
his  hatred  of  display.  Success  never  engendered 
an  overwhelming  confidence  in  self,  and  to  the  very 
last  it  pleased  him  to  be  assured  that  he  had  done 
something  worthy  of  his  name  and  talent.  To 
prove  this  I  cannot  do  better  than  reproduce  a  let- 
ter which  he  wrote  me  only  a  year  before  his  death 
—premising  that  the  opera  mentioned  was  *^The 
Eose  of  Persia, ' '  and  that  he  had  a  short  time  pre- 
viously resigned  his  position  as  conductor  of  the 
Leeds  Festival:

1  Queen's  Mansions,  Victoria  Street,  S.  W., 

19  November,  1899. 
Dear  Klein: 

O  si  sic  omnes!  I  am  still  young  enough  to  be  pleased 
at  reading  (in  real  live  print,  mind  you!)  a  few  kind 
words  written  in  a  kindly  spirit  such  as  I  have  just  read 
in  the  ' '  Sunday  Times. "  ^ 

To-day  I  am  just  out  of  prison,  having  finished  the 
score  of  the  new  opera  at  3.15  a.m.,  and  I  feel  strange 
at  having  nothing  to  do  except  rehearsing.  By  the  way, 
if  you  want  to  know  what  the  music,  pure  and  simple,  is 
like,  you  will  find  a  full  rehearsal  of  band  and  voices 
going  on  at  St.  Andrew's  Hall  [Wells  Street,  London] 
on  Wednesday  next,  from  11  a.m.  onwards. 

About  Leeds — I  could  tell  you  much,  but  cannot  write 
it.  As  H.  K.  suggests,  I  hope  they  won't  take  a  foreigner 
as  my  successor.  If  they  do,  it  will  be  a  terrible  disap- 
pointment to  someone. 

Ever  yours  sincerely, 

Arthur  Sullivan. 

The  Leeds  conductorship  was  eventually  bestowed 
upon  Sir  C.  Villiers  Stanford.  There  was  never, 
indeed,  much  danger  of  the  ^*  hated  foreigner '^  be- 
ing appointed.  Probably  the  only  conductor,  not 
an  Englishman  by  birth,  who  would  have  stood  a 
chance  was  Georg  Henschel,  and  he,  so  far  as  I 
am  aware,  was  not  among  the  candidates  for  the 
vacant  position. 

More  than  a  quarter  of  a  century  has  passed

poem  ' '  The  Absent-minded  Beggar. ' '

since  Mr.  Henschel  made  his  debut  in  England,  and 
his  wide  circle  of  friends  there  must  long  ago  have 
made  up  their  minds  to  regard  him  in  the  light 
of  a  British  subject.  When  he  first  came  I  saw  a 
good  deal  of  him,  and,  curiously  enough,  his  late 
gifted  wife,  then  Miss  Lillian  Bailey,  lived  oppo- 
site our  house  in  Bentinck  Street,  where  we  could 
hear  by  the  hour  her  sweet,  penetrating  tones  as 
she  labored  steadfastly  at  those  old  florid  Italian 
airs,  the  study  of  which  furnishes  the  sole  true 
medium  for  the  acquisition  of  a  fine  vocal  tech- 
nique. After  he  had  terminated  his  connection  with 
the  Boston  Symphony  Concerts,  Mr.  Henschel  per- 
manently settled  down  in  London,  and  there  for 
many  years  he  shared  the  principal  concert  work 
with  the  eminent  and  evergreen  barytone,  Charles 
Santley.  As  singer,  as  composer,  as  conductor,  as 
accompanist,  and  as  teacher,  Henschel  long  ago 
demonstrated  his  remarkable  talent  and  his  even 
more  extraordinary  versatility.  In  a  word,  he  has 
fairly  earned  the  right  to  be  called  the  ' '  Admirable 
Crichton ' '  of  his  art. 

In  the  autumn  of  1886,  Mr.  Henschel  started  the 
enterprise  known  as  the  London  Symphony  Con- 
certs, which  he  carried  on  with  conspicuous  skill 
for  several  years.  Unfortunately,  their  pecuniary 
results  offered  an  inadequate  return  for  the  care 
and  energy  that  were  bestowed  upon  the  rendering 
of  a  singularly  eclectic  and  interesting  series  of 
programmes.  Truth  to  tell,  Mr.  Henschel  never 
figured  in  the  public  mind  as  a  great  or  even  a 

203 


Musical  Life  in  London 


strong  conductor.  His  readings  of  the  classical 
masterpieces  might  be  conscientious  and  artistic, 
but  tliey  lacked  individuality,  force,  and  warmth. 
On  the  other  hand,  the  vocal  recitals  which  he 
gave  with  the  aid  of  his  accomplished  wife  never 
failed  to  attract,  by  virtue  of  the  unique  interpre- 
tative charm  with  which  the  two  singers  invested 
their  delightful  selections.

CHAPTER   X

EARLY  in  the  spring  of  1887,  I  was  lunching 
one  day  with  Augustus  Harris  at  the  old 
Albion  Restaurant,  opposite  Drury  Lane  Theatre.^ 
As  a  rule,  the  busy  manager  allowed  himself,  at 
most,  twenty  minutes  for  his  midday  meal  (a  year 
or  two  later  he  allowed  himself  no  lunch  at  all) ; 
but  on  this  particular  day  he  lingered  over  his  cof- 
fee, called  for  cigars,  and  proceeded  to  deliver  him- 
self of  what  was,  to  me,  a  wholly  unexpected  piece 
of  news.  Leaning  back  against  the  upright  wooden 
partition  which  separated  the  tables  in  the  old- 
fashioned  dining-room,  and  with  a  bright,  familiar 
gleam  in  his  penetrating  eyes,  he  said : 

*  The  resort,  in  the  days  before  theatrical  clubs  existed,  of  all 

the  best-known   actors  and  managers  in  London.     The  walls  of 

the  smoking-parlor  were  hung  with  portraits  of  Sarah  Siddons, 

John  Philip  Kemble,  Charles  Kemble,  Edmund  Kean,  Macready, 

and  other  histrionic  celebrities  of  the  century.     What  became  of 

the  pictures  I  cannot  say;  but  the  place,  if  not  yet  pulled  down, 

has  been  used  for  some  years  as  a  kind  of  warehouse.

''Klein,  I  have  made  up  my  mind  to  do  some- 
thing big.'' 

This  was  not  very  astonishing.  Augustus  Harris 
was  always  doing  ''something  big.''  His  panto- 
mime and  autumn  dramas  were  the  very  biggest 
things  of  their  kind ;  and  in  the  summer  of  the  pre- 
vious year  he  had  mounted  a  new  comic  opera  by 
Herve,  entitled  "Frivoli,"  which  was  at  once  the 
costliest  spectacle  and  the  most  dismal  failure  of 
his  managerial  career.  This  recollection  suggested 
a  rather  cruel  expression  of  hope  on  my  part  that 
he  did  not  intend  going  in  for  more  French  opera- 
bouff e.    He  smiled  and  shook  his  head : 

"  No ;  it  is  to  be  the  real  thing  this  time.  What 
I  am  going  to  do  is  to  give  a  month  of  Italian 
opera  on  a  large  scale  at  Dury  Lane,  at  the  height 
of  the  London  season!" 

Still  smiling,  Harris  stared  hard  at  me,  to  judge 
the  effect  of  his  words.  I  was  genuinely  surprised, 
and  told  him  so.  Did  he  not  think  he  had  sufficient 
responsibilities  already  without  launching  his  ship 
upon  the  treacherous  waters  of  Italian  opera,  which 
had  wrecked  one  English  impresario  after  another, 
and  profited  none! 

' '  I  know.  But  why  should  I  suffer  the  same  fate  1 
Why  should  not  opera  pay,  provided  it  be  well 
done?  All  this  talk  about  Italian  opera  being 
'moribund'  is  merely  because  the  management  of 
it  has  been  going  from  bad  to  worse,  because  so- 
ciety is  no  longer  interested  and  the  public  has 
lost  confidence.    Look  at  what  Carl  Rosa  has  done

and  is  doing  for  English  opera !  He  has  won  over 
the  public,  and  makes  money  in  the  provinces,  if 
he  can't  in  London.  See  what  Lago  did  last  year 
at  Covent  Garden  with  what  I  consider  a  mediocre 
company  and  limited  resources !  Economy  helped 
him  out,  it  is  true;  but  at  least  he  proved  that 
Italian  opera  was  still  gasping!  He  is  going  to 
try  again  this  year ;  this  time,  however,  I  mean  to 
show  him  that  ^ opera  on  the  cheap'  is  not  what 
London  actually  wants.  He  may  get  the  old  fogies 
and  habitues  at  Covent  Garden;  I  intend  to  draw 
the  real  aristocracy  to  Drury  Lane. ' ' 

I  saw  that  he  was  serious,  and  I  realized  that 
his  conclusions,  to  some  extent,  were  just.  Grand 
opera  in  its  noblest  form,  of  whatever  school  or 
language,  if  adequately  presented,  could  not  die 
in  England  any  more  than  in  other  countries  of 
equivalent  musical  calibre.  And  England,  I  may 
sav,  is  now  not  half  so  ^  ^  unmusical "  as  it  is  habitu- 
ally  depicted.  Without  the  aid  of  a  state  sub- 
vention, opera  upon  a  ^^ grand"  scale  all  the  year 
round  might  be  impossible.  But  not  even  for  three 
months  in  the  year  would  society,  or,  indeed,  any 
section  of  the  public,  be  willing  to  purchase  guinea 
stalls  and  pay  high  prices  all  rour^d  for  perform- 
ances of  only  moderate  excellence,  supported  by 
two  or  three  * '  stars ' '  and  an  otherwise  second-rate 
personnel.  I  agreed  that  Lago  could  not  go  on 
long  under  present  conditions,  and  I  told  my  com- 
panion that  I  thought  he  might  stand  a  chance  if 
he  could  contrive  to  get  together  a  strong  company.

^^ There/'  said  Harris,  ^4s  where  you  can  be  of 
service  to  me,  if  you  care  to/'  I  replied  that  in 
such  a  good  cause  I  should  be  only  too  delighted 
to  assist  him  in  every  possible  way.  ^'Then,"  he 
continued,  ^^come  abroad  with  me  at  Easter.  I 
have  already  prepared  the  ground  in  several  di- 
rections. I  have  even  engaged  my  conductor— a 
man  quite  unknown,  but  said  to  be  very  clever— 
Luigi  Mancinelli.  He  is  now  conducting  at  Ma- 
drid, and  I  want  you  to  go  there  with  me  to  listen 
to  some  artists  whom  he  has  recommended."  I 
said  that  I  would  do  so  with  the  utmost  pleasure. 
Then  suddenly  an  idea  occurred  to  me,  and  I  con- 
tinued : 

^^I  know  of  a  splendid  tenor  for  you— if  you  can 
get  him.  He  sang  here  years  ago  as  a  barytone, 
but  is  really  a  tenor,  and  I  heard  him  last  summer 
at  the  Paris  Opera  in  ^Le  Cid.'  He  has  a  mag- 
nificent voice  and  is  a  thorough  artist. ' ' 

*^You  mean  Jean  de  Reszke,''  broke  in  Harris. 
^^I  have  been  told  about  him,  but  have  not  quite 
decided  what  to  do.'' 

*^ Don't  hesitate.  He  will  make  a  great  hit  here 
now;  and  his  brother  Edouard,  who  has  already 
sung  at  Covent  Garden  and  has  the  finest  bass  voice 
in  the  world,  of  course  will  have  to  come  too." 

**I  shall  see  if  I  can  get  them  both,"  said  the  new 
impresario,  and  with  that  we  parted. 

In  less  than  a  fortnight  the  two  brothers  were 
engaged— Jean  at  £100  ($500)  a  night,  and  Edou- 
ard at  £320  ($1600)  a  month— salaries  which  they 

2  lO 


Musical  Life  in  London 


were  then  well  content  to  accept.^  In  such  fashion 
did  the  preparations  for  the  campaign  commence, 
quietly  and  without  fuss. '  For  the  moment  every- 
thing was  kept  secret.  The  pantomime  had  not 
yet  run  its  course,  and  there  was  still  a  four  weeks ' 
Carl  Rosa  season  to  be  held  at  Drury  Lane  during 
the  month  of  May.  Augustus  Harris  naturally  de- 
sired, therefore,  that  the  public  should  not  be  in- 
formed until  his  plans  were  more  matured.  At 
Easter  we  started  together  for  Paris,  en  route  for 
Spain. 

Little  did  I  then  dream  that  the  mission  upon 
which  we  were  setting  out  was  to  have  results  of 
far-reaching  magnitude;  that  it  was  to  affect  the 
whole  future  of  opera  in  England,  and  also  in 
an  appreciable  degree  the  nature  and  methods  of 
operatic  enterprise  in  the  United  States.  Still  less 
did  I  imagine  that  the  words  which  turned  the 
balance  in  favor  of  the  engagement  of  Jean  de 
Reszke  were  also  to  mark  the  turning-point  in  the 
singular  career  of  that  illustrious  artist— to  lift 
him  from  the  sluggish  waters  of  the  stream  of 

^  It  has  been  asserted  that  M.  Jean  de  Reszke  's  services  were 
offered  in  1886  to  Signer  Lago  at  a  very  moderate  salary,  and 
refused.  There  is  good  reason  to  doubt  the  accuracy  of  that 
statement.  It  is  possible,  of  course,  that  some  musical  agent  in 
London  or  Paris  did  offer  to  try  to  secure  the  new  tenor  for 
Signor  Lago;  but  if  so,  it  was  not  done  at  M.  de  Reszke 's  instiga- 
tion. And  in  any  case  the  ''refusal"  would  not  have  come  so 
much  from  the  impresario  as  from  Signor  Gayarre,  who  was  at 
the  back  of  the  concern,  and  would  assuredly  have  objected  to 
the  engagement  of  an  artist  who  might  prove  a  formidable  rival 
to  himself.

Parisian  operatic  life;  to  pave  the  way  for  his 
brilliant  rise  to  fame  in  the  two  great  English- 
speaking  lands;  and  to  lay  the  foundation  of  a 
friendship  that  should  enable  me  materially  to 
aid  in  kindling  those  Wagnerian  aspirations  which 
have  borne  such  precious  and  universally  cher- 
ished fruit. 

The  position  of  affairs  should  now  be  tolerably 
clear  to  the  reader.  I  have  traced  the  influence  of 
Carl  Rosa  upon  Augustus  Harris  through  the  dark 
period  that  followed  upon  the  collapse  of  the  Gye 
regime.  I  have  demonstrated  the  mighty  power 
that  was  wielded  by  Wagnerian  and  German  opera 
in  the  education  both  of  the  managers  and  the 
music-loving  communities  for  whom  they  catered. 
In  London,  at  least,  the  hour  for  the  operatic 
renaissance  had  arrived,  and  with  it  the  man.  In 
America,  no  doubt,  the  time  for  reaping  the  new 
harvest  was  also  near  at  hand.  Mapleson,  who 
had  all  but  reached  the  end  of  his  tether  at  home, 
could  no  longer  send  to  America  Italian  compa- 
nies worthy  of  attention.  The  sole  European  at- 
traction upon  whom  an  American  manager  could 
rely  with  certainty  was  Mme.  Patti— a  name  to 
conjure  with  any  time  these  forty  years— a  genius 
whose  light  gives  no  sign  even  now  of  growing 
dim.  On  the  other  hand,  German  opera,  thanks 
to  the  crusade  so  bravely  led  by  Dr.  Leopold  Dam- 
rosch,*  had  become  firmly  established  in  New  York, 
and  the  love  of  Wagner  had  entered  even  more 
.deeply  into  the  hearts  of  the  people  there  than 

212 


Musical  Life  in  London 


in  London.  Consequently,  the  time  was  ripe  for 
a  bolder  and  more  extended  movement  on  both 
sides  of  the  Atlantic.    In  due  course  it  came. 

But  to  return  to  our  journey.  Augustus  Harris 
made  the  briefest  possible  stay  in  Paris.  We  ar- 
rived in  the  morning  and  called  upon  Choudens, 
the  publisher,  to  arrange  for  the  exclusive  English 
rights,  as  far  as  they  could  be  secured,  of  certain 
popular  French  operas.  This  done,  we  took  break- 
fast with  M.  and  Mme.  Edouard  de  Reszke  and 
their  family,  including,  of  course,  Jean,  then  a 
lively  bachelor  of  less  than  forty.  Edouard  re- 
membered me  at  once,  and  reminded  me  of  our 
last  merry  meeting  at  the  dinner  given  by  Pauline 
Lucca. 

The  elder  brother  made  a  great  impression  both 
upon  Harris  and  myself.  Already  an  enormous  fa- 
vorite in  Paris,  Jean  de  Reszke  seemed  to  be  wholly 
free  from  affectation  or  conceit;  in  a  word,  a  de- 
lightful man  and  a  thorough  gentleman.  His  con- 
versation was  marked  by  ease  and  freedom,  and  it 
offered  a  fascinating  combination  of  humor  and  in- 
tellectuality. He  then  spoke  very  little  German 
and  still  less  English,  though  as  a  boy  he  had 
studied  both  languages.  French  and  Italian,  of 
course,  he  spoke  fluently;  indeed,  in  the  former 
tongue  his  accent  was  so  pure  and  his  diction  so 
correct  that,  had  I  not  known  him  to  be  a  Pole,  I 
should  readily  have  taken  him  for  a  Parisian. 

The  arrangements  between  Jean  de  Reszke  and 
his  new  impresario  were  quickly  settled.    He  would 


213 


Thirty  Years  of 


make  his  appearance  on  the  opening  night  in 
^  ^  Aida, ' '  and  follow  this  np  as  quickly  as  possible 
by  singing  Lohengrin  (in  Italian)  for  the  first  time 
on  any  stage.  He  realized  that  London  had  known 
him  as  a  barytone,  and  he  was  anxious  to  make 
manifest  without  delay  that  he  was  a  genuine  tenor. 
I  asked  him  how  the  mistake  had  first  arisen. 

^*It  is  difficult  to  say/'  he  replied.  *^We  were 
always  a  musical  family,  and  accustomed  to  attend 
operatic  performances  whenever  there  were  any 
going  on  in  Warsaw.  My  parents  were  both  very 
musical,  and  my  mother  had  a  fine  soprano  voice. 
I  remember  once,  in  Warsaw,  her  singing  the  duet 
from  ^Semiramide'  with  Trebelli.  When  I  was 
only  fifteen  I  began  to  take  lessons  from  Ciaffei, 
an  old  tenor,  who  was  a  professor  at  the  Conserva- 
toire at  Warsaw.  He  decided  that  I  was  a  bary- 
tone, and  what  part  do  you  think  he  gave  me  to 
study  first! — Leporello!  Notwithstanding  this,  I 
always  had  good  high  notes.  When  I  made  my 
debut  at  the  Fenice  at  Venice,  in  1874,  in  the  *Fa- 
vorita, '  I  finished  up  the  cahalletta  with  a  ringing 
A  natural.  The  real  test,  of  course,  lies  in  the  capa- 
city for  sustaining  the  tessitura.  A  barytone  may 
be  able  to  bring  out  a  B  flat  or  even  a  B  natural, 
but  no  example  has  yet  been  known  of  a  barytone 
who  was  capable  of  sustaining  the  tenor  tessitura 
through  long  and  heavy  roles.  The  thing  is  a  rank 
impossibility. ' ' 

I  inquired  how  long  he  had  given  himself  to  ef- 
fect the  necessary  change  of  method.

* '  Two  years,  of  which  I  spent  part  in  Paris  and 
part  in  Poland.  That  was  from  1877  to  1879.  I 
made  my  reappearance  at  Madrid  as  Roberto,  and 
was  immediately  hailed  as  a  real  tenore  rohusto. 
I  assure  you  I  found  it  much  more  easy  and  com- 
fortable than  singing  barytone.  My  voice  at  the 
end  of  the  performance  felt  a  great  deal  less  fa- 
tigued. But  I  still  had  to  work  very,  very  hard  to 
feel  myself  thoroughly  equipped  at  all  points. 
Then  there  came  an  offer  to  appear  here  at  the 
Italiens,  and  I  sang  my  first  French  role  when  I 
created  John  the  Baptist  in  ^Herodiade'  four  years 
ago." 

He  expressed  his  regret  that  we  could  not  re- 
main to  hear  him  in  ^ '  Le  Prophete, ' '  which  he  con- 
sidered his  most  successful  opera  in  Paris.  For  my 
own  part,  I  should  have  liked  it  above  all  things; 
but  Augustus  Harris— one  of  the  most  restless 
specimens  of  concentrated  nervous  energy  that  ever 
lived— had  fully  determined  to  proceed  forthwith 
to  Madrid,  and  no  amount  of  persuasion  could  de- 
ter him  from  leaving  Paris  that  same  night.  We 
accordingly  bade  the  brothers  ^*au  revoir,''  and 
looked  forward  to  meeting  them  again  in  London 
early  in  June.  Thirty-six  hours  later  we  were 
safely  installed  in  the  Spanish  capital. 

Our  first  business  was  to  find  Signor  Mancinelli. 
He  lived  in  a  house  overlooking  some  public  gar- 
dens not  far  from  the  royal  palace,  and  on  the 
way  thither  Harris  confided  to  me  for  the  first 
time  that  he  was  not  quite  sure  whether  he  ought 


217 


Thirty  Years  of 


to  have  engaged  the  man  we  were  then  going  to  see, 
or  his  brother,  Marino  Mancinelli,  who  was  the  con- 
ductor at  the  Lisbon  Opera-house,  and,  according 
to  some  people,  the  more  gifted  of  the  two.  On 
this  point  I  was  happily  able  to  reassure  my  friend. 
I  had  not  seen  both  brothers ;  but,  when  at  Bologna 
in  1879,  I  had  seen  Luigi  Mancinelli  direct  at  the 
Teatro  Comunale  a  remarkably  fine  performance 
of  Gounod's  ^' Faust"  (with  a  Covent  Garden  so- 
prano. Mile.  TuroUa,  as  Margherita),  and  I  had 
considered  him  a  chef-d^orchestre  of  the  first  order. 
Harris  was  able  quickly  to  confirm  this  opinion 
for  himself  by  means  of  a  representation  of  the 
selfsame  work  at  the  Royal  Opera-house. 

The  season  in  Madrid  was  fast  approaching  its 
termination.  The  audiences,  however,  were  still 
tolerably  brilliant,  and  the  two  infantas,  aunts  of 
the  present  King  of  Spain,  then  a  baby  in  arms, 
were  present  nearly  every  evening.  Queen  Chris- 
tina, naturally,  did  not  go  to  the  opera;  but  by  a 
welcome  chance  I  saw  her  one  day  at  the  hotel 
where  we  were  staying  in  the  Puerta  del  Sol.  The 
queen-regent,  who  was  attired  in  deep  mourning, 
came  to  the  hotel  for  the  purpose  of  visiting  some 
distinguished  Russian  personage  whose  name  I 
have  now  forgotten;  and,  as  Harris  and  I  bowed 
low  when  she  passed  down  the  stairs.  Her  Majesty 
returned  our  salute  with  a  gracious  smile. 

Shortly  after  our  arrival  we  went  to  pay  our 
respects  to  the  British  ambassador.  Sir  Clare  Ford, 
who  received  the  Drury  Lane  manager  with  marked 

218 


Musical  Life  in  London 


cordiality.  He  invited  us  to  a  dejeuner  in  honor  of 
some  of  the  opera  artists,  among  the  guests  being 
the  late  Lord  Beaconsfield  ^s  popular  secretary,  Lord 
Kowton,  who  had  not  long  been  raised  to  the  peer- 
age. We  met,  among  others,  Gayarre;  Battistini, 
the  barytone ;  Mme.  Kupf er-Berger,  a  well-known 
dramatic  soprano;  and  Guerrina  Fabbri,  the  con- 
tralto,—all  of  whom  were  subsequently  engaged  for 
London,  with  the  exception  of  Gayarre,  who  was, 
as  a  matter  of  course,  to  be  once  more  the  principal 
tenor  of  Lago's  season  at  Covent  Garden.  In  ad- 
dition to  these,  a  new  light  tenor,  De  Lucia,  was 
also  secured;  and  altogether,  as  far  as  the  men 
were  concerned,  there  was  ample  reason  to  be  con- 
tent with  the  results  of  our  visit.  As  regards  the 
prime  donne  I  was  not  equally  impressed.  Neither 
the  two  above  named,  nor  two  Italian  sopranos 
recommended  by  Mancinelli  (who  then  had  no 
experience  of  English  audiences),  proved  to  be 
suited  to  the  London  operatic  boards. 

One  of  the  many  attentions  bestowed  upon  us 
by  the  ambassador  was  to  send  us  tickets  for  a 
private  bull-fight  given  by  the  Duchess  de  Alba  in 
the  great  bull-ring  at  Madrid.  I  could  not  confess 
to  an  overwhelming  desire  to  witness  one  of  these 
spectacles,  but  I  was  naturally  curious ;  while  Au- 
gustus Harris  was  positively  anxious  to  see  one, 
in  order,  as  he  explained,  to  note  the  necessary 
points  for  a  realistic  production  of  the  last  act  of 
*^ Carmen."  This  particular  bull-fight,  it  seemed, 
was  an  extremely  select  annual  affair,  to  which  the 


219 


Thirty  Years  of 


Duchess  invited  all  her  friends,  and  in  which  the 
performers,  from  the  matador  down  to  the  humblest 
banderillero,  consisted  of  the  fine  fleur  of  the  youth- 
ful aristocracy  of  Spain.  They  made  a  brave  show, 
did  these  young  fellows,  in  their  handsome  cos- 
tumes. The  programmes  were  printed  upon  yellow 
satin,  and  the  select  assemblage,  though  not  nearly 
large  enough  to  fill  the  huge  galleries  of  the  Plaza 
de  Toros,  comprised  some  of  the  most  fashionable 
families  in  Madrid. 

Among  the  ladies  present  was  that  fine  artist 
Mme.  Christine  Nilsson,  who  a  few  months  before 
had  become  the  Countess  Casa  de  Miranda.  She 
confided  to  me  that  she  did  not  really  care  for  bull- 
fights, and  had  come  solely  in  order  to  please  the 
Count— a  statement  fully  to  be  credited  from  the 
manner  in  which  she  constantly  used  her  fan  to 
shut  out  the  proceedings  in  the  arena  from  her 
view.  From  the  standpoint  of  sport,  however, 
the  affair  was  a  dire  failure.  The  bulls  refused  to 
show  fight,  and  the  amateur  matadors  were  never 
exposed  to  any  risk  from  which  their  agility  as 
runners  could  not  speedily  have  removed  them. 

It  was  not  at  this  absurd  function  that  Augus- 
tus Harris  obtained  the  real  suggestions  for  the 
projected  revival  of  ''Carmen."  We  went  subse- 
quently to  one  of  the  regular  bull-fights  at  the  same 
amphitheatre,  and  at  this  he  made  plentiful  notes 
for  the*  procession  of  the  Alcade,  the  picadors  on 
horseback,  and  the  group  of  banderilleros,  for  all 
of  whom  he  ordered  real  and  costly  Sx)anish  cos- 

2  20 


Musical  Life  in  London 


tumes.  He  even  arranged  for  an  exact  copy  of  the 
curious  hurdle-like  contrivance,  drawn  by  three 
ponies,  which  is  employed  in  dragging  the  bodies 
of  the  dead  horses  and  bulls  out  of  the  arena.  Not 
satisfied  with  this,  we  paid  a  twenty-four  hours  ^ 
visit  to  Seville  in  order  to  obtain  touches  of  the 
true  couleur  locale.  We  went  to  the  great  cigar 
and  cigarette  factory  where  Carmen  is  supposed 
to  conduct  herself  with  so  much  impropriety.  We 
obtained  photographs  of  the  Giralda  Tower;  we 
sketched  the  entrance  to  the  Plaza  de  Toros;  and 
we  gathered  together  every  authentic  detail  that  it 
was  possible  to  procure  for  uniforms,  costumes, 
and  scenery.  Thus  it  was  that  the  mise  en  scene 
of  ^^ Carmen,''  as  mounted  by  Augustus  Harris, 
proved  to  be  by  far  the  most  accurate  and  pictur- 
esque that  had  ever  been  vouchsafed  to  Bizet's 
opera. 

I  must  not  dwell  longer  upon  the  events  of  this 
interesting  Spanish  trip ;  nor  is  it  necessary  to  de- 
scribe in  further  detail  the  preparations  for  the 
Drury  Lane  Italian  season.  Enough  to  say  that 
the  troupe  finally  collected  by  Augustus  Harris 
was  the  strongest  heard  in  London  for  several 
years.  The  opening  representation  of  ^^Aida"  on 
June  13,  with  brand-new  costumes  and  fresh 
scenery  expressly  imported  from  Italy,  fairly  took 
critics  and  opera-goers  by  surprise.  The  triumph 
of  Jean  de  Eeszke  was  instantaneous  and  complete. 
Here,  at  last,  was  the  great  tenor  for  whom  the 
world  had  been  waiting  since  the  death  of  Giuglini 

22  1 


Thirty  Years  of 


and  the  retirement  of  Mario !  Edouard  de  Reszke 
was  unable  to  leave  Paris  in  time  for  this  per- 
formance, but  he  arrived  later  in  the  month,  and 
worthily  supported  his  brother  on  their  debuts  in 
^  ^  Lohengrin/ '  On  the  whole,  despite  Mme.  Kup- 
fer-Berger^s  vocal  shortcomings  as  Aida  and  Elsa, 
the  rendering  of  both  Verdi 's  and  Wagner 's  operas 
aroused  the  admiration  of  experts;  while  the  in- 
spiring zeal  and  magnetism  of  Luigi  Mancinelli 
were  readily  recognized. 

Soon  London  began  to  talk.  It  was  a  new  thing 
to  find  a  series  of  operas  placed  nightly  upon  the 
stage  with  the  highest  care  and  efficiency,  and  dis- 
tinguished not  only  by  a  rare  liberality  in  the 
mounting,  but  by  the  improving  touches  of  a  stage- 
manager  courageous  enough  to  sweep  away  the 
more  absurd  anachronisms  that  disfigure  the  tradi- 
tions of  Italian  opera,  and  capable  of  replacing 
them  with  artistic  and  appropriate  ideas  of  his 
own.  Naturally  the  audiences  did  not  numerically 
realize  Harris's  hopes.  His  losses,  especially  dur- 
ing the  first  fortnight  of  his  four  weeks'  season, 
amounted  to  many  thousands  of  pounds.  But  any 
comparison  between  the  work  that  he  was  doing 
and  the  dull  representations  at  Co  vent  Garden,  or 
the  still  more  slipshod  performances  at  Her  Ma- 
jesty's,^ was  all  in  favor  of  the  new  impresario. 

^  HerQ  Mapleson  was  making  one  of  his  expiring  efforts.  Its 
only  noteworthy  features  were  a  revival  of  "Fidelio"  with  Lilli 
Lehmann,  now  heard  for  the  first  time  in  one  of  her  great  parts; 
and  a  solitary  appearance  of  Patti  in  ' '  La  Traviata. ' '  But  the 
public  refused  to  respond,  and,  no  more  capital  being  available, 
the  ill-starred  campaign  quickly  ended.

The  Prince  and  Princess  of  Wales,  who  had  at  once 
become  ardent  admirers  of  Jean  de  Reszke,  came 
several  times  to  hear  him.  By  degrees  society  fol- 
lowed, more  suo,  the  royal  example ;  and,  just  when 
the  brief  campaign  was  reaching  its  close,  people 
began  to  perceive  that  Italian  opera,  so  called,  as 
given  at  Drury  Lane,  was  a  still  vital  and  attrac- 
tive art-prodnct. 

But  the  successes  of  the  season  were  not  all  for 
the  Polish  brothers.  Among  the  procession  of  old 
and  new  friends  that  traversed  the  scene  were  some 
very  notable  figures.  I  recall  an  exceedingly  good 
performance  of  ^'Don  Giovanni"  with  Maurel  as 
the  Don,  Minnie  Hauk  as  Zerlina,  and  Lillian 
Nordica  (little  more  than  a  debutante,  and  not  yet 
the  favorite  that  she  was  to  become  later)  as  Donna 
Elvira.  I  remember  the  debuts  of  Marie  Engle  as 
Adalgisa,  of  Sigrid  Arnoldson  as  Rosina,  of  Amelia 
Groll  as  Donna  Anna,  of  De  Lucia  as  Alfredo,  of 
Battistini  as  Rigoletto,  and  of  Navarrini  as  Ramfis. 
Again,  there  was  Del  Puente,  sympathetic  as  ever, 
in  his  old  parts  of  Escamillo  and  Germont  pere; 
while  the  veteran  barytone  Pandolfini  was  still 
fine  as  Amonasro,  which  role  he  was  the  first  to 
sing  at  Milan  and  Paris.  Glancing  at  these  names, 
American  readers  will  be  able  to  judge  for  them- 
selves not  only  of  the  extraordinary  merit  of  the 
new  ensemble,  but  of  the  extent  to  which  it  em- 
braced the  practically  ''untried''  talent  that  was 
to  constitute  in  after  years  the  best  part  of  the 
brilliant  constellation  revolving  in  their  own  oper- 
atic firmament.

The  proudest  night  of  the  month  for  Harris  was 
that  on  which  he  revived  ^^Les  Huguenots''  with 
a  splendid  cast,  and  in  such  fashion  as  to  make 
old  habitues  declare  that  ^'the  son  had  beaten 
the  father  at  his  own  game."  Imagine  Jean  de 
Reszke  at  this  time  as  Raoul!  Always  remarkable 
for  its  refinement,  distinction,  and  passionate 
warmth,  his  impersonation  was  just  then  peculiarly 
imbued  with  the  spirit  of  the  true  Meyerbeer  school. 
Alike  in  a  vocal  and  a  histrionic  sense,  it  was  su- 
premely great.  His  *' velvety"  tones,  fresh,  clear, 
and  mellow  as  a  bell,  were  emitted  with  an  un- 
sparing freedom  that  would  thrill  the  listener  not 
once,  but  twenty  times,  in  the  course  of  a  single 
scene.  There  was  no  ^  ^  saving  up ' '  for  the  last  act 
then;  it  was  ^^laissez  aller"  throughout,  with 
plenty  to  spare  at  the  finish.  And  what  tender- 
ness, withal,  in  that  famous  grand  duet  of  the 
fourth  act!  Not  Mario  himself  had  phrased  the 
*'Tu  m'ami,  tu  m'ami!"  (this  was  still  an  Italian 
performance)  with  a  greater  wealth  of  delicious 
surprise  and  pent-up  adoration.  Little  wonder 
that  Nordica  nearly  lost  her  head  through  ner- 
vousness and  emotion.  It  was  the  very  first  time 
she  sang  Valentine;  she  had  studied  the  part 
in  less  than  a  week,  and  for  a  young,  inexpe- 
rienced artist,— so  youthful,  so  pretty,  so  win- 
ning that  she  fascinated  others  beside  Raoul,— 
her  achievement  was  in  the  highest  degree  credi- 
table. The  fifth  act,  generally  suppressed  in  Eng- 
land, was  on  this  occasion  duly  given,  but  the

noise  of  the  firing  and  the  smoke  from  the  gun- 
powder proved  too  much  even  for  Augustus 
Harris.    It  was  subsequently  omitted,  as  usual. 

Thanks  to  the  vagaries  of  one  of  the  artists,  this 
memorable  performance  came  near  to  not  being 
given  at  all.  The  opera  was  to  have  begun  at  eight 
o  ^clock,  but  it  was  quite  a  quarter  past  before  Man- 
cinelli  took  his  place  in  the  orchestra.  Then  an- 
other wait  ensued.  Thinking  there  must  be  some- 
thing amiss,  I  went  behind  the  scenes  to  make  in- 
quiries. I  was  informed  that  there  was  trouble 
with  the  principal  barytone,  and  that  if  I  went  to 
his  room  I  should  find  Mr.  Harris  there.  I  hur- 
ried to  the  dressing-room,  and  found  that  a  lively 
dispute  was  going  on  between  artist  and  manager. 
The  latter,  as  usual  in  an  emergency,  was  calm, 
self-possessed,  and  apparently  in  the  best  of  tem- 
pers; the  singer  was  gesticulating  wildly  and 
nearly  beside  himself  with  rage.  I  ventured  to 
ask  what  was  the  matter. 

^  ^  Matter !  ^ '  shouted  the  indignant  barytone.  *  ^  Do 
you  see  this  specimen  of  an  Englidi-made  costume  ? 
Did  you  ever  gaze  upon  such  a  disgraceful  fit! 
How  am  I  supposed  to  play  a  fastidious  gentleman 
like  Nevers,  and  go  upon  the  stage  in  a  doublet 
that  his  valet  would  have  declined  to  put  on  *?  Look 
at  this  right  sleeve!  It  fits  so  abominably  that  I 
have  had  to  tear  it  clean  away  at  the  shoulder  to 
make  it  hang  decently!'' 

Looking  closely  at  the  garment,  I  did  indeed  per- 
ceive that  it  was  torn  at  the  seam  under  the  arm ; 

227 


Thirty  Years  of 


but  otherwise  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  it. 
A  richer  and  handsomer  doublet  no  reasonable 
Comte  de  Nevers  could  have  desired  to  wear,  and 
I  told  the  gentleman  what  I  thought.  He  flung  him- 
self into  a  chair,  and  declared  that  he  positively 
refused  to  go  on  the  stage  in  such  a  costume. 

Matters  were  now  becoming  rather  serious.  In 
the  next  room  I  could  hear  Jean  de  Reszke  and 
Edouard  getting  their  respective  voices  into  trim 
by  the  execution  of  aerial  flights  and  descents  into 
the  depths  below.  Moreover,  I  could  hear  the  au- 
dience in  the  distance  stamping  and  clapping  their 
hands  with  impatience.  I  turned  to  Harris,  and 
asked  him  whether  another  Nevers  was  available. 

*'I  have  sent  for  Del  Puente,''  he  replied,  ^'but 
I  am  not  sure  that  we  shall  be  able  to  find  him.^' 
Then,  struck  by  a  sudden  idea,  Harris  addressed 
himself  once  more  to  the  recalcitrant  barytone: 
*^  Listen,  monsieur.  Your  complaint  about  this 
costume  is  merely  a  bit  of  caprice.  It  fits  you  per- 
fectly well;  and  even  though  you  have  torn  the 
sleeve,  a  pin  or  two  will  easily  put  that  right.  I 
now  ask  you  to  let  this  performance  commence.  If 
you  do  not,  I  shall  go  before  the  curtain  and  tell 
the  audience  exactly  why  it  is  that  they  are  being 
kept  waiting.'' 

I  added  a  word  to  the  effect  that  I  should  not 
fail  to  give  my  colleagues  of  the  press  a  precise 
and  particular  account  of  what  had  occurred,  un- 
less the  artist  instantly  put  an  end  to  a  situation 
that  was  at  once  ridiculous  and  offensive  to  the 

228 


Musical  Life  in  London 

public.  The  effect  of  this  double  shaft  was  elec- 
trical. A  moment  later  the  irate  singer  had  risen 
and  called  for  pins,  and  the  incident  was  closed. 
Less  than  half  a  dozen  people  knew  what  had 
happened,  for  the  secret  of  the  delay  was  not 
allowed  to  leak  out.  The  opera  began,  without 
comment,  half  an  hour  late,  and,  thanks  to  the 
Comte  de  Nevers  and  the  fifth  act,  it  was  not  over 
until  nearly  one  o'clock  in  the  morning.

SIR  ARTHUR  SULLIVAN  once  described  an 
English  triennial  festival  as  a  kind  of  musical 
boa-constrictor  which  so  overfed  itself  during  a 
given  week  that  it  required  the  whole  of  the  inter- 
vening three  years  to  go  through  the  operation  of 
digesting  the  feast.  Some  such  period  of  rest  for 
the  purpose  of  assimilation  would  appear  to  have 
been  needed  by  the  metropolis  after  the  Gargantuan 
operatic  banquet  which  it  enjoyed  during  the  sum- 
mer of  1887.  At  any  rate,  ten  consecutive  months 
elapsed  before  serious  opera  was  again  heard  there. 
Even  Carl  Rosa  kept  severely  in  the  provinces, 
contenting  himself  with  a  revival  of  Balfe's  opera, 
*  ^  The  Puritan 's  Daughter, ' '  and  producing,  for  the 
first  time  in  English,  Meyerbeer's  ^^L'Etoile  du 
Nord''  and  Halevy's  ^^La  Juive.''  The  annual 
visit  to  Drury  Lane  had  now  become,  indeed,  a 
thing  of  the  past. 

But  in  the  meantime  Augustus  Harris  was  not 
idle.    Quick  to  perceive  the  effect  that  his  brilliant

little  season  had  created,  and  feeling  pretty  sure 
that  he  had  frightened  all  his  rivals  out  of  the 
field,  he  set  about  preparing  the  ground  for  still 
more  extended  operations  in  the  near  future.  His 
heavy  loss  over  the  initial  experiment  did  not 
trouble  him.  ^^I  shall  recoup  myself,'^  he  said, 
*^with  the  aid  of  society.  I  shall  work  this  time 
upon  a  totally  different  plan.  Instead  of  burden- 
ing myself  with  the  whole  responsibility,  I  shall 
have  the  support  of  the  leaders  of  fashion  and  be 
guaranteed  a  big  subscription  before  I  start. ' '  This 
sounded  both  wise  and  promising;  but  I  asked, 
^^Do  you  expect  the  leaders  of  fashion  and  their 
following  to  come  to  Drury  LaneT'  *' Certainly 
not,"  was  Harris's  reply.  ''I  have  every  inten- 
tion, all  being  well,  of  taking  Covent  Garden  at  the 
earliest  practicable  date,  and  directing  the  regular 
season  of  the  ^Eoyal  Italian  Opera'  there  next 
summer. ' ' 


The  secret  of  the  manager's  ambition  was  out 
at  last.  He  had  only  used  his  own  theatre  as  the 
stepping-stone.  He  had  wanted  to  prove  that  he 
was  equal  to  the  task;  and,  with  such  material  as 
he  could  now  command,  the  rest  seemed  compara- 
tively easy.  However,  there  was  an  enormous 
amount  of  work  yet  to  be  done.  He  needed  all  his 
friends  to  help  him  in  the  good  cause;  and  I,  for 
one,  earnestly  begged  him  to  consider  me  always 
at  his  disposal.  My  duties  as  a  critic  had  not  so 
far  proved  an  obstacle  to  the  exercise  of  friendly 
offices,  freely  (and,  of  course,  gratuitously)  vouch-

safed;  nor  had  my  interest  in  the  enterprise  pre- 
vented me  from  writing  about  every  performance 
with  joerf  ect  impartiality.  Harris  knew  this  as  well 
as  I  did,  and  his  thanks,  both  then  and  always, 
were  expressed  with  the  utmost  heartiness. 

But  for  the  accomplishment  of  the  next  im- 
portant step,  Augustus  Harris  owed  nearly  every- 
thing to  the  enthusiasm  and  influence  of  Lady  de 
Grey  and  Lady  Charles  Beresf  ord.  These  popular 
women,  veritable  pillars  of  society,  had  already 
watched  with  something  more  than  superficial  in- 
terest the  progress  of  the  Drury  Lane  experiment. 
They  were  devoted  lovers  of  opera,  and  intense 
admirers  as  well  as  personal  friends  of  the  de 
Reszkes.  What  more  natural  than  that  they  should 
desire  to  see  the  personnel  of  the  Harris  establish- 
ment transferred  to  its  proper  home,  shining  in  a 
worthy  atmosphere  amid  fitting  and  congenial 
surroundings?  All  the  impresario  stipulated  was 
that  a  certain  number  of  boxes  should  be  sub- 
scribed for.  This  was  enough  for  the  two  ladies. 
With  the  aid  of  Mr.  Harry  V.  Higgins,  brother-in- 
law  of  Lady  de  Grey,  they  immediately  began  the 
hunt  for  subscribers,  restricting  their  canvass,  of 
course,  to  such  members  of  the  ^^ smart  set"  as 
would  be  acceptable  to  themselves  and  their 
friends;  and  this,  of  course,  was  only  an  added 
inducement  to  join  it.  The  requisite  number  of 
boxes  were  speedily  taken  up,  and  by  a  certain 
date  the  fair  canvassers  went  to  Mr.  Harris  with 
their  list. 


234 


Musical  Life  in  London 


Meanwhile  the  astute  manager  must  have  got 
wind  of  the  success  that  was  attending  the  search. 
At  any  rate,  he  suddenly  discovered  that  he  had 
been  too  modest  in  his  demands.  It  began  to  occur 
to  him  that  Covent  Garden  Theatre  and  its  con- 
tents, including  piles  of  well-worn  costumes  and 
stacks  of  shabby,  useless  scenery,  were  now  get- 
ting into  an  extremely  dilapidated  condition,  and 
that  in  all  probability  it  would  cost  him  an  outlay 
of  two  or  three  thousand  pounds  to  renovate  the 
opera-house  sufficiently  for  occupation  by  a  high- 
class  troupe  and  an  aristocratic  ahonnement.  He 
was  afraid  that  unless  so  many  more  boxes  were 
subscribed  for,  he  would  not  dare  venture  to  lease 
the  theatre.  Lady  de  Grey  and  Lady  Charles  Beres- 
ford  obligingly  saw  the  reasonableness  of  the  re- 
quest, and  tried  again— to  such  good  purpose  that 
within  a  few  hours  nearly  all  of  the  boxes  on 
the  grand  and  pit  tiers  were  definitely  allotted. 
This  time  Harris  simply  beamed  with  delight. 
He  saw  himself  the  proud  impresario  of  Covent 
Garden,  with  the  largest  subscription  known  for 
years;  and  that,  for  the  moment,  may  be  said 
to  have  constituted  the  summit  of  his  ambitions. 

During  the  extensive  preparations  which  now  en- 
sued, London,  as  I  have  already  hinted,  troubled 
itself  little  about  opera.  Music-lovers  found  ample 
food  for  enjoyment  in  their  ^'Pops,''  at  which 
Clara  Schumann,  Joachim,  Neruda,  Charles  Halle, 
Fanny  Davies  (now  the  most  popular  English 
pianist  of  her  sex),  and  Piatti  were  the  leading

lights.  They  took  pleasure  in  listening  to  fresh 
examples  of  English  talent,  such  as  Cowen's  fine 
^^Scandinavian''  symphony,  his  oratorio  ^^Ruth,'' 
and  his  cantata  ^^The  Sleeping  Beauty";  Stan- 
ford's ^^ Irish"  symphony;  Parry's  oratorio  ^^ Ju- 
dith"; J.  F.  Bridge's  cantata  ^ ^ Callirhoe " ;  Stain- 
er's  *  ^  Crucifixion " ;  and  Hamish  MacCunn's 
overture  ^^The  Land  of  the  Mountain  and  the 
Flood."  The  Philharmonic  Society  gave  a  most 
interesting  season,  with  Frederic  Cowen  (vice  Sir 
Arthur  Sullivan)  as  conductor.  Mme.  Schumann 
played  at  the  opening  concert;  and  subsequently 
two  famous  masters,  Edvard  Grieg  and  Peter 
Iljitsch  Tschaikovsky,  made  their  first  appear- 
ances in  England,  the  former  playing  his  concerto 
in  A  minor,  while  the  latter  conducted  his  seren- 
ade for  strings  and  the  variations  from  his  third 
orchestral  suite.  The  wonderful  boy  pianists, 
Josef  Hofmann  and  Otto  Hegner,  made  their 
London  debuts;  and  Hans  von  Biilow,  returning 
after  a  six  years'  absence,  executed  his  ^^Bee- 
thoven Cyclus"  at  what  proved  to  be  his  last 
series  of  performances  in  an  English  concert- 
room.  Von  Biilow  was  a  great  pianist,  but  a 
much  greater  conductor. 

On  Monday,  May  14,  Augustus  Harris  inau- 
gurated his  first  Covent  Garden  season.^    The  as- 

^  I  may  jnention  that  the  impresario  owed  a  great  deal,  during 
his  entire  period  of  operatic  management,  to  the  loyal  and  de- 
voted services  of  his  *' right-hand  man"  and  alter  ego,  Mr.  Fred 
G.  Latham,  who  subsequently,  for  several  years,  exercised  simi- 
lar functions  in  America  for  Mr.  Maurice  Grau.

pect  of  the  house  offered  the  strongest  possible 
contrast  to  the  records  of  the  preceding  ten  years. 
The  Prince  and  Princess  of  Wales  headed  one  of 
those  brilliant  assemblages  that  were  formerly  as- 
sociated only  with  ^^Patti  nights,"  and  altogether 
there  was  abundant  evidence  that,  with  the  re- 
awakening of  an  exalted  social  interest,  the  for- 
tunes of  the  ^ ^ Royal  Italian  Opera' '  were  once  more 
in  the  ascendant.  The  de  Reszkes  did  not  appear 
at  the  outset.  With  wise  diplomacy,  the  impre- 
sario kept  back  for  a  space  his  strong  trump  card, 
and  in  the  interim  showed  his  new  subscribers  that 
he  possessed  alike  the  ability  and  the  resources  for 
presenting  their  favorite  operas  with  attractive  en- 
sembles and  fresh  features  of  stage  treatment.  In 
^  ^  Lucrezia, ' '  the  opening  opera,  the  perennial  Tre- 
belli  filled  her  old  part  of  Maffio  Orsini;  in  ^^  Car- 
men'' the  gipsy  was  impersonated  for  the  first 
time  by  Nordica;  a  successful  debut  was  made  as 
Michaela  by  Marguerite  Macintyre,  a  pupil  of 
Manuel  Garcia;  in  ^^La  Traviata"  Ella  Russell 
appeared;  in  ^^ Faust"  Albani  and  Trebelli;  in 
^^Don  Giovanni"  Sigrid  Arnoldson,  Fiirsch-Madi, 
and  D'Andrade. 

Then,  on  the  24th,  was  given  ' '  Lucia  di  Lammer- 
moor,"  for  the  debut  at  Covent  Garden  of  a  new 
light  soprano  who  had  been  winning  laurels 
at  the  Brussels  Monnaie.  This  was  Mme.  Melba. 
For  months  we  had  been  reading  wonderful 
accounts  of  Mme.  Marches! 's  Australian  pupil, 
and  curiosity  concerning  her  vocal  powers  had  been 


237 


Thirty  Years  of 


roused  to  a  high  pitch.  It  was  not  actually  her  first 
appearance  before  a  London  audience.  She  had 
sung  two  years  before,  under  her  own  name  of 
Mrs.  Nellie  Armstrong,  at  a  concert  at  Prince's 
Hall  (now  the  Prince's  Restaurant  in  Piccadilly) ; 
but,  beyond  admiring  the  quality  of  her  voice,  I 
had  not  been  much  impressed  by  her  efforts  on  that 
occasion.  Augustus  Harris  also  heard  her  in  1886 
at  the  annual  dinner  of  the  Royal  General  The- 
atrical Fund,  at  which  he  presided.  She  had  been 
introduced  by  Mr.  Wilhelm  Ganz,  and  sang,  of 
course  without  fee,  the  ^^Ave  Maria''  of  Gounod. 
But  it  was  not  until  nearly  a  year  later  that  Harris 
was  preparing  his  Drury  Lane  season,  and  then, 
naturally,  he  gave  no  thought  to  *'Mrs.  Arm- 
strong," who  was  working  hard  with  Marches!  in 
Paris.^ 

Mme.  Melba's  initial  success  at  Covent  Garden 
was  not  wholly  unequivocal.    The  audience,  truly, 

^  In  the  "Daily  News"  (London)  my  esteemed  colleague  Percy 
Betts  recently  gave  the  following  amusing  account  of  the  narrow 
escape  that  Mme.  Melba  had  of  being  engaged  for  English  opera 
during  her  visit  to  London  in  1886:  ''Mr,  Ganz,  very  naturally, 
thought  a  great  deal  of  her  voice,  and  promised  to  introduce  her 
to  Carl  Eosa.  Mme.  Melba  at  that  time  was  extremely  anxious 
to  go  upon  the  operatic  stage  in  this  country  rather  than  in 
Paris,  for  she  was  diffident  as  to  her  French  accent.  It  was  there- 
fore practically  arranged  that  if  he  approved  of  her  voice  Carl 
Eosa  should  engage  her  for  five  years,  on  the  sort  of  sliding  scale 
which  he  at  that  time  adopted;  although  the  terms  were  very 
moderate'  indeed.  An  appointment  was  made  for  a  certain  day 
and  hour  at  Mr.  Ganz's  house,  and  Carl  Eosa  scribbled  a  note  on 
his  shirt  sleeve.  The  busy  impresario  doubtless  forgot  that, 
owing  to  the  exigencies  of  the  laundry,  unless  a  note  pencilled 


238 


Musical  Life  in  London 


went  into  raptures  and  gave  her  an  enthusiastic 
reception.  But  in  the  light  of  calmer  judgment 
the  critics  took  exception  to  certain  *^  manner- 
isms'^ of  style;  and  I,  for  one,  while  noting  the 
extraordinary  beauty  of  her  timbre  and  her  exceed- 
ingly brilliant  vocalization,  was  fain  to  declare  that 
her  singing  was  ^'to  an  extent  deficient  in  that 
indescribable  something  which  we  call  charm''; 
that  ^'her  accents  lacked  the  ring  of  true  pathos"; 
and  that,  despite  admirable  intelligence,  ''the  gift 
of  spontaneous  feeling  had  been  more  or  less  de- 
nied her."  As  an  actress  she  still  had  everything 
to  learn.  In  point  of  fact,  it  was  not  during  this 
season  that  Melba  began  to  build  up  the  pyramid 
of  her  real  London  triumphs.  The  raising  of  that 
structure  commenced  only  after  another  twelve- 
month of  hard  study  and  practical  stage  experi- 
ence. 

The  impatience  with  which  the  return  of  the  de 
Reszkes  was  awaited  can  be  better  imagined  than 
described.  It  was  emphasized  by  the  fact  that  they 
were  to  be  accompanied  by  their  friend  and  con- 
frere Jean  Lassalle,  and  that  the  ''French  Trio," 
as  they  were  subsequently  rather  inaptly  desig- 
nated, would  make  their  rentrees  together  in  a 
gorgeous  revival  of  "L'Africaine."  That  was  a 
great  night.     The  house  was  literally  crammed 

on  a  shirt  cuff  is  transferred  the  same  night  to  the  diary  it  is 
apt  to  be  overlooked  altogether.  In  the  result  the  appointment 
entirely  slipped  Carl  Rosa's  memory,  and  Mme.  Melba,  after  wait- 
ing at  Harley  Street  for  an  hour  or  two,  very  naturally  got 
impatient,  and  declined  further  to  entertain  the  matter."

from  floor  to  ceiling,  and  the  Prince  and  Princess 
of  Wales  led  the  applause  that  greeted  the  now 
famous  Polish  tenor  on  making  his  debut  upon  the 
stage  of  Covent  Garden  in  the  role  of  Vasco  di 
Gama.  He  sang  magnificently,  while  Lassalle's 
Nelusko  was,  if  possible,  more  fervid,  more  pictur- 
esque than  ever.  Nordica  was  less  well  suited  as 
Selika  than  as  Marguerite  in  ^  ^  Faust, "  which  part 
she  sang  with  the  three  distinguished  artists  later 
in  the  season.  Altogether,  though,  it  was  a  re- 
markable performance,  and  fairly  set  the  seal  upon 
Jean  de  Beszke's  renown  in  England,  besides  add- 
ing materially  to  Augustus  Harris's  prestige  as  a 
metteur  en  scene. 

While  they  were  in  London  at  this  time,  MM.  de 
Reszke  and  Lassalle  stayed  at  the  Continental  Ho- 
tel in  Regent  Street,  where  they  occupied  adjoining 
apartments  and  took  their  meals  together.  I  fre- 
quently used  to  join  them  at  lunch  or  dinner,  and  a 
cordial  welcome  always  awaited  me.  Then  we 
would  chat  over  the  events  of  the  preceding  night's 
performance,  discuss  its  merits  and  deficiencies, 
and  point  out  improvements  that  might  be  intro- 
duced in  the  future.  It  was  not  less  amazing  than 
interesting  to  see  how  these  three  gifted  artists 
would  criticize  each  other's  gestures  and  attitudes. 
Sometimes  they  would  move  away  the  table  and 
make  room  to  go  through  some  scene  with  full 
stage  action— going  over  it  again  and  again  until 
they  had  it  to  their  common  satisfaction.  On 
these  occasions  I  had  to  play  the  part  of  spectator 
and  deliver  my  verdict  upon  the  general  effect.

Or  else  we  would  talk  '' art  ^'— talk  it  steadily  by 
tlie  hour.  And  what  a  delight  that  was,  with  men 
whose  only  aim  was  to  reach  the  highest  goal  by 
the  noblest  path !  How  we  discussed  voice-produc- 
tion and  breathing!  Not  a  detail  of  that  wonder- 
ful subject  was  left  untouched.  Now  Jean  would 
show  us  how  a  tenor  should  manage  his  tones  so 
as  to  form  the  perfectly  equal  scale.  Now  Lassalle 
would  illustrate  the  marvelous  simplicity  of  the 
^^one  and  only''  method  which  he  designated  ^'la 
grande  ligne."  Finally,  Edouard  would  strip  to 
the  waist  to  give  us  an  example  of  his  extraor- 
dinary control  of  the  abdominal  muscles,  whereby, 
in  expanding  the  ribs  and  completely  filling  the 
lungs,  he  seemed  to  raise  the  lower  half  of  his 
figure  until,  like  one  barrel  sliding  inside  another, 
it  had  concealed  itself  in  the  vast  cavity  of  his 
chest. 

Once,  I  remember,  our  party  of  four  was  joined 
by  Tamagno  when  the  celebrated  Italian  tenor  was 
playing  Otello  at  the  Lyceum.  We  all  had  supper 
together  after  the  performance  and  were  in  the 
j  oiliest  of  moods.  Tamagno  had  a  slight  cold  on 
the  chest,  but  protested  that  it  made  no  difference 
whatever  in  the  singing  quality  of  his  head  tones. 
Catarrh  in  the  nose,  he  said,  was  fatal,  but  a  chest 
cold  made  not  the  least  difference  to  him.  Upon 
this,  Lassalle  offered  to  wager  that  he  could  sing 
higher  with  his  falsetto  than  Tamagno  with  his 
voce  di  petto.  The  challenge  was  accepted,  and 
forthwith  the  two  began  a  vocal  duel  the  like  of 
which  I  am  certain  I  shall  never  hear  again.    Out 


243 


Thirty  Years  of 


came  Tamagno's  A's  and  B  flats,  as  quickly 
responded  to  with  the  falsetto  equivalents  from 
Lassalle^s  sturdy  throat.  Then  the  Italian  went 
' '  one  better ' ' ;  and  the  Frenchman,  in  order,  as  he 
said,  to  help  himself  up  the  scale,  mounted  his 
chair  and  emitted  the  B  natural;  whereupon  Ta- 
magno  also  stood  upon  his  chair  and  brought  out 
not  only  a  high  C,  but  a  ringing  D  flat.  Lassalle 
was  now  for  mounting  the  table,  but,  this  being 
** ruled  out"  as  an  unfair  advantage  over  a  less 
athletic  opponent,  he  proceeded  to  get  the  neces- 
sary notes  from  the  eminence  of  his  chair,  amid 
terrific  applause  from  the  rest  of  the  company. 
Tamagno  now  made  a  bold  dash  for  a  D  natural, 
but  did  not  quite  succeed;  and  as  Lassalle  fared 
no  better,  we  pronounced  the  result  a  ^  ^  dead  heat. '  ^ 
Which,  at  that  somewhat  advanced  hour  of  the 
night,  was  perhaps  rather  a  blessing  for  the  neigh- 
boring occupants  of  the  hotel. 

One  great  piece  of  fun,  in  which  Edouard  and 
I  were  wont  to  indulge  for  the  especial  amuse- 
ment of  Jean,  was  an  imitation  of  the  later  de- 
clamatory style  of  Wagner.  At  that  time  neither 
brother  knew  by  heart  two  consecutive  bars  of  any 
more  advanced  score  than  that  of  ''Lohengrin." 
Edouard,  however,  shared  the  wonderful  imitative 
faculty  of  his  elder  brother,  and  had  a  sufficiently 
good  notion  of  the  character  of  Wagnerian  recita- 
tive to  be  able  to  caricature  it  with  facility.  Ac- 
cordingly, I  would  improvise  upon  the  piano  a 
*' fearful   and  wonderful"   series   of  leitmotiven, 


244 


Musical  Life  in  London 


varied  by  strange  dissonances  and  startling  modu- 
lations, which  Edouard  for  his  part  would  follow 
from  key  to  key  with  marvelous  alertness,  declaim- 
ing the  while  the  most  unvocal  phrases  in  an  im- 
possible guttural  language  which  might  as  easily 
have  been  mistaken  for  Chinese  as  for  German. 
The  effect  of  this  absurd  improvisation  a  deux 
was  certainly  very  ludicrous,  and  from  no  one  did 
it  evoke  heartier  laughter  than  from  the  artist 
who  was  ere  long  to  portray  in  ideal  fashion  the 
noblest  of  Wagner's  heroes. 

Among  the  remaining  features  of  the  opera  sea- 
son of  1888  to  which  attention  may  be  drawn,  was 
a  revival  of  Verdi's  *^Un  Ballo  in  Maschera,"  Jean 
de  Reszke  playing  Riccardo  for  the  first  time,  with 
Scalchi,  Sigrid  Arnoldson,  and  Lassalle  in  other 
parts.  ^^Guillaume  Tell''  was  given  for  Lassalle 
and  Edouard  de  Reszke;  and  the  latter  also  made 
a  notable  hit  in  Boito's  ^ '  Mefistof ele, "  in  which, 
by  the  way,  the  parts  of  Margherita  and  Helen  of 
Troy  were  for  once  separately  undertaken  by  Mar- 
guerite Macintyre  and  Ella  Russell.  I  may  further 
mention  the  highly  favorable  debut  of  Zelie  de 
Lussan  in  her  captivating  embodiment  of  Carmen; 
while  Nordica  essayed  for  the  first  time  the  role 
of  Aida  with  entire  success.  The  results  of  the 
season  of  1888  were,  as  a  whole,  artistically  and 
financially  satisfactory.  Not  only  was  it  unat- 
tended by  loss,  but  the  attitude  of  Augustus 
Harris's  new  clientele  clearly  indicated  that  that 
all-important    factor,    the    regular    subscription.

might  hereafter  be  counted  upon  as  permanent. 
This  in  itself  was  an  enormous  step  toward  regain- 
ing  the  path  of  prosperity.  In  the  direction  of 
stage  reform,  of  greater  catholicity  of  taste,  of 
improved  working  in  every  branch  of  the  enter- 
prise, there  yet  remained  much  to  be  accomplished. 

Above  all,  there  was  need  to  strengthen  the  re- 
pertory. Covent  Garden  had  too  long  furnished 
a  surfeit  of  hackneyed  Italian  operas;  of  mod- 
ern works  of  the  best  type  it  offered  too  few. 
The  genius  of  Wagner  was  represented  by  a  paltry 
two  or  three  of  his  earlier  operas,  and  there  seemed 
little,  if  any,  prospect  of  the  number  being  added 
to  in  the  immediate  future.  With  this  thought  in 
my  mind,  I  approached  Augustus  Harris  during 
the  last  days  of  the  season  and  begged  him  to 
give  the  matter  of  the  repertory  his  serious  at- 
tention, particularly  with  the  view  to  mounting, 
if  possible,  more  of  Wagner's  works. 

*'I  shall  only  be  too  glad  to  do  that,''  he  said. 
*^I  don't  exactly  see  yet  how  I  am  to  cast  the  later 
Wagner  operas,  but  that  question  can  be  left  open 
for  the  present.  Meantime,  I  think  I  should  like 
to  go  to  Bayreuth  this  summer.  Will  you  come 
with  me?"  I  replied  that  I  had  already  arranged 
to  go  with  some  friends  early  in  August.^ 

**That  will  be  too  late  for  me,"  said  Harris. 
*^I  must  be  back  early  in  August  to  begin  the  re- 

^  I  had  then  not  long  been  appointed  a  professor  of  singing  at 
the  Guildhall  School  of  Music,  and  mj  various  duties  kept  me  in 
town  until  the  end  of  July.

liearsals  for  the  autumn  drama.  I  will  take  Man- 
cinelli^  with  me,  and  let  him  have  a  lesson  in 
the  Wagnerian  business  as  carried  on  at  ^head- 
quarters/ '^ 

Three  weeks  later  I  met  impresario  and  con- 
ductor together  at  Bayreuth  on  the  day  that  they 
were  to  take  their  departure.  Both  were  full 
of  the  wonders  they  had  seen  and  heard.  The 
works  given  that  year  were  ' '  Parsifal, ' '  ^  ^  Tristan, ' ' 
and  ^'Die  Meistersinger'^— the  Nuremberg  opera 
for  the  first  time  at  Bayreuth.  I  asked  Harris 
which  of  the  three  he  had  decided  to  do  at  Covent 
Garden  next  season. 

** Parsifal, ''  was  his  unblushing  reply;  '^that  is, 
if  Frau  Cosima  will  oblige  me  with  the  necessary 
permission.  But  I  am  afraid  she  won't.  Seri- 
ously, though,  I  should  like  to  do  the  ^Meister- 
singer,'  even  if  I  have  to  give  it  in  Italian  and 
get  the  text  specially  translated.  If  only  Jean 
de  Eeszke  would  sing  Walther!  See  poor  old 
Gudehus  in  the  paxt  here,  and  then  imagine  for 
yourself  what  a  perfect  Walther  Jean  would 
make ! ' ' 

I  made  no  comment,  but  took  a  mental  note 
of  Harris's  wish.  It  occurred  to  me  that  there 
might  be  a  chance  before  long  of  helping  him  to 
realize  his  idea. 

^  The  Italian  conductor  had  quickly  become  a  favorite,  and 
the  admiration  of  his  undoubted  gifts  had  been  enhanced  by  the 
production  at  the  Norwich  Festival,  in  1887,  of  his  oratorio 
*'Isaias, ''  wherein  originality  and  fine  musicianship  were  alike 
conspicuous. 

249 


Thirty  Years  of 


My  experience  at  Bayreuth  that  summer  was 
wholly  delightful,  despite  the  customary  heat  and 
the  inevitable  dust.  The  representations  were  of 
transcendent  excellence,  the  casts  incomparable; 
for  example,  ^'Parsifal"  with  Alvary,  Scheide- 
mantel,  Wiegand,  and  Therese  Malten;  ^^  Tristan 
und  Isolde ' '  with  Rosa  Sucher  and  Heinrich  Vogl ; 
'^Die  Meistersinger"  with  Bettaque,  Gudehus, 
Friedrichs,  and  Reichmann.  The  conductors  in 
turn  were  Hermann  Levi,  Felix  Mottl,  and  Hans 
Richter.  In  a  word,  those  were  among  the  ' '  palmy 
days''  of  the  Bayreuth  Festspiel.  After  leaving 
the  sleepy  old  Bavarian  town,  I  went  for  a  fort- 
night to  the  Austrian  Tyrol.  Then,  instead  of  re- 
turning direct  to  London  via  Cologne,  I  left  the 
Rhine  steamer  at  Coblenz  and  paid  a  visit  of  two 
or  three  days  to  Ems. 

My  reason  for  going  to  Ems  was  simply  this: 
Jean  and  Edouard  de  Reszke  were  staying  there, 
together  with  Lassalle,  and  I  had  a  special  object 
in  wishing  to  see  them.  I  was  only  just  in  time, 
for  they  had  all  but  completed  their  ^^cure,"  and 
were  intending  to  be  off  to  Poland  or  Paris  in  a 
day  or  two.  At  Ems  also  was  Mme.  jSTordica,  ac- 
companied by  her  mother;  and  a  very  pleasant 
evening  we  all  spent  together  on  the  day  of  my 
arrival.  Next  morning  I  took  breakfast  with  the 
famous  trio  at  their  hotel— a  prelude  to  what  was 
to  prove  one  of  the  most  interesting  incidents  of 
my  life.  It  was  raining  hard,  I  remember,  and  we 
had  i3lenty  of  time  to  linger  over  our  coffee  and 


250 


Musical  Life  in  London 


cigars.  Naturally,  the  conversation  turned  upon 
Bayreuth,  and  I  had  to  give  a  detailed  account 
of  what  had  taken  place  there.  This  was  precisely 
what  I  wanted.  I  took  care,  however,  to  dwell  with 
particular  frequency  and  emphasis  upon  one  of  the 
works  that  I  had  heard,  and  I  referred  to  its  beau- 
ties so  often  that  at  last  Lassalle  said: 

^  ^  I  wish  you  would  tell  us  something  more  about 
this  '  Meistersinger. '    Tell  us  the  story ! '  ^ 

I  turned  to  Jean  and  Edouard :  ' '  But,  of  course, 
you  both  know  the  plot  of  the  'Meistersinger.' 
Would  it  not  weary  you  to  listen  while  I  relate 
it  to  our  friend  here?'' 

'* Indeed  no,"  rejoined  the  elder  brother;  *'we 
have  only  the  haziest  notion  of  the  story,  and  I 
should  be  really  glad  to  hear  it  properly  narrated. " 

I  thereupon  proceeded  to  describe,  with  all  the 
eloquence  at  my  command,  the  manner  in  which 
Sir  Waltlier  von  Stolzing  sets  about  his  wooing  of 
the  fair  Eva,  and  how,  with  the  aid  of  the  poet- 
cobbler,  Hans  Sachs,  the  gallant  knight  eventually 
succeeds  in  overcoming  the  prejudices  of  the  well- 
meaning  mastersingers  and  winning  the  hand  of 
the  goldsmith's  daughter.  I  emphasized  every 
point  in  the  comedy;  I  dwelt  upon  its  rare  com- 
mingling of  humor  and  poetic  sentiment;  I  en- 
larged upon  the  wondrous  art  of  the  composer  in 
treating  his  exquisite  pictures  of  medieval  German 
life ;  in  short,  I  so  brought  my  listeners  under  the 
spell  of  the  story  that  at  last  they  had  wrought 
themselves  up  to  a  pitch  of  interest  bordering 


251 


Thirty  Years  of 


upon  excitement.  A  lorofessional  Persian  story- 
teller could  not  have  desired  a  richer  reward  for 
his  efforts.  I  lost  no  time,  but  quickly  set  about 
driving  the  wedge  home: 

^^If  you  can  find  such  pleasure  in  a  simple  nar- 
rative of  this  plot,  imagine  what  must  be  the  de- 
light of  hearing  the  opera  itself !  And  that  you 
can  accomxplish  by  the  simple  process  of  going  to 
Bayreuth  before  the  end  of  next  week!'' 

I  said  it  without  seriously  hoping  that  my  ad- 
vice would  be  acted  upon.  But  the  influence  of 
the  moment  was  rdore  powerful  than  I  had  im- 
agined. The  three  artists  forthwith  declared  their 
intention  of  setting  out  for  Bayreuth  without  de- 
lay; and,  to  make  good  their  words,  they  immedi- 
ately sent  off  a  telegram  requesting  that  seats 
should  be  reserved  for  the  final  series  of  repre- 
sentations. At  the  same  time,  Lassalle,  who  could 
not  read  German,  wired  to  Brussels  for  a  French 
translation  of  the  libretto,  which,  I  believe, 
reached  him  in  time.  Mme.  Nordica,  who  was  on 
the  point  of  leaving  Ems,  was  duly  apprised  of 
their  determination  and  invited  to  accompany 
them;  which  she  did.  On  the  following  day  I 
again  breakfasted  with  the  three  friends— this 
time  on  the  summit  of  the  Marlberg.  I  was  quite 
prepared  to  hear  that  they  had  altered  their 
minds;  but,  on  the  contrary,  they  were  more  bent 
than  ever  on  going.  In  the  afternoon  I  left  Ems 
for  England.  Later  in  the  month,  I  received  from 
Mme.  Nordica  this  letter: 


252 


Musical  Life  in  London 


Berlin,  August  21,  1888. 
Dear  Mr.  Klein  : 

I  thought  you  would  perhaps  like  to  know  how  we 
enjoyed  our  Bayreuth  experience.  Well,  it  was  truly 
most  sublime! 

My  mother  and  I  remained  in  Ems  and  went  along 
with  the  "  Monsters. '^  And  a  very  jolly  journey  we  had. 
I  was  fortunate  enough  to  get  tickets  for  both  operas, 
and  after  each  act  we  adjourned  to  the  cafe,  hard  by, 
to  talk  it  over.  I  think  Lassalle  enjoyed  it  least  of  all. 
But  at  the  last  moment  all  were  very  triste,  because, 
after  all  their  calculations,  M.  Lassalle  received  a  tele- 
gram from  France  calling  him  home  to  his  children. 
So  Jean  and  Edouard  were  obliged  to  ^'trudge"  on  to 
Breslau,  while  their  friend  fled  back  to  Paris.  Your 
humble  servant  plodded  on  to  Berlin,  and  here  end  the 
riotous  and  mirthful  scenes  with  which  we  are  fully 
acquainted. 

I  am  having  splendid  success  here. 

My  mother  wishes  to  be  kindly  remembered,  and  so 
does 

Yours  very  sincerely, 

Lillian  Nordica. 

The  effect  of  the  visit  to  Bayreuth  was  such  that 
Jean  de  Reszke  and  Lassalle  decided  without  fur- 
ther hesitation  to  study  ^^Die  Meistersinger "  for 
the  following  season.  Meanwhile,  a  proposition 
had  for  some  time  been  laid  before  the  ^^trio"  by 
Mapleson  for  a  visit  to  the  United  States  in  the 
spring  of  1889.  This  was  seriously  considered, 
and  for  a  while  it  seemed  highly  probable  that 


253 


Thirty  Years  of 


the  famous  artists  would  make  their  advent  in 
America  under  the  banner  of  the  old  impresario 
of  Her  Majesty's.  As  usual,  however,  the  latter 
was  able  to  command  everything  but  the  neces- 
sary capital,  and  so  the  project  came  to  nothing. 
The  advanced  point  reached  in  the  negotiations  is 
clearly  indicated  by  the  following  letter,  which  I 
received  early  in  November: 

[Translated  from  the  French.] 

Paris,  Wednesday. 

My  dear  Friend: 

At  last  Lassalle  has  returned  from  Lyons,  and  I  am 
able  to  give  you  an  answer  on  the  subject  of  Mapleson. 
With  Lassalle  nothing  has  been  signed.  Mapleson  has 
verbally  settled  the  clauses  of  the  contract,  but  no  sig- 
natures have  been  exchanged;  and  it  is  even  very  dis- 
agreeable, because  Lassalle,  as  a  matter  of  delicacy,  will 
accept  no  other  engagement  while  Mapleson  shows  a 
sign  of  life.  My  brother  and  I  have  arranged  the  bases 
of  our  contracts,  the  salary,  the  repertory,  the  number 
of  representations,  etc.;  but  we  are  waiting  in  vain  for 
the  contracts.  Mapleson  was  to  have  given  us  certain 
guarantees  that  we  asked  for,  and  for  our  part  we  also, 
as  a  matter  of  delicacy,  are  waiting  until  he  decides  to 
come  and  sign  these  clauses.  There  you  have  the  truth : 
as  in  London,  so  at  Ems,  we  talked  over  with  Mapleson 
the  whole  of  the  project  for  America,  discussed  figures, 
and  separated  good  friends;  but  in  words  only — in  writ- 
ing not  so  much  as  a  shadow !  This  is  very  annoying  for 
us,  for  we  are  refusing  quite  a  quantity  of  business  for 
this  *' unsigned"  America.     I  hope  that  Mapleson  will 


254 


Musical  Life  in  London 


end  by  arranging  the  entire  affair,  for  just  now  tie  is 
counting  a  little  too  much  on  our  patience.  My  dear 
friend,  I  shall  be  delighted  to  see  you  at  the  premiere 
of  ''Romeo."  A  place  will  be  reserved  for  you.  Bay- 
reuth  was  superb !  I  cherish  the  memory  of  it  among 
my  most  poetic  souvenirs.  A  thousand  friendly  greet- 
ings and  a  shake  of  the  hand  from  your  devoted 

Jean  de  Reszke. 

But  not  until  I  saw  him  in  Paris  did  I  learn  from 
Jean  de  Reszke  's  own  lips  the  deep  and  ineffaceable 
impression  that  the  Bayreuth  representations  had 
left  upon  him.  His  decision  to  essay  the  role  of 
Walther  von  Stolzing  had,  however,  been  com- 
municated to  Augustus  Harris  without  delay,  as 
also  the  intimation  that  Lassalle  would  play  Hans 
Sachs.  It  is  not  too  much  to  say  that  the  news  filled 
the  enthusiastic  manager  with  genuine  pleasure. 
He  at  once  commissioned  the  late  Giannandrea 
Mazzucato  to  prepare  an  Italian  translation  of  the 
text,  and  bade  Mancinelli  mark  the  ' '  cuts ' '  essential 
for  reducing  the  score  of  '^Die  Meistersinger ' ' 
to  the  Covent  Garden  limits  of  that  period— a  task 
which  the  worthy  conductor  performed  with  char- 
acteristic liberality.  These  were  regrettable  but 
indispensable  adjuncts  of  an  otherwise  welcome  ex- 
periment, the  ultimate  success  of  which  was  to  lead 
to  results  infinitely  more  important  and  far-reach- 
ing than  I  could  have  dreamed  when  I  related  that 
simple  story  of  medieval  Nuremberg  over  the 
breakfast-table  at  Ems.

Patti  and  Jean  de  Reszke  in  "Rom6o  et  Juliette"— Historical 
night  at  the  Paris  Opera— Carl  Rosa's  death— The  controlling

A  HAPPY,  if  fortuitous,  circumstance  was  that 
which  brought  upon  the  same  scene,  toward 
the  end  of  1888,  the  two  most  illustrious  lyric  ar- 
tists of  their  time.  The  rising  star  of  Jean  de 
Reszke  had  displaced  no  more  familiar  planet;  it 
simply  filled  a  vacant  foremost  position  in  the  con- 
stellation of  operatic  favorites.  For  some  four 
years  Adelina  Patti  had  ceased  to  appear  regularly 
in  opera  in  London;  but  in  the  concert-room  and 
upon  the  Continental  stage  she  still  enchanted  vast 
audiences,  and,  in  every  sphere  alike,  the  brilliant 
orb  of  the  ^  ^  queen  of  song ' '  continued  to  blaze  with 
undimmed  splendor.  Now,  in  my  opinion,  there 
would  have  been  ample  space  for  these  two  famous 
stars  to  shine  in  company  at  Covent  Garden  with- 
out one  detracting  in  the  smallest  degree  from  the 
brightness  of  the  other.  Yet,  with  all  his  pluck, 
Augustus  Harris  never  ventured  upon  this  ^^  great 
emprise.'*  Whether  from  motives  of  economy  or 
for  some  more  obscure  reason,  I  cannot  say;  but,

if  the  former,  he  had  before  him  the  striking  ex- 
ample of  the  ^^ coalition  season''  of  1879,  when  Gye 
and  Mapleson  united  their  wonderful  array  of 
forces  at  Covent  Garden  and  made  between  them 
a  net  profit  of  £24,000  ($120,000). 

Strangely  enough,  it  was  Paris  that  was  to  do 
the  trick.  That  highly  favored  institution,  the 
Academie  Nationale  de  Musique,  was  to  have  the 
honor  of  including  in  its  bill,  ^'for  a  few  nights 
only,''  the  distinguished  names  of  Adelina  Patti 
and  Jean  de  Reszke.  They  were  no  strangers. 
They  had  known  each  other  in  the  earlier  days 
when  the  tenor  was  singing  as  a  barytone,  and 
the  diva  had  given  much  friendly  advice  and  en- 
couragement to  the  young  Pole,  whom  she  was 
wont  to  address  by  his  petit  nom  of  ' '  Giovannini. ' ' 

The  occasion  that  brought  them  together  again 
was  the  first  performance  at  the  Grand  Opera  of 
Gounod 's  '  ^  Romeo  et  Juliette. ' '  Curious  had  been 
the  history  of  this  work  in  the  two  capitals.  It 
was  first  produced  at  Paris  at  the  Theatre-Lyrique 
in  1867,  the  part  of  Juliette  being  then  sung  by 
Mme.  Miolan-Carvalho,  the  original  Marguerite  of 
Gounod's  ^' Faust."  In  1873,  when  the  Theatre- 
Lyrique  disappeared,  *^ Romeo  et  Juliette"  was 
transferred  to  the  boards  of  the  Opera-Comique, 
and  at  about  the  same  time  it  was  given  at  Covent 
Garden  in  Italian,  with  Mario  and  Patti  in  the  title 
roles.  Later  on  the  renowned  prima  donna  (then 
the  Marquise  de  Caux)  appeared  in  the  same  ver- 
sion  with   the   handsome   French   tenor,    Ernest

Nicolini,  who  was  subsequently  to  become  her 
second  husband.  Notwithstanding  these  interpre- 
tative advantages,  neither  in  Paris  nor  in  London 
did  '^iiomeo  et  Juliette''  take  any  real  hold  upon 
the  affections  of  the  public.  ^^ Faust"  was  by  far 
the  most  popular  opera  of  the  day.  "Romeo" 
seemed  to  be  merely  tolerated  because  it  was  by 
the  same  composer  and  on  account  of  its  Shak- 
sperian  subject,  rather  than  for  any  intrinsic  merits 
of  its  own.  I  know  not  which  were  the  unkinder 
toward  it,  the  French  or  the  English  critics.  The 
latter  plainly  called  it  a  dull,  tedious  opera.  One 
of  the  former  complained  that  the  "symphonic 
element  dominated  it  too  much";  that  the  duo 
Valouette  required  "more  naive  emotion,  fewer 
heart-rending  dissonances  and  violent  cries,  more 
art  and  more  nuances ' ' ;  finally,  that  the  composer 
had  "preferred  to  make  concessions  to  the  doc- 
trine of  the  music  of  the  future,  while  discarding 
the  exigencies  of  taste  and  ear,  and  making  of  it 
a  realistic  drama. ' '  ^ 

Autres  temps ,  autres  moeurs!  During  the  "eight- 
ies" a  distinct  change  of  attitude  began  to  mani- 
fest itself  in  Paris  toward  "Romeo  et  Juliette." 
I  recollect  a  performance  at  the  Opera-Comique 
in  1886,  with  Talazac  and  Adele  Isaac,  that  de- 
lighted not  only  myself  but  a  crowded  and  demon- 
strative house.  At  last  Gounod,  still  hale  and 
hearty,  arranged  for  his  work  to  be  transferred

from  a  stage  that  was  too  small  for  it  to  the  opera- 
house  where  it  ought  originally  to  have  seen  the 
light.  The  directors,  MM.  Ritt  and  Gailhard,  had 
the  discrimination  to  foresee  a  valuable  addition 
to  their  repertoire,  and  determined  to  mount  it 
with  a  superb  mise  en  scene  and  the  finest  obtain- 
able cast.  Gounod  himself  undertook  to  conduct 
the  inaugural  performance,  and,  in  compliance 
with  the  stupid  traditions  of  the  Paris  Opera,  he 
consented  to  furnish  the  music  for  a  ballet,  without 
which  at  that  time  no  work,  whatever  its  source, 
could  obtain  admission  to  this  law-ridden  stage. 

I  went  to  Paris  expressly  to  attend  this  most 
interesting  premiere,  which  took  place  on  Novem- 
ber 28,  1888.  Seats  were  not  only  at  a  high  pre- 
mium but  virtually  unobtainable,  and  I  owed  the 
possession  of  mine  to  the  courtesy  of  Jean  de 
Reszke.  Many  a  time  I  have  looked  upon  the 
heavily  gilded  and  slightly  sombre  interior  of  the 
Paris  Opera-house,  but  never  when  it  contained 
such  an  audience,  such  a  gathering  of  famous  men, 
of  elegant,  jewel-bedecked  women,  as  appeared 
there  on  that  memorable  night.  The  grandes 
dames  of  the  French  aristocracy  were  present,  dis- 
playing a  sartorial  splendor  that  recalled  the 
halcyon  days  of  the  Second  Empire,  and  what  that 
implied  I  can  only  leave  my  fair  readers  to  guess. 
On  taking  the  conductor's  seat,  Gounod  was  over- 
whelmed with  acclamations.  His  calm,  serene 
countenance  wore  an  encouraging  smile,  and  no

one  would  have  dreamed  that  the  veteran  com- 
poser was  as  anxious  as  though  it  were  the  first 
performance  of  a  brand-new  opera. 

At  the  outset,  indeed,  every  one  was  nervous. 
Many  years  had  elapsed  since  Mme.  Patti  had  ap- 
peared at  the  Opera,  and,  often  as  she  had  enacted 
Juliette-y  this  was  the  first  time  she  had  sung  the 
part  in  French;  in  the  waltz  air— long  one  of  her 
favorite  concert-pieces— she  did  what  was  for  her 
the  rarest  imaginable  thing:  she  made  a  slip 
that  carried  her  four  bars  ahead  of  the  accom- 
paniment (^'Elle  sautait  quatre  mesures!'^  as 
Gounod  subsequently  put  it).  Yet,  thanks  to  her 
extraordinary  presence  of  mind,  the  great  prima 
donna  regained  her  place  so  quickly  that  probably 
not  twenty  persons  in  the  audience  noticed  the 
error.  Moreover,  she  sang  the  whole  waltz  with 
such  grace  and  entrain  that  an  encore  was  inevit- 
able, and  on  the  repetition  her  rendering  of  it  was 
the  most  brilliant  I  have  ever  heard  her  give.  The 
youthfulness  and  charm  of  her  assumption  were 
astounding,  while  her  fine  acting  in  the  more  tragic 
scenes  indicated  a  startling  advance  in  histrionic 
force  over  her  effort  in  the  same  opera  ten  years 
earlier. 

The  new  Romeo  proved  worthy  of  his  associa- 
tion with  this  perfect  Juliette.  The  mere  fact  that 
it  was  Jean  de  Reszke  may  be  deemed  suiOficient 
guarantee  of  that  to-day;  it  is  not  easy,  however, 
to  convey  an  idea  of  the  striking  revelation  which 
his  impersonation  offered  as,  step  by  step,  scene

by  scene,  it  unfolded  itself  for  the  first  time  upon 
the  same  plane  with  Patti's  exquisite  conception. 
Every  attribute  that  distinguished  the  one  arose, 
strong  and  clear-cut,  in  the  other.  Never  before, 
at  least  in  their  operatic  mold,  had  the  hapless 
Veronese  lovers  been  so  faultlessly  matched. 
Where  was  ^ ^monotony,''  where  was  ^Hedium,'' 
now?  The  interest  of  that  delicious  sequence  of 
love-duets  acquired  a  fresh  intensitj^,  and  became 
'^cumulative"  in  such  a  degree  that  the  final  scene 
in  the  tomb  formed  a  veritable  climax  of  musical 
as  well  as  dramatic  grandeur.  The  genius  of 
Gounod  stood  in  a  new  light;  and  his  personal 
triumph  on  this  occasion  was  a  fitting  corollary  to 
that  of  the  great  artists  who  were  his  chief  inter- 
preters. Again  and  again  did  they  appear  before 
the  curtain,  hand  in  hand,  an  illustrious  trio,— 
to  be  converted  into  an  illustrious  quartet  after 
Edouard  de  Eeszke  had  invested  with  his  own 
unique  organ  notes  the  grateful  phrases  of  Frere 
Laurent.  From  first  to  last,  it  was  a  historic  per- 
formance.^ 

^  The  following  is  the  translation  of  a  letter  which  Gounod  ad- 
dressed to  Jean  de  Eeszke  in  1892  (the  year  of  the  composer's 
death),  on  the  day  after  the  tenor's  appearance  in  the  one-hun- 
dredth performance  of  **Eomeo"  at  the  Paris  Opera: 

^ '  My  dear  Jean  : 

''You  literally  surpassed  yourself  last  night.  Perhaps  that  sur- 
prises you?  It  does  me,  too.  Nevertheless,  it  is  true.  Never 
have  you  carried  to  such  a  height  that  beauty  of  diction  and 
gesture,  that  correctness  and  expressiveness  of  accent,  that  con- 
trol of  voice  production — in  a  word,  that  perfectly  balanced  pro- 
portion which  alone  makes  the  great  artist  by  placing  him  beyond

Thirty  Years  of 


It  was  natural  that  the  tremendous  success  now 
reported  from  Paris  should  draw  the  attention  of 
Augustus  Harris  to  Gounod's  hitherto  neglected 
opera.  He  immediately  secured  such  performing 
rights  as  were  surviving  in  the  work,  and  arranged 
to  give  it  at  Covent  Garden  during  the  season  of 
1889.  Therewith  came  about  a  decision  which  was 
to  lead  to  one  of  the  most  important  innovations 
of  the  new  regime.  Why  revive  ^' Romeo''  in 
Italian?  Why  not  give  it  in  the  original  French! 
The  establishment  in  Bow  Street  might  still  bear 
the  courtesy  title  of  ^'The  Royal  Italian  Opera"; 
but  with  two  thirds  of  the  active  repertory  French 
and  German,  this  was  surely  a  misnomer,  or  would 
be  so  but  for  the  pious  superstition  that  London 
society  never  cared  for  opera  unless  sung  in  Italian. 

Not  only  did  the  de  Reszkes  prefer  to  sing  in 
French,  but  many  members  of  the  company  were 
now  taken  from  the  Paris  and  Brussels  opera- 
houses.  Among  them  was  Mme.  Melba,  who  was 
to  replace  Mme.  Patti  as  Juliette  in  the  Covent 
Garden  cast.  On  the  whole,  therefore,  it  was  found 
easier  to  perform  ^^ Romeo"  to  the  original  text 
than  to  any  other;  and  this  happy  contingency, 

the  danger  of  extremes,  the  perpetual  temptation  of  the  incom- 
petent. Thanks  and  bravo,  again  and  always!  May  heaven  pre- 
serve you  and  leave  us  your  beautiful  art  as  long  as  possible! 
Of  such  as  you  we  have  great  need.  Eemember  me  to  dear 
Edouard,  \yho,  like  yourself,  has  the  air  of  having  been  born  in 
his  role,  and  believe  me,  both  of  you, 

"Cordially  yours, 

''Ch.  Gounod.''

while  it  enhanced  the  London  success  of  the  opera, 
also  opened  Harris's  eyes  to  the  weighty  fact 
that  operas  sounded  best— and  were  most  accept- 
able to  his  subscribers— in  the  language  to  which 
they  were  composed.  The  full  demonstration 
of  this  truth  was  not  to  come,  however,  until 
later  on. 

Meanwhile,  a  serious  blow  was  inflicted  upon  the 
cause  of  opera  in  England  through  the  death  of 
Carl  Rosa,  which  occurred  in  Paris  on  April  30, 
1889.  Failing  health  had  for  some  time  materially 
restricted  the  scope  of  his  labors;  and,  in  the 
opinion  of  his  best  friends,  he  committed  a  signal 
error  when  he  converted  his  enterprise  into  a  lim- 
ited liability  company.  On  the  other  hand,  he  did 
a  good  stroke  of  business  when  he  induced  Au- 
gustus Harris  to  unite  with  him  and  make  it  a 
joint  undertaking.  Thereby,  poor  fellow,  he  length- 
ened the  life  of  the  concern,  if  powerless  to  pro- 
long his  own.  I  have  shown  before  how  admirably 
these  gifted  men  worked  together,  and  it  was  a 
thousand  pities  that  they  were  not  permitted  to 
^^run  in  double  harness '^  a  few  years  longer.  The 
harm  wrought  by  this  premature  separation  was 
serious  in  every  way— most  of  all,  perhaps,  in  that 
it  shifted  an  excessive  load  of  work  and  responsi- 
bility upon  the  shoulders  of  the  surviving  partner. 
Augustus  Harris  now  became  managing  director 
of  the  Carl  Eosa  company,  as  well  as  lessee  and 
manager  of  Drury  Lane  and  impresario  of  the 
Royal  Italian  Opera;  and,  even  in  an  age  of  huge 


265 


Thirty  Years  of 


trusts  and  giant  administrators,  that  was  too  much 
for  a  single  individual  to  undertake. 

It  is  apropos  to  note  here  the  imperceptible  but 
steady  growth  of  an  influence  which  was  to  ex- 
ercise an  important  bearing  upon  the  trend  and 
ultimate  development  of  the  Covent  Garden  enter- 
prise. The  subscription  for  the  season  of  1889  was 
larger  than  ever.  The  Prince  of  Wales  (now  King 
Edward  VII)  was  taking  a  deep  personal  interest 
in  the  opera,  and  he  and  the  Princess  were  among 
its  most  regular  attendants.  Closely  in  the  royal 
wake  followed  an  ever-augmenting  section  of  the 
aristocracy,  overflowing  by  this  time  from  grand- 
and  pit-tier  boxes  into  several  rows  of  stalls.  Now, 
the  ^^ interests"  of  these  subscribers  had  to  be 
studied,  and  the  duty  of  representing  them  vis-d 
vis  with  the  manager  was  fulfilled  with  much  tact  by 
Mr.  Harry  V.  Higgins,  the  brother-in-law  of  Lady 
de  Grey.  Her  ladyship  never  for  an  instant  re- 
laxed the  hold  which  her  initial  efforts  had  given 
her  in  the  control  and  working  of  the  organiza- 
tion. At  first  purely  artistic  and  disinterested; 
then  guided  by  a  general  consensus  of  opinion; 
finally,  dictated  by  her  own  individual  ideas— the 
wishes  of  this  indefatigable  lady  have  grown  to 
be  the  commands— nay,  the  absolute  law— of  the 
most  independent  opera-house  in  Europe. 

I  do  not  purpose  writing  the  ^ inside  history" 
of  this  matter.  Indeed,  it  would  scarcely  concern 
my  present  task  to  touch  upon  it  at  all,  save  for 
the  purpose  of  rendering  the  progress  of  events

clear  to  the  reader.  It  is  enough,  then,  to  say  that 
Lady  de  Grey  (whose  husband.  Earl  de  Grey,  had 
been  an  habitue  of  the  opera  for  many  years)  oc- 
cupied from  the  outset  a  position  of  extraordinary 
power  and  influence.  A  persona  grata  at  Marlbor- 
ough House,  the  intimate  personal  friend  of  Jean 
and  Edouard  de  Heszke,  the  recognized  leader  of 
the  subscribing  body,  it  would  have  been  strange 
indeed  had  this  tireless  supporter  of  the  enter- 
prise failed  to  become  one  of  the  most  potent  factors 
in  its  internal  economy. 

During  the  early  days  of  the  renaissance  much 
diplomacy  was  used  by  all  parties.  Mr.  Higgins 
would  convey  suggestions  to  Mr.  Harris,  who 
would  thereupon  have  a  chat  with  Lady  de  Grey 
and  promise  to  do  his  best  to  meet  her  wishes. 
Needless  to  add  that  they  seldom  passed  unheeded. 
As  time  went  on  the  modus  operandi  gradually  al- 
tered. When  Harris  became  overwhelmed  with 
his  various  duties  he  was  glad  to  rely  upon  Mr. 
Higgins  for  advice,  or  even  to  go  to  Lady  de  Grey 
^^for  instructions.''  A  new  prima  donna  had  to 
be  engaged,  a  new  opera  to  be  commissioned,  a 
Continental  success  to  be  mounted,  a  new  box- 
subscriber  to  be  passed  and  admitted.  Ere  any 
of  these  things  could  be  done  it  was  essential  that 
Lady  de  Grey  should  be  consulted.  So  by  degrees 
her  word  became  law;  and  law  it  remains  to  this 
day.  With  the  artists  at  Covent  Garden  Lady  de 
Grey  is  very  popular.  With  those  who  fail  to  ob- 
tain engagements   she  is  naturally  the  reverse;

and  I  dare  say  she  is  often  blamed  for  refusals 
for  which  she  is  not  primarily  responsible. 

Personally  I  have  always  found  her  the  amiable 
lady  that  the  world  supposes  her  to  be,  despite 
the  knowledge  that  a  hand  of  iron  is  hidden  be- 
neath the  velvet  glove.  And  she  certainly  has  a 
devoted  second  in  the  present  managing  director 
of  the  Royal  Opera  Syndicate.  The  chairman, 
Earl  de  Grey,  naturally  represents  his  wife's 
views.  The  secretary,  Mr.  Neil  Forsyth,  has  a 
well-earned  reputation  for  urbanity,  energy,  and 
tact.  On  the  whole,  the  machine  works  smoothly, 
and  from  a  practical  view-point  nothing  can  be 
urged  against  a  concern  that  pays  its  shareholders 
a  regular  and  substantial  dividend.  At  the  same 
time  much  might  be  said  regarding  the  artistic 
demerits  of  a  system  that  depends  so  largely  upon 
individual  fancy,  impulse,  and  even  caprice.  The 
best  results  cannot  possibly  be  obtained  where  the 
personal  equation  is  allowed  to  take  precedence 
of  loftier  considerations.  The  most  we  can  hope 
is  that  an  improved  standard  of  public  taste  will 
compel  the  observance  of  those  higher  traditions 
which  lend  prestige  to  the  leading  subsidized 
opera-houses,  and  which  Augustus  Harris  adopted 
and  handed  down  to  his  successors  in  a  much  more 
flourishing  and  unsullied  condition  than  the  latter 
probably  have  ever  realized. 

The  ppera  season  of  1889  demands  further  atten- 
tion for  at  least  two  productions  out  of  the  three 
Vv^hich  it  yielded.     It  opened,  at  Covent  Garden, 


270 


Musical  Life  in  London 

with  Bizet's  ^^Pecheurs  de  Perles, '' given  in  Italian 
with  Ella  Russell,  Talazac,  and  D'Andrade  in  the 
cast;  but  the  work  signally  failed  to  please.  In 
June  the  de  Reszkes  returned,  with  Melba  and  Las- 
salle,  and  on  the  fifteenth  a  French  performance 
of  ^^ Romeo  et  Juliette''  shed  lustre  for  the  first 
time  upon  the  annals  of  a  London  opera-house. 
The  full  cast  was  as  follows:  Romeo,  M.  Jean  de 
Reszke;  Frere  Laurent,  M.  Edouard  de  Reszke; 
Tybalt,  M.  Montariol;  Mercutio,  M.  Winogradow; 
Capulet,  M.  Seguin ;  Due,  M.  Castelmary ;  Stefano, 
Mile.  Jane  de  Vigne;  Gertrude,  Mme.  Lablache; 
and  Juliette,  Mme.  Melba ;  Signor  Mancinelli,  con- 
ductor. The  chorus  sang  in  French,  and  the 
mounting  of  the  opera  was  almost  entirely  new. 
^  ^  Romeo ' '  attracted  crowded  audiences  throughout 
the  season.  I  may  mention  that  the  role  of  Juliette 
was  subsequently  filled  with  no  less  success  by 
Mme.  Emma  Fames,  who,  by  the  way,  had  studied 
it  under  Gounod  when  she  succeeded  Mme.  Patti  in 
the  part  at  the  Paris  Opera. 

Meanwhile  preparations  were  in  active  progress 
for  the  eagerly  awaited  representation  of  "Die 
Meistersinger. ' '  These  were  so  far  advanced  that 
it  took  Mancinelli  less  than  a  month  to  get  his  ma- 
terial into  highly  creditable  shape.  To  attain  per- 
fection another  month  was,  of  course,  needed ;  but 
when,  I  should  like  to  know,  during  or  since  the 
Harris  era,  did  a  difficult  and  unfamiliar  opera 
ever  receive  at  Covent  Garden  an  adequate 
allowance   of   time   for   thorough   rehearsal?     A

month  for  a  big  Wagner  work  was  considered  am- 
ple, and,  truth  to  tell,  the  results  accomplished  in 
that  absurdly  small  space  of  time  gave  such  remark- 
able satisfaction  that  no  struggle  was  made  to  ob- 
tain a  more  liberal  concession.  London  was  now 
learning  the  lesson  of  lightning  opera  production 
which  New  York  was  to  imitate  later  on— as,  for 
example,  in  the  recent  instance  of  Paderewski's 
' '  Manru. ' ' 

Both  Jean  de  Reszke  and  Lassalle  had  been 
working  hard  at  their  parts  all  through  the  winter 
and  spring.  Toward  the  end  they  received  valua- 
ble assistance  in  their  studies  from  the  veteran 
maestro  al  piano,  Herr  Saar,  a  well-known  figure 
at  Covent  Garden  for  upward  of  a  quarter  of  a 
century.  This  excellent  musician— a  genuine  type 
of  the  old  German  school— was  the  conductor  at 
Strasburg,  and  familiar  with  every  note  of  Wag- 
ner's scores.  He  shared  my  intense  enthusiasm 
on  the  subject  of  Jean  de  Reszke 's  ^^predestina- 
tion'' for  the  great  Wagner  roles,  and  his  joy  over 
the  approaching  advent  of  the  new  Walther  von 
Stolzing  knew  no  bounds.  I  was  often  present 
when  he  came  round  to  the  Continental  to  do  a 
morning's  work  with  the  great  tenor.  His  good- 
humored  face  would  be  wreathed  in  smiles  as  he 
sat  down  to  the  piano;  and  when  Jean  sang  the 
''Probelieder"  or  the  ''Preislied,"  with  a  charm 
that  gave  them  a  new  meaning,  the  old  accom- 
panist would  gaze  heavenward  through  his  spec- 
tacles with  a  look  of  ecstasv  that  was  far  more

eloquent  than  words.  He  objected  to  the  cuts ;  he 
cordially  disliked  the  Italian  text;  but  he  was 
aware  that  both  were  indispensable,  and  he  had 
the  satisfaction  of  knowing  that  we  all  agreed  with 
him. 

For,  notwithstanding  the  poetic  merit  and  rhyth- 
mical vigor  of  Mazzucato's  adaptation,  Jean  de 
Eeszke  was  even  now  beginning  to  rebel  against 
the  open  vowels  and  soft  consonants  of  the  Italian 
tongue  as  a  medium  for  the  utterance  of  the  crisp, 
rugged  verse,  the  expressive  Teutonic  sounds,  the 
biting  sibilants  and  gutturals  of  Wagner's  origi- 
nal text.  He  felt  that  his  declamation  was  even 
losing  force  in  the  very  act  of  giving  it  birth— that 
it  had  not  yet  acquired  the  intense  dramatic 
quality  which  had  so  appealed  to  him  in  the  enun- 
ciation of  the  Bayreuth  singers.  All  this  was  to 
be  acquired  in  good  time,  though  we  little  imag- 
ined then  that  the  fulfilment  was  to  be  so  com- 
plete ;  for  as  yet  the  Polish  tenor  had  not  declared 
to  a  soul  (and  probably  had  not  yet  conceived  the 
idea)  that  he  would  ever  sing  an  opera  in  the  Ger- 
man language.  And  for  the  moment  musical  Lon- 
don was  content  to  be  radiantly  happy  over  Jean 
de  Eeszke 's  first  appearance  on  any  stage  (July  13, 
1889)  as  the  hero  of  Wagner's  *^Die  Meister- 
singer."  It  was  a  great  occasion,  and  the  public 
recognized  it  as  such  by  crowding  the  house  in 
every  part.  Earely  have  I  known  Covent  Garden 
to  be  pervaded  so  completely  by  an  atmosphere 
of  excitement  and  curiosity.    Only  five  years  pre-

vious  the  same  opera  had  been  given  there  in  Ger- 
man before  a  comparatively  lukewarm  assem- 
blage of  Wagner  partizans.  Now  every  section  of 
the  operatic  community,  united  in  love  and  ad- 
miration for  a  great  artist  as  well  as  for  a  great 
composer,  was  fully  represented.  That  the  stick- 
lers for  the  exact  letter  grumbled  at  Mancinelli's 
prodigious  cuts  may  go  without  saying;  but  that 
could  not  be  helped,  and,  indeed,  their  complaints 
were  almost  unheard  amid  the  general  chorus  of 
gratification  and  pleasure. 

The  reader  will  forgive  me  if  I  say  that  on  that 
memorable  night  I  felt,  deep  in  my  heart,  a  sen- 
sation of  joyful  but  modest  pride  at  the  thought 
that  I  had  been  in  some  measure  instrumental  in 
bringing  about  that  felicitous  achievement.  I  shall 
be  ever  grateful  for  the  words  of  thanks  with 
which  Jean  de  Reszke  and  Lassalle  responded  to 
my  congratulations  when  I  went  on  the  stage  to 
see  them  after  the  first  act.  Both  seemed  to  be  in 
the  seventh  heaven.  Edouard,  the  future  Rans 
Sachs  J  was  present ;  and  to  the  lips  of  us  all  there 
came  more  than  once  the  word  ^'Ems!"  The 
Bayreuth  experiment  had  turned  out  a  brilliant 
success. 

Looking  back  with  calm  reflection  upon  the  Hans 
Sachs  of  Lassalle,  I  must  admit  that  his  delineation 
of  the  poet-cobbler  was  too  refined,  too  delicate, 
too  '^gentlemanly''  to  be  altogether  correct.  Yet 
his  noble  voice  and  artistic  phrasing  imparted  an 
added  beauty  to  his  music,  and  the  benevolent,

kindly  spirit  of  the  character  has  never  been  more 
delightfully  portrayed.  The  very  attributes  of  re- 
finement and  distinction  that  were  out  of  place  in 
Hans  Sachs  enabled  Jean  de  Reszke  to  realize  in 
ideal  fashion  the  attractive  personality  of  the 
Franconian  knight,  especially  in  the  half-timid, 
half -angry  moments  when  he  rebels  against  the 
dull  bigotry  of  the  Nuremberg  mastersingers. 
The  entire  embodiment  presented  features  of  origi- 
nality that  surprised  by  their  freshness  no  less 
than  by  their  truthful  adherence  to  the  Wagnerian 
conception;  and,  as  with  his  Lohengrin,  so  with 
his  Walther,  the  vocal  rendering  of  the  part  con- 
stituted a  veritable  revelation.  The  final  render- 
ing of  the  ^ '  Preislied ' '  on  that  hot  July  night  was 
something  that  never  before  had  been  approached, 
and  has  not  since  been  surpassed.^ 

One  of  the  events  of  this  season  was  a  gala  per- 
formance at  the  Opera  in  honor  of  the  Shah  of 
Persia.  Such  celebrations  subsequently  became  of 
frequent  occurrence,  but  this  was  noteworthy  as 
the  first  that  had  taken  place  at  Covent  Garden 
since  the  visit  of  the  Emperor  and  Empress  of  the 
French  many  years  before.    The  Queen,  of  course,

did  not  attend,  being,  as  usual,  represented  by  the 
Prince  of  Wales.  But  more  than  a  quarter  of  a 
century  had  now  elapsed  since  the  death  of  the 
Prince  Consort,  and  there  was  growing  evidence 
of  Her  Majesty's  willingness  to  emerge  somewhat 
from  her  retirement  and  to  indulge  more  freely  in 
the  enjoyment  of  an  art  to  which  she  was  always 
conspicuously  devoted.  Welcome  proof  of  this  had 
been  forthcoming  in  the  previous  May,  when 
Queen  Victoria  went  to  the  Royal  Albert  Hall  to 
hear  a  performance  of  ^ '  The  Golden  Legend ' '  con- 
ducted bv  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan.  The  idea  now  re- 
ceived  further  confirmation  from  the  fact  that 
Her  Majesty  began  to  take  a  renewed  interest  in 
the  Opera;  and,  thanks  to  the  glowing  reports  of 
various  members  of  the  royal  family,  her  curi- 
osity regarding  the  new  Polish  singers  was  roused 
to  the  highest  pitch.  This  at  last  found  expression 
in  a  ^^ command''  that,  together  with  Mme.  Al- 
bani,  they  should  appear  before  Her  Majesty  at 
Windsor  Castle. 

I  cannot  do  better  than  quote  at  length  a  note 
wherein  M.  Jean  de  Reszke  gave  me  a  full  descrip- 
tion of  this,  his  first  visit  to  Windsor.    He  says : 

[Translated  from  the  French.] 

My  dear  Friend  : 

The  concert  began  with  the  air  from  *'L'Etoile  du 
Nord,"  which  Edouard  sang  wonderfully.  Then  Mme. 
Albani  and  I  sang  the  duet  from  ''Lohengrin,"  after 
which  the  Queen  expressed  a  desire  to  hear  me  in  ' '  Salve 


278 


Musical  Life  in  London 


dimora"  from  ''Faust."  This  I  gave,  and  she  appeared 
delighted.  Next  Mme.  Albani  sang  an  air  by  Handel, 
with  the  accompaniment  for  flute  obbligato — I  think 
''Sweet  Bird"  was  the  title,  but  you  will  know  better 
than  I  the  particular  piece  in  question;  and  she  sang 
it  like  a  true  virtuose.  I  accompanied  Edouard  in 
Denza's  romance  "A  un  portrait,"  with  which  the  Queen 
was  much  pleased;  then  Edouard  and  I  thundered  out 
the  unaccompanied  duet  from  "Carmen,"  arranged  by 
ourselves— great  success!^  At  Her  Majesty's  request, 
the  concert  ended  with  the  duet  from  the  "Traviata, " 
sung  by  Mme.  Albani  and  myself.  The  Queen,  smiling 
and  full  of  kindness,  approached  us  and  paid  us  many 
compliments.  Among  them  she  told  me  that  I  reminded 
her  of  Mario,  only  that  my  voice  had  more  power.  She 
refused  to  believe  that  I  was  the  elder  brother,  and  this 
discussion,  in  which  Mme.  Albani  was  called  upon  to 
arbitrate,  greatly  amused  the  Queen.  Then,  after  the 
customary  courtesies,  the  Queen  retired.  I  found  her 
extremely  well,  charming  in  manner,  speaking  French 
like  a  Parisian,  and  a  genuine  lover  of  music — as  one 
could  easily  see  by  her  eyes  and  in  the  movements  of  the 
head  with  which  she  emphasized  the  chief  passages.  In 
a  word,  this  musical  pilgrimage  was  anything  but  the 
solemn  function  which  we  at  first  feared  it  might  be. 
Thanks  to  the  amiability  of  the  sovereign,  there  was  not 
a  vestige  of  fog  at  Windsor!  Mancinelli  accompanied. 
A  thousand  greetings. 

Jean  de  Reszke. 


^  The  ' '  Carmen ' '  duet  referred  to  in  the  above  is  a  clever  ar- 
rangement by  the  brothers,  for  two  voices  in  ''thirds"  and 
"sixths,"  of  the  refrain  ''Dragon  d'Alcala, "  sung  by  Don  Jose 
just  before  his  entry  into  the  tavern  of  Lillas  Pastia  in  the 
second  act.

The  summer  of  1889  did  not  pass  entirely  with- 
out operatic  rivalry.  A  feeble  effort  and  an  ex- 
piring one  was  that  made  at  Her  Majesty's  by 
Mapleson  in  June,  with  Bevignani  as  conductor. 
The  company,  with  two  or  three  exceptions,  was 
mediocre  in  the  extreme,  and  the  only  debutante 
worth  mentioning  was  the  contralto,  Signorina 
Bellincioni,  younger  sister  of  the  soprano,  who  also, 
later  on,  created  the  role  of  Santuzza  in  ^'Caval- 
leria  Rusticana.''  This  season  lasted  exactly 
twenty-five  days.  A  more  interesting  and  more 
fortunate  speculation  was  the  series  of  representa- 
tions of  Verdi's  ^'Otello"  given  at  the  Lyceum 
Theatre  in  July,  under  the  direction  of  Mr.  M. 
L.  Mayer,  with  a  complete  Milanese  troupe— 
principals,  chorus,  orchestra,  and  even  mise  en 
5ce^e— expressly  brought  over  from  La  Scala, 
where  the  opera  was  first  produced  in  February, 
1887.  Tamagno  and  Maurel  sustained  their  origi- 
nal parts,  and  for  the  former  it  was  his  London 
debut.  The  performance,  exceedingly  fine  on  the 
whole,  was  admirably  directed  by  Faccio,  the  fa- 
mous chef-d'orcJiestre  of  La  Scala,  who  died  a 
year  or  two  later. 

It  was  in  this  same  season  that  Eugene  Ysaye 
made  his  first  appearance  in  London,  playing  the 
Beethoven  concerto  at  the  Philharmonic  with  such 
brilliant  success  that  he  was  at  once  reengaged  for 
the  next  concert.  Under  the  auspices  of  the  same 
society,  a  successful  debut  was  made  also  by  the 
young   Russian   pianist   Loris    Sapellnikoff,   who

played  Tschaikowsky 's  pianoforte  concerto  in 
B  flat  minor,  the  composer  conducting.  Largely 
through  the  influence  of  Joseph  Barnby,  the  quick 
development  of  the  modern  Flemish  school  found 
recognition  in  the  production  by  the  Koyal  Choral 
Society  of  Peter  Benoit's  oratorio  ^ ^Lucifer.'' 
It  created  the  impression,  however,  of  a  more  or 
less  disconnected  series  of  tone-pictures,  original 
in  treatment,  but  lacking  in  spontaneous  inspira- 
tion.

IT^ARLY  in  the  winter  of  1889-90  a  powerful 
^  opera  troupe  was  formed  by  Mr.  Henry  Ab- 
bey to  undertake  a  tour  in  the  United  States,  and 
just  before  the  new  year  it  opened  at  Chicago  with 
immense  eclat.  Among  the  leading  artists  were 
Adelina  Patti,  Emma  Albani,  Lillian  Nordica,  and 
Tamagno.  Then  for  the  first  time  did  American 
opera-lovers  hear  the  diva  as  Juliette,  Albani  as 
Valentina  and  Desdemona,  Nordica  as  Aida,  and 
Tamagno  as  Otello.  Each  in  turn  achieved  suc- 
cess; but  the  chief  triumph  of  the  tour  fell  easily 
to  Mme.  Patti,  who  appeared  always  to  overflow- 
ing houses,  and  received  from  the  critics,  espe- 
cially in  California,  their  loudest  paeans  of  praise. 
Taken  for  all  in  all,  this  enterprise  was  notewor- 
thy because  it  opened  the  eyes  of  American  mana- 
gers to  the  possibility  of  working  independently 
of  the  European  impresario.  It  showed  them 
where  to  look  for  the  lodestones  best  calculated  to 
attract  their  own  public ;  and  thus  it  led  to  the  es- 

284 


Musical  Life  in  London 


tablishment  of  the  prevailing  system,  which,  for 
a  decade  at  least,  I  have  described  elsewhere  by 
saying  that  ''what  Covent  Garden  does  this  year. 
New  York  does  next.''  I  need  scarcely  add  that 
this  aphorism  has  no  application  whatever  to  Ger- 
man opera,  since  the  latter  was  "running  alone'' 
in  New  York  while  in  London  it  was  not  out  of 
swaddling-clothes.  In  1890,  however,  the  two 
branches  in  both  cities  were  still  separate  and 
distinct.  The  time  was  yet  to  come  when  the  three 
great  schools  of  opera  should  be  exploited  by  a 
single  company  of  artists  upon  one  and  the  same 
stage. 

Gladly  would  I  have  written  ''four"  instead  of 
' '  three. ' '  But,  alas,  the  development  of  the  young 
English  school  was  again  progressing  at  too  slow 
a  rate  for  it  to  keep  pace  with  its  older  and  more 
powerful  sisters.  Not  that  Augustus  Harris  left  a 
stone  unturned  to  direct  to  a  successful  issue  the 
policy  and  the  task  bequeathed  him  by  Carl  Rosa. 
He  signalized  the  very  first  year  after  his  old  part- 
ner's death  by  arranging  for  the  company  to  re- 
new its  Easter  visit  to  Drury  Lane.  Rosa  had 
commissioned  Frederic  Cowen  after  his  return 
from  Australia  to  write  an  opera  expressly  for 
him.^  The  libretto  was  supplied  by  Mr.  Joseph 
Bennett,  who,  knowing  the  composer's  fondness 
for  Scandinavian  color,  founded  his  plot  upon  an 

^  Mr.  Cowen  had  conducted  the  whole  of  the  orchestral  per- 
formances given  in  connection  with  the  Melbourne  Centennial 
Exhibition  of  1888.

episode  in  the  ancient  Icelandic  tale  of  '^Viglund 
the  Fair."  Cowen's  ^^Thorgrim"  was  duly  pro- 
duced at  Drury  Lane  on  April  22,— some  thirteen 
and  a  half  years  after  Carl  Rosa  had  brought  out 
his  *' Pauline"  at  the  Lyceum,— with  Zelie  de  Lus- 
san,  Barton  McGuckin,  and  Frank  Celli  in  the 
principal  parts.  The  Prince  of  Wales,  to  whom 
the  work  was  dedicated,  attended  the  first  perform- 
ance with  the  Duke  and  Duchess  of  Edinburgh; 
and  the  composer  conducted  an  admirable  render- 
ing of  his  opera.  Yet,  despite  a  cordial  reception, 
^'Thorgrim"  failed  quite  to  hit  the  mark,  and 
the  effect  of  its  many  beauties  was  lost  because 
of  a  story  too  unattractive  and  too  undramatic 
to  appeal  to  the  popular  taste.  In  the  course  of 
this  season,  Gounod's  ^* Romeo  et  Juliette"  was 
given  for  the  first  time  in  English. 

To  be  quite  candid,  as  every  ^'faithful  chroni- 
cler" should  be,  it  is  necessary  to  record  that  such 
hold  as  opera  in  the  vernacular  had  taken  upon  the 
metropolitan  public  was  now  beginning  to  relax. 
The  attention  of  the  main  body  of  opera-goers  was 
directed  almost  exclusively  toward  Covent  Garden. 
And  there,  during  the  season  approaching,  we 
were  to  witness  a  demand  for  opera  in  French  that 
amounted  almost  to  a  craze.  The  *  ^  Romeo ' '  exper- 
iment was  bearing  fruit  with  a  vengeance.  As  far 
as  the  requisite  time  for  preparation  would  permit, 
no  opera  composed  to  a  French  text  was  hence- 
forth to  be  sung  in  any  but  the  French  language. 
Curiously  enough, ''Faust"  and  ''Les  Huguenots" 
were  still  for  a  brief  spell  to  be  given  in  their  Ital- 

286

ian  dress;  but  ^'Le  Prophete/'  ^'La  Favorita/' 
^* Hamlet,"* ^Carmen,"  and  even  Goring  Thomas's 
**  Esmeralda '^  were  all  to  be  done  in  French  for 
the  first  time.  That  this  was  a  step  in  the  right 
direction  there  can  be  no  question.  It  was  artistic 
in  the  abstract,  and  furthermore  it  greatly  pleased 
the  largest  array  of  subscribers  known  since  the 
** palmy  days''  of  Covent  Garden.  The  subscrip- 
tion for  the  opera  season  of  1890  amounted  in  the 
aggregate  to  nearly  forty  thousand  pounds  ($200,- 
000),  and  this  for  only  ten  weeks  of  ^ve  nights  each. 
Artists'  salaries  were  rising  too;  but  for  all  that, 
Augustus  Harris  was  finding  that  the  *' Royal 
Italian  Opera,"  conducted  on  liberal  principles, 
was  commencing  to  pay  extremely  well. 

Of  the  new  French  repertoire  only  two  works 
required  special  study  on  the  part  of  the  Paris 
singers— namely,  ** Carmen"  and  *' Esmeralda. " 
Jean  de  Reszke  was  pretty  forward  with  the  role 
of  Captain  Phoebus;  but  Lassalle  was  equally 
backward  with  those  of  Escamillo  and  Claude 
FrollOj  having  had  little  time  to  devote  to  the 
study  of  new  operas  for  London.  As  a  matter  of 
fact,  he  had  only  created  the  title  part  in  Saint- 
Saens's  '^Ascanio"  at  the  Opera  on  the  21st  of 
March,  and  two  days  later  he  wrote  me  as  follows : 


[Translated  from  the  French.] 

Paris,  March  23,  1890. 
My  dear  Friend  : 

What  a  pity  you  could  not  come  to  the  premiere  of 
"Ascanio !"    You  would,  I  am  sure,  have  been  delighted 


287 


Thirty  Years  of 


with  this  music.  It  is  a  very  remarkable  work,  no  matter 
what  the  Parisian  press  may  say  of  it.  I  am  much  afraid 
that  it  (the  press)  will  deceive  itself  concerning  this 
work,  just  as  it  made  a  mistake  about  '' Carmen"  and 
so  many  other  compositions  that  constitute  the  glory  of 
the  French  school.  Personally,  I  have  had  a  very,  very 
great  success,  whereof,  as  you  may  guess,  no  one  could 
be  happier;  but  it  does  not  blind  me  to  the  point  of  not 
attributing  it  primarily  to  the  musical  value  of  Saint- 
Saens's  wonderful  work.  The  honor  of  being  the  chosen 
interpreter  of  such  a  master  is  great.  I  am  happy  and 
proud  of  it.  Jean  and  Edouard  beg  me  to  convey  to 
you  their  best  regards.  I  unite  with  them  in  adding  my 
most  sincere  greetings.

The  result  was  that  neither  ^^ Carmen''  nor  *^ Es- 
meralda'' appeared  in  its  Gallic  guise  until  late  in 
July.  Indeed,  ^  ^  Carmen ' '  was  given  only  for  Har- 
ris's  ^^ benefit"  on  the  very  last  night  of  the  season, 
when  the  demand  for  seats  was  so  enormous  that 
stalls  sold  for  £4  ($20)  apiece,  and  many  hun- 
dreds of  people  were  turned  away  from  the  doors. 
The  only  disappointment  was  Melba's  non-ap- 
appearance  as  Michaela,  but  this  was  almost 
forgotten  amid  the  triumphs  of  Jean  de  Reszke 
and  Lassalle,  whose  admirable  impersonations 
were  well  matched  by  the  fascinating  Carmen  of 
Zelie  de  Lussan.  Being  a  kind  of  gala  night,  Au- 
gustus Harris  imagined  it  would  be  interesting  to 
have  each  of  his  three  conductors  engaged  upon 
the  one  opera.     Accordingly  Mancinelli  directed 

288 


Musical  Life  in  London 


the  first  act,  Bevignani  the  second,  Randegger  the 
third,  and  Mancinelli  again  the  fourth.  The  effect 
upon  the  ensemble  of  the  performance  was  sim- 
ply disastrous,  and,  needless  to  add,  the  childish 
experiment  was  never  tried  again. 

The  Don  Jose  of  Jean  de  Reszke  has  been  vari- 
ously criticized.  I  hold  the  opinion,  however,  not 
only  that  it  was,  and  still  is,  a  superb  embodiment, 
but  that  it  did  a  great  deal  to  restore  to  the  char- 
acter the  musical  and  histrionic  value  which  it  had 
gradually  been  losing  in  inverse  ratio  to  the  ever- 
growing prominence  of  the  central  figure  of  the 
opera.  For  this  reason  I  quote  some  lines  that  I 
penned  anent  M.  de  Reszke's  impersonation  at  the 
time : 

He  showed  us  that  it  was  as  easy  for  one  great  artist 
to  revive  the  importance  and  enhance  the  interest  of  a 
good  role  as  for  twenty  mediocrities  to  drag  it  down  to 
the  level  of  their  own  talent.  It  goes  without  saying 
that  the  Polish  tenor  copied  nobody's  Don  Jose  in  par- 
ticular. He  knew  the  traditions  of  the  character,  just 
as  he  learned  those  of  Sir  Walter  von  Stolzing  by  visit- 
ing Bayreuth.  He  read  his  Merimee  and  carefully  studied 
his  libretto;  but  like  an  artist  of  individuality  and  re- 
source, he  also  thought  the  part  out  for  himself.  The 
result,  curiously  enough,  was  a  conception  more  closely 
resembling  Campanini's  than  any  we  have  seen  since. 
It  was  free  from  the  melodramatic  exaggeration  into 
which  other  tenors  had  fallen.  Take,  as  an  instance,  the 
last  act.  M.  de  Reszke  did  not  make  himself  up  like  a 
starved  ghost,  neither  did  he  rush  about  like  a  savage

animal  in  a  cage.  He  looked  the  picture  of  despair,  and 
he  made  his  piteous  appeal  to  Carmen  with  the  tone  of 
a  man  who  is  yearning  for  love,  not  for  an  excuse  to 
commit  murder.  When  at  last  driven  to  extremities,  he 
did  not  gloat  over  his  revenge  nor  chase  his  victim  from 
corner  to  corner  as  a  cat  might  chase  a  mouse.  He 
simply  stood  at  the  entrance  to  the  bull-ring,  and  when 
Carmen  made  her  attempt  to  escape,  he  seized  his  dag- 
ger as  by  a  sudden  impulse  and  stabbed  her  as  she  was 
endeavoring  to  pass  him.  An  instant  later  he  was  lean- 
ing over  her  lifeless  body  in  tears,  horror-stricken  at  the 
deed  he  had  committed.  This  surely  was  the  true  read- 
ing of  the  episode.  Nor  was  it  the  only  scene  upon  which 
M.  Jean  de  Reszke,  with  rare  artistic  insight,  contrived 
to  throw  a  new  and  consistent  light.  He  depicted  with 
wonderful  subtlety  and  skill  the  gradual  stages  by  which 
Don  Jose  is  drawn  under  Carmen's  fascinating  influ- 
ence. Fierce  and  absorbing  passion  revealed  itself  in 
his  facial  expression,  his  gestures,  and,  above  all,  the 
thrilling  tones  of  his  voice.  Never  before  has  the  beauti- 
ful passage  where  Jose  brings  forth  the  flower  that  Car- 
men gave  him  and  tells  her  how  it  cheered  his  lonely 
prison  hours,  been  invested  with  such  charm  of  voice  and 
such  tenderness  and  warmth  of  delivery. 

Jean  de  Reszke  did  no  less  to  elevate  and  enrich 
by  his  transcendent  art  the  part  of  Phcehus  in  Gor- 
ing Thomas's  ^'Esmeralda.''  .  So  did  Lassalle 
that  of  the  priest  Frollo,  and  so,  in  a  vocal  sense  at 
least,  did  Melba  that  of  the  heroine.  These  artists 
evinced  a  genuine  interest  in  the  opera,  for  they 
had  taken  an  immense  personal  liking  to  the  com- 
poser, and  openly  expressed  their  admiration  for

the  talent  and  modesty  of  ''ce  clier  Goringne.'^ 
But  in  another  direction  unfortunate  influences 
were  at  work.  Notwithstanding  its  French  origin 
and  treatment,  ^' Esmeralda^'  was  in  all  essential 
matters  an  English  opera,  and  as  such  the  public 
knew  and  remembered  it.  Clothed  in  a  foreign 
garb,  it  did  not  really  appeal  to  connoisseurs,  while 
the  subscribers,  as  usual,  gave  infinitely  more 
thought  to  the  interpreters  than  to  the  work.  That 
Goring  Thomas's  charming  opera  would  have 
fared  better— obtained  an  abiding-place  in  the  ac- 
tive repertory— had  it  been  presented  in  English  by 
the  same  distinguished  artists,  is  also  a  matter  of 
doubt.  Experience  has  proved  that  Covent  Gar- 
den audiences  do  not  care  for  opera  in  the  ver- 
nacular, whether  the  work  be  of  native  or  Conti- 
nental origin;  and  it  is  the  same,  I  believe,  with 
the  audiences  of  the  Metropolitan  Opera  House  in 
New  York.  Nor  will  the  prejudice  be  overcome 
until  the  leading  singers  of  the  English-speak- 
ing countries  are  perfectly  trained  in  the  enun- 
ciation of  their  native  tongue  and  can  coax 
their  compatriots  into  listening  with  pleasur- 
able appreciation  to  first-rate  native  works  ren- 
dered in  the  language  ^  ^  understanded  of  the 
people. ' ' 

In  1890  all  sorts  of  rumors  were  in  the  air  con- 
cerning the  future  of  Covent  Garden  Theatre. 
There  was  a  heavy  mortgage  on  the  property,  and 
the  owner,  Mr.  A.  Montague,  was  so  uncertain 
what  he  would  do  with  it  that  he  would  consent 


2gi 


Thirty  Years  of 


to  let  the  opera-house  only  for  a  few  weeks  at 
a  time.  Augustus  Harris,  who  that  year  added  to 
his  other  trifling  labors  by  accepting  the  hon- 
orable duties  of  Sheriff  of  London/  would  gladly 
have  taken  a  sub-lease  of  the  theatre  for  a  length- 
ened period,  if  only  for  the  sake  of  being  able  to 
effect  the  many  costly  structural  alterations  and 
decorative  improvements  of  which  the  place  stood 
so  badly  in  need.  But  Mr.  Montague  was  in  too 
vacillating  a  mood,  and  he  would  agree  to  nothing 
definite.  Such  was  the  position  of  affairs  when 
our  old  friend  Signor  Lago  came  forward  and 
offered  to  take  Covent  Garden  for  a  six  weeks'  au- 
tumn season  of  Italian  opera  at  cheap  prices,  dat- 
ing from  October  18.    The  offer  was  accepted. 

This  autumn  enterprise  was  noteworthy  for  two 
or  three  things;  chiefly  for  the  revival  of  Gluck's 
*^Orfeo,''  wherein  the  sisters  Sofia  and  Giulia 
Ravogli  made  their  debuts,  and  the  contralto,  by 
her  nobly  picturesque  assumption  of  Orfeo,  cre- 
ated a  very  striking  and  powerful  impression. 
Further,  Albani  and  Maurel  resumed  together  the 
parts  of  Elizabeth  and  Wolfram  which  they  had 
played  in  the  production  of  ^'Tannhauser"  at  this 
house  in  1876.  Last,  but  not  least,  Lago  established 
his  claim,  under  the  clauses  of  the  Berne  Conven- 
tion, to  perform  certain  operas,  such  as  ^^ Faust'' 

^  He  was  a  liveryman  (by  purchase)  of  the  City  of  London 
and  Prime  Warden  of  the  Loriners'  Company.  He  was  the  first 
theatrical  manager  upon  whom  the  coveted  shrieval  dignity  had 
ever  been  bestowed.

and  ^ '  Lohengrin, ' '  without  pa^Tnent  of  fees  to  other 
parties  who  declared  that  they  owned  the  remain- 
ing rights  in  those  books.  It  was  in  virtue  of  the 
^ interest"  vested  therein  by  prior  production  at 
Covent  Garden  that  Lago  obtained  that  victory, 
and  the  result  considerably  upset  the  calculations 
of  the  Carl  Rosa  Opera  Company  and  Augustus 
Harris,  who  had  paid  large  sums  for  surviving 
rights  in  certain  operas  that  now  proved  to  possess 
only  a  limited  value.  Harris,  in  reply  to  an  inquiry, 
had  written  me  a  note  to  say  that,  *  *  Except  '  Par- 
sifal, '  all  Wagner  rights  for  this  country  are  ours, 
in  all  languages.  No  piece  can  be  done  at  a  concert, 
even,  without  permission  from  yours  truly,  Augus- 
tus Harris." 

But  the  connection  between  the  two  undertakings 
was  soon  to  be  terminated.  The  new  sheriff  was 
fain  to  admit  that  even  his  Napoleonic  grasp  was 
not  equal  to  the  task  of  holding  and  directing  the 
strands  of  such  a  huge  coil  of  enterprises,  to  which, 
by  the  way,  he  had  recently  added  the  lesseeship 
of  a  theatre  at  Newcastle.  Toward  the  end  of  1890 
he  resigned  his  position  as  managing  director  of 
the  Carl  Rosa  Company,  and  the  splendid  edifice 
which  had  taken  fifteen  years  to  build  was  now, 
for  the  first  time,  without  an  actual  controlling 
head.  Its  fortunes,  I  am  sorry  to  say,  quickly  be- 
gan to  suffer.  The  concern  did  not  long  continue 
to  pay  a  dividend,  and  in  a  few  years  had  become, 
what  it  is  now,  a  mere  shadow  of  its  former  pros- 
perous self.

Thirty  Years  of 


The  early  summer  of  1890  was  to  witness  the 
debut  of  the  successor  to  Liszt  and  Rubinstein,  of 
the  greatest  of  the  fin  de  siecle  group  of  great 
pianists— Ignace  Jan  Paderewski.  This  event 
created  interest  at  the  time  among  a  very  limited 
circle.  It  was  anticipated  with  curiosity  only  by 
the  critics  and  dilettanti  who  follow  the  trend  of 
musical  events  in  Paris.  For  several  months  we 
had  been  receiving  vivid  accounts  of  a  young  Po- 
lish pianist,  ^^with  a  wonderful  aureole  of  golden 
hair,'^  who  executed  miracles  upon  the  keyboard, 
who  composed  delicious  minuets  and  played  Cho- 
pin to  absolute  perfection.  But  London  cares 
little,  as  a  rule,  for  what  Paris  thinks  of  new  ar- 
tists, and  it  displayed  anything  but  a  burning  im- 
patience to  hear  Leschetizky 's  latest  pupil.  This 
fact  was  sufficiently  demonstrated  by  the  meagre 
audience  which  gathered  at  St.  James 's  Hall  on  the 
9th  of  May  for  the  first  of  the  four  recitals  an- 
nounced by  the  composer  of  ^  ^  Paderewski 's  Min- 
uet.^' A  more  coldly  critical  assemblage  perhaps 
it  would  have  been  impossible  to  find.  Not  a 
soupQon  of  magnetic  current  was  in  the  atmos- 
phere—not even  the  quickened  pulse  arising  from 
the  anticipation  of  * ^ sensational  effects." 

When  M.  Paderewski  appeared  upon  the  plat- 
form there  was  a  mild  round  of  applause  accom- 
panied by  an  undercurrent  of  whispering  and  sup- 
pressed murmurs  that  had  evident  reference  to  his 
unwonted  picturesqueness  of  aspect.  The  deep 
golden  tinge  of  his  hair  seemed  to  accentuate  the 

296 


Musical  Life  in  London 


intense  pallor  of  his  countenance.  One  could 
plainly  see  that  he  was  nervous ;  but  in  those  deep, 
thoughtful  eyes,  in  those  firmly-set  lips,  in  that 
determined  chin,  one  could  read  also  the  strong, 
virile  qualities  of  the  self-contained,  self-reliant 
artist,  already  accustomed  to  conquer  audiences 
and  to  create  magnetism  in  the  most  sterile  space. 
Exactly  how  he  played  that  day— I  mean,  as  com- 
pared with  the  Paderewski  whose  every  mood  was 
by  and  by  to  become  familiar— it  is  rather  hard 
for  me  to  say.  That  he  strove  to  be  ^  ^  sensational ' ' 
I  do  not  believe  now,  though  at  the  time  it  was 
difficult  to  think  otherwise.  For  surely  his  con- 
trasts were  startling  in  their  violence,  and  the  in- 
strument fairly  thundered  under  his  execution  of 
a  forte  passage.  At  times  there  seemed  to  be  no 
restraint  whatever.  His  magnificent  technique 
enabled  him  to  give  free  rein  to  his  impulse  and 
imagination,  and  laissez  aller  was  then  the  word. 
If  you  loved  sensationalism  in  a  pianist,  here  un- 
questionably was  a  virtuoso  capable  of  providing 
an  unlimited  quantity  of  it. 

And  such  was  the  prevailing  impression  in  the 
minds  of  the  aforesaid  critics  and  dilettanti  when 
they  left  St.  James's  Hall  that  afternoon.  The 
former  dwelt  not  upon  the  tenderness  and  poetry 
that  Paderewski  had  revealed  in  his  Chopin-play- 
ing, nor  ujDon  the  romantic  touches  in  his  Schu- 
mann. They  described  as  ^^ eccentric"  his  reading 
of  Handel  and  Mendelssohn,  and  preferred  his  in- 
terpretation of  Liszt  and  Eubinstein.    They  liked 


297 


Thirty  Years  of 


best  of  all  his  rendering  of  his  own  **Trois 
Hnmoresques  a  Pantique/'  and  the  inevitable 
^^Menuet/'  which  had  been  enthusiastically  en- 
cored. Altogether  the  press  notices  were  marked 
by  coolness  and  extreme  caution.  For  my  own 
part,  I  confess  that  I  did  not  at  first  care  to  commit 
myself  to  a  definite  judgment.  Yet  I  had  found 
so  much  to  admire,  so  much  to  marvel  at,  so  much 
that  was  individual  and  supremely  masterful  in 
Paderewski's  playing  that  I  determined  not  to 
miss  a  single  recital  of  the  three  still  to  come. 
The  second  drew  a  better  audience,  though  nothing 
approaching  a  crowd ;  and  this  time  the  new  pian- 
ist included  Bach,  Beethoven,  and  Schubert  in  his 
scheme,  together  with  more  Chopin  and  Pade- 
rewski.  The  ^'barometer''  began  to  rise.  At  his 
third  recital  his  fine  performances  of  Beethoven's 
sonata  in  A  flat,  Op.  110,  and  Schumann's  *^ Car- 
nival" carried  the  mercury  from  ^^ change"  to 
^^fair";  but  there  it  remained,  stationary  for  the 
season.  In  addition  to  the  recitals  he  also  gave  an 
orchestral  concert,  at  which  he  played  his  own  con- 
certo in  A  minor,  Saint-Saens's  concerto  in  C 
minor,  and  Liszt's  ^'Fantaisie  Hongroise,"  the 
conductor  being  Mr.  Henschel;  and  if  it  failed  to 
arouse  wide-spread  interest,  this  parting  shot 
served  to  hit  the  mark  so  truly  that  I,  for  one,  no 
longer  hesitated  to  acknowledge  Paderewski  as  a 
really  great  artist. 

The  completion  of  the  conquest  was  deferred, 
however,  until  the  season  of  1891.    There  had  been 

298 


Musical  Life  in  London 


opportunities  in  the  meantime  for  reflection,  and 
the  public  was  now  beginning  to  scent  a  veritable 
musical  ^Mion.'^  I  used  to  receive  letters  from 
women  readers  asking  all  sorts  of  questions  about 
the  Polish  pianist  and  begging  for  particulars  that 
in  no  way  concerned  them.  These  of  course  went 
unanswered;  for  the  English  journalist  is  less 
generous  than  his  American  confrere  in  dispensing 
information  about  the  private  lives  of  artists. 
But  the  very  existence  of  such  curiosity  told  a 
tale.  There  would  be  no  more  **  meagre  audi- 
ences'' when  Paderewski  played.  As  a  matter  of 
fact,  his  Chopin  recital  at  St.  James 's  Hall  in  July 
drew  the  largest  crowd  and  the  highest  receipts 
recorded  since  the  final  visit  of  Rubinstein.  He 
also  appeared  at  the  Philharmonic,  at  a  Richter 
concert,  and  at  an  orchestral  concert  of  his  own, 
when  he  was  heard  in  the  greatest  two  of  all  piano- 
forte concertos:  the  E  flat  (''Emperor")  of  Bee- 
thoven and  the  A  minor  of  Schumann.  It  was  his 
superb  rendering  of  these  masterpieces  that,  in 
England  at  least,  assured  the  fame  of  the  gifted 
Pole ;  and  it  was  this  concert  that  led  indirectly  to 
my  making  his  acquaintance. 

I  had  been  requested  by  his  manager,  Mr.  Daniel 
Mayer,  to  undertake  the  writing  of  such  brief  ana- 
lytical notes  as  the  programme  required,  and,  in- 
stead of  following  conventional  lines  or  of  describ- 
ing these  familiar  works  in  detail,  I  contented  my- 
self with  a  more  or  less  detailed  contrast  of  the 
characteristic  features  of  the  two  concertos.    This 


299 


Thirty  Years  of 


appeared  to  have  pleased  and  interested  Pade- 
rewski;  and  when  I  was  introduced  to  him  after 
the  concert  he  said  some  charming  things  in  that 
charming  manner  which  is  so  characteristic  of  the 
man.  We  quickly  became  close  friends.  I  learned 
not  only  to  appreciate  the  real  magnitude  of  his 
gifts  as  a  creative  and  executive  musician,  but  also 
to  gauge  his  rare  intellectuality  and  to  respect  his 
broad-minded  views  as  cultured  artist  and  man  of 
the  world.  During  his  many  visits  to  London  we 
saw  a  great  deal  of  each  other,  and  more  than  once 
he  testified  to  his  kindly  regard  for  me. 

An  instance  of  this  occurred  in  1894.  It  was  ar- 
ranged that,  toward  the  end  of  his  English  tour, 
M.  Paderewski  should  dine  one  evening  at  my  flat 
in  Whitehall  Court  to  meet  a  few  well-known  mu- 
sicians ;  other  friends  were  invited  to  come  in  after- 
ward. The  date— May  3— was  fixed  by  the  artist 
himself,  and  the  guests  at  dinner  further  included 
Sir  Arthur  Sullivan,  Sir  Alexander  Mackenzie, 
Sir  Joseph  Barnby,  my  beloved  old  master,  Manuel 
Garcia,  and  the  veteran  'cellist,  Signor  Alfredo 
Piatti.  I  was  especially  gratified  to  be  the  means 
of  bringing  Paderewski  and  Sullivan  together. 
They  were  acquainted,  I  fancy,  but  had  not  met 
frequently ;  at  any  rate,  the  former  wrote  me : 

Inutite  de  vous  dire  que  je  serai  absolument  enchante 
de  passer  une  soiree  chez  vous,  avec  vous,  et  de  recon- 
trer  Sir  Sullivan  [sic],  que  j 'admire  beaucoup.

Just  before  dinner  a  quaint  sort  of  letter  was 
placed  in  my  hands.  It  was  from  some  one  in  the 
famous  pianist's  entourage,  reminding  me  that 
M.  Paderewski  was  very  fatigued  after  his  heavy 
work  in  the  provinces,  and  begging  that  I  would 
under  no  circumstances  ask  him  to  play  that  even- 
ing. I  was  half  amused,  half  annoyed  by  this  un- 
expected communication,  which,  of  course,  I  knew 
better  than  to  regard  as  inspired  by  my  guest  of 
honor  himself.  It  was  also  entirely  superfluous,  as 
I  always  made  it  a  strict  rule  never  to  request  an 
artist  to  perform  in  my  house  who  did  not  come 
there  for  that  purpose  or  with  that  expressed  in- 
tention. However,  I  thought  no  more  about  it  until 
after  dinner,  when  I  took  an  opportunity  to  inform 
Paderewski,  in  a  whispered  ^ '  aside, ' '  of  the  strange 
warning  I  had  received.  I  assured  him  seriously 
that  I  had  not  had  the  slightest  idea  of  asking  him 
to  play,  and  that  my  friends  were  more  than  satis- 
fied to  have  the  pleasure  of  meeting  him  and  enjoy- 
ing his  society.    He  replied : 

^*Do  you  imagine  I  think  otherwise?  This  is  a 
case  of  'Save  me  from  my  friends!'  That  I  am 
tired  is  perfectly  true.  But  when  I  am  in  the  mood 
to  play  fatigue  counts  for  nothing.  And  I  am  in 
that  mood  to-night.  Are  you  really  going  to  have 
some  music  I" 

''Yes,  Piatti  has  brought  his  'cello,  and  he  is 
going  to  take  part  in  the  Rubinstein  sonata  in  D. ' ' 

"Then  I  should  like  to  play  it  with  him;  and 


301 


Thirty  Years  of 


more  beside,  if  lie  will  permit  me.  Piatti  and  I 
are  now  old  colleagues  at  the  *Pops,'  and  we  al- 
ways get  on  splendidly  together." 

What  could  I  say?— save  express  my  gratitude, 
and  apprise  my  friends  of  the  treat  that  was  in 
store.  It  was  the  more  welcome  because  it  was  vir- 
tually unexpected.  An  unalloyed  delight  was  the 
performance  of  that  lovely  sonata  by  the  ^^  Prince 
of  'Cellists'^  and  the  greatest  of  living  pianists. 
Both  seemed  to  revel  in  the  beauties  of  a  work  ad- 
mirably designed  for  the  display  of  their  respec- 
tive instruments,  and  the  rendering  was  in  every 
way  perfect.  After  it  was  over,  dear  old  Piatti, 
who  rarely  talked  much,  said  to  me  in  his  quiet 
way,  ^*I  quite  enjoyed  that.  I  have  played  the 
sonata  with  Rubinstein  many  times,  but  it  never 
went  better  than  to-night.''  Later  on  he  played 
again ;  and  so  did  Paderewski— with  Sullivan  close 
by  his  side,  watching  with  fascinated  eyes  the 
nimble  fingers  as  they  glided  over  the  keys.  That 
evening  the  illustrious  pianist  was  inspired.  Fa- 
tigue was  forgotten;  indeed,  he  seemed  much 
fresher  than  on  the  preceding  night,  when  he  in- 
troduced his  fine  ^^ Polish  Fantasia"  at  the  Phil- 
harmonic.^ He  went  on  and  on  from  one  piece  to 
another,  with  characteristic  forgetfulness  of  self, 
and  it  was  well  on  to  dawn  before  we  parted. 

The  debut  of  Leonard  Borwick  in  1890  is  worthy 

^  This  work  was  composed  for  and  first  performed  by  M.  Pade- 
rewski at  the  Norwich  Festival  of  1893.

of  mention,  inasmuch  as,  like  Fanny  Davies,  lie 
embodies  in  a  remarkable  degree  the  unique  quali- 
ties of  the  romantic  school  whereof  their  teacher, 
Mme.  Clara  Schumann,  was  admittedly  the  most 
spontaneous  and  finished  exponent.  The  suc- 
cess of  these  two  native  artists  was  destined  to 
afford  great  encouragement  to  rising  students  both 
in  England  and  on  the  Continent.  It  also  helped 
to  create  among  the  general  mass  of  amateurs  a 
taste  for  pianoforte-playing  of  a  more  warm- 
blooded type  than  had  hitherto  satisfied  them. 
The  days  of  Arabella  Goddard  and  her  feux-d' ar- 
tifice had  now  passed  forever ;  and  so,  very  nearly, 
had  those  of  the  coldly  correct  and  scholastic  Sir 
Charles  Halle.  Let  it  be  said,  nevertheless,  that 
the  late  musical  knight  accomplished  much  useful 
work  in  the  oral  education  of  the  youthful  and 
impressionable  mothers  of  future  generations  of 
amateurs.  He  performed  a  still  higher  function, 
moreover,  by  diffusing  a  love  of  high-class  orches- 
tral music  through  the  medium  of  his  famous 
Manchester  band  (now  conducted  by  Hans 
Richter),  which  enjoyed  a  tremendous  vogue  in 
the  north  of  England,  though  it  consistently  failed 
to  make  money  when  brought  to  the  metropolis, 
as  it  frequently  was  at  that  time.  At  the  Popular 
Concerts  Sir  Charles  was  still  a  favorite,  and  I 
note  that  in  December,  1890,  he  was  taking  part 
in  a  ^'Beethoven  programme''  with  Lady  Halle 
{nee  Neruda),  Louis  Eies,  Ludwig  Straus,  Alfred

Gibson,  and  Piatti  for  coadjutors.  The  old  com- 
bination, even  as  late  as  that,  was  still  intact.  In 
the  same  month,  by  the  way,  Jean  Gerardy  made 
his  first  appearance  in  London,  a  marvelous  'cello 
prodigy  of  twelve,  and  destined  to  ripen  into  an 
artist  of  the  first  rank.

CHAPTER  XIV 

Adelina  Patti  at  home — Life  at  Craig-y-nos  Castle— Opening  of 
the  Patti  Theatre:  inaugural  operatic  performance — Prepar-

Wagner — Bayreuth  by  proxy  and  in  reality — "The  Queen  of 
Song":  an  appreciation— How  she  reappeared  at  Covent 
Garden — A  strange  presentiment. 

IN  August,  1891,  I  paid  my  first  visit  to  Craig-y- 
nos  Castle,  the  lovely  Welsh  home  of  Mme. 
Adelina  Patti.  I  had  known  the  distinguished 
cantatrice  personally  some  half-dozen  years;  but 
somehow  I  had  always  been  content  to  worship 
from  afar  one  who  filled,  by  right  of  unrivaled 
gifts,  the  highest  place  in  the  temple  of  vocal  art. 
The  gr^eatest  vocalist  of  her  sex  that  the  world  had 
brought  forth  since  the  middle  of  the  nineteenth 
century;  the  brilliant  ^^ Queen  of  Song,''  honored 
by  monarchs  and  princes,  sought  by  the  creme  of 
aristocracy  and  wealth,  quoted  by  poets  and  nov- 
elists, feted  and  applauded  alike  in  the  Eastern 
and  Western  hemispheres— small  wonder  if  this 
strangly  unique  being  had  inspired  me  from  youth 
upward  with  feelings  of  the  deepest  veneration  and 
amazement.  Nor  were  those  feelings  to  undergo 
the  slightest  tinge  of  modification  during  the 
period  of  ripening  friendship  and  often  close  asso-

elation  that  was  now  to  follow.  There  's  a  ^'di- 
vinity doth  hedge''  queens  as  well  as  kings;  and 
Patti  is  one  of  those  in  whom  familiarity  may 
exercise  a  charm,  but  can  never  ' '  breed  contempt. ' ' 
The  immediate  occasion  of  my  first  journey 
to  Craig-y-nos  was  the  inauguration  of  the  elegant 
little  theatre  which  Mme.  Patti-Nicolini  had  re- 
cently built  in  the  new  wing  of  her  castle.  It  had 
been  settled  in  the  spring  that  I  was  to  be  present. 
In  July  came  the  following  note : 

Craig- Y-Nos  Castle,  Ystradgynlais, 

July  13,  1891. 
Dear  Mr.  Klein  : 

I  promised  to  send  you  a  line  with  itinerary  for  jour- 
ney from  London  to  Craig-y-nos  Castle,^  which  I  enclose, 
and  trust  you  will  be  good  enough  to  let  me  know  on 
which  day  we  are  to  expect  you,  so  as  to  send  the  car- 
riage to  the  station  to  meet  you.  With  omr  united  very 
best  regards, 

Most  sincerely  yours, 

Adelina  Patti-Nicolini. 

P.S. — The  opening  of  our  theatre  takes  place  on  the 
12th  of  August. 

I  went  down  on  the  8th.     It  was  so  much  more 
pleasant  to  be  there  for  three  or  four  days  before 

^  It  was  then  an  eight  hours '  affair,  involving  two  changes  of 
railway  and  a  journey  from  one  station  to  another  at  Neath, 
followed  ^j  a  drive  to  the  castle  from  the  station  in  Swansea 
Valley  by  the  road  whi'-h  Mme.  Patti  expressly  had  cut  along  the 
mountain-side.  The  present  journey  by  the  Brecon  route  is  much 
shorter.

the  function.  One  could  study  the  castle  and  its 
environs,  and  become  accustomed  to  the  ways  of 
the  household.  My  welcome  was  of  the  utmost  cor- 
diality. Mme.  Patti's  fame  as  a  hostess  had  pre- 
ceded and  did  not  belie  her;  she  kept  an  eye  open 
for  the  comfort  of  each  of  her  guests.  The  house 
party  was  a  numerous  one,  including  as  it  did  the 
Spanish  Ambassador,  Sir  Edward  Lawson,  Sir 
Augustus  and  Lady  Harris,^  poor  William  Terriss, 
the  actor  (asked  to  deliver  the  opening  address  in 
place  of  Sir  Henry  Irving,  who  could  not  come), 
the  Eissler  Sisters,  Signer  and  Mme.  Arditi,  An- 
toinette Sterling,  Giulia  Valda,  Durward  Lely, 
Tito  Mattel,  Wilhelm  Ganz,  Franco  Novara,  and 
others. 

The  place  has  been  described  so  often  that  I  take 
it  almost  for  granted  the  reader  knows  something 
of  Craig-y-nos  and  its  beauties.  Enough  that  the 
scene  is  a  bit  of  fairyland,  a  veritable  ^  ^  oasis  in  the 
desert,''  as  some  guide-books  have  called  it,  amid 
the  long  tracts  of  uninteresting  country  that  con- 
stitute the  watershed  of  the  Swansea  Valley.  The 
castle  itself  is  fitted  up  with  every  contrivance  that 
modem  luxury  can  afford.  The  winter  garden, 
with  its  wonderful  electric  fountain,  is  of  huge 
dimensions,  and  in  summer  the  conservatory  makes 
the  most  picturesque  dining-room  I  have  ever  seen. 
In  the  French  billiard-room  stands  the  famous 

^The  worthy  sheriff  had  just  received  the  honor  of  knight- 
hood in  connection  with  the  visit  of  Kaiser  Wilhelm  II  to  the 
City  of  London.

orchestrion,  probably  the  finest  instrument  of  its 
kind  ever  built.  It  possesses  a  rich,  mellow  organ 
tone,  and  executes  the  most  complex  compositions 
with  extraordinary  clearness.  I  may  say,  without 
exaggeration,  that  it  was  by  the  aid  of  her  splendid 
orchestrion  that  Mme.  Patti  first  began  to  compre- 
hend the  intricacies  of  Wagner's  more  advanced 
works.  She  now  knows  them  by  heart  and  enjoys 
them. 

But,  after  all,  the  gem  of  the  castle,  apart  from 
its  mistress,  is  the  theatre.  It  has  been  called  ^'a 
Bayreuth  theatre  en  miniature^^— and  justly.  No 
side  boxes  or  seats;  a  single  gallery  at  the  back; 
stalls  sloping  down  to  the  orchestra  so  that  the  mu- 
sicians are  nearly  out  of  sight ;  and  a  clever  system 
of  stage  lighting  by  electricity.  The  pure  Renais- 
sance architecture  is  set  off  to  great  advantage  by 
a  singularly  delicate  scheme  of  color,— pale  blue, 
cream,  and  gold,— to  which  the  deep  sapphire  of 
the  curtains  supplies  a  most  effective  contrast. 
The  walls  and  proscenium  are  tastefully  decorated, 
and  between  graceful  columns  are  inscribed  in  pan- 
els the  names  of  the  great  composers.  The  scenery 
is  painted  by  the  best  theatrical  artists;  while  the 
act-drop,  representing  Semiramide  driving  her 
war-chariot,  is  a  spirited  achievement,  beside  fur- 
nishing an  excellent  portrait  of  the  Queen  of  the 
Castle.  Also  to  be  noted  is  the  novel  mechanism 
for  rai'sing  the  floor  of  the  auditorium  to  the  level 
of  the  stage,  whereby  the  salle  is  converted  into  a 
handsome  ball-room.    It  is  here,  every  Christmas

Eve,  that  Mme.  Patti  bestows  her  annual  gifts 
upon  the  servants  and  tenantry  of  her  estate. 

With  her  professional  career  nearing  its  end, 
what,  it  may  be  asked,  can  have  been  the  object  of 
this  great  artist  in  enriching  her  home  with  such 
a  structure  as  this!  To  practise  and  perform 
operas?  Certainly  not.  True  it  is  that  on  the 
memorable  opening  night  now  referred  to  the  still 
youthful  Patti,  a  picture  of  grace  ablaze  with 
diamonds,  sang  the  first  act  of  '^La  Traviata,^' 
followed  by  the  garden  scene  from  "Faust,''  with 
her  husband,  M.  Nicolini,  in  his  old  part.  Again, 
three  days  later,  a  performance  was  given  of  the 
balcony  scene  from  "Romeo''  and  the  third  act 
of  Flotow's  "Martha";  this,  like  the  first,  being 
attended  by  a  crowded  audience  of  privileged 
friends  and  neighbors.  But  these  were  the  bap- 
tismal representations.  They  consecrated  the  the- 
atre, as  it  were,  without  precisely  foreshadowing 
the  main  purpose  of  its  existence. 

The  answer  to  this  question  was  supplied  by 
Mme.  Patti  herself  early  during  that  very  sojourn 
at  Craig-y-nos  Castle :  "I  love  the  stage.  I  love  to 
act  and  to  portray  every  species,  every  shade  of 
human  emotion.  Only  I  want  freedom— more  free- 
dom than  opera,  with  its  restricted  movements  and 
its  wear  and  tear  on  the  voice,  can  possibly  allow 
the  actress.  I  care  not  whether  it  be  comedy  or 
tragedy,  so  long  as  I  feel  that  I  can  devote  my 
whole  energy,  my  whole  being,  to  realizing  the 
character  that  I  have  to  delineate.     Even  words 


313 


Thirty  Years  of 


trouble  me;  they  take  time  to  commit  to  memory, 
and  their  utterance  fatigues  a  singer  too  much. 
Yet  I  want  to  act,  to  feel  myself  upon  the  boards, 
playing  to  amuse  myself  and  a  few  chosen  friends 
on  each  side  of  the  footlights.  What  does  there 
remain  for  me  to  do?  What  but  to  enact  scenes 
and  plays  in  '  pantomime ' ;  to  utilize  the  ancient  art 
of  the  Italian  mime  and  express  every  sentiment  by 
means  of  gesture,  action,  and  facial  expression.  I 
must  have  music,  of  course;  I  cannot  do  entirely 
without  my  own  art  and  all  its  wealth  of  suggestive 
force.  Give  me  only  a  dramatic  idea,  with  music 
that  aids  in  depicting  it,  and  I  will  play  you  any 
part  you  choose,  from  one  of  Sarah  Bernhardt 's 
down  to  Fatima  in  ^  ^  Bluebeard. '  ^ 

I  understood.  There  was  something  more  in  this 
than  mere  whim  or  caprice.  That  Mme.  Patti  had 
already  been  demonstrating  her  marvelous  talent 
for  ^^ dramatic  pantomime''  upon  the  stage  of  her 
new  theatre  I  knew  quite  well.  In  a  word,  her  his- 
trionic powers,  which  had  so  conspicuously  devel- 
oped during  the  later  years  of  her  career,  were  now 
asserting  their  strength  to  a  degree  which  in  this 
case  demanded  active  exercise.  Knowing  that  I 
was  an  ^^old  hand"  at  amateur  stage  work,  she 
asked  me  if  I  would  like  to  assist  in  one  of  the  en- 
tertainments. I  inquired  which  particular  kind— 
the  '^ Sarah  Bernhardt''  or  the  ^ ^ Bluebeard " ! 

*'Both,"  she  replied,  laughing.  ^^We  already 
have  a  capital  arrangement  of  ^Bluebeard.'  We 
can  do  that  to-morrow  or  next  day.    Then  if  you 


314 


Musical  Life  in  London 


like  to  write  out  a  scenario  of  one  of  Bernhardt 's 
plays,  we  will  put  it  in  hand  and  give  it  later  in 
the  month. ' ' 

I  suggested  ^*La  Tosca"— little  dreaming  that 
Puccini  was  then  thinking  of  composing  an  opera 
upon  Sardou's  play.  My  hostess  agreed.  The 
casts  were  arranged  and  forthwith  we  set  to  work. 
In  * '  Bluebeard ' '  I  played  the  lover.  In  ^ '  La  Tosca ' ' 
young  Richard  Nicolini,  a  professional  actor, 
enacted  the  painter  Paul  Cavaradossi,  and  I  took 
the  part  of  Scarpia,  The  rehearsals  were  a  delight. 
They  frequently  took  place  in  the  afternoon,  and 
Mme.  Patti  entered  into  them  as  seriously  as 
though  they  were  for  a  public  performance;  in- 
teresting herself  in  every  little  detail  and  suggest- 
ing countless  bits  of  effective  *  ^  business. ' '  It  was 
in  course  of  these  rehearsals  that  I  began  to  realize 
what  a  consummate  mistress  she  was  of  the  art  of 
the  stage.^  A  bare  idea,  a  mere  hint,  would  suffice ; 
whether  comedy  or  tragedy  was  the  theme,  she 
would  work  upon  it  and  elaborate  it  with  wonder- 
ful skill.  Once  while  we  were  rehearsing  ^^La 
Tosca, ' '  Sir  Augustus  Harris  quietly  slipped  in  and 
took  a  seat  in  the  dark  auditorium.  He  watched 
the  proceedings  with  the  amusement  of  a  master  of 
the  game  enjoying  a  holiday.  Mme.  Patti  soon  per- 
ceived him,  and  she  called  out: 

*  In  matters  concerning  scenery,  costumes,  and  lighting  it  was 
the  same,  though  herein  Mme.  Patti  relied  greatly  upon  the  able 
assistance  of  Frank  Rigo  (the  second  regisseur  of  Covent  Garden 
and  the  Metropolitan  Opera  House),  who  used  regularly  to  spend 
his  summer  holiday  at  Craig-y-nos. 

315

*^Gus,  what  are  you  doing  there!  Why  don't 
you  come  on  the  stage  and  help  us  T ' 

*^My  dear  Adelina,''  answered  Sir  Augustus, 
^  ^  if  this  were  an  opera  or  a  play  I  would  with  plea- 
sure. But  it  is  neither,  and  whatever  it  may  be, 
there  is  no  need  of  my  help  as  long  as  you  are 
there.  I  am  just  beginning  to  realize  that  if  you 
had  not  been  the  world 's  greatest  singer  you  could 
have  been  one  of  its  best  actresses."  He  meant  it 
—and  it  was  true. 

The  ^  ^  Tosca"  performance  did  not  come  off  until 
August  29,  after  the  impresario  had  left  the  castle. 
At  the  last  moment  we  found  the  bill  too  long,  so 
we  determined  to  omit  dramatic  action  and  give  it 
as  a  series  of  tableaux  vivants,  in  which  form  it 
vastly  pleased  a  large  audience  of  friends  from 
' '  The  Valley. ' '  They  missed,  however,  the  thrill- 
ing effect  of  Mme.  Patti's  gliding,  serpentine 
movements  in  the  supper  scene  where  she  stabs 
Scarpia;  and  they  could  not  guess  that  the  dead 
Minister  of  Police,  in  the  person  of  myself,  was 
positively  shuddering  as  he  lay  prone  between  the 
two  lighted  candles.  I  had  been  told  to  keep  my 
eyes  open  and  stare,  but  that  tragic  look  upon  the 
countenance  of  La  Tosca  as  she  placed  the  crucifix 
upon  my  breast  was  so  terrible  that  if  I  had  not 
closed  them  I  should  have  had  to  jump  up  before 
the  curtain  fell.  Throughout,  Patti's  attitudes 
were  a  wonderful  study,  and  I  feel  sure  Sarah 
Bernhardt  and  Ternina  would  have  given  much  to 
have  seen  her  remarkable  impersonation. 

316 


Musical  Life  in  London 


A  week  prior  to  this  event  Mme.  Patti  had  been 
honored  by  a  visit  from  the  late  Prince  Henry  of 
Battenberg,  who  was  staying  at  Clyne  Castle,  and 
who  came  out  to  lunch  accompanied  by  Count 
Gleichen,  Lord  Koyston  (now  the  Earl  of  Hard- 
wicke),  and  other  friends.  The  Queen's  son-in- 
law  witnessed  a  repetition  of  the  garden  scene  from 
^ 'Faust,"  and  altogether  spent  a  most  agreeable 
afternoon.  A  few  days  later  we  all  went  over  to 
Swansea  to  take  part  in  the  annual  concert  given 
by  Mme.  Patti  in  aid  of  the  local  charities.  The 
journey  each  way  assumed  the  character  of  a  tri- 
umphal progress,  the  entire  route  from  the  station 
to  the  concert-hall  being  lined  by  dense  crowds.  It 
was  touching  to  witness  the  eagerness  of  the  hum- 
ble folk— men,  women,  and  children— to  catch  a 
glimpse  of  the  illustrious  vocalist,  who  once  every 
year  came  from  her  mountain  home  to  aid  the  in- 
stitution that  succored  their  needy  and  suffering. 
The  concert  itself  was  memorable  because  on  this 
occasion,  for  the  first  time  in  her  life,  the  famous 
songstress  delivered  as  an  encore  the  soul-stirring 
strains  of  the  Welsh  national  air,  ''Land  of  my 
Fathers ' ' ;  and  when,  at  her  request,  her  enthusias- 
tic auditors  joined  in  the  chorus,  the  effect  was 
simply  electrifying. 

Altogether  that  delightful  month  at  Craig-y- 
nos  Castle  was  packed  with  excitement  and  bustle. 
It  was  my  privilege  during  the  next  few  years  to 
spend  there  many  weeks— visits  not  less  enjoyable, 
but  less  eventful,  and  infinitely  more  restful.     In

Thirty  Years  of 


the  evenings  we  would  sit  and  listen  to  the  orches- 
trion, and  when  it  had  exhausted  its  round  of  Wag- 
ner excerpts  I  would  occasionally  supplement  the 
selection  upon  the  piano  with  fragments  from  the 
^ * Meistersinger/ '  ''Tristan,"  and  the  ''Nibelun- 
gen."  It  was  extraordinary  to  see  the  pleasure 
Mme.  Patti  took  in  this  music.  One  year  August 
Wilhelmj  was  there,  and  to  please  her  he  played 
his  own  transcription  of  the  ''Preislied"  upon 
Nicolini's  fine  ' '  Guarnerius, "  Clara  Eissler  exe- 
cuting the  accompaniment  upon  the  harp.  To 
reward  him  Patti  sang  Gounod's  ''Ave  Maria"  to 
his  violin  obbligato,  Clara  Eissler  again  playing 
the  harp  part,  while  I  took  the  harmonium.  Never 
did  the  familiar  piece  go  better.  But  the  real  re- 
ward came  later  when  some  one  brought  a  copy  of 
Wagner's  "Traume"  to  the  castle,  and  the  diva, 
for  the  first  time  in  her  career,  wedded  her  golden 
tones  to  one  of  Wagner's  long-drawn  melodies. 
By  her  request  we  worked  at  it  together,  but  her 
German  accent  and  phrasing  were  faultless,  and, 
beyond  marking  the  breathing-places,  I  had  vir- 
tually nothing  to  suggest. 

In  the  following  season  she  sang  "Traume"  at 
one  of  the  concerts  at  the  Albert  Hall,  and  so  rap- 
turously was  this  applauded  that  we  subsequently 
took  up  the  study  of  Elizabeth's  Prayer  ("Tann- 
hauser").  This  suited  her  to  perfection,  and  she 
rendered  it  with  a  depth  of  fervid  expression  and 
a  wealth  of  glorious  tone  that  have  never  been 
equaled.    Further  than  this,  however,  Mme.  Patti

has  not  yet  consented  to  pursue  her  active  alliance 
with  the  music  of  Wagner.  She  loves  to  listen  to 
it,  but  hesitates  to  impose  upon  her  delicate  organ 
the  strain  of  singing  it  in  public.  During  our  Wag- 
ner chats  she  would  often  ask  me  about  Bayreuth, 
and  I  begged  her  to  seize  the  first  opportunity  of 
attending  the  festival.  She  did  not  do  so,  how- 
ever, until  after  her  marriage  with  Baron  Ceder- 
strom,  who  is  extremely  fond  of  traveling,  and, 
beside  taking  his  wife  to  Sweden  every  summer, 
introduces  her  to  many  interesting  European  re- 
sorts.   The  following  letter  tells  its  own  tale: 

FIhrens  Villa,  near  Saltsjobaden,  Stockholm, 

August  5,  1901. 
Dear  Mr.  Klein  : 

We  have  just  arrived  at  this  lovely  place  after  spend- 
ing a  very  pleasant  time  in  Switzerland  and  at  Bayreuth, 
and  I  must  send  you  first  these  few  lines  to  tell  you  how 
immensely  I  was  impressed  by  the  Bayreuth  perform- 
ances. I  never  could  have  imagined  anything  so  perfect 
as  the  mise  en  scene,  and  I  thought  the  "Ring"  simply 
divine.  There  are  no  words  to  express  it;  it  is  all  so 
wonderful  and  beautiful.  I  thought  "Parsifal"  was 
glorious,  especially  the  last  act,  and  I  am  indeed  glad  to 
have  heard  all  these  marvelous  works. 

After  a  three  weeks'  stay  at  Schinznach  we  went  to 
Lucerne,  where  we  had  a  most  delightful  time,  taking 
long  excursions  every  day.  Can  you  imagine  me  going 
up  the  Rigi,  Pilatus,  the  Biirgenstock,  and  similar 
places  ?  I  was  well  rewarded  for  my  courage  in  mounting 
those  perpendicular  heights,  for  the  view  from  the  top 
was  simply  beyond  description.  .  .  .

We  expect  to  remain  here  until  the  beginning  of  Sep- 
tember, when  we  shall  return  to  England,  as  my  concert 
tour  commences  the  first  week  in  October.  The  Baron 
joins  me  in  sending  you  kindest  remembrances. 

Yours  very  sincerely, 

Adelina  Patti-Cederstrom. 

The  days  at  Craig-y-nos  were  always  full  of  in- 
terest and  variety.  It  was  an  inestimable  privi- 
lege to  enjoy  the  daily  society  and  conversation  of 
Adelina  Patti;  to  hear  her  ever  and  anon  burst 
into  song ;  to  catch  the  ring  of  her  sunshiny  laugh ; 
to  come  under  the  spell  of  a  personal  charm  such 
as  few  women  possess.  She  converses  with  equal 
facility  in  English,  French,  Italian,  and  Spanish, 
speaks  German  and  Russian  well,  and  by  this  time, 
I  dare  say,  can  carry  on  a  fluent  colloquy  in  Swe- 
dish. Her  memory  is  extraordinary.  She  tells  a 
hundred  stories  of  her  early  life  in  America,  dat- 
ing from  the  age  of  seven,  when  she  made  her  first 
appearance  in  public.^  She  tells  how  they  used 
to  stand  her  upon  the  table  to  sing;  how  she  first 

^  The  portrait  of  Adelina  Patti  at  the  age  of  nine  forming  the 
frontispiece  of  this  book  is  taken  from  a  daguerreotype  in  her 
possession,  which  she  showed  me  at  Craig-y-nos  Castle  a  few  years 
ago.  The  complete  picture  shows  three  little  girls  seated  together 
at  a  table — Adelina  in  the  centre  and  a  playmate  on  each  side. 
I  was  so  much  struck  by  the  intelligence  of  the  expression  and  the 
extraordinary  maturity  of  the  features  generally — so  like,  even 
at  that  age,  to  the  familiar  face  of  later  years — that  I  begged 
Mme.  Pat{i  to  allow  me  to  have  a  photographic  enlargement  made 
of  the  central  figure.  She  kindly  consented,  and  three  copies 
were  executed.  Of  these  she  herself  owns  one,  the  widow  of  Sir 
Augustus  Harris  has  another,  and  I  possess  the  third.

rendered  ^' Casta  Diva  '^  by  ear  without  a  single 
mistake ;  and  how,  when  her  eldest  sister,  Amalia, 
was  striving  hard  to  master  the  shake,  the  tiny 
Adelina  stopped  her  and  asked,  ^^Why  don't  you 
do  it  like  this!''  therewith  executing  a  natural  and 
absolutely  irreproachable  trill. 

Patti  tells  you  that  she  never  studied  the  art  of 
producing  or  emitting  the  voice.  Nature,  alone 
and  unaided,  accomplished  that  mar^^el.  To  keep 
the  organ  in  perfect  condition,  she  has  but  to  run 
over  the  scales  ten  minutes  every  morning.  Her 
vocalization  is  one  of  those  miracles  that  cannot 
be  explained.  Its  wondrous  certainty  and  finish 
are  assuredly  not  arrived  at  without  some  labor; 
but  in  the  end  the  miracle  seems  to  have  accom- 
plished itself.  Her  ''ear"  is  phenomenal.  She 
never  forgets  a  tune,  and  will  instantly  name  the 
opera  or  composition  in  which  it  occurs.  Another 
mystery  is  the  perennial  freshness  of  her  voice, 
which,  after  half  a  century  of  constant  use,  retains 
well-nigh  unimpaired  the  delicious  sweetness  and 
bell-like  timbre  of  early  womanhood.  No  other 
such  example  of  perfect  preservation  stands  on 
record  in  the  annals  of  the  lyric  art.  To  analyze 
its  secret  one  can  only  say,  here  surely  is  a  singer 
of  marvelous  constitution,  heaven-gifted  with  a 
faultless  method,  who  has  sedulously  nursed  her 
physical  resources,  and  has  never,  under  any  cir- 
cumstances, imposed  the  smallest  undue  strain 
upon  the  exquisitely  proportioned  mechanism  of 
her  vocal  organs.

And  the  triumphs  of  this  incomparable  artist 
have  not  ^* spoiled"  her.  The  homage  of  kings, 
the  adulation  of  friends,  the  applause  of  multi- 
tudes, have  not  robbed  her  of  that  unaffected  sim- 
plicity, that  freedom  from  ostentation,  that  yearn- 
ing for  home  life  and  domestic  tranquillity,  which 
are  among  her  most  characteristic  attributes.  As 
evidence  of  this  fact,  I  quote  a  portion  of  a  letter 
which  Mme.  Patti  wrote  me  from  Nice  in  the  spring 
of  1895.  It  was  obviously  not  ^  intended  for  pub- 
lication," but  herein  lies  its  chief  value  as  a  com- 
munication emanating  from  the  friend  rather  than 
the  artist:* 

When  I  gave  my  extra  performance  of  the  ''Barbiere'* 
my  triumph  was,  if  possible,  even  greater  than  usual, 
but  on  each  occasion  the  success  has  been  so  enormous 
that  it  would  be  difficult  to  say  which  performance  ex- 
cited the  greatest  enthusiasm,  or  when  I  received  the 
biggest  ovation.  It  has,  indeed,  become  a  succession  of 
triumphs  the  whole  time.  Do  you  not  feel  proud  of  your 
little  friend,  who  was  fifty-two  last  month,  and  has  been 
singing  uninterruptedly  every  year  from  the  age  of 
seven!  I  am  really  beginning  to  believe  what  they  all 
tell  me — that  I  am  a  wonderful  little  woman! 

It  is  no  exaggeration  to  say  that  every  one,  without 
exception,  has  been  running  after  me,  and  loading  me 
with  invitations— in  fact,  to  such  a  degree  that  I  must 
honestly  confess  that  I  am  getting  decidedly  tired  of 
all  the  parties  and  gaieties  we  have  been  going  through 
during  the  past  few  weeks.  It  has  been  an  incessant 
lunching  out,  dining  out,  and  receiving  visitors  from 
morning  till  night.  I  shall  be  very  happy  to  see  my 
dear  Castle  again  and  have  a  little  peace  and  quietness.

It  was  just  prior  to  this  visit  to  the  south  of 
France  that  negotiations,  in  which  I  acted  as  in- 
termediary, were  concluded  between  Mme.  Patti 
and  Sir  Augustus  Harris  for  the  diva's  reappear- 
ance in  opera  at  Covent  Garden  during  the  season 
of  1895.  I  had  long  devoutly  wished  for  this  con- 
summation; but  there  were  many  obstacles  to  be 
removed,  not  the  smallest  of  these  being  concerned 
with  the  Birmingham  managers  of  the  ^' Patti 
Concerts"  throughout  the  United  Kingdom,  who 
were  naturally  afraid  lest  her  return  to  opera 
should  interfere  with  the  financial  success  of  the 
customary  concerts  at  the  Albert  Hall.  Ultimately 
these  fears  were  allayed,  and  Mme.  Patti  con- 
fided to  me  that  she  would  not  be  unwilling  to 
consider  an  oifer  on  certain  terms  from  her 
old  friend  ^'Gus."  I  immediately  set  about 
arranging  for  an  interview  between  them  in 
London.  This  was  not  altogether  an  easy  mat- 
ter. The  great  prima  donna  was  to  spend  only 
one  evening  in  town  on  her  way  to  the  Riviera, 
and  the  busy  impresario,  with  whom  minutes 
reckoned  as  hours,  was  not  readily  to  be  moved 
—on  an  uncertain  mission,  as  he  deemed  it 
— from  one  quarter  of  London  to  another.  But, 
eventually,  I  persuaded  him  that  Mme.  Patti  was 
really  in  earnest,  and  he  consented  to  accompany 
me  to  Paddington  Station  to  meet  the  express  from 
South  Wales. 

It  was  a  bleak  January  evening,  and  of  course 
the  train  was  late.  This  was  the  more  unlucky 
because  it  happened  that  Tennyson's  ^'King  Ar- 


323 


Thirty  Years  of 


thur''  was  to  be  produced  at  the  Lyceum  that  night, 
and  we  were  both  anxious  to  be  there  at  the  rise 
of  the  curtain;  and,  moreover,  I  had  to  write  a 
notice  of  Sullivan's  incidental  music  to  the  new 
play.  We  were  already  in  evening  dress,  and  as 
Harris  was  suffering  from  a  cold  I  took  care  not 
to  let  him  stand  upon  the  draughty  platform.  We 
waited,  therefore,  by  a  warm  fire  at  the  station 
hotel  and  discussed  current  events.  My  compan- 
ion was  not  in  good  spirits,  while  the  fact  that  he 
was  not  in  a  sanguine  mood  was  palpable  from  his 
frequent  remark,  ^' Klein,  I  can't  believe  Patti 
means  to  sing  at  Covent  Garden  this  season. "  Sol 
felt  heartily  glad  when  the  train  was  signaled  and 
the  youthful  little  lady,  vivacious  as  ever  in  bearing, 
but  silent  under  a  mountain  of  wraps  wound  round 
to  protect  her  from  the  biting  air,  stepped  buoy- 
antly out  of  her  saloon  carriage  and  took  Har- 
ris's arm  to  walk  into  the  hotel.  Not  a  word  was 
spoken  until  we  got  to  the  private  sitting-room. 
Then,  greetings  over,  Mme.  Patti,  with  an  arch 
smile,  asked  Sir  Augustus  if  he  would  like  a  little 
quiet  conversation  with  her.  He  bowed  graciously. 
The  rest  of  us  discreetly  retired.  Ten  minutes 
later  he  came  out  of  the  room  beaming  with  plea- 
sure. *'Make  haste  and  say  good-by.  Adelina 
would  like  us  to  stay  and  dine,  but  we  must  n  't ;  we 
must  get  a  *  snack'  somewhere  and  then  hurry  to 
the  Lyceum. ' '  In  the  hansom  he  added :  "It  's  all 
right.  She  sings  at  six  performances,  beginning 
the  second  week  in  June!"  And  we  both  felt  as 
happy  as  school-boys.

In  the  late  summer  I  was  at  Craig-y-nos  once 
more.  Work  was  all  over  for  the  season,  and  the 
indefatigable  mistress  of  the  castle,  satiated  with 
triumphs  surpassing  any  that  she  had  ever  previ- 
ously earned  at  Covent  Garden,  was  only  thinking 
how  she  could  best  amuse  her  guests  and  herself 
upon  the  stage  of  her  beloved  theatre.  It  was  de- 
cided to  do  a  new  ' '  play  without  words. '  ^  Several 
subjects  were  proposed,  but  the  choice  eventually 
fell  upon  Mrs.  Henry  Wood's  ^'East  Lynne," 
which,  as  every  one  knows,  was  dramatized  many 
years  ago  and  makes  a  most  effective  play.  The 
scenario  was  soon  prepared  and  rehearsals  started. 
There  was  ample  talent  available  for  the  rather 
lengthy  cast.  Mme.  Patti  of  course  played  Ladt/ 
Isabel  (afterward  Mme,  Vine) ;  that  talented  ama- 
teur actor  C.  P.  Colnaghi  (since  deceased)  was  the 
Archibald  Carlyle;  another  well-known  amateur, 
Augustus  Spalding,  played  Captain  Levison;  and 
I  undertook  the  part  of  Richard  Hare.  Music  for 
the  melodrame  was  expressly  composed  (at  light- 
ning speed)  by  our  hostess's  distant  relative  Andre 
Pollonnais,  the  clever  French  musician  who  after- 
ward wrote  for  her  the  pantomime  play  ^ '  Mirka, ' ' 
in  which  she  appeared  at  Nice  for  the  benefit  of  the 
local  charities.  M.  Pollonnais  also  set  to  music  the 
lines  of  a  lullaby  which  I  had  written  specially  for 
Mme.  Patti  to  sing  in  the  scene  where  the  supposed 
governess  watches  tenderly  over  her  dying  child 
in  the  nursery  at  East  Lynne.  This  same  lullaby 
she  afterward  sang  in  public  in  London  and  in 
other  places. 


327 


Thirty  Years  of 


The  performance  of  the  wordless  '^East  Lynne'^ 
on  August  17  was  perhaps  the  most  complete  ar- 
tistic achievement  in  this  direction  accomplished 
at  Craig-y-nos  Castle.  Certainly  it  yielded  the 
finest  piece  of  acting  on  Mme.  Patti's  part  that  I 
have  known  her  to  give  at  her  own  theatre.  It 
was  also  notable  for  a  curious  incident.  Eeaders 
familiar  with  the  novel  or  play  will  remember  that 
when  Mme.  Vine  revisits  her  former  home  she  is 
dressed  in  widow 's  ' '  weeds. ' '  Such  a  costume  was 
worn  by  Mme.  Patti,  and  very  charming  she  looked 
in  it.  One  person,  however,  objected  strongly  to 
her  having  donned  a  crape  dress.  That  person  was 
M.  Nicolini.  After  the  curtain  had  fallen  he  ex- 
pressed himself  on  the  subject  in  no  measured 
terms,  declaring  that  such  attire  ^^portait  mal- 
heur,''  and  that  he  did  not  like  to  see  his  wife  in 
a  costume  which  she  might  one  day  be  compelled 
of  necessity  to  wear.  I  pointed  out  to  him  that 
he  might  make  the  same  complaint  about  the  pei- 
gnoir worn  by  Violetta  when  dying,  or  the  prison 
garb  of  Marguerite  in  the  last  act  of  ^  ^  Faust. ' '  But 
he  refused  to  see  it,  and  remarked,  ^^Elles  n'etaient 
jamais  veuves,  cettes  femmes-la ! ' '  ^^lich  was  per- 
fectly true;  and,  having  regard  to  subsequent 
events,  his  objection  would  appear  to  have  been  not 
altogether  unjustifiable. 

It  was  in  June  of  the  succeeding  year  that  Mme. 
Patti  hbnored  me  by  being  the  centre  of  attraction 
at  a  dinner-party  which  I  gave  at  Whitehall  Court, 
followed  by  a  large  reception  whereat  some  three 

328 


Musical  Life  in  London 


hundred  guests,  well  known  in  the  musical,  theat- 
rical, and  literary  worlds,  were  bidden  to  meet  the 
diva.  The  peculiarity  of  this  function  was  that 
it  collected  a  good  many  celebrities  who,  for  various 
reasons,  are  seldom  brought  together.  For  this, 
no  doubt,  good  luck  was  largely  responsible.  One 
may  know  and  invite  many  famous  folk  to  dine 
or  sup  during  the  London  season ;  but  it  will  rarely 
happen  that  ninety-five  per  cent,  are  disengaged 
and  willing  to  come.  In  this  instance  I  did  not  re- 
ceive more  than  twenty  refusals,  all  told.  Thus 
it  fell  that  when  I  took  Mme.  Patti  in  to  dinner 
she  found  on  her  right  her  old  friend  Jean  de 
Eeszke,  whom  she  had  not  met  since  the  glorious 
^^Eomeo''  time  in  Paris,  eight  years  before. 
Edouard  was,  of  course,  there,  facing  his  old  con- 
frere Nicolini,  who  chatted  about  his  pet  Cremona 
violins  with  the  perennial  Alfredo  Piatti.  Among 
others  present  were  my  father 's  old  friend  and  pu- 
pil, Lord  Suffield,  and  Lady  Suffield  (now  lord  and 
lady  in  waiting  to  King  Edward  and  Queen 
Alexandra),  Sir  Edward  and  Lady  Lawson,  Sir 
Augustus  and  Lady  Harris,  and  Miss  Zelie  de  Lus- 
san.  Charles  (now  Sir  Charles)  Wyndham  and 
Miss  Mary  Moore  also  came  to  dinner— or  perhaps 
it  was  later  in  the  evening;  and  with  them  the 
young  American  actress  Miss  Fay  Davis,  not 
then  known  on  the  stage,  who  recited  some  pieces 
with  infinite  piquancy  and  grace.  Altogether  it 
was  an  interesting  gathering. 

The  feature  of  the  musicale,  however,  was  a  per-

formance  of  Schumann's  pianoforte  quartet  (Op. 
47)  by  four  distinguished  artists:  Fanny  Davies, 
Sarasate,  Hollander,  and  Piatti— a  combination 
rare  even  at  the  ^'Pops/'  and,  above  all,  to  be 
appreciated  for  the  honor  conferred  by  the  great 
Spanish  violinist,  who  seldom  took  part  in  a  cham- 
ber work  beyond  the  "Kreutzer''  or  some  other 
duet-sonata.  So  anxious  was  he  for  the  quartet 
to  go  well  that  he  insisted  upon  a  rehearsal,  and 
from  Paris  fixed  the  date  himself.  Here  is  his 
note: 

Paris,  23 -5 -'96. 
C'est  entendu,  cher  ami,  je  partirai  le  3  juin.     Ar- 
rangez  la  repetition  pour  le  4  dans  I'apres-midi.^ 

Votre, 

Pablo  Sarasate. 

What  was  more,  he  declined  the  invitation  to 
dine  in  order  that  he  might  be  able  to  eat  his 
early  meal  at  the  Bristol,  as  was  usual  on  evenings 
when  he  had  to  play.  It  is  hardly  necessary  to 
add  that  the  performance  of  the  quartet  was  su- 
perlatively fine.  From  first  to  last  it  went  with 
magnificent  spirit;  and  it  was  listened  to  with 
keen  enjoyment  by  an  assemblage  whose  interest 
seemed  evenly  divided  as  to  the  music,  the  exe- 
cutants, and  the  foremost  group  of  auditors,  headed 
by  the  peerless  ^  ^  guest  of  the  evening. '  ^

entertainments  upon  a  large  scale.  Still,  the  Baron- 
ess Cederstrom  is  as  dearly  attached  as  ever  to  her 
mountain  home,  and,  when  she  is  not  traveling 
abroad  or  professionally,  she  spends  practically  her 
whole  time  there.  She  sings  at  twenty  or  twenty- 
five  concerts  every  year  (three  or  four  in  London, 
the  rest  in  the  provinces),  and  is  received  every- 
where with  the  old-time  ecstasy  and  enthusiasm. 
Nor  can  one  feel  astonished  at  the  vast  assemblages 
which  gather  at  these  familiar  functions,  since  Ade- 
lina  Patti  yet  retains  her  title,  *^The  Queen  of 
Song, ' '  by  virtue  of  tones  still  pure,  rich,  vibrant, 
and  exquisitely  musical;  by  the  magic  of  an  art 
which  no  other  singer  of  her  day  has  exemplified 
with  the  same  wondrous  measure  of  beauty  and 
perfection.  This  extraordinary  survival  of  power 
and  popularity  makes  it  difficult  to  foretell  even 
approximately  when  the  great  prima  donna  will 
bring  her  unexampled  career  to  a  close.  She  has 
now  agreed  to  undertake  a  farewell  tour  in  the 
United  States ;  but  it  is  not  her  intention  to  appear 
there  in  opera.  Thus  the  American  public  will  not 
have  an  opportunity  to  realize  the  full  extent  of 
that  amazing  development  of  her  dramatic  genius 
to  which  I  have  more  especially  made  reference. 
But  Patti  is  always  Patti;  and  whatever  the  con- 
ditions, her  final  coming  will  be  the  occasion  of  a 
rapturous  welcome  from  the  citizens  of  the  country 
in  which  she  was  reared.

THE  early  months  of  1891  witnessed  a  very 
remarkable  operatic  experiment.  New  forces 
were  at  the  back  of  it,  and  it  was  destined  to  mark 
the  climax  of  the  modern  development  of  Eng- 
lish opera.  Had  the  scheme  succeeded  in  its  in- 
tegrity, the  operatic  history  of  the  next  dozen 
years  wonld  have  had  to  be  rewritten;  as  it  was, 
an  individual  artistic  triumph  was  hampered  by 
a  Quixotic  managerial  policy,  and  the  ambitious 
enterprise  resulted  in  a  regrettable  failure. 

The  late  Richard  D'Oyly  Carte  was  an  excel- 
lent man  in  his  own  sphere  of  action  at  the  Savoy 
Theatre.  He  thoroughly  understood  the  business 
of  mounting  the  unique  comic  operas  of  Grilbert 
and  Sullivan,  and  of  sending  them  round  the 
globe  in  the  hands  of  well-trained  companies.  But 
about  the  organization  and  management  of  serious 
opera   he    knew    absolutely   nothing.      Shade    of

Oarl  Rosa!  Imagine  the  fatuity  of  building  a 
large  and  costly  theatre  on  Shaftesbury  Avenue,^ 
bestowing  upon  it  the  high-sounding  title  of 
the  ''Royal  English  Opera,"  engaging  a  double 
company,  and  opening  it  with  a  repertory  of —one 
work!  Never  was  the  initial  error  of  placing  the 
whole  of  the  golden  eggs  in  a  single  basket  more 
surely  followed  by  the  destruction  of  the  goose 
that  laid  them!  Great  was  the  faith  of  D'Oyly 
Carte  in  Arthur  Sullivan.  But  not  even  the  ge- 
nius of  that  fine  musician,  as  exemplified  in  his 
first  grand  opera,  ''Ivanhoe,''  was  capable  of 
withstanding  so  rude  a  test.  Like  one  of  the 
thoroughbred  horses  he  loved  so  well,  ''Ivanhoe" 
ran  a  great  race,  achieved  a  ' '  best  on  record, ' '  and 
then  collapsed  from  sheer  exhaustion.  It  has 
never  raced  since. 

Sullivan  wrote  ''Ivanhoe,"  so  to  speak,  with 
his  life-blood.  He  slaved  at  it  steadily  from  May 
till  December,  and  put  into  it  only  of  his  best. 
For  weeks  before  he  finished  it  he  was  inacces- 
sible; the  Christmas  of  1890  was  no  holiday  for 
him.  The  rehearsals  had  begun  long  before  the 
orchestration  was  ready,  and  the  opera  was  to 
be  produced  on  January  31,  1891,  at  the  latest. 
By  the  first  week  in  the  new  year  the  score  was 
completed.  Then  Sir  Arthur  told  me  I  might  come 
to  Queen's  Mansions  to  hear  some  of  the  music. 
To  my  great  delight,  he  played  several  of  the

amusement  known  as  the  Palace  Theatre  of  Varieties.

numbers  for  me.  I  found  them  picturesque,  dra- 
matic, original,  and  stamped  throughout  with  the 
cachet  which  the  world  understands  by  the  word 
^  ^  Sullivanesque. ' '  I  was  particularly  struck  by 
the  Oriental  character  of  the  harmonies  and  ^in- 
tervals'' in  Rebecca's  song,  *^Lord  of  our  chosen 
race,"  and  I  told  Sullivan  that  I  thought  nothing 
could  be  more  distinctively  Eastern  or  even  He- 
braic in  type. 

^^That  may  well  be  so,"  he  rejoined.  ^^The 
phrase  on  the  words  'guard  me'  you  especially  re- 
fer to  is  not  strictly  mine.^  Let  me  tell  you  where 
I  heard  it.  Wlien  I  was  the  '  Mendelssohn  scholar ' 
and  living  at  Leipsic,  I  went  once  or  twice  to  the 
old  Jewish  synagogue,  and  among  the  many  East- 
ern melodies  chanted  by  the  minister,  this  quaint 
progression  in  the  minor  occurred  so  frequently 
that  I  have  never  forgotten  it. ' '  It  certainly  comes 
in  appropriately  here. 

The  libretto  of  ''Ivanhoe"  was  from  the  fluent 
pen  of  Julian  Sturgis,  the  author  of  ' '  Nadeshda. ' ' 
It  won  praise  as  a  skilful  and  fairly  dramatic 
adaptation  of  Scott's  novel  and  a  polished  exam- 
ple of  poetic  lyric-writing.  The  work  generally 
I  described  at  the  time  as  ''one  which  rivets  the 
attention  of  the  spectator  from  the  moment  the 
curtain  is  raised ;  which  is  strong  and  sympathetic

in  action  and  picturesque  in  story;  which  is  rich 
in  melody  and  replete  with  musical  interest  and 
contrast;  and  which,  finally,  is  presented  amid  a 
wealth  of  surroundings  and  with  a  perfection  of 
executive  detail  such  as  English  opera  never  en- 
joyed before."  It  was  acclaimed  with  the  utmost 
warmth  by  an  audience  that  included  the  com- 
poser's ever-constant  friends  and  patrons,  the 
Prince  and  Princess  of  Wales,  and  the  Duke  and 
Duchess  of  Edinburgh.  The  cast  on  the  first  night 
comprised  Marguerite  Macintyre  (Rebecca),  Es- 
ther Palliser  (Rowena),  Ben  Davies  (IvanJioe), 
Norman  Salmond  (Richard  Coeur  de  Lion), 
Ffrangcon  Davies  (Cedric),  Charles  Kenning- 
ham  (De  Bracy),  Avon  Saxon  (Friar  Tuck), 
Charles  Copland  (Isaac  of  York),  and  that  gifted 
American  barytone,  Eugene  Oudin,  who  made  a 
brilliant  debut  in  the  part  of  the  Templar.  The 
composer  held  the  baton. 

The  opera  was  at  once  scheduled  ^'for  a  run," 
with  two  distinct  casts,  the  alternative  group  in- 
cluding Miss  Thudichum  as  Rebecca,  Lucile  Hill 
as  Roivena,  Franklin  Clive  as  King  Richard,  Jo- 
seph O'Mara  as  Ivanhoe,  and  Richard  Green  as 
the  Templar.  The  strain  of  this  test  was  marvel- 
ously  borne.  For  no  fewer  than  one  hundred  and 
sixty  consecutive  representations  did  ^^Ivanhoe" 
draw  large  and  enthusiastic  audiences— far  and 
away  the  longest  unbroken  run  ever  accomplished 
by  a  serious  opera.  Then,  at  the  end  of  July,  it 
was  withdrawn,  and  the  house  closed  until  No-

vember,  when  an  English  version  of  Andre  Mes- 
sager's  successful  comic  opera  ^^La  Basoche'' 
was  brought  out.  This  did  fairly  well,  but  it  is 
noteworthy  to-day  only  from  the  fact  that  it  en- 
abled Mr.  David  Bispham,  by  his  clever  singing 
and  acting,  to  make  a  deep  impression  at  his  first 
appearance  upon  the  London  stage.^  D'Oyly 
Carte  now  doubtless  imagined  that  he  possessed 
the  foundation  of  a  repertory,  and  he  revived 
^'Ivanhoe''  to  run  alternately  with  ^^La  Ba- 
soche"— Barton  McGuckin  filling  the  title-role, 
while  Medora  Henson  was  the  Rowena,  But  the 
public  quickly  undeceived  the  too  sanguine  mana- 
ger. It  stayed  severely  away.  The  drawing  power 
of  Sullivan's  beautiful  opera  had  been  exhausted; 
and  on  January  16,  just  a  fortnight  short  of 
twelve  months  after  its  auspicious  opening,  the 
^^ Royal  English  Opera''  was  finally  closed— the 
strangest  commingling  of  success  and  failure  ever 
chronicled  in  the  history  of  British  lyric  enter- 
prise ! 

^  The  brilliant  stage  career  of  David  Bispham  virtually  had 
its  beginning  with  his  singularly  picturesque  embodiment  of  the 
Due  de  Longueville  in  ''La  Basoche. "  There  was  about  it  an 
element  of  fantastic  hizarrerie  that  was  singularly  attractive,  and 
which  at  once  drew  attention  to  the  unique  personality  of  the 
artist.  From  that  time  forward,  in  Avhatever  branch  of  his  art 
he  has  elected  to  labor,  David  Bispham  has  consistently  earned 
distinction  and  applause;  and  his  success  has  been  equally  em- 
phatic on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic.  His  gift  of  versatility  is 
extraordinary.  Alike  in  serious  and  comic  characters,  in  Wag- 
nerian music-drama  and  light  French  opera,  in  oratorio  and 
Lieder,  in  declamation  both  spoken  and  sung,  he  has  proved  him- 
self a  thoroughly  intellectual,  accomplished,  and  original  artist.

at  German  Lieder,  and  made  quite  a  hit  at  the 
Philharmonic  by  his  admirable  declamation  in  the 
'^Hans  Heiling''  air.  His  versatility  was  fur- 
ther demonstrated  by  a  number  of  translations  of 
French  lyrics,  all  very  neatly  and  smoothly  done. 
He  had  quite  a  passion  for  amateur  photography, 
and  loved  to  obtain  unconventional  pictures  of  all 
the  artistic  celebrities  who  would  consent  to  ^  ^  sit. ' ' 
Among  these  was  the  group  of  the  two  de  Eeszkes 
and  Lassalle  at  their  breakfast-table  at  the  Con- 
tinental, of  which  he  sent  me  a  copy  accompanied 
by  this  note: 


31  Linden  Gardens,  W.,  October  21,  1893. 
My  dear  Klein: 

I  send  you  per  same  post  a  print  (proof)  from  my 
negative,  ''Birds  of  a  Feather,"  with  every  compliment. 
I  shall  not  forget  that  it  was  through  you  and  in  your 
house  that  I  first  met  the  great  singers  who  have  since 
become  my  friends. 

It  is  an  extraordinary  coincidence,  I  think,  that  I 
should  have  put  down  for  my  part  in  the  "Pops"  this 
afternoon  (and  as  long  as  a  fortnight  ago)  four  of  my 
favorite  Gounod  songs. ^  Also  that  I  am  singing  at  the 
offertory  in  St.  George's,  Albemarle  Street,  to-morrow 
morning,  under  promise  a  fortnight  old,  the  same  mas- 
ter's ** There  is  a  green  hill." 

Faithfully  and  fraternally  yours, 

Eugene  Oudin. 

Alas!  only  eighteen  months  later  I  stood  in  the 
same    church   in   Albemarle    Street    grieving   be-

side  the  bier  of  that  sweet  singer  himself.  He 
had  fallen  a  victim  to  a  mistaken  sense  of  duty, 
literally  wearing  himself  to  death  by  nursing  a 
friend  who  lay  sick  in  his  house.  That  was  in- 
deed a  sad  and  premature  cutting  off  of  a  useful 
life.  I  had  spoken  to  Oudin  at  the  Birming- 
ham Festival  (October,  1894),  and  remarked  upon 
his  thin,  careworn  aspect.  Yet  how  beautifully 
he  had  sung  the  music  of  Br.  Marianus  in  the 
third  part  of  Schumann's  ^ ' Faust " !  It  was  all  he 
had  had  to  do  at  the  festival;  but  it  was  enough, 
he  had  made  his  mark.  Then  he  went  home,  and 
in  a  month's  time  was  no  more. 

The  premature  decease  of  Eugene  Oudin  is  al- 
ways associated  in  my  mind  with  that  of  Tschai- 
kowsky.  The  reason  lies  in  a  rather  curious 
chain  of  circumstances.  In  the  autumn  of  1892 
the  Russian  master 's  opera  ' '  Eugeny  Onegin ' '  was 
produced  in  English  at  the  Olympic  Theatre,  un- 
der the  management  of  Signor  Lago,  with  Eu- 
gene Oudin  in  the  title  part.  It  met  with  poor 
success,  and  after  a  few  nights  was  withdrawn.^ 
In  the  June  of  1893,  Tschaikowsky  came  to  Eng- 
land to  receive  the  honorary  degree  of '  ^  Mus.  Doc. ' ' 
at  Cambridge  University;  the  same  distinction 
being  simultaneously  bestowed  upon  three  other 
celebrated  musicians— Camille   Saint-Saens,   Max 

^  The  whole  undertaking  was  ill-timed  and  ill-placed.  One  of 
its  few  creditable  features  was  the  debut  in  England  of  the  bary- 
tone Mario  Ancona,  who  sang  first  in  "La  Favorita ' '  and  after- 
ward in  ' '  Lohengrin. ' '  He  was  engaged  the  following  season 
for  Covent  Garden.

Yet,  had  there  been  nothing  else,  this  venture 
would  have  been  remarkable  on  account  of  the 
unusual  number  of  American  singers  who  made 
their  debuts  in  the  two  operas.  Many  of  them 
subsequently  were  to  earn  wide  repute,  while  two 
at  least—Eugene  Oudin  and  David  Bispham— 
were  to  achieve  universal  fame.  I  can  recall  few 
instances  of  a  popularity  so  spontaneous  as  that 
vouchsafed  to  Eugene  Esperance  Oudin.  Alike 
as  artist  and  as  man  he  rapidly  became  a  gen- 
eral favorite.  Among  his  warmest  admirers 
was  Jean  de  Eeszke;  and  I  remember  how  pro- 
foundly he  interested  the  famous  tenor  by  his 
exquisite  mezza  voce,  his  perfect  union  of  the 
'^registers,"  and  the  rare  ease  with  which  he  pro- 
duced his  upper  notes.  His  voice  was  singularly 
sweet  and  sympathetic  in  quality,  yet  not  lack- 
ing in  dramatic  power;  and  none  who  saw  him 
as  the  Templar  will  readily  forget  the  extraor- 
dinary dignity  of  his  assumption  or  the  intense 
passion  of  his  singing.  His  rendering  of  the  fine 
air,  ^^Woo  thou  thy  Snowflake,''  was  to  my  mind 
the  vocal  feature  of  the  opera. 

Oudin  had  made  himself  a  name  both  as  a 
church  singer  and  in  opera  before  leaving  the 
United  States;  but  in  London  he  seems  at  once 
to  have  risen  to  a  higher  plane,  for  there  was 
need  just  then  of  a  barytone  possessing  his  special 
gifts.  Thanks  to  his  parentage,  he  had  a  pure 
French  accent,  and  sang  delightfully  in  that 
tongue.     He  also  worked  for  some  time  with  me

Bnich,  and  Arrigo  Boito.  By  a  happy  chance 
I  traveled  down  to  Cambridge  in  the  same  car- 
riage with  Tschaikowsky.  I  was  quite  alone  in 
the  compartment  until  the  train  was  actually 
starting,  when  the  door  opened  and  an  elderly 
gentleman  was  unceremoniously  lifted  in,  his 
luggage  being  bundled  in  after  him  by  the  por- 
ters. A  glance  told  me  who  it  was.  I  offered 
my  assistance,  and,  after  he  had  recovered  his 
breath,  the  master  told  me  he  recollected  that 
I  had  been  presented  to  him  one  night  at  the 
Philharmonic.  Then  followed  an  hour's  delight- 
ful conversation. 

Tschaikowsky  chatted  freely  about  music  in 
Russia.  He  thought  the  development  of  the  past 
twenty-five  years  had  been  phenomenal.  He  at- 
tributed it,  first,  to  the  intense  musical  feeling  of 
the  people  which  was  now  coming  to  the  sur- 
face; secondl}^,  to  the  extraordinary  wealth  and 
characteristic  beauty  of  the  national  melodies  or 
folk-songs ;  and,  thirdly,  to  the  splendid  work  done 
by  the  great  teaching  institutions  at  St.  Petersburg 
and  Moscow.  He  spoke  particularly  of  his  own 
Conservatory  at  Moscow,  and  begged  that  if  I 
ever  went  to  that  city  I  would  not  fail  to  pay  him 
a  visit.^  He  then  put  some  questions  about  Eng- 
land and  inquired  especially  as  to  the  systems 
of  management  and  teaching  pursued  at  the  Royal 

^  I  did  visit  Moscow  in  the  summer  of  1898,  and,  on  presenting 
my  card  as  an  English  friend  of  the  lamented  master,  was  re- 
ceived by  the  Conservatory  officials  with  every  attention  and 
cordiality.

Academy  and  the  Royal  College.    I  duly  explained, 
and  also  gave  him  some  information  concerning 
the  Guildhall  School  of  Music  and  its  three  thou- 
sand students.    It  surprised  him  to  hear  that  Lon- 
don possessed  such  a  gigantic  musical  institution. 
*'I  don't  know,"  he  added,  ^^ whether  to  con- 
sider   England    an    ^unmusical'    nation    or    not. 
Sometimes  I  think  one  thing,  sometimes  another. 
But  it  is  certain  that  you  have  audiences  for  mu- 
sic of  every  class,  and  it  appears  to  me  probable 
that  before  long  the  larger  section  of  your  public 
will  support  the  best  class  only. ' '    Then  the  recol- 
lection of  the  failure  of  his  ^^Eugeny  Onegin'^ 
occurred  to  him,  and  he  asked  me  to  what  I  at- 
tributed that— the  music,  the  libretto,  the  perform- 
ance, or  what?     I  replied,  without  flattery,  that 
it  was  certainly  not  the  music.    It  might  have  been 
due  in  some  measure  to  the  lack  of  dramatic  fibre 
in  the  story,  and  in  a  large  degree  to  the  ineffi- 
ciency of  the  interpretation  and  the  unsuitability 
of  the  locale.     ^  ^  Remember, ' '  I  went  on,  ^Hhat 
Pushkin's  poem  is  not  known  in  this  country,  and 
that  in  opera  we  like  a  definite  denouement,  not 
an  ending  where  the  hero  goes  out  at  one  door  and 
the  heroine  at  another.     As  to  the  performance, 
the  only  figure  in  it  that  lives  distinctly  and  pleas- 
antly in  my  memory  is  Eugene  Oudin's  superb 
embodiment  of  Onegin/' 

^^1  have  heard  a  great  deal  about  him,"  said 
Tschaikowsky ;  and  then  came  a  first-rate  opportu- 
nity for  me  to  descant  upon  the  merits  of  the.

American  barytone.  I  aroused  the  master's  in- 
terest in  him  to  such  good  purpose  that  he  prom- 
ised not  to  leave  England  without  making  his 
acquaintance,— ^^  and  hearing  him  singf  I  queried. 
^^Not  only  will  I  hear  him  sing,  but  invite  him  to 
come  to  Russia  and  ask  him  to  sing  some  of  my 
songs  there,''  was  the  composer's  reply  as  the 
train  drew  up  at  Cambridge,  and  we  alighted. 
Tschaikowsky  was  to  be  the  guest  of  the  Master 
of  Merton,  and  I  undertook  to  see  him  safely  be- 
stowed at  the  college  before  proceeding  to  my  hotel. 
Telling  the  flyman  to  take  a  slightly  circuitous 
route,  I  pointed  out  various  places  of  interest  as  we 
passed  them,  and  Tschaikowsky  seemed  thor- 
oughly to  enjoy  the  drive.  When  we  parted  at 
the  college,  he  shook  me  warmly  by  the  hand  and 
expressed  a  hope  that  when  he  next  visited  Eng- 
land he  might  see  more  of  me.  Unhappily,  that 
kindly  wish  was  never  to  be  fulfilled. 

The  group  of  new  ^^Mus.  Docs."  was  to  have  in- 
cluded Verdi  and  Grieg,  but  these  composers  were 
unable  to  accept  the  invitation  of  the  University. 
However,  the  remaining  four  constituted  a  suffi- 
ciently illustrious  group,  and  the  concert  at  the 
Cambridge  Guildhall  was  of  memorable  interest. 
Saint-Saens  played  for  the  first  time  the  brilliant 
pianoforte  fantasia  ^^ Africa,"  which  he  had  lately 
written  at  Cairo;  Max  Bruch  directed  a  choral 
scene  from  his  *^ Odysseus";  and  Boi'to  conducted 
the  prologue  from  ^  ^  Mefistof ele, "  Georg  Henschel 
singing  the  solo  part.    Finally,  Tschaikowsky  di-

reeled  the  first  performance  in  England  of  his 
fine  symphonic  poem,  ^^Francesca  da  Rimini,''  a 
work  depicting  with  graphic  power  the  torment- 
ing winds  wherein  Dante  beholds  Francesca  in  the 
'^Second  Circle"  and  hears  her  recital  of  her 
sad  story,  as  described  in  the  fifth  canto  of  the 
^ ^Inferno.''  The  ovation  that  greeted  each  mas- 
ter in  turn  will  be  readily  imagined.  A  night  or 
two  later  I  met  Boito  at  a  reception  given  in  his 
honor  by  my  friend  Albert  Visetti,  and  the  re- 
nowned librettist-composer  did  me  the  pleasure  of 
accompanying  me  to  the  last  Philharmonic  con- 
cert of  the  season,  at  which  Max  Bruch  conducted 
a  couple  of  works  and  Paderewski  played  his 
concerto  in  A  minor. 

Tschaikowsky  and  Eugene  Oudin  duly  met. 
The  latter  sang  the  ^'Serenade  de  Don  Juan" 
and  other  songs  of  the  Russian  master,  and  so 
delighted  him  that  the  visit  to  St.  Petersburg  and 
Moscow  was  immediately  arranged.  Its  success 
and  its  attendant  sorrow  are  alike  set  forth  in  the 
following  letter: 


Hotel  de  France,  St.  Petersburg, 

November  8,  1893. 
My  dear  Klein: 

You  have,  of  course,  read  and  commented  on  the  ter- 
ribly sudden  demise  of  Tschaikowsky.  You  can  imagine 
its  effect  on  me !  I  missed  him  in  Petersburg  on  my  way 
to  Moscow,  and  there  received  his  message  that  he  would 
not  fail  to  be  present  at  my  debut  in  the  latter  city. 
Instead  came   a   telegram   of   sudden  sickness,   danger

throughout  Russia  are  in  mourning,  and  the  concert 
which  was  to  have  been  my  debut  in  Petersburg  (next 
Saturday,  the  11th)  is  postponed  for  a  week.  It  will  be 
made  up  entirely  of  works  of  the  dead  master.  I  shall 
sing  the  '^ Arioso"  from  "Onegin"  and  some  of  his 
romances,  and  the  joint  recital  will  take  place  the  fol- 
lowing day.^ 

So  my  visit  here  is  prolonged  most  unexpectedly. 

My  debut  in  Moscow  was  a  magnificent  success.  I 
was  recalled  and  encored  again  and  again,  .  .  .  and  the 
notices  are  very  fine. 

Yours  in  haste,  but  ever  fraternally, 

Eugene  Oudin. 

And  now  to  return  to  1891.  So  far  I  have  spoken 
only  of  ^^Ivanhoe^'  and  ^^La  Basoche."  At  Co- 
vent  Garden  we  had  the  heaviest  opera  season 
on  record.  Twenty  operas  were  mounted,  none 
of  them  novelties,  but  six  for  the  first  time  under 
Harris's  directorate;  and  ninety-four  representa- 
tions were  given  in  sixteen  weeks.  The  total  re- 
ceipts amounted  to  £80,000  ($400,000),  and  the 
impresario  made  a  profit.  It  is  interesting  to  note 
how  the  repertory  and  the  personnel  were  begin- 

^  Oudin  was  accompanied  on  this  trip  by  his  wife,  a  talented 
singer  who  frequently  appeared  with  him  at  his  London  recitals, 
but  who,  on  the  death  of  her  husband,  relinquished  her  career  as  a 
vocalist  and  became  a  teacher.

ning  to  settle  down  into  the  mold  or  formula  with 
which  the  American  public  was  soon  to  become 
so  familiar.  Take  the  operas— twelve  perform- 
ances of  ^^ Faust";  nine  of  ^'Lohengrin'';  eight 
each  of  ^^Les  Huguenots'^  and  ''Romeo  et  Juli- 
ette'';  seven  of  ''Carmen";  six  of  "Orfeo";  five 
each  of  "Don  Giovanni,"  " Tannhauser, "  and 
"Rigoletto";  four  of  "Otello"  (with  Jean  de 
Reszke  in  the  title-role),  "Traviata"  and  "Ma- 
non";  three  of  "Le  Prophete"  and  "Mireille"; 
two  of  " Mefistof ele, "  "Die  Meistersinger, "  "Lu- 
cia," "Martha,"  and  "Aida";  and  (poor  Bee- 
thoven!) one  of  "Fidelio."  Again,  among  the  fif- 
teen new-comers  of  the  season  were  Emma  Eames, 
Sybil  Sanderson,  Van  Dyck,  and  PlauQon,  form- 
ing part  of  a  company  of  no  fewer  than  forty  ar- 
tists, which  included  Jean  and  Edouard  de  Reszke, 
Lassalle,  Maurel,  Ravelli,  Devoyod,  Isnardon,  and 
Montariol;  with  Nordica,  Melba,  Albani,  Zelie  de 
Lussan,  Rolla,  Regina  Pinkert,  Bauermeister,  Giu- 
lia  Ravogli,  and  the  French  contralto  Mme.  Ri- 
chard. Altogether  a  very  remarkable  collection, 
and  in  its  make-up  thoroughly  suggestive  of  the 
Metropolitan  Opera  House,  New  York. 

On  the  second  night  of  the  season  (April  7) 
Emma  Eames  made  her  London  debut  as  Margue- 
rite in  "Faust,"  that  being  her  first  appearance  on 
any  stage  save  the  Paris  Opera,  where  she  had 
been  a  favorite  for  the  two  preceding  years.  Her 
singularly  rich,  flexible  soprano  voice,  her  refined 
and  expressive  singing,  and  her  graceful  bearing

won  for  her  warm  admiration  and  instantaneous 
success.  She  looked  Goethe's  heroine  to  the  life, 
and  her  conception  of  the  character  charmed  alike 
by  its  naturalness  and  its  tender  womanly  feeling. 
Four  nights  later  she  essayed  the  part  of  Elsa,  for 
the  first  time,  to  the  Lohengrin  of  Jean  de  Reszke, 
and  again  succeeded  in  creating  a  highly  favorable 
impression.  Later  on  she  made  a  hit  as  Juliette 
and  gave  a  delightful  rendering  of  the  music  of 
Mireille,  both  of  which  characters  she  had  studied 
under  the  personal  guidance  of  Gounod.  Her  Mi- 
reille was,  I  recollect,  a  particularly  captivating 
performance,  and  it  is  perhaps  a  little  odd  that  it 
should  not  have  subsequently  filled  a  more  con- 
spicuous place  in  the  repertoire  of  this  talented 
American  artist. 

Equally  unprecedented  was  the  amount  of  op- 
eratic work  done  in  the  autumn.  Besides  D'Oyly 
Carte's  hapless  enterprise,  a  French  season  was 
given  by  Augustus  Harris  at  Covent  Garden  with 
the  concours  of  artists  of  the  Paris  Opera-Co- 
mique,  comprising  the  graceful  Mile.  Simonnet, 
that  fine  singer  Mme.  Deschamps-Jehin,  M.  En- 
gel,  M.  Bouvet,  and  M.  Lorrain.  They  gave  for 
the  first  time  there  Alfred  Bruneau's  clever  opera, 
^'Le  Reve,''  and  Gounod's  ^'Philemon  et  Baucis." 
Yet  a  third  venture  was  an  Italian  season  given 
by  Signor  Lago  at  the  Shaftesbury  Theatre.  This 
was  notable  chiefly  for  the  first  production  in 
England  of  Pietro  Mascagni's  ^^Cavalleria  Rus- 
ticana,"  which,  I  need  scarcely  say,  created  a  sen- 


354

sation.  The  performance  (conducted  by  Arditi) 
was  not  to  be  compared  with  those  subsequently 
heard  at  the  leading  opera-house,  but  it  served; 
and  the  fame  of  the  young  Italian  composer 
spread  with  marvelous  rapidity.  It  should  be 
noted  that  Marie  Brema  here  made  a  modest  but 
effective  debut  in  opera  as  Lola;  while  the  cast 
further  comprised  Adelaide  Musiani  (Santuzza), 
Grace  Damian  (Lucia) y  Brombara  {Alfio),  and 
Francesco  Vignas  (Turiddu). 

These  artists  gave  a  performance  of  ' '  Cavalleria 
Eusticana''  before  Queen  Victoria  in  the  Water- 
loo Chamber  at  Windsor  Castle  on  November  25, 
1891.  Her  Majesty  was  greatly  impressed  by 
the  new  opera,  and  in  the  following  summer,  after 
Mme.  Emma  Calve  had  made  her  London  debut 
as  Mascagni's  Sicilian  heroine,  the  Queen  com- 
manded her  to  sing  at  Windsor,  together  with  the 
tenor  De  Lucia;  Signor  Tosti  being  at  the  piano. 
The  two  artists  gave  a  selection  from  ^^Caval- 
leria,'' and,  by  Her  Majesty's  permission,  went 
through  their  scene  with  action  and  gestures  pre- 
cisely as  though  they  were  performing  it  upon  the 
stage.  So  earnestly  did  they  throw  themselves 
into  their  parts,  and  with  such  characteristic  sen- 
timent did  they  sing,  that  the  venerable  sovereign 
was  deeply  touched,  and  presented  the  artists  with 
handsome  mementos  before  they  left  the  castle. 
I  may  note,  by  the  way,  that  ^^  Cavalleria  Rusti- 
cana"  was  first  performed  in  English  by  the  Carl 
Rosa  Company  at  Liverpool  on  January  14,  1892. 


355 


Thirty  Years  of 


This  same  winter  season  was  marked  by  ope- 
ratic events  of  the  greatest  import  to  the  United 
States.  Encouraged  by  his  previous  successes, 
Henry  Abbey  determined  to  do  things  on  a  yet 
grander  scale,  and,  with  the  aid  of  new  associates, 
launched  out  upon  a  double  enterprise  of  for- 
midable magnitude.  One  of  those  associates  was 
destined  thereafter  to  play  an  important  part  in  the 
direction  of  opera  on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic— 
I  refer  to  Maurice  Grau.  For  the  moment  Abbey 
held  the  guiding  reins,  and  nobody  knew  exactly 
how  much  he  owed  to  the  energy  and  tact  of  his 
junior  partner.  At  the  same  time,  the  experience 
earned  by  Maurice  Grau  during  this  period  was 
of  inestimable  value  to  him.  He  became  familiar 
with  the  countless  nuances  of  operatic  manage- 
ment; he  acquired  his  characteristic  habit  of 
blunt,  straightforward  dealing  with  artists  of 
every  rank;  he  developed  his  excellent  business 
qualities,  and  learned  the  knack  of  gauging  to  a 
nicety  the  requirements  of  public  taste.  A  finer 
practical  schooling  in  the  delicate  duties  of  an 
impresario  could  not  possibly  have  been  devised. 
Nor  could  anything  have  been  more  timely. 

For  the  moment  had  now  arrived  when  the 
American  manager  was  to  keep  in  closer  touch 
with  the  London  stage;  when  the  ^^ tricks  and 
manners''  of  Covent  Garden  were  to  be  immedi- 
ately imitated  at  the  Metropolitan  Opera  House; 
when  the  same  collections  of  artists  and  works 
were  to   serve  for  both  countries.     The  double

venture  run  by  Abbey  consisted  of  a  big  series  of 
Patti  concerts  and  a  five  months'  season  of  grand 
opera  with  a  company  headed  by  Jean  de  lieszke. 
The  renowned  prima  donna  awakened,  as  usual, 
the  utmost  enthusiasm.  At  each  concert  a  scene, 
in  costume,  from  an  opera  was  given,  Mme.  Patti 
being  supported  by  Del  Puente,  Novara,  and  other 
artists,  with  Arditi  as  conductor.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  debuts  in  America  of  Jean  and  Edouard 
de  Reszke  were  at  the  outset  more  successful  in 
an  artistic  than  a  financial  sense.  It  seems  to 
have  taken  time  for  the  public  to  realize  that  in 
the  new  Polish  tenor  a  really  great  artist  had 
come  upon  the  scene.  A  small  section  of  the  press 
also  appears  to  have  hesitated,  though  not  the 
leading  critics  of  New  York  and  Chicago,  who 
quickly  proclaimed  the  advent  of  a  star  of  the  first 
magnitude.  That  M.  de  Reszke  himself  was,  on 
the  whole,  gratified  by  his  reception  may  be  gath- 
ered from  the  following  letter:

Auditorium  Hotel,  Chicago, 

December  9,  1891. 
My  dear  Friend  : 

I  beg  to  inclose  some  press  cuttings  from  this  place  in 
order  that  you  may  learn  of  the  success  of  your  friends 
in  America.  I  have  sung  twice  in  '^ Lohengrin,"  twice  in 
''Faust,"  twice  in  the  "Huguenots,"  once  in  "Romeo," 
twice  in  "Otello,"  and  once  in  "Lohengrin"  at  Louis- 
ville.   That  makes  ten  representations  in  a  month.    The

public  is  very  warm,  very  enthusiastic  toward  us. 
Edouard,  for  his  part,  besides  the  operas  with  me,  has 
sung  Leporello  and  in  ' '  Sonnambula. "  You  would 
confer  on  us  a  great  pleasure  by  showing  the  cuttings  to 
Harris,  to  Higgins,  and  to  your  colleagues,  in  order  that 
London  may  know  how  the  artists  of  its  choice  have  been 
winning  honors  here.  I  sing  to-morrow  *'Aida,"  with 
Lilli  Lehmann,  for  my  farewell  in  this  city;  then  on 
Thursday  I  leave  for  New  York,  where  I  am  to  make  my 
debut  on  Monday  in  ' '  Romeo. ' '  Trusting  you  are  in  good 
health,  with  a  hearty  hand-shake,  believe  me. 
Your  devoted  and  ever  grateful, 

Jean  de  Reszke. 

In  New  York  the  brothers  were  met  by  their 
friend  Lassalle,  who  made  his  first  appearance 
as  Nelusko  in  ^  ^  L 'Af ricaine ' ' ;  while,  as  Selika, 
Lillian  Nordica  also  rejoined  the  company  and  her 
former  comrades.  That  night  was  the  most  bril- 
liant of  the  season,  and  the  cable  messages  to 
Europe  told  of  unequivocal  success  all  round. 
Yet  the  ' '  business, ' '  it  appeared,  was  by  no  means 
first-rate,  and,  in  the  end,  the  entrepreneurs  must 
have  fared  but  moderately.  The  revanche,  how- 
ever, was  to  come  in  the  succeeding  years,  when 
the  American  public  knew  Jean  de  Reszke  better 
and  learned  to  appreciate  the  true  majesty  of 
his  transcendent  gifts.  He,  for  his  part,  quickly 
reciprgcated  the  warm  feeling  shown  him  by 
American  audiences,  and  would  frequently  assure 
me  how  profoundly  he  esteemed  their  good  opin- 
ion.    To  show  this  I  quote  an  interesting  letter

he  wrote  me  from  Chicago  in  1894,  immediately 
after  the  production  of  Massenet's  ^^Werther^': 

[Translated  from  the  French.] 

Chicago,  March  31,  1894. 
My  dear  Friend: 

In  an  artist's  life  every  new  role  is  a  stage  in  that 
long  journey  toward  the  summits  of  art,  toward  the 
beautiful,  the  infinite.  ''Werther,"  the  other  night, 
was  for  me  one  of  those  unanimous  successes  wherein 
the  heart — the  science  of  causing  it  to  beat  in  one's  audi- 
ence and  before  one's  audience — stood  in  true  proportion 
to  every  artifice.  The  true  path — that  of  emotion — that 
goal  for  which  I  am  striving  all  my  life — was  reached 
in  the  presence  of  a  public  which  did  not  understand 
the  words,  but  which  divined  by  instinct  that  my  con- 
ception of  the  character  arose  from  that  simplicity,  that 
pure,  unexaggerated  truthfulness  which  age  and  matur- 
ity alone  can  confer  upon  the  thinking  artist.  .  .  . 
I  am  sending  you  the  cuttings  from  the  newspapers 
here ;  show  them  to  Harris,  who,  I  hope,  will  mount  the 
opera  for  me.  Mancinelli  conducted  the  orchestra  ad- 
mirably. Eames  and  Arnoldson  are  two  adorable  little 
sisters.  In  a  word,  I  believe  that  to  the  cultivated 
London  public,  accustomed  as  it  is  to  novelties,  it  will 
come  as  a  delightful  surprise.  I  sing  regularly  three 
times  every  week,  and  my  voice  is  excellent.  At  this 
present  moment  I  am  reaching  my  forty-first  perform- 
ance. Accept,  my  dear  friend,  from  Edouard  and  my- 
self, a  thousand  affectionate  remembrances,  together 
with  a  hearty  shake  of  the  hand. 

Your  devoted, 

Jean  de  Reszke.

Three  montlis  later,  Harris  did  mount  **Wer- 
ther"  at  Covent  Garden,  with  the  Chicago  cast,  for 
the  rentree  of  Jean  de  Reszke ;  but  the  opera  failed 
to  please.  Not  even  the  genius  of  the  artist  could 
invest  with  enduring  interest  a  work  consistently 
sombre,  undramatic,  and  dull.  Yet,  taken  indi- 
vidually, his  impersonation  was,  in  its  way,  one 
of  the  supreme  achievements  of  his  career.  His 
voice  at  this  period  was  at  its  very  finest;  nor 
shall  I  ever  forget  his  wonderful  singing  and  act- 
ing in  the  duet  of  the  third  act,  where  ^^his  beau- 
tiful tones  fairly  compassed  the  entire  gamut  of 
passionate  longing  and  despair.''

"/^HI  va  piano  va  sano,  ed  anche  lontano."  The 
\y  old  Italian  proverb  applies  with  some  force 
to  the  progress  made  by  Sir  Augustus  Harris 
toward  the  development  of  the  important  branch 
of  opera  which  yet  awaited  his  attention.  The 
popularity  of  French  opera  in  the  French  lan- 
guage would  seem  to  have  been  the  natural  step- 
ping-stone to  Geiman  opera  in  the  German  lan- 
guage. But  I  am  not  quite  sure  that  Harris  found 
his  subscribers  as  ready  as  he  himself  was  to  risk 
the  step.  Annual  pilgrimages  to  Bayreuth  had 
not  yet  become  a  favorite  amusement  of  the 
British  aristocracy.  Lady  de  Grey  and  her 
friends  were  said  to  be  inclined  to  look  askance 
at  any  proposition  for  the  enlargement  of  the 
opera  scheme  beyond  the  lines  which  had  hitherto 
proved  so  successful.  However,  it  is  to  be  pre- 
sumed that  the  opposition,  if  there  was  any  worth 


Thirty  Years  of 


speaking  of,  speedily  broke  down;  for  in  the 
early  spring  of  1892  the  impresario  boldly  an- 
nounced his  intention  of  giving  a  series  of  Ger- 
man performances  at  Covent  Garden  in  mid-sea- 
son, with  the  aid  of  a  special  troupe  of  German 
artists  engaged  through  the  medium  of  the  Ham- 
burg manager,  Herr  Pollini. 

By  the  press  and  the  public  this  intimation  was 
received  with  such  unqualified  satisfaction  that 
Sir  Augustus  immediately  followed  it  up  with  a 
further  announcement  to  the  effect  that  he  would 
set  apart  seven  Wednesdays  in  June  and  July 
for  a  subsidiary  subscription,  covering  perform- 
ances of  * '  Der  Ring  des  Nibelungen, ' '  with  ^  ^  Tris- 
tan und  Isolde''  and  ^^Fidelio."  This  was  an 
adroit  move.  Wednesday  was  not  yet  a  regular 
subscription  night  at  the  opera,  and  by  thus  util- 
izing it  Harris  not  only  secured  a  perfect  guar- 
antee against  loss,  but  offered  his  German  sup- 
porters the  opportunity  of  displaying  themselves 
in  grand-  and  pit-tier  boxes,  which  they  could  not 
otherwise  have  obtained  for  love  or  money.  The 
bait  was  greedily  seized  and  a  splendid  subscrip- 
tion resulted. 

Ultimately,  too,  the  company  engaged  for  these 
representations  proved  worthy  of  the  establish- 
ment to  which  it  became  temporarily  allied.  I 
was  vQry  anxious  to  see  Richter  filling  the  conduc- 
tor's place,  and  at  my  suggestion  Harris  made 
an  effort  to  obtain  the  great  man's  services.  But 
in  vain;  he  was  already  definitely  engaged  for 

364 


Musical  Life  in  London 


the  concerts  of  the  forthcoming  Musical  Exhibi- 
tion at  Vienna.  In  these  circumstances,  Herr 
Pollini  recommended  a  young  conductor  named 
Mahler,  who  had  been  doing  excellent  work  at 
Hamburg.  Harris  at  once  made  terms  with  him; 
and  thus  for  a  single  season  did  London  afford 
hospitality  to  the  talented  musician  who  was 
shortly  after  to  succeed  Hans  Kichter  as  chef- 
d'orchestre,  and  eventually  to  become  director,  of 
the  Imperial  Opera  House  at  Vienna. 

It  was  arranged  that  Mahler  should  come  early 
in  the  season.  Ten  years  had  elapsed  since  the 
^^Ring"  or  any  section  of  it  had  been  performed 
in  a  London  opera-house,  and  in  order  not  to 
interfere  with  the  other  work  it  was  deemed  ad- 
visable to  procure  a  separate  orchestra  to  rehearse 
and  accompany  the  Wagner  music-dramas.  I 
made  Mahler's  acquaintance  soon  after  his  arri- 
val. Smaller  of  stature  than  Anton  Seidl,  his 
clean-shaven,  studious  countenance  nevertheless 
reminded  me  of  the  accomplished  conductor 
whom  I  had  seen  at  Her  Majesty's  in  1882;  nor 
was  he  unworthy  to  be  compared  with  him  in 
temperamental  qualities,  well-balanced  force,  and 
rare  concentration  of  energy.  For  a  man  who 
knew  so  very  little  English,  I  never  came  across 
any  one  so  bent  on  speaking  that  language  and 
no  other.  I  met  Mahler  frequently  at  Harris's 
office,  but  could  never  induce  him  to  carry  on  a  con- 
versation in  German.  He  would  rather  spend  f^YO^ 
minutes  in  an  effort  to  find  the  English  word  he 

365 


Thirty  Years  of 


wanted  than  resort  to  his  mother  tongue  or  allow 
any  one  else  to  supply  the  equivalent.  Consequently, 
a  short  chat  with  Mahler  involved  a  liberal  allow- 
ance of  time.  For  the  same  reason,  his  orchestral 
rehearsals  proved  extremely  lengthy  and,  to  the 
spectator,  vastly  amusing.  In  order  to  famil- 
iarize his  men  with  their  exacting  task,  he  would 
take  his  band  in  sections,  and  sj^end  hour  after 
hour  going  over  the  various  scenes  of  the  tetral- 
ogy and  ^'Tristan.''  He  knew  his  scores  virtu- 
ally by  heart,  and  infused  into  his  executants  that 
unity  of  spirit  which  only  a  born  conductor  can 
inspire.  So  it  came  about  that  the  performances 
given  under  his  direction  were  distinguished  by  a 
highly  creditable  excellence  of  ensemble. 

Absurd  as  it  may  seem,  the  ' '  Nibelungen ' '  dra- 
mas were  given  out  of  their  proper  order  because 
a  certain  great  Bayreuth  artist  insisted  upon  mak- 
ing his  English  debut  in  a  particular  character. 
Herr  Max  Alvary  wished  to  be  seen  for  the  first 
time  here  in  his  fine  impersonation  of  Siegfried; 
consequently,  we  had  to  have  ^'Siegfried''  first; 
then  ^^Eheingold''  and  ^  ^  Walkiire, ' '  and  then 
^  ^  Gotterdammerung ' '  to  wind  up  with.  I  know 
not  whom  to  blame  the  more,  Alvarv  for  demand- 
ing  such  a  piece  of  vandalism,  or  Harris  for  al- 
lowing it;  but  in  either  case  ^^de  mortuis  nil  nisi 
bonum,"  and  there  I  halt.  Certainly  Alvary  was 
an  ide'al  Siegfried;  and  he  had  no  less  an  ideal 
Briinnhilde  in  Rosa  Sucher,  who  unfortunately 
was  recalled  to  Germany  after  a  night  or  two.

Her  place  was  taken  by  the  gifted  and  lamented 
Frau  Klafsky,  whom  I  admired  as  a  truly  great 
Wagnerian  artist.  Other  notable  debutantes  were 
the  pojoular  Frau  Schumann-Heink,  Fraulein 
Bettaque,  Frau  Ende-Andriessen,  Fraulein  Traub- 
mann,  beside  Greve,  Lieban  (inimitable  Mime), 
and  Zoltan  Dome,  who  shared  the  leading  roles 
with  the  veterans  Reiehmann  and  Wiegand. 

So  extensively  did  these  German  representa- 
tions draw  that  Sir  Augustus  determined  to  give 
some  of  them  on  off-nights  at  Drury  Lane,  mov- 
ing the  scenery  back  and  forth  from  one  house 
to  the  other.  The  device  paid  him  well,  and,  be- 
side the  Wagner  works,  he  added  to  his  repertory 
Nessler's  ^'Trompeter  von  Sakkingen,''  with 
Eeichmann,  Wiegand,  Lorent,  Landau,  Bettaque, 
and  Schumann-Heink  in  the  principal  parts.  Al- 
together the  experiment  proved  a  complete  suc- 
cess, and  set  at  rest  all  doubts  as  to  the  wis- 
dom and  desirability  of  mixing  the  undiluted 
German  with  those  other  operatic  elements  which 
Sir  Augustus  Harris  (dropping  the  traditional 
^'Italian'')  had  this  season  for  the  first  time  com- 
bined under  the  new  official  title  of  ^  ^  Royal  Opera, 
Covent  Garden." 

Relieved  of  his  shrieval  duties,  the  genial  im- 
presario now  set  to  work  to  beat  all  previous  rec- 
ords ;  and  he  fairly  accomplished  the  task.  Apart 
from  the  German  venture,  he  produced  no  fewer 
than  three  novelties,  viz.:  Mascagni's  ^^L'Amico 
Fritz,"    Bemberg's    ** Elaine,"    and    Isidore    de 

369 


Thirty  Years  of 


Lara's  *^ Light  of  Asia/'  this  last  being  an  Ital- 
ianized stage  version  of  a  setting,  in  cantata  form, 
of  portions  of  Sir  Edwin  Arnold's  poem.  None 
of  these  earned  more  than  passing  favor,  albeit 
^^L'Amico  Fritz,"  in  virtue  of  Mascagni's  charm- 
ing treatment  of  a  delicious  pastoral  story  and 
Calve 's  exquisite  embodiment  of  Suzel,  deserved 
a  better  fate.  But  not  even  the  united  efforts  of 
Jean  de  Reszke,  Plangon,  Melba,  and  Deschamps- 
Jehin  could  awaken  more  than  a  shadowy  interest 
in  M.  Bemberg's  saccharine  opera.  The  general 
repertory  was  much  the  same  as  in  the  previous 
year,  only  more  extensive;  while  lingual  incon- 
gruities were  perhaps  more  flagrant  than  ever. 
For  example,  we  would  hear  in  alternation  the 
*^ Flying  Dutchman"  in  Italian  (with  Lassalle  as 
Vanderdecken) ;  ^ ' Tannhauser "  in  German;  ^^Lo- 
hengrin" in  Italian  (Van  Dyck  singing  the  title- 
role  in  French) ;  an  English  opera,  ^^La  Luce  dell' 
Asia,"  in  Italian;  *^Le  Prophete"  in  French, 
with  an  Italian  chorus;  and  so  forth.  Evidently, 
this  feature  of  the  bad  traditions  of  old  had  yet 
to  be  improved;  but  in  other  respects  the  work 
done  and  the  progress  made  were  alike  remarkable. 
In  the  course  of  the  year  1892  Augustus  Harris 
mounted  at  Covent  Garden  and  Drury  Lane  the- 
atres as  many  as  thirty  operas,  giving  a  grand 
total  of  one  hundred  and  fifty  representations. 

In  the  midst  of  this  abnormally  busy  season, 
M.  Maurel  elected  to  deliver  a  lecture  at  the  Ly- 
ceum Theatre  on  ^'The  Application  of  Science  to 


370 


Musical  Life  in  London 


the  Arts  of  Speech  and  Song/'  It  was  partly  an 
amplification  of  a  conference  given  shortly  before 
at  Milan  and  published  at  Paris  under  the  title  of 
^^Le  Chant  renoue  par  la  Science/'  wherein  the 
distinguished  barytone  promised  a  book  that 
should  more  or  less  completely  revolutionize  the 
art  (or  ^'science")  of  singing.  For  that  book  an 
impatient  world  is  still  waiting.  The  lecture,  how- 
ever, duly  came  off,  and,  apart  from  mere  prom- 
ises, its  main  feature  proved  to  be  an  exceedingly 
virulent  tirade  against  the  coup  de  la  glotte}  This 
would  not  have  mattered  much  had  it  not  hap- 
pened that  Manuel  Garcia  himself  was  present, 
and  had  to  '^possess  his  soul  in  patience''  while 
M.  Maurel  executed  some  ridiculous  imitations  of 
what  he  considered  to  be  the  indispensable  vocal 
concomitants  of  the  coup  de  la  glotte— 2i  term  de- 
rided only  by  certain  Paris  teachers  who  have 
misunderstood  and  misdirected  its  use.  Age  and 
dignity  alike  compelled  Signor  Garcia  to  sit  still 
and  treat  with  silent  contempt  this  ill-timed  and 
unjustifiable  attack  upon  his  method.  When  the 
lecture  was  over,  however,  I  offered  him  the  col- 
ums  of  the  ^  ^  Sunday  Times "  as  a  medium  for  re- 
plying to  M.  Maurel 's  assertions.  On  the  spur  of 
the  moment,  he  accepted  and  sent  a  short  account 
of  the  lecture,  written  in  his  own  terse,  trenchant 
manner.  Then,  thinking  better  of  it,  he  decided 
not  to  take  any  personal  part  in  the  discussion,  and 
requested  me  not  to  print  his  *^copy." 

^  See  reference  to  this  subject  on  page  27. 


371 


Thirty  Years  of 


This  threw  the  onus  of  reply  upon  me;  and  the 
answer  proved  so  far  effectual  that  M.  Maurel 
was  moved  to  make  a  protest,  in  other  London 
papers,  against  any  contradiction  of  his  '^scien- 
tific argumentation,''  save  by  M.  Garcia  himself, 
and  not  even  then  unless  supported  by  something 
beyond  *' simple  denial."  Accordingly,  the  maes- 
tro then  consented  to  write  a  letter  to  the  '^  Sun- 
day Times, ' '  confirming  the  statement  that  he  had 
found  M.  MaurePs  illustrations  of  the  coup  de 
la  glotte  '^ extremely  exaggerated,"  but  declining 
that  gentleman's  invitation  to  discuss  the  subject- 
matter  of  his  lecture,  and  adding  that  '4t  would 
be  utterly  impossible  to  argue  upon  theories  which 
still  remain  to  be  revealed."  Here  the  incident 
closed,  and,  as  I  have  already  said,  the  singing 
world  is  still  awaiting  the  revelation  of  M.  Maurel 's 
precious  theories.  Meanwhile,  however,  there  are 
people  who  still  think  it  their  duty  to  assume  the 
Maurelesque  attitude,  and  boldly  impeach  a 
method  for  which  no  adequate  substitute,  real  or 
imaginary,  has  yet  been  found.  It  is  chiefly  with 
the  view  of  showing  the  hollowness  of  the  attacks 
occasionally  leveled  at  the  coup  de  la  glotte  that 
I  have  recalled  an  episode  which  otherwise  might 
have  been  allowed  to  dwell  in  oblivion. 

During  the  early  '^ nineties"  Sir  Augustus  Har- 
ris was  the  proprietor  of  the  *' Sunday  Times." 
For  some  time  he  had  been  bent  on  possessing  a 
newspaper,  and  would  have  actually  started  a  new 
one  on  his  own  account  had  it  not  happened  that

AS  CARMEN

the  old  weekly  came  into  the  market  once  more. 
I  was  responsible  for  his  buying  it,  and,  as  mat- 
ters turned  out,  neither  he  nor  I  had  occasion  to 
regret  the  step,  despite  the  obvious  delicacy  of  a 
position  which,  under  ordinary  conditions,  might 
have  involved  the  independence  of  a  critic.  I  am 
bound  to  say,  however,  that  Harris  allowed  me  my 
full  freedom;  and,  inasmuch  as  I  had  all  along 
been  an  ardent  supporter  of  his  enterprise,  my 
attitude  was  in  no  way  influenced  or  disturbed 
through  his  temporary  connection  with  the  paper. 
He  eventually  sold  it— for  exactly  the  same  sum, 
I  believe,  that  he  paid  for  it— to  the  present  pro- 
prietor, Mrs.  Frederic  Beer. 

During  the  winter  of  1892-93,  the  indefatigable 
impresario  revived  the  hal  masque  at  Co  vent  Gar- 
den, thus  furnishing  the  jeunesse  doree  of  the  Eng- 
lish metropolis  with  a  form  of  entertainment 
which  has  ever  since  been  keenly  appreciated  and 
regularly  kept  up.  It  is  a  common  saying  that  the 
English  take  their  pleasures  sadly;  but  I  may 
assert,  without  fear  of  contradiction,  that  these 
fancy-dress  balls  are  a  good  deal  less  artificial  and 
more  spontaneous  in  their  gaiety  than  the  bals- 
masques  held  in  the  opera-houses  in  Paris  and 
Brussels.  That,  I  admit,  is  about  all  there  is  to 
be  said  in  their  favor. 

It  was  during  the  same  winter  that  Clara  Butt 
made  her  first  appearance  in  public.  The  need 
for  a  new  concert  contralto  of  the  first  rank  had 
become  pressing.     Trebelli  had  died  suddenly  at 

375 


Thirty  Years  of 


Etretat  the  previous  summer ;  and  in  the  February 
of  1894  an  even  more  sudden  attack  of  heart  disease 
closed  the  career  of  Janet  Patey  as  she  was  leav- 
ing the  platform  at  a  concert  at  Sheffield.  It 
was  curious  that  midway  between  these  two  sad 
events  there  should  have  appeared  upon  the 
scene  the  artist  who,  whatever  her  vocal  attributes 
as  compared  with  those  of  her  gifted  predecessors, 
indisputably  holds  at  the  present  time  the  position 
of  leading  English  contralto. 

Miss  Clara  Butt  made  her  debut,  while  yet  a 
scholar  of  the  Koyal  College  of  Music,  in  a  per- 
formance of  Gluck's  '^Orpheus,''  given  by  the 
pupils  of  the  college  at  the  Lyceum  Theatre  in 
December,  1892.  Her  unusually  lofty  stature 
lent  to  the  embodiment  of  Orpheus  a  dignity  and 
impressiveness  that  were  at  least  equaled  by  the 
organ-like  sonority  and  volume  of  her  ample 
tones.  Then  she  could  neither  act  nor  sing; 
but  there  was  intelligence  in  her  work,  there 
was  an  evident  faculty  for  imitation,  and,  above 
all,  there  was  glorious  material  in  her  powerful, 
luscious  voice.  She  continued  her  studies  for 
some  time  in  London  and  afterward  in  Paris, 
striding  always  toward  popularity  by  a  ^' royal 
road'^  that  few  young  singers  are  fortunate 
enough  to  find.  To-day  she  is  a  much  improved 
vocalist,  well  up  in  the  traditions  of  oratorio, 
and  needing  only  complete  control  of  her  organ 
and  fuller  resources  of  expression  and  color  to 
attain  the  highest  level  of  artistic  efficiency.    Her

husband,  Kenneiiey  liumford,  has  a  sympathetic 
light  barytone  voice  with  a  style  marked  by  ad- 
mirable refinement  and  distinction. 

A  posthmnous  light  opera  by  Goring  Thomas, 
called  the  ^'Golden  Web,'^  ran  for  a  time  at  the 
Lyric  Theatre  in  the  spring  of  1893,  after  a  trial 
production  by  the  Carl  Rosa  Company  at  Liver- 
pool. It  was  a  charming  example  of  the  Auber 
school,  and  was  ably  conducted  by  Mr.  Herbert 
Bunning— himself  a  composer  of  recognized 
merit,  whose  opera  ^'La  Princesse  Osra'^  was  to 
be  mounted  at  Covent  Garden  nine  years  later. 
That  this  Englishman  will  one  day  make  a  big 
mark  in  the  world  of  music  I  instinctively  feel. 
His  is  a  singularly  graceful  talent,  and  of  orches- 
tral effects  he  is  a  consummate  master.  When  he 
comes  across  a  really  good  libretto  we  shall  per- 
chance discover  in  him  the  successor  to  Arthur 
Goring  Thomas.  Another  light-opera  debut  at 
this  period  was  that  of  the  clever  Spanish  pianist 
and  composer,  Senor  Albeniz,  who  conducted  his 
*' Magic  Opal"  during  a  run  of  considerable  du- 
ration. A  vastly  superior  work,  however,  was  his 
^'Pepita  Jimenez,''  an  exquisitely  poetic  opera 
founded  upon  Juan  Valera's  famous  novel  by 
Frank  B.  M.  Coutts.  I  witnessed  the  production 
of  ^^Pepita  Jimenez''  at  the  Liceo  Theatre,  Bar- 
celona, in  January,  1896,  and  admired  it  so  much 
that  I  often  wonder  why  the  little  chef-d'oeuvre 
has  traveled  no  farther. 

The  features  of  the  season  of  1893  were  the  first 


377 


Thirty  Years  of 


visits  to  London  of  Leoncavallo  and  Mascagni, 
and  the  production  there  of  their  respective  op- 
eras, ^'Pagliacci^'  and  ^'I  Rantzau.^'  The  fame 
of  Leoncavallo's  sensational  opera  had  preceded 
it,  and  the  public  expected  something  remarkable. 
They  were  not  disappointed.  I  have  rarely  seen 
an  audience  so  breathless  with  excitement  over 
the  development  of  an  opera  plot.  The  effect  of 
the  little  tragedy  was  augmented  by  the  burning 
intensity  of  De  Lucia,  whose  portrayal  of  the  hap- 
less Canio's  anguish  and  suffering  was  a  triumph 
of  realism.  His  touching  soliloquy  at  the  end  of 
the  first  act  was  delivered  with  an  abandonment 
of  feeling  that  completely  carried  away  his  audi- 
tors. Very  fine,  too,  was  Ancona's  rendering  of  the 
already  famous  Prologue;  deliciously  pure  and 
sweet  was  Melba's  vocalization  in  the  haUateUa 
for  Nedda;  excellent  were  the  new-comers  Rich- 
ard Green  and  Bonnard  as  Silvio  and  Peppe; 
while  Mancinelli's  conducting  left  not  a  ]3oint 
undiscerned  throughout.  Leoncavallo,  modest 
and  unassuming,  waited  quietly  in  the  background 
till  the  end,  and  then  had  to  be  forced  on  to  the 
stage  by  the  artists  to  acknowledge  the  ovation 
that  awaited  him.  This  was  quite  early  in  the 
season  (May  19),  and  Leoncavallo  remained  in 
London  for  several  weeks.  I  found  him  to  be 
a  man  of  great  culture  and  strong  intellect.  He  is 
a  poet  as  well  as  a  musician,  and  in  both  arts  he 
reveals  the  grasp  of  a  profound  thinker. 

Mascagni  belongs  to  a  different  type.    In  Leon-

cavalio  there  is  a  dash  of  the  refined  and  diplo- 
matic Frenchman;  in  the  composer  of  ^^Caval- 
leria  Kusticana''  one  perceives,  within  as  well  as 
without,  the  impulsiveness,  the  impetuosity,  the 
strong  racial  temperament  of  the  full-blooded 
Italian.  Quick  as  lightning  in  speech  and  gesture, 
excitable  to  the  last  degree,  Mascagni  carries  his 
heart  upon  his  sleeve,  making  no  effort,  appar- 
ently, either  to  conceal  his  sentiments  or  his 
thoughts.  Here,  plainly  stamped,  are  the  frank 
nature,  the  dogged  perseverance,  of  the  man  who, 
under  the  most  terribly  adverse  circumstances, 
was  able  to  compose  an  opera  which  exhales  the 
very  essence  of  warm  Southern  passion,  the  very 
breath  of  free  peasant  life,  the  very  spirit  of  Si- 
cilian jealousy  and  revenge.  Sordid  and  repul- 
sive the  story  is  and  always  must  be;  yet  the 
music  never  fails  to  lift  it  from  out  the  depths 
of  its  dramatic  coarseness,  and  imparts  to  it  a 
glamour  and  an  intensity  of  color  that  few  can  re- 
sist. More  than  once  has  Mascagni  told  the  tale 
of  the  pecuniary  worries  and  the  physical  suffer- 
ings that  he  and  his  family  underwent  while  he 
was  writing  the  score  of  ^^Cavalleria"  in  his 
effort  to  win  the  prize  offered  by  the  Milanese 
publisher  Edoardo  Sonzogno.  No  wonder  the 
news  that  he  had  won  it  nearly  bereft  him  of  his 
senses. 

One  day,  at  a  dinner  given  by  De  Lucia  (at  the 
house  of  his  friend  Mazzoni  in  Charlotte  Street, 
Bedford  Square),  Mascagni  told  us  the  sequel.  And 

381 


Thirty  Years  of 


if  the  story  of  the  composition  was  touching,  the 
less  familiar  account  of  his  journey  to  Rome  and 
the  staging  of  ^^Cavalleria"  at  the  Costanzi  Thea- 
tre was  unquestionably  as  quaint  and  striking. 
At  the  time  the  news  of  his  success  reached  him, 
he  was  residing  in  the  small  Sicilian  town  of  Ceri- 
gnola,  where  he  filled  the  post  of  municipal  con- 
ductor and  organist  at  a  tiny  salary.  Now  the 
Sonzogno  prize  had  not  been  awarded  to  Mas- 
cagni's  opera  alone:  it  was  divided  between  two 
(if  not  among  three)  of  the  competitors.  Conse- 
quently, there  was  considerable  doubt  as  to  which 
of  the  successful  works  would  be  mounted  first, 
or  when  and  where  the  performance  would  be. 
Quite  unexpectedly,  one  morning  early  in  May, 
1890,  Mascagni  received  an  intimation  that  ^^Ca- 
valleria  Rusticana''  had  been  placed  in  rehear- 
sal at  the  Costanzi,  and  that  his  presence  was 
forthwith  required  in  Rome. 

The  request  came  to  hand  at  an  unfortunate 
moment.  So  straitened  were  his  circumstances 
that  he  actually  did  not  possess  sufficient  cash  to 
meet  the  expenses  of  the  journey.  However,  he 
contrived  to  borrow  the  necessary  sum  from  a 
friend,  and  arrived  in  Rome  the  next  day  but  one, 
in  good  time  for  the  rehearsal.  I  should  like  to 
quote  Mascagni 's  own  words  in  describing  what 
took  place  at  the  theatre,  but  to  give  them  in 
cold  English,  without  the  aid  of  his  eloquent  ges- 
tures and  his  wonderful  undercurrent  of  mimicry 
and  ^'asides,"  would  be  to  deprive  them  of  half 

382 


Musical  Life  in  London 


their  significance.  Enough  that  he  had  barely 
stepped  inside  the  stage  door  before  he  felt  him- 
self upon  *'hot  coals/'  Not  a  soul  knew  him.  He 
had  to  introduce  himself  to  the  manager,  who 
in  turn  presented  him  to  the  company  as  ^Hhe 
young  composer  who  had  been  fortunate  enough, ' ' 
and  so  on.  Every  one  was  studiously  polite.  The 
celebrated  tenor  Stagno,  who  was  to  honor  him 
by  creating  the  role  of  Turiddu,  made  a  frigid 
bow;  and  the  popular  Gemma  Bellincioni,  who 
had  accepted  the  part  of  Santuzza,  offered  him 
at  least  three  fingers  of  her  right  hand.  In  short, 
it  was  a  trying  moment— particularly  so  for  a 
youthful  musician  who  was  nervous,  anxious,  and 
—not  over  well  fed. 

When  the  rehearsal  began,  it  quickly  became 
evident  that  the  principals  had  already  invented 
and  arranged  most  of  their  '^  business, ' '  and  had 
no  thought  of  submitting  their  ideas  to  Mascagni 
for  his  approval.  Once  or  twice  it  was,  ^'Maes- 
tro, do  you  like  thisT'  or  ^'Do  you  care  for 
that!''  But,  generally  speaking,  his  opinion  was 
not  sought;  and,  although  his  experience  as  mu- 
sical director  of  a  touring  operetta  company 
might  have  enabled  him  to  drop  a  useful  hint,  he 
wisely  refrained  from  interfering  where  such  tre- 
mendously distinguished  artists  were  concerned. 

In  point  of  fact,  too,  he  was  like  a  man  in  a 
dream— a  veritable  dream  of  paradise.  Only 
once  did  he  venture  to  ask  a  question,  and  that 
was  at  the  outset  of  the  rehearsal,  when  Stagno 

383 


Thirty  Years  of 


called  for  a  chair  just  as  he  was  about  to  begin 
the  Sicilian  serenade  which  Tiiriddu  is  heard  sing- 
ing in  the  prelude.  With  all  humility  he  begged 
to  inquire  what  the  chair  was  for.  (His  imitation 
of  the  tenor's  tone  and  attitude  when  he  replied 
was  exquisite.) 

^* Pardon,  caro  maestro!  This  is  my  own  little 
affair.  When  I  want  to  sing  an  air  con  hrio  I 
always  like  to  think  of  ^  La  donna  e  mobile, '  which 
I  sing  so  well  because  I  am  all  the  time  holding 
on  to  the  back  of  a  chair.  Now,  when  I  sing  your 
serenade  the  curtain  is  down.  Very  well;  no  one 
sees  me.  I  intend  therefore  to  have  my  chair  here 
to  sing  it  just  as  if  it  were  the  ^Kigoletto'  air. 
You  will  see,  the  effect  will  be  superb!'' 

It  did  not  seem  to  have  occurred  to  Stagno  that 
the  serenade  in  ^  ^  Cavalleria "  is  heard  approach- 
ing from  the  distance  and  gradually  dying  away 
again.  But  never  mind ;  he  wanted  his  chair,  and 
Mascagni  was  very  glad  to  let  him  have  it.  For 
the  rest,  the  rehearsal  passed  off  satisfactorily 
enough,  and  the  opera  went  extremely  well  on  the 
18th.  How  it  created  a  furore  that  was  to  con- 
vert Mascagni  into  an  idol  and  carry  his  name 
and  music  to  the  farthest  corners  of  the  civilized 
globe  are  facts  that  need  no  narration  here.  His 
debut  at  Covent  Garden  took  place  on  June  19, 
1893,  when  he  conducted  ^^L'Amico  Fritz"  with 
Calve,  De  Lucia,  Pauline  Joran,  and  Dufriche  in 
the  cast.  He  was  rapturously  greeted  by  an  audi- 
ence which   included   so   many  ^^ royalties"   that 

384 


Musical  Life  in  London 


there  was  not  room  for  half  of  them  in  the  Queen's 
box.  As  a  matter  of  course,  he  speedily  became 
the  ^^lion^'  of  the  season. 

The  elements  were  thus  ripe  for  a  fresh  triumph 
when  the  time  came  for  the  production  of  ^*I 
Rantzau''  on  July  7.  Mascagni's  third  opera  had 
seen  the  light  at  Florence  only  in  the  previous 
November.  The  book  appeared  to  offer  a  prom- 
ising combination,  being  written  by  the  librettist 
of  ^^Cavalleria  Rusticana^'  and  founded  upon  a 
novel,  '^Les  Deux  Freres,''  by  MM.  Erckmann- 
Chatrian,  the  authors  of  ^'L'Amico  Fritz."  Un- 
fortunately, the  material  of  the  plot  proved  alto- 
gether inadequate  for  a  four-act  opera,  while  the 
love  interest  which  so  largely  predominated  in 
^'L'Amico  Fritz''  was  here  subordinated  to  the 
events  of  a  sordid  quarrel  between  two  wilful,  ill- 
tempered  brothers.  Moreover,  Mascagni  treated 
the  quarrel  in  an  intensely  tragic  vein,  which  is 
nowhere  more  strikingly  exemplified  than  in  the 
long  and  elaborate  finale  to  the  first  act.  This 
ambitious  piece  of  writing  I  have  described  as 
strong,  rugged,  original,  and  clever.  ^^Neverthe- 
less, a  big  effort  of  the  imagination  is  required  to 
suppose  an  entire  village  so  upset  by  a  squabble 
over  a  field  as  to  stand  in  two  sections  in  the 
open  piazza,  shouting  at  each  other  for  ten  min- 
utes by  the  clock!"  Even  a  street  row  in  Nu- 
remberg, aroused  by  a  matter  of  genuine  public 
interest,  was  depicted  by  Wagner  in  less  time  than 
that.

So,  despite  the  presence  and  cooperation  of  the 
genial  young  composer,  ^^I  Kantzau'^  was  not  a 
success.  The  principal  parts  were  sung  by  Melba, 
De  Lucia,  Ancona,  David  Bispham,  and  Castel- 
mary,  and  the  opera  was  mounted  in  thoroughly 
efficient  style.  In  the  following  week  Mascagni 
found  some  consolation  for  this  disappointment 
in  the  congratulations  of  the  Queen,  before  wliom 
he  conducted  the  second  act  of  ^^L'Amico  Fritz'' 
and  ^'Cavalleria  Rusticana."  I  had  the  pleasure 
of  accompanying  him  to  Windsor  on  this  occa- 
sion. We  had  barely  arrived  at  the  Castle  in  the 
afternoon  before  Her  Majesty  sent  for  the  com- 
poser, and  bestowed  upon  him  the  unusual  honor 
of  an  audience  in  the  private  apartments  just 
before  going  on  her  customary  drive.  The  Queen, 
speaking  sometimes  in  Italian,  but  mostly  in 
French,  reminded  him  that  she  had  already  heard 
^  ^  Cavalleria, ' '  and  expressed  the  deepest  interest 
in  his  music.  We  took  dinner  with  the  members 
of  the  household,  and  the  performance  began  at 
half-past  nine. 

Her  Majesty,  who  was  accompanied  by  Princess 
Henry  of  Battenberg,  Prince  and  Princess  Chris- 
tian, Princess  Henry  of  Prussia,  Princess  Louis 
of  Battenberg,  and  the  Grand  Duke  of  Hesse,  en- 
joyed the  representation  immensely,  and  directly 
afterward  sent  for  Signor  Mascagni,  together  with 
Mme.  Calve,  Sir  Augustus  Harris,  Signor  Vignas, 
and  Signor  Ancona,  all  of  whom  received  hand- 
some   souvenirs.      The    composer   was   presented 

386 


Musical  Life  in  London 


with  a  portrait  of  Her  Majesty  in  a  silver  frame 
bearing  the  autograph  inscription,  ^ '  Victoria  R.  I., 
July  15,  1893."  In  connection  with  this  function 
I  may  mention,  as  a  circumstance  without  prece- 
dent in  operatic  management,  that  Harris  simul- 
taneously gave  in  London  two  other  representa- 
tions,—namely,  ^  ^  Faust '^  at  Covent  Garden,  and 
^'Die  Walkure''  at  Drury  Lane,— employing  al- 
together upward  of  five  hundred  persons  in  the 
three  performances. 

In  the  same  month,  also.  Sir  Augustus  gave,  by 
royal  command,  a  State  performance  at  Covent 
Garden,  in  honor  of  the  marriage  of  the  present 
Prince  and  Princess  of  Wales,  when  ^' Romeo  et 
Juliette '^  was  given  with  a  cast  including  Jean 
and  Edouard  de  Reszke,  Plangon,  and  Melba, 
Mancinelli  conducting.  This  was  the  third  royal 
gala  representation  at  the  opera  within  ^ve  years. 
As  already  noted,  the  first  had  been  for  the  Shah 
of  Persia,  and  the  second  was  in  honor  of  the  Em- 
peror and  Empress  of  Germany.  At  each  of  these 
celebrations  the  decoration  of  the  auditorium  was 
ui)on  an  increasing  scale  of  gorgeous  and  lavish 
splendor;  but  not  so  that  of  the  vestibule  or 
grand  staircase,  nor  even  that  of  the  foyer,  since 
the  impresario  disliked  the  idea  of  spending  large 
sums  upon  beautifying  a  building  of  which  he 
was  still  only  a  yearly  tenant.  Hence  an  amusing 
bit  of  good-humored  criticism  from  the  Prince  of 
Wales  (now  King  Edward  VII)  on  the  night  of 
the  Kaiser's  visit  in  1891.    During  one  of  the  in- 

387 


Thirty  Years  of 


tervals  Harris  was  sent  for  and  presented  to  their 
Imperial  Majesties.  Before  leaving,  he  availed 
himself  of  the  opportunity  quietly  to  ask  the 
Prince  of  Wales  whether  he  was  pleased  with  the 
decorations.  His  Royal  Highness  replied  that  he 
was  delighted;  then,  taking  the  manager  apart, 
he  added  in  an  undertone : 

^'Delighted  with  everything,  Harris,  but  the  old 
carpet  in  the  foyer.  It  has  been  there  so  many 
years !  Eeally,  it  was  too  bad  not  to  put  down  a 
new  one  for  a  night  such  as  this ! ' ' 

Needless  to  add  that  the  hint  was  acted  upon 
long  before  the  next  gala  night. 

By  the  way,  on  the  occasion  of  the  Kaiser's 
State  visit  to  the  opera  there  was  very  nearly  a  big 
disappointment.  Toward  midday  Sir  Augustus 
received  notice  from  Jean  de  Reszke  that  he  was 
suffering  from  a  bronchial  attack  and  would  be 
unable  to  sing.  The  tenor  had  undertaken  to  ap- 
pear in  scenes  from  ^  ^  Lohengrin, ' '  ^^Les  Hugue- 
nots,'' and  "Romeo,"  and  consequently  his  in- 
disposition was  a  very  serious  affair.  Being  by 
chance  at  Covent  Garden  when  the  news  arrived, 
I  undertook  to  go  round  to  the  Continental  and 
see  if  anything  could  be  done  before  definitely 
altering  the  programme.  I  found  M.  de  Reszke 
unwell,  indeed,  but  by  no  means  voiceless. 
Whereupon  I  laid  before  him  arguments  in  favor 
of  his  making  a  superhuman  effort  to  sing,  rather 
than  wholly  disappoint  so  mighty  and  puissant  a 
personage  as  the  Emperor  William  II.     I  sug-

gested  that  if  he  could  not  appear  in  all  three  ex- 
cerpts, he  might  at  least  sing  in  one,  which  would 
be  a  great  deal  better  than  not  appearing  at  all. 
Ultimately,  the  considerate  artist  gave  way,  and 
I  returned  to  Harris  the  triumphant  bearer  of 
the  following  characteristic  note: 

[Translated  from  the  French.] 

My  dear  Friend  : 

Klein  has  just  asked  me  to  sing  at  least  one  act  of  the 
three  that  I  had  promised  you.  Consequently  I  choose 
that  of  Romeo  as  the  least  fatiguing.  Look  upon  this, 
my  dear  friend,  as  an  evidence  of  my  desire  to  spare 
you  a  portion  of  the  trouble  occasioned  by  my  indisposi- 
tion. And  in  doing  so  I  risk  hurting  my  voice !  Make 
an  announcement.    A  thousand  greetings ! 

Jean. 

Two  English  novelties  were  added  to  the  rep- 
ertory of  Co  vent  Garden  during  the  last  month 
of  the  season;  but  neither  was  sung  in  the  ver- 
nacular, and  neither  attained  to  more  than  a  suc- 
ces  d'estime.  Isidore  de  Lara^s  ^^Amy  Robsart" 
was  set  to  a  French  libretto  founded  by  Sir  Au- 
gustus Harris  and  Paul  Milliet  upon  Scott's 
*  *  Kenilworth ' ' ;  and  the  principal  interpreters 
were  Alvarez,  Lassalle,  Bonnard,  Castelmary,  and 
Emma  Calve,  Bevignani  conducting.  Villiers 
Stanford's  ^'Veiled  Prophet,"  originally  com- 
posed to  the  English  text  of  William  Barclay 
Squire    (who    derived   it    from    Moore's    *'Lalla 

391 


Musical  Life  in  London 


Rookh"),  had  been  produced  in  German  at  Han- 
over in  1881,  and  was  now  sung  to  an  Italian  ver- 
sion by  Mazzucato.  The  cast  comprised  Lillian 
Nordica,  Lucile  Hill,  Vignas,  and  Ancona,  and 
the  composer  conducted.  In  addition  to  these 
works,  Harris  mounted  Bizet's  ^^Djamileh,''  Emil 
Bach's  ^ * Irmengarda, "  and  (at  Drury  Lane)  Ha- 
levy's  *^La  Juive."  The  German  performances, 
which  did  not  begin  until  the  end  of  June,  were 
given  under  the  direction  of  the  celebrated  May- 
ence  conductor,  Emil  Steinbach.  Again  was  Max 
Alvary  the  principal  tenor;  while  among  the  more 
notable  recruits  were  Frau  Moran-Olden,  Frau 
Reuss-Belce,  Fraulein  Meisslinger,  and  the  tal- 
ented Polish  contralto,  Fraulein  Olitzka.

CHAPTER   XVII 

A  double  artistic  jubilee— August  Manns  honored— Garcia' s 
"Hints  on  Singing"— Opera  in  1894— New  orchestral  institu- 
tions— Opening  of  Queen's  Hall — A  procession  of  famous 
conductors— Richard  Strauss— With  Seidl  at  Bayreuth— A 
Wagner  anecdote— Covent  Garden  in  1895— New  pianists. 

THE  English  jubilee  of  Joseph.  Joachim  and 
Alfredo  Piatti  was  celebrated  on  March  22, 
1894^  by  a  reception  at  the  Grafton  Galleries, 
which  the  leading  journal  declared  to  be  the  most 
interesting  event  of  its  kind  that  had  taken  place 
in  London  since  the  memorable  Liszt  reception 
at  the  Grosvenor  Gallery  eight  years  before.  For 
the  organization  of  this  function  I  was  largely 
responsible  as  honorary  secretary  of  the  execu- 
tive committee;  and  my  duties  constituted  a  veri- 
table labor  of  love,  a  glad  tribute  to  the  two  great 
artists  who,  by  a  remarkable  coincidence,  had 
made  their  first  appearance  before  the  British  pub- 
lic within  a  few  weeks  of  each  other  in  the  spring 
of  1844. 

Unlike  Liszt,  neither  of  the  honored  guests  on 
this  occasion  performed  a  solo  upon  his  instru- 
ment. The  only  music  was  that  furnished  by  what 
the  late  Lord  Leighton  was  pleased  to  describe

Thirty  Years  of 


as  ^  ^  a  good  band. ' '  ^  The  formal  proceedings  of 
the  evening  consisted  of  nothing  more  than  the 
presentation  of  illuminated  addresses,— one  read 
by  Sir  Alexander  Mackenzie,  the  other  by  Sir 
George  Grove,— to  which  each  artist  in  turn  made 
an  extempore  reply.  The  addresses  naturally  laid 
stress  upon  the  ties  of  friendship  and  affection 
that  united  the  recipients  to  British  lovers  of 
music,  and  they  gave  expression  to  the  deep  admi- 
ration felt  by  the  latter,  as  well  as  their  gratitude 
to  the  distinguished  artists  for  the  inestimable 
benefits  that  had  accrued  to  the  cause  of  music 
in  England  through  their  yearly  presence  there. 
The  replies,  both  delivered  under  the  influence  of 
profound  emotion,  were  essentially  characteristic 
of  the  modesty  and  single-hearted  devotion  of  the 
two  musicians.  Piatti  created  much  amusement 
by  his  reference  to  a  ^^  little  fat  boy  in  tight  trou- 
sers,'' whom  he  saw  make  his  first  appearance  in 

^  In  this  respect  the  Berlin  celebration  of  Dr.  Joachim 's  ju- 
bilee was,  of  course,  far  more  interesting.  Then  a  grand  concert 
was  given,  at  which  every  member  of  the  orchestra  was  a  former 
student  of  the  Hochschule,  every  individual  fiddler  a  pupil  of  the 
''King  of  Violinists'^;  while,  to  make  things  perfect,  the  hero 
of  the  night  was  ultimately  persuaded  to  take  his  violin  and  bow 
from  three  of  his  fair  musical  children  and  delight  his  excited 
auditors  with  a  solo  by  Bach.  I  went  over  expressly  to  attend 
that  unique  and  brilliant  function.  The  orchestra  was  directed 
by  Herr  Steinbach,  and  as  long  as  I  live  I  shall  never  forget  the 
magnificent  quality  of  the  tone  of  those  violins  or  the  superb 
elan  that  marked  the  performance  of  Weber's  "Euryanthe" 
overture.  Every  player  was  an  artist  of  repute,  and  the  total 
value  of  the  stringed  instruments  was  computed  at  a  quarter  of 
a  million  dollars.

London  in  1844.  ^'He  had  blooming  cheeks  and 
a  short  jacket,  and  he  stepped  up  on  the  platform 
at  the  Philharmonic  Concert  and  played  Beetho- 
ven's violin  concerto  in  such  style  that  everybody 
was  astonished.  It  was  my  good  fortune  to  be  very 
much  associated  with  the  little  boy  in  after  years ; 
and  his  name  was  that  of  my  friend,  the  great 
artist,  Joseph  Joachim. '^ 

The  renowned  violinist,  for  his  part,  referred  to 
his  introduction  by  Mendelssohn  to  that  hospita- 
ble land,  and  to  the  great  advance  which  the  Eng- 
lish people  had  made  in  their  appreciation  of 
chamber  music,  and  instrumental  music  generally, 
during  the  past  fifty  years.  He  remembered  how 
once  in  those  far  back  days,  when  he  had  suggested 
that  he  should  play  at  a  concert  Beethoven's 
lovely  romance  in  F,  he  was  informed  there  was 
a  danger  that  the  composition  would  be  thought 
too  classical.  Now  the  quartets  of  the  great  mas- 
ters were  constantly  played,  and  a  large  section 
of  the  people  heard  them  with  delight.  If  he  had 
helped  in  any  way  toward  the  advance  that  had 
taken  place,  he  was  proud  and  happy;  for  he 
looked  upon  England  as  his  second  home,  where 
he  had  met  with  no  envy,  but  only  the  kindest 
appreciation,  and  to  which  country  he  was  bound 
by  the  closest  ties  of  friendship.  These  words 
will  not  be  quickly  forgotten  by  an  assembly  that 
was,  indeed,  of  a  nature  to  do  honor  to  the  occa- 
sion. Art  was  represented  by  Lord  Leighton,

It  was  my  good  fortune  to  undertake  similar 
administrative  duties  in  connection  with  the  suc- 
cessful reception  held  at  the  same  galleries  in 
May,  1895,  to  celebrate  the  seventieth  birthday  of 
the  popular  Crystal  Palace  conductor,  August 
Manns.  In  this  instance  the  members  of  the  Crys- 
tal Palace  band  volunteered  their  services  out  of 
compliment  to  their  chief,  who  directed  an  in- 
teresting programme;  while  an  address  was  read 
and  presented  by  his  old  colleague.  Sir  George 
Grove,  eulogizing  the  veteran  conductor  for  the 
noble  attitude  he  had  assumed  toward  British  mu- 
sic and  British  musicians.  Furthermore,  Queen 
Victoria's  musical  second  son,  the  late  Duke  of 
Saxe-Coburg  and  Gotha,  attended  the  reception, 
and  pinned  upon  Mr.  Manns 's  breast  the  Coburg 
.Order  for  ''Kunst  und  Wissenschaf t. ' ' 

Apropos  of  birthday  honors,  I  may  also  mention 

398 


Musical  Life  in  London 


that  on  March  17,  1894,  Manuel  Garcia  entered 
upon  his  ninetieth  year;  and  his  brother  profes- 
sors at  the  Royal  Academy  of  Music  seized  the 
opportunity  to  present  him  with  a  silver  tea-  and 
coffee-service,  accompanied  by  an  illuminated  ad- 
dress. Later  in  the  same  year,  the  venerable 
maestro  brought  out  his  second  and  last  text-book 
upon  the  art  wherein  he  had  labored  with  such 
distinguished  success  for  nearly  three  quarters 
of  a  century.  In  the  compilation  of  ^' Hints  on 
Singing,''  as  this  instructive  catechism  is  called, 
I  was  fortunately  able  to  render  Signor  Garcia 
material  assistance;  and  the  help  thus  gladly  ten- 
dered finds  gracious  acknowledgment  in  the  pref- 
ace. The  *' Hints"  are  published  in  the  United 
States  as  well  as  in  England,  but  have  not  yet 
attained  the  wide  recognition  that  they  deserve.^ 
The  bewildering  rapidity  with  which  novelty 
succeeded  novelty  during  the  Covent  Garden  sea- 

^  The  following  quotation  from  the  preface  of  ' '  Hints  on  Sing- 
ing ' '  affords  an  admirably  succinct  statement  of  Signor  Garcia 's 
views  upon  the  degeneracy  of  the  coloratur  singer :  ' '  At  the 
present  day  the  acquirement  of  flexibility  is  not  in  great  esteem, 
and  were  it  not,  perhaps,  for  the  venerable  Handel,  declamatory 
music  would  reign  alone.  This  is  to  be  regretted,  for  not  only 
must  the  art  suffer,  but  also  the  young  fresh  voices,  to  which 
the  brilliant  florid  style  is  the  most  congenial;  the  harder  and 
more  settled  organs  being  best  suited  for  declamation.  It  would 
not  be  difficult  to  trace  the  causes  of  the  decline  of  the  florid 
style.  Let  it  suffice,  however,  to  mention,  as  one  of  the  most 
important,  the  disappearance  of  the  race  of  great  singers  who, 
beside  originating  this  art,  carried  it  to  its  highest  point  of 
excellence.  The  impresario,  influenced  by  the  exigencies  of  the 
modern   prima   donna,   has   been   constrained   to   offer  less   gifted

son  of  1894  has  had  no  parallel  either  before  or 
since.  Within  the  space  of  three  weeks  (June  10 
to  June  30)  Sir  Augustus  Harris  mounted  Mas- 
senet's "Werther''  and  ^^La  Navarraise, ' '  Al- 
fred Bruneau's  ^'L'Attaque  du  Moulin,"  and 
Frederic  Cowen's  ^'Signa'';  the  second  of  these 
being  given  for  the  first  time  on  any  stage.  Both 
the  French  composers  came  over  to  superintend 
the  production  of  their  works.  Massenet  was  as 
much  disappointed  by  the  comparative  failure  of 
^'Werther''  as  he  was  delighted  over  the  enthu- 
siasm that  greeted  that  *^blood-and-thunder'' 
little  music-drama  ^^La  Navarraise/'  which,  how- 
ever, owed  its  temporary  vogue  chiefly  to  the  ge- 
nius of  Emma  Calve.  ^'L'Attaque  du  Moulin'' 
won  a  more  genuine  artistic  success,  even  if  it 
did  not  secure  a  permanent  place  in  the  repertory, 
and  an  ineffaceable  impression  was  made  by  the 
gifted  mezzo-soprano.  Mile.  Delna,  who  then  ap- 
peared here  for  the  first  time.  Her  Marcelline 
was  a  superb  creation;  and  Bouvet's  embodiment 
of  the  kind-hearted  old  miller,  Pere  Merlier^  was 
also  extremely  fine.  The  performance,  directed 
by  Philippe  Flon,  was  of  astonishing  excellence. 
M.  Bruneau  assured  me  he  found  it  equal  in  every 
respect  to  that  at  the  Opera-Comique,  and  he— 

and  accomplished  virtuose  to  the  composer,  who  in  turn  has  been 
compelled  to  simplify  the  role  of  the  voice  and  to  rely  more  and 
more  upon  orchestral  effects.  Thus,  singing  is  becoming  as  much 
a  lost  art  as  the  manufacture  of  mandarin  china  or  the  varnish 
used  by  the  old  masters."

professional  critic  as  well  as  composer — is  by  no 
means  easy  to  please. 

Mr.  Cowen^s  ^^Signa'^  was  not  sung  in  Eng- 
lish. Originally  composed  to  a  libretto  by  the 
late  Gilbert  a  Beckett  (founded  on  Ouida's  novel), 
and  intended  for  the  defunct  Royal  English  Op- 
era, it  had  been  produced  in  November,  1893,  at 
the  Dal  Verme  Theatre,  Milan,  where  it  was,  of 
course,  sung  in  Italian.  It  was  now  given  at  Co- 
vent  Garden  with  the  same  foreign  text,  the  prin- 
cipal parts  being  filled  by  Mme.  de  Nuovina,  Ben 
Davies,  and  Ancona,  while  the  composer  con- 
ducted. So  with  another  English  novelty,  ^^The 
Lady  of  Longford, ' '  produced  later  in  the  season : 
the  book  was  by  Augustus  Harris,  and  the  mu- 
sic had  been  set  to  it  by  Emil  Bach;  but  for  the 
performance  Paul  Milliet,  a  Parisian  librettist,  was 
called  in,  and  the  opera  was  sung  in  French  by 
Emma  Eames,  Alvarez,  and  Edouard  de  Reszke. 
Neither  of  these  productions  attained  to  more 
than  passing  favor. 

To  the  above  record  must  be  added  two  new 
Italian  operas,  Verdi's  ^^Falstaff  and  Puccini's 
^^Manon  Lescaut,"  both  of  which  were  brought 
out  early  in  the  season;  and  so  well  did  the  for- 
mer please  that  no  fewer  than  eight  performances 
were  given  of  the  old  master's  exquisite  musical 
comedy.  The  German  representations,  as  in  the

to  London  in  the  same  capacity  in  1902.  The  fea- 
tures of  the  Carl  Rosa  season  were  a  stage  ver- 
sion of  Berlioz 's  ^  ^  Faust ' ' ;  a  new  romantic  opera, 
^^Jeanie  Deans,''  written  by  Joseph  Bennett  and 
composed  by  Hamish  MacCunn ;  and  the  first  pro- 
duction in  England  of  Humperdinck 's  ^^  Hansel 
und  Gretel."  At  Covent  Garden  and  Drury  Lane 
alone,  however,— that  is  to  say,  quite  apart  from 
the  Carl  Rosa  productions,— ninety- two  perform- 
ances of  twenty-seven  operas  were  given  in  eleven 
weeks,  and  of  these  works  seven  were  mounted  for 
the  first  time  in  London. 

Amid  this  orgy  of  operatic  activity,  another  no- 
table development  was  in  progress.  I  refer  to  the 
growing  taste  for  orchestral  music  of  the  highest 
class.  It  was  welcome  for  more  than  one  reason. 
Accurately  reading  the  signs  of  the  times,  it  was 
impossible  to  shut  one's  eyes  to  the  fact  that  ora- 
torio was  on  the  downward  path;  that  the  once 
characteristic  English  love  for  choral  music  was 
distinctly  waning.  Without  the  Royal  Choral  So- 
ciety in  London,  without  the  prosperous  provincial 
festivals  and  the  legion  of  small  choral  societies 
in  all  parts  of  the  kingdom,  the  oratorio  and  the 
cantata  to-day  might  be  looked  upon  in  the  light 
of  a  ^'negligible  quantity."  The  vast  majority 
of  metropolitan  music-lovers  would  never  miss 
them.  It  is  more  difficult  to  account  for  this  than 
for  the  decline  of  institutions  like  the  Crystal 
Palace  and  the  Popular  Concerts.  The  latter  have 
lost  their  hold  ui^on  the  public  as  the  centre  of  ar-

tistic  movement  has  shifted  from  one  scene  to  an- 
other, as  the  old  supporters  have  died  out,  or  as 
the  famous  performers  most  intimately  associated 
with  these  enterprises  one  by  one  have  disappeared 
from  the  platform. 

The  opening  of  the  new  Queen's  Hall,  in  Lang- 
ham  Place,  added  a  locale  of  much-needed  interme- 
diate size  to  the  number  of  London's  concert- 
rooms.  Any  hope  that  it  might  be  put  to  profitable 
use  for  choral  performances  was  fairly  dispelled 
by  the  experiences  of  a  season  or  two.  On  the 
other  hand,  under  the  energetic  management  of 
Mr.  Robert  Newman,  the  popularity  of  orchestral 
music  largely  increased.  In  this  direction  the  ap- 
petite of  the  public  seemed  to  grow  by  what  it  fed 
upon,  and  the  advent  of  a  new  and  talented  Eng- 
lish conductor  in  the  person  of  Mr.  Henry  J.  Wood 
added  just  that  touch  of  personal  magnetism,  of 
attractive  individuality,  without  which  the  finest 
collection  of  instrumental  performers  may  appeal 
in  vain.  In  a  word,  the  Queen's  Hall  band  and 
their  leader  quickly  won  renown,  and  their  con- 
certs were  soon  to  be  regarded  as  synonymous  with 
well-chosen  schemes,  interesting  novelties,  and  ad- 
mirable performances. 

Nor  did  the  etfect  of  this  growing  love  for  or- 
chestral music  end  here.  It  brought  augmented 
support  to  the  Philharmonic  Society,  and  it  led  to 
the  establishment  at  Queen's  Hall  of  an  annual 
series  of  concerts  in  frank  imitation  of  those  given 
at  St.  James's  Hall  under  the  direction  of  Hans

Eichter.  For  this  undertaking,  managed  by  Mr. 
Alfred  Schulz-Curtius,  London  was  favored,  sea- 
son after  season,  with  a  veritable  procession  of 
more  or  less  renowned  foreign  conductors.  First 
and  foremost,  in  1894,  came  Felix  Mottl,  the  gifted 
Karlsruhe  Kapellmeister;  then,  later  in  the  same 
year,  the  youthful  and  ambitious  Siegfried  Wag- 
ner. In  1895  the  late  Hermann  Levi  paid  a  solitary 
visit;  subsequently  came  Felix  Weingartner,  Ni- 
kisch,  and  Richard  Strauss.  But  for  at  least  two 
or  three  concerts  every  year  until  the  enterprise 
was  abandoned  did  Felix  Mottl  direct  perform- 
ances of  Beethoven  symphonies  and  Wagner  ex- 
cerpts that  were  distinguished  by  a  very  high  order 
of  merit.  During  the  same  period,  in  a  fitting 
spirit  of  emulation,  Mr.  Robert  Newman  secured 
the  services  of  the  famous  French  conductors  MM. 
Lamoureux  and  Colonne.  At  first  these  musicians 
brought  over  their  own  orchestras,  and  some  mag- 
nificent work  was  done  by  both.  The  plan,  how- 
ever, proved  too  expensive,  and,  while  M.  Colonne 
did  not  repeat  his  visit,  his  accomplished  rival  was 
content,  after  one  or  two  seasons,  to  utilize,  when 
he  came,  the  excellent  material  of  the  Queen 's  Hall 
band.  This  he  did  until  just  before  his  death, 
which  occurred  in  1899. 

It  was  at  the  concert  conducted  by  Hermann  Levi 
on  April  25,  1895,  that  that  fine  artist,  Milka  Ter- 
nina,  made  her  London  debut.  This  was  the  only 
occasion  on  which  I  ever  heard  her  sing  ^'off  the 
key.''    The  high  English  pitch  was  still  employed

then  at  Queen's  Hall,  and  it  frequently  upset  her 
intonation ;  beside,  her  singing  lacked  the  freedom 
and  inspiration  that  it  acquires  in  a  stage  per- 
formance. I  remarked  at  the  time:  ^^Fraulein 
Ternina  has  a  splendid  voice,  and  is  a  singer  of  re- 
markable intelligence;  but  it  is  evidently  only  in 
combination  with  her  qualities  as  an  actress  that 
she  can  display  these  rare  gifts  in  their  true  light. ' ' 
And  my  words  were  fully  borne  out  when  the  Mu- 
nich soprano  made  her  first  appearance  at  Covent 
Garden,  three  years  later,  in  her  superb  embodi- 
ment of  Isolde.  Her  triumph  in  that  instance  was 
brilliant  and  complete. 

Siegfried  Wagner  came  twice  to  London.  In  the 
autumn  of  1894  he  challenged  criticism  as  a  con- 
ductor only,  and  was  *  ^  let  off ' '  pretty  lightly.  He 
wielded  the  baton  with  his  left  hand,  but  his  beat 
was  firm  and  distinct,  and  his  readings,  if  color- 
less, were  intelligent  and  clear.  In  the  summer  of 
1895  he  appeared  as  a  composer,  and  presented  to 
the  world,  for  the  first  time,  a  symphonic  poem 
written  after  Schiller's  ' ^ Sehnsucht. "  This  work 
revealed  promise,  but  it  was  ^^the  promise  of  the 
child  who  tries  to  run  before  he  can  walk,  the  pre- 
maturely exposed  talent  of  the  artist  who  repre- 
sents on  canvas  some  great  problem  of  human  life 
before  he  has  mastered  the  art  of  mixing  his  col- 
ors." At  the  same  concert  he  gave  a  practical 
demonstration  of  his  father's  ideas  concerning  the 
interpretation  of  Beethoven 's  ' '  little ' '  symphony  in 
F.     On  the  other  hand,  his  reading  of  the  *^Der 


407 


Thirty  Years  of 


Freischiitz ' '  overture  was  ^ '  simply  remarkable  for 
wilful  eccentricity  and  a  flagrant  disregard  for  the 
obvious  intentions  of  the  composer." 

Richard  Strauss  paid  his  first  visit  to  England 
in  December,  1897.  His  songs  and  chamber  pieces 
were  tolerably  well  known,  but  of  his  orchestral 
works  only  three  had  so  far  been  heard  in  London— 
namely,  the  symphony  in  F  (April  12)  and  the  sym- 
phonic poems,  ^^Till  EulenspiegeP '  and  *^Also 
sprach  Zarathustra. ' '  He  now  brought  with  him 
the  *  ^  Tod  und  Verklarung, ' '  wherein  is  dejoicted  the 
death  struggle  of  a  man  before  whose  mental  vision 
there  passes  the  panorama  of  a  wasted  life,  fol- 
lowed by  the  man's  transfiguration,  as  his  re- 
deemed soul  passes  out  of  earthly  existence  into 
a  higher  state.  The  second  section  of  this  remark- 
able work  made  an  especially  deep  impression,  and 
at  the  close  the  composer  was  overwhelmed  with 
applause.  Strauss 's  gifts  as  a  conductor  were  made 
manifest  in  very  positive  fashion.  In  his  own  mu- 
sic startling  contrasts,  powerful  crescendos,  and  ex- 
citing climaxes  naturally  abounded.  In  the  inter- 
pretation of  Mozart  and  Wagner  he  displayed  an 
admirable  command  of  dynamic  effects,  ranging 
from  the  most  delicate  to  the  most  sonorous;  and 
in  everything  alike  he  revealed  the  intellectual  in- 
sight and  authority,  the  artistic  culture,  the  mag- 
netic force,  the  strong  individuality  of  a  musician 
of  genius. 

The  name  of  Anton  Seidl  may  perhaps  be  missed 
from  the  group  of  leading  German  conductors  enu-

merated  above.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  however,  Seidl 
scarcely  had  an  opportunity  of  displaying  his  pow- 
ers in  London  as  a  concert  conductor.  His  appear- 
ances there  were  solely  in  connection  with  opera— 
the  ^ ' Nibelungen "  performances  at  Her  Majesty's 
in  1882,  and  the  German  representations  at  Covent 
Garden  in  1897.  In  the  course  of  the  latter  I  saw 
him  frequently,  and  one  night  he  accompanied  me 
to  a  Richter  concert  at  St.  James's  Hall.  He  had 
not  seen  his  great  Viennese  rival  upon  the  platform 
for  many  years,  and  was  especially  curious  to  hear 
his  rendering  of  Tschaikowsky 's  ^  ^  Pathetique " 
symphony.  He  was  delighted  with  every  feature 
save  one.  Directly  after  starting  the  second  (5-4) 
movement,  Richter  laid  down  his  baton  and  al- 
lowed the  band  to  proceed  without  guidance  to  the 
end  of  the  piece.  Seidl  knit  his  brows  and  looked 
stern,  but  did  not  utter  a  word  till  the  room  was 
ringing  with  applause.  Then  he  turned  to  me  and 
said:  ''I  wish  he  had  not  done  that.  It  was  to 
show  that,  in  spite  of  the  awkward  rhythm,  his  men 
could  keep  perfectly  together  without  the  beat,  and 
maintain  the  necessary  precision  all  through  the 
movement.  So  they  did ;  but  the  result  was  a  very 
machine-like  performance.  It  was  much  less  crisp 
and  animated  than  it  would  have  been  if  Richter 
had  conducted  it  with  his  arm  as  well  as  with  his 
eyes!'^ 

The  last  time  I  saw  Seidl  was  at  Bayreuth  in 
1897.  He  was  conducting  ^^ Parsifal"  that  sum- 
mer; and  what  a  glorious  treat  it  was  to  listen  to 


409 


Thirty  Years  of 


the  orchestra  under  him,  immediately  after  the 
blurred  and  ponderous  execution  of  the  *^Nibelun- 
gen''  under  Siegfried  Wagner!  On  one  of  the 
''off  days'^  of  the  festival,  Seidl  invited  his  friend 
Francis  Neilson  and  myself  to  lunch  with  him  at 
the  ' '  Schwarze  Adler. ' '  ^  The  usually  quiet,  re- 
served musician  was  disposed  to  ' '  come  out  of  his 
sheir'  that  afternoon,  for  when  lunch  was  over  he 
developed  a  communicative  mood  such  as  neither 
Neilson  nor  I  had  ever  observed  in  him  before.  He 
told  us  story  after  story  of  his  early  experiences 
with  Wagner,  dating  from  the  time  when  he  first 
went  to  Bayreuth  in  1875  for  the  purpose  of  act- 
ing as  his  secretary  and  of  assisting  to  make  a 
''clean  copy''  of  the  score  of  the  "Ring.''  His 
preliminary  interview  with  the  master  in  the  li- 
brary at  Wahnfried  was  among  his  more  vivid 
recollections.  When  he  entered  the  room  he 
thought  no   one  was  there  but  himself.     So  he 

^  Anton  Seidl  was  at  that  period  setting  to  music  for  the  stage 
the  first  part  of  a  trilogy  entitled  ^'Manabozo, "  written  by 
Francis  Neilson,  and  founded  upon  the  myths  of  the  North  Amer- 
ican Indians.  The  fact  was  kept  secret,  and  nobody  seems  to 
have  heard  any  of  the  music  but  Mr.  Neilson  (now  stage  man- 
ager of  the  Eoyal  Opera,  Co  vent  Garden),  who  declared  that  it 
possessed  beauty  and  originality  of  no  mean  order.  I  understood 
that  the  first  part  of  the  trilogy  had  been  fully  sketched  and 
was  partially  scored  for  orchestra;  but  what  became  of  the  score 
I  am  unable  to  say.  The  poem  of  ' '  Manabozo ' '  was  published 
separately  in  London  in  1899  by  John  Macqueen,  Norfolk  Street, 
Strand,  and  was  dedicated  by  the  author  to  the  memory  of  Anton 
Seidl.  The  preface  states  that  this  work  was  Seidl 's  ''dearest 
aim,"  and  that  his  ''confidence  and  belief  in  the  subject  and  its 
potentialities"  were  extraordinary.

pulled  out  his  letter  of  introduction  and  inwardly 
rehearsed  for  the  twentieth  time  the  little  speech 
which  he  had  prepared.  Suddenly,  from  out  of 
a  dark  corner,  where  he  had  been  reading  or 
searching  for  a  book,  there  sprang  into  view— Hi- 
chard  Wagner !  The  apparition  so  completely  up- 
set poor  Seidl's  equanimity  that  he  found  him- 
self unable  to  utter  a  single  sentence  of  his  speech. 
Even  in  reply  to  the  master's  questions  he  could 
barely  manage  to  blurt  out  a  monosyllable.  At 
last  Wagner  dismissed  him  with  the  remark,  *^If 
you  work  as  well  as  you  hold  your  tongue  you  will 
do. ' '  And  from  that  time  forward  his  capacity  for 
silence  was  a  standing  joke  at  Wahnfried. 

Seidl  also  told  us  the  '  ^  fish  story ' '  which  he 
related  to  Mr.  H.  T.  Finck  ^  as  an  instance  of  Wag- 
ner's  love  of  animals,  with  the  additional  informa- 
tion that  this  quaint  encounter  with  the  old  fish- 
woman  at  the  Bayreuth  railway  station  was  the 
immediate  cause  of  the  famous  diatribe  which  the 
sensitive  composer  penned  against  the  practice  of 
vivisection.  Another  anecdote  narrated  by  Seidl, 
and  possessing  an  even  wider  interest,  is  worth 
setting  down  here  at  length. 

Early  in  December,  1878,  Wagner  made  up  his 
mind  that  his  wife  should  be  serenaded  on  her 
birthday  at  Christmas  with  the  strains  of  the  '^  Vor- 
spiel"  to  ^'Parsifal,"  of  which  work  he  had  then 
completed  the  first  act.  The  only  question  was 
how  to  obtain  an  orchestra.     After  some  reflec-

tion,  Wagner  determined  to  procure  the  services 
of  the  celebrated  Meiningen  performers,  but  of 
course  without  their  conductor,  then  no  other  than 
Dr.  Hans  von  Biilow,  Frau  Cosima  Wagner  ^s  first 
husband.  The  project  was  kept  a  profound  secret, 
and  young  Anton  Seidl  was  forthwith  despatched 
to  Meiningen  to  arrange  matters  with  the  band.  He 
arrived  there  early  in  the  morning,  and  went  direct 
to  the  hotel  at  which  von  Biilow  was  staying.  The 
worthy  doctor  was  practising,  and,  being  unac- 
quainted with  Seidl,  sent  out  word  that  he  could 
not  see  him  until  eleven  o'clock.  Accordingly,  at 
that  hour  he  presented  himself  at  the  great  pian- 
ist's apartment  and  was  duly  ushered  into  his  pres- 
ence. At  the  first  mention  of  Wagner's  name  von 
Biilow  drew  himself  up  and  inquired  in  an  icy  tone 
what  it  was  that  Herr  Wagner  wanted.  Seidl 
explained  the  object  of  his  mission. 

*^Well,"  replied  the  doctor,  ^'you  must  permit 
me  to  inform  you  that  I  do  not  occupy  myself  at 
all  with  the  engagements  of  my  orchestra.  If  Herr 
Wagner  requires  their  services,  his  ambassador 
must  be  good  enough  to  address  himself  to  my 
Conzertmeister.  Good  morning."  And  with  that 
he  stiffly  bowed  Seidl  out. 

The  ^^ ambassador"  quickly  found  the  leader  of 
the  band,  and,  the  Duke  of  Meiningen 's  permission 
being  readily  granted,  it  was  arranged  that  the 
men  should  be  at  Bayreuth  by  a  certain  evening. 
They  assembled  in  good  time  at  the  Sonne  Hotel, 
where  Wagner  met  them  and  conducted  a  rehear-

sal  of  the  '  ^  Vorspiel. ' '  Early  next  morning,  while 
Fran  Cosima  was  still  asleep,  the  heavier  instru- 
ments were  conveyed  to  Wahnfried,  and  the  play- 
ers quietly  stationed  themselves  at  their  desks  in 
the  vestibule  and  upon  the  staircase.  When  all  was 
ready,  Wagner  gave  the  signal,  and  his  much-hon- 
ored wife  awoke  from  her  slumbers  to  hear  for  the 
first  time  the  mystic  phrases  of  the  prelude  to 
**  Parsifal.'' 

In  1895,  for  the  first  time  for  eight  years,  there 
was  a  London  opera  season  without  the  coopera- 
tion of  Jean  de  Reszke.  This  was  the  year  of 
Mme.  Patti's  return  to  the  stage  of  Covent  Gar- 
den, an  event  to  which  reference  has  already  been 
made.  Prior  to  her  rentree  the  diva  sang  at  a 
Philharmonic  concert,  and  was  presented  on  that 
occasion  with  the  society's  gold  medal— an  honor 
bestowed  upon  only  sixteen  musicians  before  her. 
Her  six  appearances  at  the  Opera  (as  Violetta  and 
Rosina)  resulted  in  a  splendid  and  unparalleled  tri- 
umph for  herself  and  a  handsome  profit  for  her  old 
friend  Augustus  Harris.  Another  welcome  return 
was  that  of  Marcella  Sembrich,  who  had  not  sung 
in  London  since  1884,  and  was  now  a  greater  artist 
than  ever.  The  prime  donne  further  included 
Melba,  Calve,  Albani,  Emma  Eames,  Marie  Engle, 
and  Marguerite  Macintyre— altogether  a  rare 
galaxy  of  soprano  talent;  so  that,  with  Tamagno, 
De  Lucia,  and  Alvarez  dividing  the  principal  tenor 
work,  the  absence  of  the  distinguished  Pole  was 
less  felt  than  it  otherwise  would  have  been.    The 


Thirty  Years  of 


principal  debutante  was  Gemma  Bellincioni,  but  her 
lack  of  vocal  charm  was  fatal  to  the  chance  of  the 
original  Santuzza  winning  favor  in  England. 

The  only  important  novelty  was  Frederic 
Cowen's  ''Harold/'  a  four-act  dramatic  opera, 
composed  to  a  weak  libretto  by  Sir  Edward  Malet, 
and,  mirahile  dictu,  sung  in  English  before  a  Co- 
vent  Garden  audience  in  mid-season!  The  fine 
music  of  this  work  deserved  more  enduring  suc- 
cess. The  cast  comprised  Mme.  Albani,  Miss 
Meisslinger,  Philip  Brozel,  David  Bispham,  and 
Richard  Green ;  but,  unluckily,  there  was  a  lack  of 
distinction  (and  distinctness)  about  the  general 
rendering  that  was  scarcely  calculated  to  engender 
in  aristocratic  auditors  any  particular  love  of  op- 
era in  the  vernacular.  Anyhow,  the  English  ex- 
periment was  never  repeated;  while,  on  the  other 
hand,  a  performance  of  ' '  Tannhauser ' '  in  French, 
given  later  in  the  summer,  was  hailed  with  posi- 
tive delight.  Concurrently  with  the  regular  Covent 
Garden  enterprises,  the  stock  company  from  the 
ducal  theatre  at  Coburg  appeared  at  Drury  Lane 
in  a  series  of  light  German  operas  comprising  ' '  Der 
Vogelhandler, ' '  "  Die  Fledermaus, ' '  and  ' '  Die  ver- 
kaufte  Braut.''  These  admirable  representations 
were  thoroughly  appreciated. 

It  is  timely  here  to  note  the  gradual  advent  of 
the  new  generation  of  modern  pianists,  filling  in 
the  gaps  left  by  the  decease  of  favorites  like  Mme. 
Schumann,  Anton  Rubinstein,  Hans  von  Biilow, 
and  Sir  Charles  Halle,  all  of  whom  died  between

1894  and  1896.  The  predominant  position  of  Pa- 
derewski  had  long  since  been  assured;  now,  how- 
ever, came  Moritz  Rosenthal  and  Eugen  d 'Albert, 
seeking  a  London  indorsement  of  the  reputations 
they  had  already  won  on  the  Continent  and  in 
America.  In  each  case  the  general  verdict  was 
emphatically  ratified.  Moritz  Rosenthal's  debut 
at  the  Richter  concerts  (June  10,  1895),  when  he 
played  the  Liszt  concerto  in  E  flat,  created  a  gen- 
uine sensation;  and  his  subsequent  recitals  con- 
firmed the  opinion  that  he  possessed  the  most  phe- 
nomenal technique  of  any  living  pianist. 

Eugen  d 'Albert  was  regarded  in  the  light  of  a 
^  ^  prodigal. ' '  A  native  of  Glasgow  and  educated  at 
the  National  Training  School  for  Music  in  London, 
he  might  with  all  fairness  have  been  termed  a  Brit- 
ish product.  He  preferred,  however,  to  call  himself 
a  German,  and  had  not  stood  upon  an  English  con- 
cert platform  since  boyhood  till  he  appeared  at 
Queen's  Hall  under  Felix  Mottl  (April  28,  1896), 
and  gave  a  magnificent  performance  of  Beetho- 
ven's E  flat  or  ^'Emperor"  concerto.  He  had  a 
cold  reception,  but  after  he  had  played  it  became 
evident  that  the  old  grievances  had  been  forgotten 
in  the  presence  of  a  legitimate  virtuoso,  of  a  true 
artist  possessing  the  fire  of  unmistakable  genius. 
Personally  I  admire  his  playing  immensely;  and 
as  an  interpreter  of  Beethoven,  it  is  upon  the  shoul- 
ders of  d 'Albert  that  the  mantle  of  Rubinstein,  to 
my  thinking,  has  fallen.  His  place  as  a  composer 
will  have  to  be  decided  by  a  future  generation.

Among  other  native  pianists  now  coming  to  the 
fore  were  Frederic  Lamond  and  Frederick  Dawson, 
natives  of  Scotland  and  Lancashire,  respectively, 
llona  Eibenschiitz,  a  pupil  of  Mme.  Schumann,  had 
become  quite  a  favorite;  and  the  romantic  school 
had  also  a  gifted  and  popular  exponent  in  the  clever 
Hungarian  artist  Benno  Schonberger.  Also  note- 
worthy were  the  debuts  at  about  the  same  time  of 
Emil  Sauer,  Ferrucio  Busoni,  and  Ossip  Gabrilo-

JEAN  DE  RESZKE  \S  first  appearance  as  a 
German  singer  in  Wagnerian  opera  was  des- 
tined to  take  place,  not  in  England,  but  in  America. 
This  was  during  the  winter  of  1895-96.  My  im- 
patience to  hear  him  sing  in  German  was  natural, 
for  I  had  fully  sympathized  with  his  desire  to 
escape  from  the  trammels  of  the  Italian  transla- 
tion, and  had  done  my  share  toward  paving  the  way 
for  his  mastery  of  the  original  text.  Fortune  was 
kind  enough  to  afford  me  an  earlier  opportunity 
than  I  had  anticipated  of  enjoying  the  fruit  of  this 
endeavor.  It  happened  that  at  Easter,  1896,  I 
paid  my  first  visit  to  the  United  States  for  the  pur- 
pose of  attending  the  production  of  the  comic  opera 
^  ^  El  Capitan, '  ^  of  which  my  brother,  Charles  Klein, 
was  the  author  and  John  Philip  Sousa  the  com- 
poser. Directly  after  that  successful  event  I  spent 
a  week  in  New  York,  just  when  Mr.  Grau  ^s  supple- 

419 


Thirty  Years  of 


mentary  season  at  the  Metropolitan  Opera  House 
was  approaching  its  close. 

I  had  hoped,  before  my  return  to  England,  to  hear 
both  ' '  Lohengrin '  ^  and  '  ^  Tristan ' '  in  German ;  but, 
as  it  turned  out,  I  could  not  remain  for  the  latter. 
My  passage  was  booked  for  Saturday,  and  ^  ^  Tris- 
tan'' was  not  to  be  given  until  the  following  Mon- 
day. In  vain  did  the  warm-hearted  Polish  brothers 
endeavor  to  i3ersuade  me  to  stay  and  sail  with  them 
on  Wednesday.  I  dared  not  delay  my  return  by  a 
single  day.  I  should  have  to  be  content,  therefore, 
with  hearing  ^ ^ Lohengrin, "  and  wait  for  ^'Tris- 
tan'' until  it  was  done  at  Covent  Garden  later  in 
the  spring.  That  is  precisely  what  did  occur;  but 
my  self-denial  was  first  to  receive  compensation 
in  the  shape  of  a  very  rare,  if  not  unparalleled  com- 
pliment—one of  those  tributes  of  personal  regard 
which  we  appreciate  most  when  they  are  perfectly 
spontaneous  and  unpremeditated. 

It  was  arranged  that  we  were  all  to  sup  together 
in  Mme.  Nordica's  apartments  at  the  Savoy  after 
the  performance  of  *' Lohengrin. "  Our  hostess 
was,  indeed,  the  heroine,  in  a  special  sense,  of  that 
representation;  for  after  the  bridal  scene  she  was 
presented  with  a  superb  diamond  tiara,  which  had 
been  subscribed  for  by  the  leaders  of  New  York 
society.  The  assemblage  was  one  of  the  most  bril- 
liant- and  crowded  of  the  season.  It  was  the  first 
time  I  ever  saw  the  Metropolitan  Opera  House,  and 
I  was  much  struck  with  its  handsome  proportions. 
Then  again,  under  Anton  Seidl  's  magic  wand,  the

AS   BRUNNHILDE

performance  touched  at  all  points  a  very  high  level 
of  excellence.  Finally,  I  derived  immense  pleasure 
from  the  novel  sensation  of  hearing  Jean  and 
Edouard  de  Reszke  as  exponents  of  Wagner 's  own 
text.  Their  conscientious  enunciation  of  each  syl- 
lable, their  accurate  diction,  and  their  admirable 
accent  seemed  to  impart  an  added  dignity  alike  to 
the  music  and  to  their  impersonations.  Even  the 
more  cultivated  listener  might  easily  have  im- 
agined them  to  be  native  German  singers.  Mme. 
Nordica,  too,  handled  the  German  words  with  re- 
markable facility  and  confidence.  Altogether,  it 
was  a  most  meritorious  achievement. 

The  subsequent  reunion  at  the  hotel  found  every 
one  in  the  highest  spirits.  Beside  the  three  artists, 
there  were  present  Mme.  Nordica  ^s  sister  (Mrs. 
Walker)  and  Mr.  Amherst  Webber,  the  talented 
English  maestro  at  piano^  who  had  recently  acted 
as  accompanist  to  the  brothers  in  their  Wagnerian 
studies.  After  supper  the  conversation  turned 
upon  Bayreuth,  and  allusion  was  made  to  a  certain 
half-promise  given  by  Jean  de  Eeszke  to  Frau  Co- 
sima,  that  he  would  one  day  sing  Tristan  and 
Walther,  or  perhaps  even  Siegfried,  at  the  festi- 
val. I  remarked  that,  after  what  I  had  heard 
that  night,  I  entertained  no  doubts  concerning  the 
adequate  quality  of  his  accent.  This  only  elicited 
a  further  request  that  I  would  stay  in  New  York 
until  I  had  heard  how  it  sounded  in  ^'Tristan.'' 
Then  the  distinguished  tenor  turned  to  Mme.  Nor- 
dica and  proposed  that,  as  I  was  evidently  not  to 


Thirty  Years  of 


be  made  to  alter  my  determination,  the  best  thing 
they  could  do  would  be  to  ^' bring  the  mountain 
to  Mohammed"  and  sing  some  ^* Tristan''  to  me 
there  and  then;  and  that  between  one  and  two  in 
the  morning,  and  after  a  heavy  opera  like  ' '  Lohen- 
grin"! Surely  it  was  not  possible.  But  surprise 
and  incredulity  quickly  changed  to  delight.  For, 
without  an  instant 's  hesitation,  Mme.  Nordica  con- 
sented ;  Mr.  Webber  went  to  the  piano  and  played 
a  few  introductory  bars;  and,  almost  before  I 
could  realize  what  was  being  done,  the  two  gifted 
artists  were  warbling  the  wondrous  love  scene  from 
Wagner's  immortal  music-drama. 

They  did  not  spare  themselves,  either,  these  gen- 
erous friends.  They  sang  with  full  voice;  they 
went  through  not  only  the  scene  with  which  they 
had  started,  but  the  duet  of  the  first  act  as  well; 
and,  from  beginning  to  end,  the  exquisite  beauty  of 
their  phrasing,  the  blending  of  their  voices  in  per- 
fect intonation  and  unity  of  color,  the  significance 
of  their  supreme  dramatic  interpretation,  con- 
stituted at  once  a  marvel  and  a  revelation.  It  was 
a  strange  experience,  sitting  at  the  supper-table 
(for  none  of  us  but  Mr.  Webber  had  moved  from 
our  seats)  while  for  an  hour  or  more  those  two 
famous  singers  reveled  in  the  enjoyment  of  their 
self-imposed  task— undertaken  for  the  sole  purpose 
of  conferring  pleasure  upon  an  old  friend.  The 
picture  of  that  night  remains  vividly  imprinted 
upon  my  mind,  even  as  its  vocal  spell  lives  fresh 
and  fragrant  among  my  most  treasured  memories.

Musical  Life  in  London 


I  shall  always  be  grateful  for  the  privilege  of  hav- 
ing listened  to  some  of  the  grandest  pages  of  *  ^  Tris- 
tan'' under  such  novel  and  interesting  conditions. 

A  month  later  the  de  Reszkes  were  at  Co  vent 
Garden,  giving  habitues  a  taste  of  their  quality  as 
German  singers  in  ''Lohengrin,"  ''Tristan,"  and 
"Die  Meistersinger. "  Their  success  was  unquali- 
fied. In  the  new  Tristan  was  hailed  the  beau-ideal 
—the  perfect  conception  and  the  complete  realiza- 
tion—of the  noblest  of  Wagner's  knightly  heroes. 
The  Konig  Marke  and  the  Hans  Sachs  of  Edouard 
de  Reszke  won  unstinted  admiration.  Also  to  be 
noted  was  the  Pogner  of  Pol  Plangon,  an  artist 
whose  magnificent  organ  and  supreme  gifts  alike 
as  singer  and  as  actor  had  by  this  time  won  him 
immense  popularity  in  London.  Unfortunately, 
Mme.  Nordica  did  not  come  that  season  to  share  in 
the  triumphs  of  the  new  German  campaign.  Al- 
bani  sang  Elsa  and  Isolde;  Emma  Eames  was  the 
Eva— and  a  delightful  one,  I  remember.  But  the 
Gallic  craze  was  still  rampant,  and  in  the  midst  of 
all  this  good  work  we  were  amazed  at  the  spectacle 
of  a  performance  of  "Die  Walkiire"  in  French, 
with  Alvarez  (not  Alvary,  poor  fellow!)  as  Sieg- 
mundy  Lola  Beeth  as  Sieglinde,  Mantelli  (sic)  as 
Bruymhilde,  Albers  as  Wot  an,  and  Castelmary  as 
Blinding!  Little  need  to  state  that  the  absurd  and 
useless  proceeding  was  a  dismal  failure. 

The  most  notable  event  of  the  season  of  1896  was, 
alas!  the  death  of  Sir  Augustus  Harris.  It  was 
in  the  middle  of  June,  at  a  moment  when  every- 

425 


Thirty  Years  of 


thing  appeared  bright  and  prosperous,  that  Lon- 
don was  startled  by  the  sudden  illness  and  prema- 
ture decease  of  its  favorite  manager.  Only  forty- 
four  years  of  age,  the  universally  popular  ^^Gus'' 
died  amid  general  expressions  of  sorrow.  Like 
Tom  Bowling  in  the  ballad,  *'his  friends  were 
many  and  true-hearted'';  these  mourned  for  the 
man.  But  countless  were  the  numbers  of  those  that 
had  never  known  him,  yet  deplored  the  loss  of  the 
genial  worker  who  had  catered  generously  to  their 
theatrical  amusement,  and  had  raised  opera  in 
England  from  a  ^^ moribund"  state  to  its  present 
flourishing  condition.  Harris  did  not  realize  the 
limit  of  his  physical  powers.  Though  his  heart 
was  only  in  two  or  three  undertakings,  his  brain 
and  hand  were  in  a  dozen.  When  death  overtook 
him  he  was  actually  struggling  to  revive  the  lan- 
guishing fortunes  of  the  huge  circus  business  known 
as  Olympia! 

^  ^  His  genius  was  of  that  Napoleonic  order  which 
comes  but  rarely  into  existence  and  still  more  rarely 
finds  its  exact  bent.  His  spirit  moved  with  the 
times;  it  was  fin  de  siecle  in  the  most  marked  de- 
gree, and  it  brooked  the  interference  of  tradition 
only  when  by  so  doing  it  could  secure  the  sur- 
vival of  the  fittest.  Where  the  public  taste  was 
concerned  his  instinct  seldom  erred;  he  knew  pre- 
cisely what  his  patrons  wanted  and  how  best  to 
give  it  them.  As  impresario,  manager,  entrepre- 
neur, dramatist,  librettist,  and  stage  manager,  all 
rolled  into  one,  he  was  absolutely  unique;  and  it

may  be  taken  for  granted  that  we  shall  ^ ne'er  look 
upon  his  like  again.'  "  These  words  are  as  true 
to-day  as  they  were  when  I  wrote  them  nearly  seven 
years  ago.  Sir  Augustus  Harris  was  buried  at  Ken- 
sal  Green  Cemetery,  in  the  presence  of  an  assem- 
blage numbering  many  thousands.  The  problem 
of  carrying  on  his  chief  operatic  concern  was  solved 
by  the  formation  of  the  Covent  Garden  Syndicate, 
the  capital  for  which  was  furnished  by  the  leading 
subscribers.  Of  this  body  Earl  de  Grey  and  Mr. 
H.  V.  Higgins  were  appointed  directors,  while  Mr. 
Maurice  Grau  undertook  the  duties  of  managing 
director,  and  Mr.  Neil  Forsyth  those  of  secretary. 
Many  other  notable  figures  disappeared  from  the 
scene  in  this  same  year— among  them  Mme.  Clara 
Schumann,  Sir  Joseph  Barnby^  Ambroise  Thomas, 
Frau  Klaf  sky,  Italo  Campanini,  Henry  Leslie,  and 
Lewis  Thomas,  the  Welsh  basso.  Of  these  the  most 
interesting  to  the  English  musical  community  in 
general  were  the  two  talented  choral  conductors, 
Joseph  Barnby  and  Henry  Leslie,  the  former  re- 
markable as  a  trainer  of  large  vocal  bodies,  as  that 
at  the  Albert  Hall ;  the  latter  well  known  as  the 
founder  and  leader  of  the  Leslie  Choir,  probably 
the  most  wonderful  embodiment  of  a  perfect  choral 
ensemble  that  London  ever  possessed,  not  except- 
ing even  the  Bach  Choir  in  its  best  days.  I  knew 
both  men  well,  but  was  more  intimately  acquainted 
with  Sir  Joseph  Barnby,  with  whom,  after  he  suc- 
ceeded Weist  Hill  as  principal  of  the  Guildhall 
School  of  Music,  I  was  brought  into  almost  daily 


429 


Thirty  Years  of 


association.  It  was  a  pity  he  ever  went  to  that 
institution.  The  work  killed  him,  even  as  the  dis- 
appointment of  failing  to  secure  the  appointment 
killed  his  rival  candidate,  Sir  William  Cusins. 

Barnby  is  now  remembered  more  for  his  church 
music  than  for  his  deeds  with  the  baton.  Yet  he 
told  me  once  that  his  greatest  ambition  was  to  be 
an  operatic  conductor;  and  I  quite  believed  that 
when  he  deprived  me  of  my  post  as  conductor  of 
the  opera  class  at  the  Guildhall  School  in  order  to 
fill  it  himself,— though  necessarily  in  perfunctory 
fashion,  for  he  could  not  really  spare  the  time. 
Well,  I  bore  him  no  grudge  on  that  account.  W^e 
were  the  best  of  friends  to  the  end;  and  when  he 
died  (January  28,  1896)  I  readily  complied  with 
Lady  Barnby  ^s  request  to  organize  the  arrange- 
ments for  the  funeral  service,  which  was  held  in  St. 
Paul's  Cathedral.  This  I  did  in  conjunction  with 
my  friend  Mr.  Alfred  Littleton,  and  in  order  to  ob- 
tain the  requisite  experience  for  directing  so  elabor- 
ate a  function  I  attended  the  funeral  of  Lord  Leigh- 
ton,  who  was  buried  in  the  cathedral  on  the  previous 
day.  The  crowds  were  enormous,  and  the  difficul- 
ties of  the  Barnby  ceremony  were  increased  in  that, 
after  the  service  at  St.  Paul's,  the  coffin  had  to  be 
taken  away  for  interment  at  Norwood  Cemetery. 
Five  years  later  I  was  called  upon  to  perform  a 
similar  mournful  duty  in  connection  with  the  fu- 
neral of  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan,  who,  like  Lord  Leigh- 
ton,  was  deemed  worthy  of  a  niche  in  the  crypt  of 
the  cathedral.    Neither  light  nor  pleasant  was  the 


430 


Musical  Life  in  London 


labor  of  arranging  these  solemn  functions ;  yet  they 
will  remain  always  among  the  proudest  and  most 
notable  events  of  my  life. 

I  seldom  attended  the  festivals  of  the  Three 
Choirs.  They  rarely  yielded  music  of  an  '' epoch- 
making''  character,  and  they  always  occurred  at 
the  beginning  of  September,  just  when  I  was  enjoy- 
ing my  hard-earned  holiday.  I  was  warned,  how- 
ever, not  to  miss  the  Worcester  Festival  of  1896; 
and  I  am  glad  I  did  not.  That  was  the  meeting 
which  lifted  Edward  Elgar  out  of  his  obscurity 
as  a  Malvern  teacher  and  revealed  him  to  his 
countrymen  as  a  musician  of  high  attainments  and 
still  higher  promise.  For  once  the  *' local  man" 
turned  out  to  be  something  better  than  your  or- 
dinary writer  of  ^  ^  Kapellmeistermusik ' ' ;  for  once 
the  dip  in  the  local  lottery-bag  yielded  a  genuine 
prize. 

Edward  Elgar  produced  at  this  festival  a  short 
oratorio  entitled  ^'The  Light  of  Life,''  founded 
upon  the  miracle  of  the  healing  of  the  blind  man, 
related  in  the  ninth  chapter  of  St.  John.  Its  ori- 
ginality, the  sense  of  proportion  and  tone-color  dis- 
played in  the  choral  and  orchestral  effects,  the  bold 
and  masterful  treatment  of  the  leading  themes, 
and  the  generally  engrossing  character  of  the  mu- 
sic fairly  took  connoisseurs  by  surprise,  and  pre- 
pared them  for  the  development  which  so  rapidly 
placed  Edward  Elgar  in  the  very  forefront  of  con- 
temporary British  composers.  From  ^^The  Light 
of  Life  "  to  ^ '  The  Dream  of  Gerontius ' '  represents 


431 


Thirty  Years  of 


an  enormous  stride,  and  every  phase  of  the  transi- 
tion is  replete  with  interest.  It  would  be  hard  to 
say  in  which  direction— orchestral  or  choral  mu- 
sic—his genius  shows  the  more  powerful  bent.  In 
both  it  seems  to  me  that  his  individuality  and  im- 
aginative force  are  equally  striking,  his  technical 
resources  equally  comprehensive ;  and,  at  the  same 
time,  fully  on  a  par  with  his  gifts  as  a  musician  are 
his  modest  and  unassuming  yet  sterling  qualities 
as  a  man. 

One  warm  July  night  in  1896  I  was  present 
at  a  large  musical  party  given  by  the  late  Mrs. 
Edward  Goetz  at  her  house  in  Hyde  Park  Ter- 
race. Always  enjoyable  were  the  entertainments 
of  this  liberal  and  sympathetic  patroness  of  the  art, 
who  was  a  daughter  of  Mr.  J.  M.  Levy,  the  founder 
of  the  '^  Daily  Telegraph, '^  and  sister  of  Sir  Ed- 
ward Lawson,  the  genial  proprietor  of  that  jour- 
nal. This,  however,  was  a  noteworthy  occasion, 
since  it  brought  to  a  first  hearing  a  composition 
which  was  destined  to  win  popularity  in  every  land 
where  English  song  flourishes— I  refer  to  Liza 
Lehmann's  graceful  and  fascinating  setting  of 
lines  from  Omar  Khayyam's  ^^Rubaiyat"  (''In  a 
Persian  Garden").  I  shall  not  readily  forget  the 
mingled  surprise  and  admiration  awakened  by  the 
novel  fragrance  and  charm  of  this  music,  remark- 
able at  once  for  its  sincerity  of  feeling  and  ex- 
pression and  the  subtle  beauty  of  its  harmonic 
structure.  The  solos  were  finely  rendered  by  Al- 
bani,  Hilda  Wilson,  Ben  Davies,  and  David  Bisp-

ham;  and  the  accompaniments  were  played  by 
the  composer,  who,  I  may  add,  seemed  to  be  not 
less  astonished  than  delighted  at  the  warmth  of  the 
compliments  showered  upon  her. 

During  the  following  December  ^'In  a  Persian 
Garden"  was  sung,  for  the  first  time  in  public,  at 
one  of  the  Popular  Concerts,  and  with  extraor- 
dinary success.  Apart  from  its  intrinsic  worth,  the 
new  song-cycle  was  especially  welcome  to  an  au- 
dience that  had  long  counted  Liza  Lehmann  the 
vocalist  among  its  particular  favorites.  In  that 
capacity,  indeed,  the  fair  musician  was  just  bidding- 
farewell  to  the  concert  platform  and  creating  a 
vacancy  that  might  have  remained  long  unfilled 
but  for  the  timely  debut  of  Blanche  Marchesi,  the 
accomplished  daughter  of  the  famous  Paris  teacher. 
Very  different  in  type  were  these  two  singers,  nor 
can  it  be  gainsaid  that  the  art  of  Blanche  Marchesi 
covers  a  wider  intellectual  grasp,  a  broader  range 
of  color,  a  greater  depth  of  dramatic  intensity  than 
that  which  distinguished  the  English  soprano. 
Yet  both  must  be  given  a  conspicuous  place  in  the 
group  of  artists  whose  talent  helped  at  this  time 
to  keep  alive  the  fading  glories  of  the  '^Pops.'^ 
For,  alas !  the  closing  years  of  the  nineteenth  cen- 
tury were  to  witness  a  sad  deterioration  in  the 
quality  of  these  renowned  concerts.  The  secession 
of  Joachim  and  the  death  of  Piatti  eliminated  the 
last  links  that  held  intact  the  chain  of  the  old 
subscribers.  The  support  fell  away,  and  with  the 
resignation    of   Arthur    Chappell    the   institution

finally  lost  the  prestige  and  the  value  that  had 
earned  it  renown  for  a  period  of  over  forty  years. 

Among  the  remarkable  old  men  of  music  whose 
light  died  out  with  the  expiring  months  of  the  last 
century  was  my  dear  friend  Charles  Kensington 
Salaman.  His  active  labors  as  composer  and 
teacher  had  long  ceased;  but  his  brain  was  ever 
alert  and  ever  busy  amid  his  storehouse  of  mem- 
ories of  a  bygone  age.  He  could  tell  of  a  visit  to 
the  famous  singer  Catalani  (heard  for  the  last  time 
in  England  at  the  York  Festival  in  1828),  and  he 
could  describe  the  sensations  with  which  he  had 
played  duets  with  Liszt  when  the  Weimar  pianist 
first  came  to  London  as  a  boy  of  eleven.  It  was  a 
rare  pleasure  to  listen  to  Charles  Salaman 's  anec- 
dotes ;  to  sit  by  him  as  he  played  with  still  wonder- 
ful facility  and  grace  some  quaint  old  show-piece ; 
or  to  sing  while  he  accompanied  some  such  exqui- 
site lyric  as  his  lovely  setting  of  Shelley's  *^I  arise 
from  dreams  of  thee.''  It  was  his  habit  always 
to  celebrate  his  birthday  by  composing  a  new  song 
to  lines  specially  written  by  his  son  Malcolm,  and 
not  the  least  charming  of  these  efforts  was  the 
^^Love  Song"  which  commemorated  his  eightieth 
birthday  on  March  3, 1894.  He  was  visited  on  these 
occasions  by  some  of  the  foremost  musical  and  the- 
atrical celebrities  in  the  metropolis.  But  after 
keeping  up  the  charter  another  two  or  three  years 
his  health  gradually  failed  and  he  died  amid  uni- 
versal regrets. 

In  the  spring  of  1897  Giacomo  Puccini  paid  his 

436 


Musical  Life  in  London 

second  visit  to  England,  to  superintend  the  produc- 
tion of  his  opera  *'La  Boheme''  by  the  Carl  Rosa 
company  at  Manchester.  The  young  Italian  com- 
poser had  achieved  only  a  moderate  success  with 
his  ^^Manon  Lescaut"  at  Covent  Garden  three 
years  before,  and  was  anxious  to  add  to  his  laurels. 
On  joining  him  at  Manchester  the  afternoon  of 
the  premiere,  I  found  him  in  very  low  spirits.  He 
was  not  satisfied  with  the  Carl  Rosa  artists,  and 
fully  anticipated  a  fiasco  for  the  English  represen- 
tation of  *'La  Boheme.^'  I  assured  him  that  Carl 
Rosa  singers  (as  distinguished  from  Carl  Rosa 
^  ^ directors ' ')  did  not  know  the  meaning  of  the  word 
^'fail'^;  the  intelligence  and  ensemble  of  the  com- 
pany were  bound  to  pull  him  through.  And  so  it 
proved.  Deficient  as  it  was  in  many  respects,  there 
was,  nevertheless,  so  much  spirit  and  animation 
about  the  performance,  such  a  flavor  of  Bohemian 
jollity,  that  the  opera  instantly  won  the  favor  of 
the  Lancashire  audience  and  paved  the  way  for 
its  subsequent  London  success.^ 

With  the  Covent  Garden  season  of  1897  the  work 
of  the  new  regime  fairly  began.  Mr.  Maurice  Grau 
made  his  entry  upon  the  scene,  nominally  as  the 
successor  to  Sir  Augustus  Harris ;  and  he  paid  that 
impresario  the  highest  compliment  in  his  power 

*  The  cast  was  as  follows :  Budolph,  Mr.  Eobert  Cunningham ; 
Marcel,  Mr.  William  Paull;  Colline,  Mr.  A.  S.  Winckworth; 
Schaunard,  Mr.  C.  Tilbury;  Benoit,  Mr.  Homer  Lind;  Musetta, 
Miss  Bessie  MacDonald;  and  Mimi,  Miss  Alice  Esty.  Mr.  Claude 
Jaquinot  conducted,  and  Mr.  T.  H.  Friend  was  the  stage  manager.

by  frankly  pursuing  the  lines  that  had  marked  the 
previous  managerial  policy  of  the  establishment. 
Not  a  single  innovation  worthy  of  the  name  had  to 
be  recorded.  As  in  America,  so  in  London,  Mr. 
Grau  found  that  it  would  be  impossible  for  him 
to  do  better  at  the  head  of  a  big  operatic  concern 
than  steer  the  exact  course  that  had  been  followed 
during  the  preceding  decade  by  Augustus  Harris. 
The  usual  sixty-seven  performances  were  given, 
and  altogether  eighteen  operas  were  mounted;  no 
fewer  than  half  of  these  were  sung  in  French.  The 
novelties  were  ^'Der  Evangelimann, '  ^  a  sentimen- 
tal work  by  Wilhelm  Kienzl,  in  which  the  tenor 
Van  Dyck  scored  a  great  success;  and  ^'Inez 
Mendo, ' '  a  meritorious  opera  from  the  pen  of  Fre- 
deric d'Erlanger,  wherein  Mme.  Frances  Saville, 
a  new  soprano,  and  M.  Renaud,  the  barytone  from 
the  Paris  Opera,  sustained  the  principal  parts. 
Other  debutants  of  the  season  were  Miss  Susan 
Strong,  Mile.  Pacary,  Fraulein  Sedlmair,  Andreas 
Dippel,  Salignac,  Marcel  Journet,  Fugere,  Lem- 
priere  Pringle,  and  Thomas  Meux. 

The  brunt  of  more  than  two  months'  hard  work 
was  borne  by  Jean  and  Edouard  de  Reszke,  toge- 
ther with  Mme.  Emma  Fames  and  David  Bispham, 
gifted  American  artists  who  notably  strengthened 
their  London  reputations  in  the  course  of  this  sea- 
son. *  Mme.  Melba  appeared  in  a  round  of  familiar 
impersonations,  while  the  sterling  qualities  of  MM. 
Alvarez  and  Plangon  now  began  to  earn  for  those 
singers  a  wider  circle  of  admirers.    From  the  be-

ginning  of  the  season  until  the  end  of  June  the 
German  operas  were  conducted  by  the  late  Anton 
Seidl,  and  the  memory  of  this,  his  last  appearance 
at  Covent  Garden,  is  associated  with  some  exceed- 
ingly fine  performances. 

Among  the  visitors  to  London  during  the  latter 
part  of  the  year  were  Edvard  Grieg  and  his  wife, 
and  the  clever  composer  of  ^^  Hansel  und  Gretel," 
Engelbert  Humperdinck.  The  former  appeared  at 
the  Popular  and  other  concerts,  beside  paying  a 
visit  to  the  Queen  at  Windsor;  while  Humperdinck 
made  his  debut,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Philhar- 
monic Society,  at  the  last  of  an  autumn  series  of 
concerts  and  conducted  some  excerpts  from  his 
operas  with  signal  success.  Yet  another  distin- 
guished composer,  Moritz  Moskowski,  appeared  at 
the  Philharmonic  during  the  same  series,  after  an 
absence  from  London  of  over  eleven  years.  He 
brought  nothing  new,  but  conducted  with  much 
spirit  his  violin  concerto  (played  by  M.  Gregoro- 
witsch)  and  three  movements  from  his  opera  *'Bo- 
abdil'^;  a  contralto  air,  also  from  the  latter  work, 
was  rendered  by  Mile.  Olitzka. 

The  debut  of  a  son-in-law  of  Queen  Victoria  in 
the  capacity  of  operatic  librettist  was  an  interest- 
ing feature  of  the  Carl  Rosa  season  held  at  Covent 
Garden  during  the  autumn  of  1897,  the  year  of 
Her  Majesty 's  ^ '  Diamond  Jubilee. ' '  Twenty  years 
previous  a  cousin  of  the  Queen,  the  then  reigning 
Grand  Duke  Ernest  of  Saxe  Coburg-Gotha,  had 
figured  upon  the  same  scene  as  the  composer  of  an

opera  called  ^^  Santa  Chiara.'^  In  the  present  in- 
stance it  was  the  Marquis  of  Lome  (now  the  Duke 
of  Argyll),  husband  of  that  amiable  and  accom- 
plished lady,  the  Princess  Louise,  who  was  respon- 
sible for  the  text  of  Hamish  MaeCunn^s  romantic 
opera  '^Diarmid'^;  and  such  was  the  striking  all- 
round  merit  of  this  work  that,  but  for  the  weak- 
ness of  the  denouement  and  an  unfortunate  resem- 
blance to  the  plot  of  ^'Tristan  und  Isolde,"  which 
evoked  inevitable  comparisons,  it  might  have 
earned  enduring  success.  As  it  was,  I  fancy  the 
Marquis  derived  his  principal  reward  from  the 
amusement  of  attending  the  rehearsals,  which  he 
did  regularly,  in  company  with  the  Princess,  who 
would  watch  the  proceedings  from  the  corner  of  a 
private  box. 

The  Queen 's  love  of  music  was  at  no  period  more 
strongly  evinced  than  during  the  last  few  years  of 
her  life.  She  turned  to  it  for  solace  and  comfort 
in  her  old  age,  and  derived  the  keenest  pleasure 
from  the  performances  of  the  various  artists  who 
were  invited  in  quick  succession  to  labor  for  her 
enjoyment.  Her  devoted  daughters.  Princess 
Christian  and  Princess  Henry  of  Battenberg,  were 
ever  on  the  alert  to  procure  talent  for  this  purpose ; 
scarcely  a  week  passed  but  that  some  artist  of  note 
played  or  sang  in  the  royal  drawing-rooms  at 
Windsor,  Osborne,  or  Balmoral.  Lengthy,  indeed, 
must  be  the  list  of  those,  from  the  diva  downward, 
who  can  point  with  pride  to  their  jeweled  brooch 
or  pin  bearing  the  familiar  monogram  ^  ^  V.  R.  I. " ;

while  many,  too,  can  display  even  costlier  gifts 
that  were  received,  after  repeated  visits,  as  tokens 
of  Her  Majesty's  grateful  appreciation.  A  select 
few  had  bestowed  upon  them  the  insignia  of  the 
Royal  Victoria  Order ;  and  the  first  musician  to  be 
thus  honored,  after  Sir  Arthur  Sullivan  and  Signor 
Tosti,  was  M.  Jean  de  Reszke,  who  received  the 
cross  of  the  ^^R.  V.  0.*'  (fourth  class)  after  a 
performance  of  ^'Lohengrin''  at  Windsor  Castle 
on  the  Queen's  eightieth  birthday.  May  24,  1899. 
His  brother  was  similarly  decorated  fourteen 
months  later,  after  a  representation  of  ^ 'Faust "— 
the  last  occasion  on  which  Queen  Victoria  ever  lis- 
tened to  an  opera. 

The  birthday  celebration  was  marked  by  one  or 
two  curious  incidents.  To  begin  with,  only  the  first 
and  third  acts  of  '^ Lohengrin"  could  be  given. 
There  was  hardly  time  to  include  the  second,  as 
these  royal  functions  do  not  commence  until  nearly 
ten  o  'clock  at  night.  The  plot,  however,  was  fully 
explained  to  the  Queen,  who  had  never  heard  Wag- 
ner's  opera,  and  the  temptation  of  Elsa  (Mme.  Nor- 
dica)  by  the  perfidious  Ortrud  (Mme.  Schumann- 
Heink)  and  her  spouse  (David  Bispham)  was 
easily  ' '  taken  as  read. ' '  Mancinelli  conducted,  and 
everything  went  capitally  until  the  fall  of  the  cur- 
tain. Her  Majesty  then  retired  to  one  of  the  draw- 
ing-rooms and  requested  that  the  principal  artists 
be  presented  to  her,  together  with  Mr.  Maurice 
Grau  as  managing  director  of  the  Royal  Opera. 

The  awful  discovery  was  then  made  that  neither 


443 


Thirty  Years  of 


Jean  nor  Edouard  de  Reszke  had  with  him  any  but 
the  operatic  garments  in  which  they  stood.  It  was 
the  first  time  that  the  brothers  had  ever  appeared 
in  opera  before  the  Queen,  and,  not  knowing  that 
it  was  usual  to  don  evening  dress  for  the  subsequent 
presentation,  they  had  clothed  themselves  as  Lo- 
hengrin and  Heinrich  der  Vogler  before  leaving 
London,  and  had  traveled  to  Windsor  in  dark 
cloaks  of  sufficient  amplitude  to  conceal  themselves 
from  the  gaze  of  an  inquisitive  Cockney  crowd. 
The  situation  was  duly  explained  to  Her  Majesty, 
who  laughingly  declared  that  it  did  not  matter  in 
the  least;  for  once  court  etiquette  should  be  disre- 
garded, and  the  two  artists  brought  before  her  in 
their  picturesque  stage  attire.  The  command  was 
forthwith  obeyed,  and  the  Queen,  in  course  of  con- 
versation with  the  brothers, ' '  expressed  the  delight 
that  it  had  afforded  her  at  last  to  hear  them  in 
opera  and  listen  to  the  beautiful  music  of  Wagner's 
work. ' ' 

Queen  Victoria  never  heard  Jean  de  Eeszke 
again.  In  the  summer  of  1900,  when  '  ^  Faust ' '  was 
given  at  Windsor,  he  was  not  well  enough  to  sing, 
and  a  substitute  was  forthcoming  in  the  new  French 
tenor  Saleza.  I  accompanied  Edouard  de  Reszke 
to  the  castle  and  was  present  at  the  performance. 
The  Marguerite  was  that  sympathetic  artist  Mme. 
Suzai;ne  Adams,  to  whom,  afterward,  Her  Majesty 
personally  handed  a  handsome  sapphire  and  dia- 
mond bracelet.  Philippe  Flon  was  the  conductor, 
and  the  cast  further  included  Mile.  Bauermeister,

Mile.  Maubourg,  and  M.  Declery,  with  M.  Almanz 
as  regisseur.  The  remarkable  feature  of  that  even- 
ing was  the  mental  and  physical  endurance  shown 
by  the  aged  sovereign,  who  was  now  so  near  to  the 
close  of  her  august  career.  It  was  a  hot,  sultry 
July  night,  and  although  several  cuts  were  made, 
the  opera  was  not  over  until  nearly  twelve  o  'clock. 
From  the  beginning  to  the  end  the  Queen  remained 
deeply  interested,  and  never  stirred  from  her  chair 
upon  the  dais.  It  was  only  as  she  walked  down  the 
inclined  gangway,  passing  within  a  yard  of  where 
I  stood,  and  leaning  heavily  upon  the  arm  of  her 
Indian  attendant,  that  I  perceived  how  intensely 
fatigued  Her  Majesty  was.  Her  face  bore  a  look 
of  exhaustion  that  indicated  actual  suffering.  Yet 
there  was  no  suggestion  of  dispensing  with  the  cus- 
tomary reception.  From  the  door  of  the  Waterloo 
Chamber  the  Queen's  chair  was  wheeled  through 
St.  George's  Hall  to  the  Green  Drawing-room, 
and  quite  forty  minutes  more  must  have  elapsed 
ere  the  ceremony  of  receiving  the  artists  and  giv- 
ing them  their  presents  was  over.  Whether  work 
or  pleasure  was  involved,  Victoria  the  Good  never 
sought  to  spare  herself  in  the  rendering  of  those 
courtesies  which  she  thought  she  owed  to  others. 
It  was  just  six  months  after  witnessing  this 
^^ Faust"  performance  that  Her  Majesty  breathed 
her  last  at  Osborne  House.

Operatic  retrogression— The  seasons  of  1898,  1899,  and  1900— 
Purchase  of  the  Covent  Garden  lease — The  "Perosi  craze" — 
Final  remarks  on  the  Harris  regime — Death  of  Sims  Reeves 
— Edward  Lloyd's  retirement — English  singers  and  English 
festivals :  a  concluding  retrospect. 

EVERY  period  of  change  and  reform  gives 
place  to  a  corresponding  spell  of  plodding, 
mechanical  labor  upon  the  lines  that  public  appre- 
ciation has  indorsed.  By  comparison  with  the 
decade  extending  from  1887  to  1897,  the  story  of 
operatic  progress  during  the  succeeding  five  years 
is  dull  and  uninteresting.  That  is  an  excellent  rea- 
son for  treating  it  with  brevity,  if  not,  indeed,  for 
bringing  it  to  a  conclusion,  as  far  as  these  pages  are 
concerned,  with  all  convenient  speed.  The  spirit  of 
innovation  died  when  Sir  Augustus  Harris  ^^  shuf- 
fled off  this  mortal  [operatic]  coil.''  The  tempo- 
rary association  of  Mr.  Maurice  Grau  with  the  man- 
agement of  Covent  Garden  only  tended  to  crystal- 
lize the  identical  systems  of  supply  and  demand 
which  had  already  distinguished  the  leading  lyric 
theatres  of  London  and  New  York.  The  dead  im- 
presario's  successors  contented  themselves  with  a 
mild  imitation  of  the  Harris  policy,  plus  a  cred- 
itable endeavor  to  ameliorate  the  materiel— they 

448

could  not  well  improve  the  personnel— of.  their  es- 
tablishment. Beyond  that,  there  has  been  neither 
initial  energy  nor  imagination  to  widen  the  scope 
and  elevate  the  character  of  this  important  enter- 
prise. 

The  last  two  or  three  seasons  of  the  nineteenth 
century  may  be  very  briefly  dismissed.  In  1898 
the  novelties  at  Covent  Garden  were  Saint-Saens^s 
' '  Henry  VIII ' '  and  Mancinelli  's  ' '  Ero  e  Leandro. ' ' 
In  the  former,  Mme.  Heglon  made  her  debut  as 
Anne  Boleyn,  and  M.  Renaud  gave  an  extremely 
picturesque  embodiment  of  ^^  bluff  King  HaP'  as 
viewed  through  a  pair  of  French  pince-nez.  The 
chief  parts  in  Mancinelli 's  opera  ^  were  created  by 
Eames,  Schumann-Heink,  Saleza,  and  Plangon. 
Another  noteworthy  feature  was  the  revival  of 
^*Der  Ring  des  Nibelungen"  under  Felix  Mottl. 
In  this  Jean  de  Reszke  made  his  first  appearance 
in  the  role  of  Siegfried,  and  a  splendid  series  of 
casts  included,  among  others,  Nordica,  Ternina, 
Eames,  Schumann-Heink,  Marie  Brema,  Yon  Art- 
ner,  Meisslinger,  Van  Dyck,  Dippel,  Van  Rooy,  and 
Edouard  de  Reszke.  The  general  troupe  further 
comprised  Melba,  Calve,  Zelie  de  Lussan,  Frances 
Saville,  Suzanne  Adams,  Saleza,  and  Campanari, 
of  whom  the  last  three  then  sang  in  London  for  the 
first  time.  The  success  of  the  young  American  de- 
butante, who  subsequently  became  the  wife  of  Mr. 
Leo  Stern,  the  violoncellist,  was  especially  marked.

Festival  of  1896.

Thirty  Years  of 


The  profits  in  1898  and  1899  were  larger  than 
during  any  like  period  since  the  operatic  renais- 
sance began ;  but  from  an  artistic  standpoint  prog- 
ress was  no  longer  reflected  in  the  deeds  of  the 
Covent  Garden  management.  The  season  of  1899 
yielded  but  a  single  novelty,  namely,  Isidore  de 
Lara's  ^ * Messaline. "  True,  this  was  the  work  of 
an  Englishman;  but  it  was  composed  to  a  French 
libretto  and  performed  by  French  artists,  and  it 
owed  its  hearing  exclusively  to  foreign  influence. 
Its  success,  despite  the  glamour  of  its  picturesque 
Roman  setting,  and  notwithstanding  the  art  of 
Heglon,  Alvarez,  and  Renaud,  must  perforce  be 
described  as  equivocal.  The  story  at  best  is  re- 
volting ;  and  the  music  combines  with  a  few  fine  mo- 
ments many  dull  quarts  d'heure.  Wagner  again 
played  a  prominent  part,  his  works  furnishing  just 
one  third  of  the  seventy-one  representations  that 
made  up  the  season.  These  were  directed,  with  two 
exceptions,  by  Dr.  Muck,  one  of  the  conductors  of 
the  Berlin  Hof-Oper.  Conspicuous  therein  were 
some  magnificent  impersonations  by  Mme.  Lilli 
Lehmann,  who  had  not  been  heard  in  London  for 
many  years,  and  by  Mme.  Gadski,  who  now  made 
her  debut  at  Covent  Garden  and  at  once  earned 
the  favor  due  to  an  artist  of  rare  vocal  and  his- 
trionic attainments.  Of  the  other  new-comers 
neither  Mile.  Lucienne  Breval  nor  Mile.  Litvinne 
did  herself  complete  justice ;  but  Mme.  Louise  Ho- 
mer created  a  satisfactory  impression,  and  a  posi-

tive  hit  was  scored  by  Signor  Scotti,  one  of  the 
most  versatile  and  accomplished  barytones  that 
Italy  has  sent  forth  in  recent  years.  Jean  de 
Reszke  sang  only  nine  nights  and  was  then  com- 
pelled by  illness  to  seek  rest ;  in  the  following  win- 
ter, however,  he  was  singing  in  America  with  all 
his  wonted  vigor  and  charm. 

Early  in  1899  the  inheritor  of  the  Covent  Gar- 
den lease,  Mr.  Gr.  F.  Faber,  disposed  of  the  theatre 
to  the  Grand  Opera  Syndicate,  for  the  remainder 
of  his  term,  for  the  sum  of  £110,000.  This  de- 
sirable consummation,  which  was  brought  about 
through  the  efforts  of  Mr.  Alfred  de  Rothschild, 
had  the  effect  of  placing  the  entire  concern  upon  a 
sound  and  solid  footing.  The  syndicate  was  formed 
into  a  limited  liability  company,  the  list  of  share- 
holders being  headed  by  the  Prince  of  Wales  (now 
King  Edward  VII)  and  composed  very  largely  of 
the  opera  subscribers,  who  thus  became  directly  in- 
terested in  the  financial  prosperity  of  the  general 
undertaking.  The  direction  of  the  company  re- 
mained in  the  same  hands,  but  Mr.  Grau  did  not 
long  continue  the  heavy  labors  involved  in  his 
double  impresarioship.  Another  couple  of  years 
of  fruitful  toil,  and  then  he  relinquished  his  Lon- 
don duties  altogether,  so  far  as  opera  was  con- 
cerned, thenceforth  devoting  himself  with  in- 
creased energy  to  the  sister  enterprise  in  New  York. 
He  was  succeeded  as  artistic  director  at  Covent 
Garden  by  M.  Andre  Messager,  the  composer  of 


453 


Thirty  Years  of 


^ '  La  Basoche ' '  and  other  works,  whose  experience 
as  conductor  and  joint  manager  of  the  Paris  Opera- 
Comique  eminently  fitted  him  for  the  post. 

This  same  year,  by  the  way,  witnessed  the  brief 
*^Perosi  craze.''  How  that  purely  artificial  vogue 
ever  came  to  extend  beyond  the  walls  of  the  Italian 
churches  no  one  knows.  At  least  it  should  have 
stopped  short  at  Paris,  which  was  as  far  as  the 
youthful  abbe  himself  contrived  to  get  on  his  road 
to  London.  But  for  a  time  the  ^' craze"  raged  in 
England  with  the  virulence  of  an  epidemic,  and 
many  sane  musicians  persuaded  themselves  that 
the  new  oratorio  composer  was  a  genius  of  the  first 
magnitude.  His  ^'Transfiguration,"  his  '^ Raising 
of  Lazarus,"  and  his  '^ Resurrection  of  Christ" 
were  all  performed  at  the  London  Musical  Festi- 
val which  Robert  Newman  started  at  Queen's  Hall 
in  May;  while  his  '^ Passion  of  Christ"  was  given 
at  the  Norwich  Festival  in  the  autumn.  In  each 
instance,  however,  there  was  felt  a  keen  sense  of 
disappointment.  At  best  Perosi's  works  could  ap- 
peal only  to  the  ear  amid  ecclesiastical  surround- 
ings, and  even  there  their  woeful  lack  of  originality 
was  bound  to  irritate  the  critical  listener.  Far  more 
interesting  as  choral  events  were  the  first  per- 
formances in  England  (at  the  Gloucester  Festival) 
of  Professor  Horatio  Parker's  '^ Hora  Novissima" ; 
the  revival  (at  Albert  Hall)  of  Wagner's  scriptural 
scene  for  male  voices  and  orchestra,  ''The  Last 
Supper  of  the  Apostles";  and  the  restoration,  by

Bridge,  of  the  original  accomiDaniments  to  Han- 
dePs  ^'Messiah.'' 

The  opera  season  of  1900,  the  last  touched  upon 
in  this  chronicle,  offered  to  a  contented  public  prac- 
tically the  same  company,  the  same  repertory,  the 
same  familiar  commingling  of  brilliant  individual 
efforts  and  unsurpassable  artistic  resources,  toge- 
ther, alas!  with  a  growing  roughness  of  ensemble 
and  a  lamentable  mediocrity  of  mise  en  scene.  It 
was  the  last  London  opera  season  in  which  Jean 
de  Reszke  had  thus  far  taken  part ;  and  even  that 
appearance  was  attended  by  a  ^^ partial  eclipse,'* 
the  climate  of  the  British  metropolis  once  more 
proving  so  seriously  detrimental  to  the  vocal  or- 
gans of  the  famous  tenor  that  he  was  unable  to  com- 
plete his  engagement.  Two  cycles  of  the  ^^Ring'* 
were  given,  and  among  the  new  members  of  the  cast 
were  Frau  Gulbranson,  Miss  Edyth  Walker,  Frau- 
lein  Hieser,  Herr  Ernst  Kraus,  Herr  Briesemeister, 
Herr  Slezak,  Herr  Bertram,  and  Herr  Klopfer.  In 
the  direction  of  the  German  operas,  Felix  Mottl 
was  assisted  by  that  admirable  conductor  Emil 
Paur,  who  made  a  highly  satisfactory  impression. 
Distinct  hits  were  achieved  also  by  the  clever  young 
light  soprano,  Fraulein  Fritzi  Scheff;  by  Signor 
Bonci,  a  sympathetic  Italian  tenor  of  the  old  school ; 
and  by  Mr.  Blass,  an  American  basso  of  German 
parentage  and  training. 

Puccini's  ^^Tosca"  was  the  solitary  new  opera 
produced  in  1900,  and,  thanks  to  the  genius  of 
Fraulein  Ternina,  its  many  beauties  were  at  once

Thirty  Years  of 


made  patent  to  all  who  were  willing  to  perceive 
them.  That  artist's  superb  assumption  of  Floria 
Tosca,  coming  as  it  did  on  top  of  a  series  of  tri- 
umphs in  such  roles  as  Brilnnhilde,  Sieglinde,  Elsa, 
Elisabeth,  and  Leonora,  was  but  another  revela- 
tion of  her  versatility  and  of  her  vocal  and  his- 
trionic charm.  This  was  Ternina's  first  essay  as 
the  heroine  of  Puccini 's  picturesque  work,  and  she 
received  excellent  support  from  De  Lucia  as  Pietro 
Cavaradossi,  and  from  Scotti  as  Scarpia— this  last 
a  creation  which  has  won  universal  recognition  as 
an  ideal  presentment  of  one  of  the  most  subtle  and 
malevolent  figures  in  modern  opera.  Altogether  it 
was  a  splendid  performance,  and  Luigi  Mancinelli 
conducted  it  in  his  most  masterly  manner.  In  the 
German  operas  the  increasing  success  of  Mme. 
Gadski  became  conspicuously  characteristic;  while 
Mme.  Melba  extended  her  repertory  with  a  piquant 
impersonation  of  Rosina  in  ^^11  Barbiere."  Mme. 
Calve  was  content  to  travel  within  the  limited  cir- 
cle of  her  old  round  of  parts. 

The  following  table  indicates  roughly  the  extent 
of  the  work  accomplished  during  the  regular  Lon- 
don season,  by  the  late  Sir  Augustus  Harris  and 
his  successors,  during  the  thirteen  years  that  came 
after  the  tentative  Drury  Lane  season  of  1887 :

A  casual  glance  at  these  figures  will  suffice  to 
show  how  curiously  in  the  nature  of  an  *'arc''  are 
the  rise  and  fall  in  the  labor  and  energy  which 
evolved  them.  In  1894,  exactly  half  way  between 
1888  and  1900,  was  reached  the  high-water  mark 
of  activity  under  the  Harris  regime.  I  disregard 
the  sudden  ^' bulge''  of  1891,  because  in  that  year 
the  season  was  unduly  extended,  and  there  were 
then  but  twenty  operas  in  the  repertory.  Three 
years  later  it  attained  the  remarkable  total  of 
twenty-seven  operas,  an  achievement  never  even 
equaled,  much  less  surpassed,  in  subsequent  sea- 
sons. But  it  is  not  altogether  by  aggregate  re- 
sults that  the  value  of  Augustus  Harris's  operatic 
work  can  be  reckoned ;  it  lies  in  the  fact  that  opera, 
both  in  London  and  in  New  York,  is  to-day  a  living 
thing— a  prosperous,  not  a  ^^ moribund"  institu- 
tion. Nay,  more:  instead  of  being  the  ^'Italian 
Opera"  of  our  fathers,  with  all  its  miserable  limi- 
tations and  inartistic  conventionalities,  it  is  an 
opera  that  combines  the  three  great  schools  of  the 

459 


Thirty  Years  of 


art  in  one  organization,  and  presents  their  master- 
pieces in  the  languages  in  which  they  were  written. 
To  render  the  system  perfect  it  needs  to  be  less 
wholly  dependent  upon  the  social  equation;  but 
that  desirable  result  never  will  be  accomplished, 
either  in  England  or  in  America,  until  opera  has 
been  released  from  the  shackles  of  the  foreign 
tongue  and  driven  right  home  to  the  hearts  of  the 
people  through  the  medium  of  their  own  good 
Anglo-Saxon  vernacular. 

Strange  was  it  that  the  closing  weeks  of  the  cen- 
tury were  to  see  the  English  concert-room  de- 
prived of  its  two  greatest  tenors.  In  October,  1900, 
Sims  Reeves  died  at  the  ripe  old  age  of  eighty- two ; 
two  months  later  Edward  Lloyd  went  into  retire- 
ment after  giving  a  memorable  farewell  concert  at 
the  Royal  Albert  Hall.  It  may  not  be  uninteresting 
to  compare  these  two  supreme  artists.  In  many 
ways,  notably  as  to  character  of  voice  and  method, 
they  were  as  unlike  as  two  singers  could  be;  but 
each  in  his  own  fashion  exemplified  the  purest  at- 
tributes of  the  bel  canto  and  upheld  the  best  tra- 
ditions of  the  British  oratorio  school.  Sims  Reeves 
in  the  original  instance  was  an  opera-singer.  I 
once  heard  him  in  opera,  but  he  was  then  nearly 
sixty,  and  had  long  abandoned  his  stage  career.  I 
first  heard  him  sing  at  the  Norwich  Festival  of 
1866,  when  he  took  part  in  Costa's  oratorio  *^Naa- 
man."  His  voice  was  then  still  in  its  prime.  A 
more  exquisite  illustration  of  what  is  termed  the 
true  Italian  tenor  quality  it  would  be  impossible  to 

460 


Musical  Life  in  London 


imagine;  and  this  delicious  sweetness,  this  rare 
combination  of  ''velvety'^  richness  with  ringing 
timbre,  he  retained  in  diminishing  volume  almost 
to  the  last. 

It  is  probable  that  Sims  Reeves  lost  more  money 
through  unfulfilled  engagements  than  any  other 
singer  that  ever  lived.  He  himself  computed  the 
total  amount  thus  eliminated  from  his  banking  ac- 
count, during  a  career  of  half  a  century,  at  £80,000 
($400,000).  An  eighth  of  this  sum  would  have 
sufficed  to  spare  him  the  rigid  economy  and  the 
necessity  for  music-hall  work  which  marred  the 
closing  years  of  his  existence.  In  the  early  '  ^  nine- 
ties ' '  he  took  up  teaching  and  accepted  a  professor- 
ship at  the  Guildhall  School,  where  we  frequently 
came  in  contact.  I  asked  him  once  whether  there 
had  always  been  good  and  sufficient  cause  for  his 
disappointing  the  public  so  frequently. 

^ '  Well,  perhaps  not  always, ' '  replied  the  veteran 
tenor.  ^^That  is  to  say,  I  have  no  doubt  it  would 
have  been  possible  very  often  for  me  to  have  sung, 
if  I  had  made  the  effort.  But  the  very  fact  that  it 
would  have  required  an  effort  was  enough  to  pre- 
vent me  from  trying.  You  see,  my  throat  has  al- 
ways been  delicate,  and  at  the  slightest  sign  of 
hoarseness  I  have  been  afraid  to  sing,  lest  I  should 
impose  a  strain  upon  my  vocal  cords.  If  I  had  not 
been  so  careful,  who  knows  but  that  my  voice  would 
have  given  out  long  ago,  instead  of  being  as  fresh 
and  strong  to-day  as  at  any  time  these  twenty 
years  1 ' '    That  may  have  been  absolutely  true.    As 

461 


Thirty  Years  of 


it  was,  Sims  Reeves  was  unquestionably  the  best- 
preserved  male  singer  of  his  time.  To  hear  him, 
long  after  he  had  passed  the  age  of  seventy,  sing 
^^ Adelaide"  or  ^^ Deeper  and  deeper  still"  or  '^The 
Message"  was  an  exposition  of  breath  control,  of 
tone-coloring,  of  phrasing  and  expression,  that 
may  truly  be  described  as  unique. 

Edward  Lloyd,  both  as  a  man  and  a  singer,  was 
of  quite  a  different  calibre.  Hardy  of  constitu- 
tion, fond  of  exercise  and  open-air  sports,  the 
possessor  of  a  strong,  healthy  throat,  it  was  the 
rarest  imaginable  occurrence  for  him  to  be  com- 
pelled to  forego  an  engagement  in  consequence  of 
indisposition.  Moreover,  he  had  no  weakness  for 
luxuries,  and  never  spent  his  money  extravagantly. 
On  the  contrary,  he  knew  how  to  save  it  and  how  to 
invest  it  to  good  advantage.  Therefore  it  came 
about  that,  after  a  public  career  of  some  thirty 
years,  Edward  Lloyd  was  in  a  position  to  indulge 
his  longing  for  otium  cum  dignitate;  and  when  he 
retired  from  active  service,  in  the  plenitude  of  his 
vocal  powers,  he  was  a  tolerably  wealthy  man 
—though,  truth  to  tell,  that  farewell  came  all  too 
soon  for  the  liking  of  the  British  public.  There 
was  no  one  to  take  Lloyd's  place,  and  even  now 
it  remains  practically  unfilled.  Ben  Davies  has 
in  his  voice  some  notes  of  beautiful  quality,  and 
he  is  an  artist  of  undoubted  taste  and  distinction. 
Nevertheless,  to  place  him  wholly  upon  the  same 
artistic  level  with  his  gifted  predecessor  might  be 
to  imitate  the  Player  Queen  in  '^Hamlet"  and 
'^protest  too  much."

As  these  lines  are  penned  Edward  Lloyd  is  con- 
templating a  farewell  tour  of  the  world ;  so,  happily, 
there  is  no  necessity  yet  to  speak  of  him  altogether 
in  the  past  tense.  He  has  promised,  too,  from 
time  to  time  to  reappear  in  the  concert-room  in 
England,  as  compliment  or  charity  may  demand. 
Edward  Lloyd's  is  one  of  those  pure,  natural 
voices  that  never  lose  their  sweetness,  but  preserve 
their  charm  so  long  as  there  are  breath  and  power 
to  sustain  them.  His  method  is,  to  my  thinking, 
irreproachable  and  his  style  absolutely  inimitable. 
His  versatility  was  greater  than  that  of  Sims 
Eeeves,  even  though  he  was  never  a  stage  tenor; 
for  he  was  equally  at  home  in  music  of  every  period 
and  of  every  school.  In  Bach  and  Handel,  in 
modern  oratorio,  in  the  Italian  aria,  in  Lied,  ro- 
mance, or  ballad,  he  was  equally  capable  of  arous- 
ing genuine  admiration;  and,  when  he  had  fin- 
ished with  all  of  these,  he  could  declaim  Wagner 
with  a  beauty  of  tone,  a  fullness  of  dramatic  expres- 
sion, and  a  clarity  of  enunciation  that  used  to  make 
his  German  audiences  in  London  shout  for  very 
wonder  and  delight.  Hans  Richter  was  wont  to  de- 
clare that  Edward  Lloyd  was  the  first  tenor  to 
bring  out  in  all  its  fascinating  loveliness  the  exqui- 
site vocal  charm  of  the  ^ '  Preislied. ' '  That  thought 
occurred  to  me  when  he  was  singing  it  at  his  fare- 
well concert  at  the  Albert  Hall  in  December,  1900 ; 
and  I  was  fain  to  admit  that  upon  the  operatic 
boards  only  Jean  de  Reszke  had  accomplished  with 
this  inspired  melody  what  Edward  Lloyd  had  done 
with  it  upon  the  concert  platform. 

465 


Thirty  Years  of 


Another  great  English  singer  who  yet  lingers 
upon  the  field  of  his  former  successes  is  Charles 
Santley.  For  his  years,  his  voice  is  wonderfully 
preserved,  and  no  ^^old  man  eloquent"  could  throw 
into  his  efforts  a  more  remarkable  measure  of  en- 
ergy, vigor,  and  feeling.  Like  Reeves,  he  made  his 
name  first  as  an  opera-singer ;  there  are  many  still 
living  who,  like  myself,  entertain  a  vivid  recol- 
lection of  his  sympathetic  and  dramatic  delineation 
of  Valentine  in  *^ Faust"  and  the  Conte  di  Luna 
in  ^^11  Trovatore"  years  before  the  appearance 
with  the  Carl  Rosa  Company  to  which  allusion  has 
already  been  made  in  these  pages.  But  of  late 
years  the  voice  has  lost  its  haunting  beauty  of 
timbre,  and  the  charm  of  Santley 's  singing,  save 
that  which  survives  in  his  perfect  phrasing,  is 
no  longer  aught  but  a  memory. 

England's  leading  vocalists,  at  the  dawn  of  the 
twentieth  century,  comprised  many  artists  of  genu- 
ine excellence.  The  time  when  there  were  *^  giants 
in  the  land"  might  be  past  and  gone;  the  advent 
of  a  great  English  soprano  might  seem  as  far  off 
as  ever.  But  the  average  singing  heard  in  the  con- 
cert-room was  often  distinguished  by  fine  musical 
feeling  and  intelligence.  A  busy  career  of  nearly 
thirty  years  had  not  yet  made  serious  inroads  on 
the  thrilling  tones  of  Emma  Albani.  The  ' '  Queen 
of  the  British  Musical  Festival"  was  still  the  most 
reliable  and  conscientious  of  interpreters,  the  most 
industrious  of  artists.  Marguerite  Macintyre,  de- 
spite her  stronger  penchant  for  opera,  was  never- 

466 


Musical  Life  in  London 


theless  best  known  to  her  home  public  as  a  concert 
soprano;  and  the  same  statement  applies  with 
equal  appropriateness  to  Ella  Russell,  who, 
American  by  birth,  English  by  adoption,  and  Ital- 
ian by  marriage,  was  the  dramatic  soprano  par 
excellence  of  the  concert  platform,  a  singer  always 
sincere,  thorough,  and  convincing  in  her  work.  An- 
other acclimatized  American  of  tried  ability  alike 
in  opera-  and  concert-work  was  Lucile  Hill ;  while 
yet  another  (who,  however,  had  not  yet  trodden  the 
lyric  boards)  was  Lillian  Blauvelt,  a  refined  and 
highly  cultivated  singer  with  talents  equally  ap- 
preciated on  both  sides  of  the  Atlantic. 

But  where,  among  the  leading  women  singers, 
were  the  English-born  artists?  To  find  them  one 
had  to  turn  to  the  contraltos— to  Clara  Butt,  with 
her  glorious  wealth  of  tone  and  Gallic  grace  of 
delivery;  to  Marie  Brema  (who,  however,  would 
be  more  correctly  classified  as  a  mezzo-soprano), 
with  her  admirable  command  of  tone-color,  her 
faultless  diction,  her  infinitely  varied  shades  of 
impassioned  poetic  expression;  and  to  Kirkby 
Lunn,  with  her  warm,  rich  notes  of  true  contralto 
quality,  a  singer  full  of  talent  and  an  observant, 
persevering  artist.  The  foremost  contralto  group 
would  not  be  complete,  however,  without  the  name 
of  the  talented  Australian,  Ada  Crossley,  whose 
popularity,  rapidly  and  surely  earned,  was  due 
almost  as  much  to  winning  charm  of  style  as  to 
sheer  force  of  tonal  beauty. 

The  mantle  of  Braham  and  Sims  Eeeves,  as 

467 


Thirty  Years  of 


worthily  borne  by  Edward  Lloyd,  was  resting  more 
or  less  easily  upon  the  shoulders  of  Ben  Davies, 
a  singer  whose  rare  musical  instinct  and  intelli- 
gence have  always  partially  atoned  for  his  uneven 
scale  and  his  lack  of  ringing  head-notes.  Among 
the  tenors  who  had  made  their  mark,  Joseph 
0  'Mara  must  not  be  forgotten,  nor  William  Green, 
the  somewhat  Italian  quality  of  whose  organ  gave 
promise  of  rich  development  with  greater  freedom 
of  emission  and  growth  of  temperament.  At  the 
head  of  the  barytones  stood  Andrew  Black,  one 
of  the  best  male  singers  that  Scotland  has  ever 
produced,  the  possessor  of  a  superbly  resonant 
voice,  and  notably  impressive  in  music  calling  for 
pathetic  sentiment  and  declamatory  vigor.  Artistic 
singers  were  Kennerley  Rumford  and  Denham 
Price,  while  as  a  **safe''  oratorio  bass  Watkin 
Mills  fully  deserved  his  position.  To  complete  the 
list  there  only  remains  to  mention  Plunket  Greene, 
who,  had  his  vocal  attributes  only  been  on  a  par 
with  his  interpretative  powers,  might  fairly  have 
been  described  as  one  of  the  finest  concert  vocalists 
of  his  time. 

And  so  I  conclude  these  recollections,  as  I  began 
them,  with  reflections  upon  English  Festival  ar- 
tists and  English  Festival  singing.  The  festival, 
indeed,  lives  and  flourishes,  and  remains  perhaps 
the  most  characteristic  feature  of  musical  progress 
in  th6  United  Kingdom.  It  is  the  institution  which 
continues  to  compare  most  favorably  with  what 
it  was  at  the  beginning  of  the  thirty  years  traversed

by  these  pages.  There  were  greater  singers  in  the 
*^  seventies  "—greater,  maybe,  than  ever  will  be 
heard  at  a  festival  again.  On  the  other  hand,  there 
were  not  then  finer  choirs  than  can  be  heard  to-day 
at  Leeds,  Birmingham,  Norwich,  and  Sheffield ;  nor 
were  there  splendid  orchestras  available  then,  as 
now,  for  the  adequate  rendering  of  something  more 
than  choral  accompaniments  and  easy  symphonies 
by  Haydn  or  Mozart.  Moreover,  thanks  to  superior 
executive  means  and  a  higher  order  of  musical  ajD- 
preciation,  there  has  been  a  manifest  improvement 
in  the  tone  of  festival  programmes.  A  spirit  of 
eclecticism  dominates  the  choice  of  works  and  re- 
flects a  catholicity  of  taste  that  nowhere  could  be 
surpassed.  Indeed,  as  regards  the  future  of  the 
art  in  England,  it  is  the  great  provincial  centres 
that  display  the  promise  to  be  sought  for  in  vain 
amid  the  invertebrate  elements  which  constitute 
musical  life  in  the  huge,  overgrown  metropolis  of 
the  British  Empire.
