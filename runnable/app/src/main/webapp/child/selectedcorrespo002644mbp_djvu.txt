INTRODUCTION 

For many years before his death in 1952 Edward Sydow had been 
working on his Chopin's Correspondence, a publication which, coming 
after his Chopin Bibliography of 1949, crowns his achievement in the 
field of Chopin research and confirms his reputation as an industrious 
and reliable scholar. Unhappily Mr Sydow died before he could com- 
plete his final revision of the Correspondence and see his book through 
the press. After an interval the task of preparing Sydow's work for 
publication was entrusted to Professor Janusz Miketta of Cracow. He 
undertook it with enthusiasm but he had not gone far when he too was 
struck down by a fatal illness. In the end a small committee of Polish 
musicologists and writers took charge and the two large volumes of 
the Correspondence appeared in Polish in 1955. Mr Sydow had himself 
already prepared an edition in Spanish (a language which he knew 
perfectly), and a three-volume edition in French had been begun in 
collaboration with Mile Suzanne Chainaye and her sister Mme Denise 
Coifs. This French edition, published by Richard-Masse, was only 
completed after the death, early in 1960, of the principal collaborator, 
Mile Suzanne Chainaye. 

From the spring of 1946 I was in regular correspondence with Mr 
Sydow on questions relating to Chopin, and during the celebrations in 
Warsaw of the 1949 Chopin Centenary I had the opportunity of 
meeting him and discussing the many problems raised by his project of 
publishing a comprehensive edition of Chopin's letters, together with 
those written to him and other contemporary documents. During the 
years that followed I was able to contribute to Sydow's work in matters 
of chronology, authoritative texts, unpublished material and so forth; 
and it was understood between us that, when the time came for an 
English version to be brought out, I should be the one to undertake it. 
I also knew Mile Chainaye and her sister very well and frequently met 
them; they made valuable contributions to the general project, thanks 
to their skilful and indefatigable researches in France. 

The letters, papers and fragments assembled by Mr Sydow, his 
French colleagues and myself number nearly 800. But it has always 
been clear to me that fully one half of these could be of small interest to 

vii 



any but specialists; so far from being of value to the general reader of 
musical biography they could only have the effect of blurring the clear 
outlines of Chopin's life story as told by his correspondence. A fair 
proportion of the documents in the complete editions consists of 
inscriptions on visiting-cards, invitations to dinner, scribbled notes and 
so forth, whose date or significance it is now impossible to establish. 
They have no bearing on the main story and are only an encumbrance. 
Other letters deal with domestic events and persons of whom nothing 
definite can be known today; even when research has thrown what 
light it can on the contents of these letters, they often prove to be of 
little interest or importance. 

For these reasons it was obvious that for English readers a selection 
would have to be made. It has been carried out on the following 
principle: nothing has been omitted which illuminates the life and 
character of Chopin or which offers a commentary on the society in 
which he moved. Furthermore, in order that the letters might be read 
as an almost continuous narrative covering the whole of Chopin's 
career, the documents have been linked by a brief commentary suf- 
ficient to guide the reader without coming between him and the letters 
themselves. 

It will be seen that the term "correspondence" has been stretched to 
include not only the letters written or received by Chopin but also 
a number of those exchanged between his friends, such as the vital 
letter sent by George Sand to his friend Grzymala at the beginning of 
her liaison with the composer in 1838, or the final letter from Grzy- 
mala to another friend, describing Chopin's last moments. The in- 
clusion of this extraneous material (indicated in the text by the prefixing 
of the sign to the heading of the letter) seems justified by the help such 
contemporary documents give in clearing up the course of events and 
by the light they throw on the psychology of the principal actors. In the 
delicate and complicated matter of Chopin's relations with George 
Sand it is most necessary that the reader should have the views of both 
parties before him. They are presented here for the first time in English, 
demolishing completely (especially in Section III) the complacent 
pronouncement of Chopin's biographer, Frederick Niecks, who, 
speaking in 1888 of the end of the Chopin-Sand affair, wrote: "We are 
not at the present moment, nor, all things well considered, shall be even 
in the most distant future in a position to speak on the subject otherwise 
than conjecturally." 

Among new material appearing now for the first time (since it is 
neither in the Polish nor the French editions) are several letters that 



vui 



have recently been recovered, e.g. No. 309 from London and more 
especially the letters of Karl and Joseph Filtsch written from Paris in 
1842. Karl Filtsch, who died at the age of fifteen in 1845, was un- 
questionably Chopin's most brilliant and promising pupil, a real 
genius. He came to Paris with his elder brother Joseph and was with 
Chopin for eighteen months. I am indebted to Lady Gwynne Evans, 
a descendant of Joseph Filtsch, for being given access to this material 
and permission to use it. Contemporary evidence of this kind is vastly 
more reliable than all the "memories" served up to the public forty 
or fifty years after the events themselves. Indeed, where Chopin is 
concerned, it is almost axiomatic that anything written more than ten 
(even five) years after his death is not to be trusted. The countless 
anecdotes, legends and traditions surrounding his name can only be 
set right by the facts as ascertained from strictly contemporary 
sources. 

The correspondence of Chopin may be divided into two main 
groups : Polish and French. In the former group are the letters exchanged 
between him and his family (apart from those from his father, who 
wrote in French) and his intimate Polish friends. To the latter group 
belong those to and from his acquaintances in the social world of Paris 
and his business correspondence with publishers. 

It is in the Polish letters that the real Chopin is to be found; there we 
have the direct and free expression of his mind in his native tongue. 
Chopin spent one half of his life in France and spoke French fluently; 
but he was never completely at his ease in any language but Polish. 
There is a monotony of phrase and an awkwardness of expression in 
his letters in French which offer a striking contrast to the variety, colour 
and exuberant vitality of his Polish. In Polish he wrote as he spoke; the 
words often tumble over each other in breathless and unending 
sentences. He had no literary pretensions whatever, no thought that 
one day an international public might read what he had written. And 
yet he has style his own style and there are often passages of remark- 
able effect which call up before the reader's eyes pictures as vivid and 
as memorable as the most carefully composed literary effort could 
evoke. It has been my aim to try to convey to the English reader some- 
thing of the spontaneity and liveliness of Chopin's language. The letters 
are full of slang and colloquial expressions which are best rendered by 
their modem equivalents, many of which come far closer to the original 
Polish than would corresponding phrases from, say, Dickens. At every 
point intelligibility has been my chief concern and I have on occasions 
preferred a paraphrase to a literal translation which might leave the 



reader guessing as to the true meaning of what Chopin is saying. Since 
so many of the originals of the letters have been lost, it has not always 
been easy to establish a correct text. For example, the collection of 
over fifty letters to Julian Fontana was abruptly dispersed in 1911 and 
there was only just time for a hasty copy of the originals to be made. 
In every case where the autograph of one of these letters has come into 
my hands I have found differences between the published text and that 
which Chopin actually wrote. The translation given here is based, 
wherever possible, on photographs, facsimiles and autographs which 
Mr Sydow, Mile Chainaye and I have consulted. 

As to the chronology of those letters which bear no date, Mr Sydow 
and I were in general agreement on the dates to be assigned, based on 
internal and other evidence, but there again the close examination of 
an original which may have been lately recovered has enabled me to 
correct details in both the French and Polish editions. The Polish edition 
is accompanied by copious notes amounting to some two hundred 
pages of text. For the most part these have been left aside since they 
are of slender interest to the general reader. Their place has been taken 
by a few footnotes and by short notes in square brackets inserted into the 
text of the letters, thus sparing the reader the trouble of "looking things 
up at the back". It seemed unnecessary that every single person men- 
tioned by Chopin should be identified or that every historical event 
should be fully explained; the reader can have little difficulty in follow- 
ing the general sense of most of the letters without the need of a mass of 
supplementary information. Nor have details of the present where- 
abouts of the originals or of their previous publication (where this has 
occurred) been included here. Many of the autographs have in fact been 
destroyed in the course of wars and revolutions, but accurate transcripts 
and photographs exist and every letter given here may be regarded as an 
authentic document. 

The so-called "Letters to Delfina Potocka", which have been the 
subject of much controversy, have been dealt with in an appendix: 
the proper place for them, since it was impossible to mingle such tainted 
material with the rest of the letters, whose authenticity is undoubted. 
They do not appear in either the Polish or French editions, for reasons 
which are made clear at the end of this book. I may ckim to be as well 
informed as anyone in this matter. Two longish visits to Poland since 
the texts were first produced, and first-hand acquaintance with many 
of the people concerned in the affair, have led me to the conviction 
that the typescript of these "Letters" produced in 1945 is not genuine, 
and constitutes a gross slander on Chopin's name. This view is shared 



by the great majority of European scholars. Each reader must judge 
for himself. 

I am particularly grateful to Mr Stanislas Meyer and Mr Joseph 
Karpf of London for their help in the translation of many obscure 
points in Chopin's Polish text, and to Mile Krystyna Kobylanska of 
the Chopin Institute, Warsaw, for allowing me to peruse Chopin's 
diaries, together with other papers in her private possession.

SECTION I 



CHILDHOOD, YOUTH AND EARLY MANHOOD UP TO THE DATE 
OP CHOPIN'S ARRIVAL IN PARIS IN SEPTEMBER 1 83 1 



We possess a surprising number of family greeting-cards of members of the 
Chopin family. These kurki or laurel-wreaths* carefully executed and neatly 
written, are of importance in that they show how constantly preoccupied the 
family was with questions of birthdays* name-days and the like. It is incon- 
ceivable that in such conditions Justyna Chopin and the boy Fryderyk should 
not have known precisely when he was bom, whatever may have been 
written in the baptismal register at Broch6w church when the infant was 
presented there by his father on 23 April 1810, nearly two months after his 
birth. 

Here is one of little Fryderytts characteristic efforts. Already at the age of 
eight he is a composer: his first Polonaise (in G minor, 1817} has been 
published^ his Military March has been scored and played by the City 
Governor's band, and he has various other little compositions to his credit. 
Music is assuming its dominating role in his future. 

I, To NICHOLAS CHOPIN, FOR ras NAME-DAY 
Dear Papa, 

Although it would be easier for me to reveal my feelings if they 
could be expressed in musical sounds, and since the finest concerto 
could not do justice to my devotion to you, I must use simple words 
straight from my heart to convey to you the homage of my tender 
gratitude and filial attachment. 

F. Chopin 
6 December 1818 



Apart from his exploits as a musical wonder-child Fryderyk led the normal 
life of a Warsaw schoolboy, attending to his lessons and spending his holidays 
in the country. From the village ofSzafarnia 9 wliere he went for the holidays 
of 1824 and 182$, he sent home to his parents in Warsaw letters in the form 
of a country-newspaper, called the Szafarnia Courier in imitation of the 
leading Polish journal, the Kurier Warszawski. Most of his Courier 
consists of boyish family gossip, of little interest today, but there are passages 
of musical interest, showing particularly the attention he was paying to the 
folk-music with which he was making immediate contact. For example: 

2. EXTRACTS FROM THE Szafarnia Courier 

HOME NEWS 

19 August 1824. On 15 August, at a musical gathering at Szafarnia, 
consisting of a score or so of somebodies and nobodies, Mr Pichon 1 
figured in the programme, playing Kalkbrenner's concerto, which did 
not, however, make such an impression, particularly on the nobodies, 
as The Little Jew* performed by this same Mr Pichon. 

Among a great deal of local gossip, farm-yard occurrences, adventures with 
cats, dogs and geese, he writes: 

FOREIGN NEWS 

29 August 1824. As he was passing through Nieszawa Mr Pichon 
heard a village Catalani 3 singing at the top of her voice as she sat on a 
fence. His attention was at once caught and he listened to both song 
and voice, regretting, however, that in spite of his efforts he could not 
catch the words. Twice he walked past the fence, but in vain he could 
not understand a word. Finally, overcome by curiosity, he fished out of 
his pocket three sous and promised them to the singer if she would 
repeat her song. For a time she made a fuss, pouted and refused, but, 
tempted by the three sous, she made up her mind and began to sing a 
little mazurka from which the present Editor, with the permission of 
the authorities and censorship, may quote as an example one verse: 
See, the wolf is dancing there behind the mountains: 
He's breaking his heart because he hasn't got a wife. 

3. HOME NEWS 

Tuesday 3 September 1824. On i September, as Mr Pichon was 
playing the Little Jew, Mr Dziewanowski called his Jewish cattle-hand 

1 Anagram of "Chopin", 

1 A mazurka* elaborated and published much later as Op. 17, No. 4, 

8 Angelica Catalani (1780-1849), the celebrated Italian singer who in 1820 presented 

young Chopin with a gold watch during her viiit to the Polish capital. 



and asked him what he thought of the young Jewish virtuoso. Young 
Moses came to the window, poked his hooked nose into the room and 
listened. Then he said that if Mr Pichon cared to play at a Jewish 
wedding he could make at least ten florins. Such a pronouncement 
encouraged Mr Pichon to study this kind of music as hard as he could, 
and who knows but what he may in time devote himself entirely to 
such profitable music-making. 

There have survived a number of boyhood letters written to his school- 
friend Jan Bialoblocki. The tone of these is extraordinarily naive, when one 
considers the type of music young Chopin was writing at this period: various 
polonaises and mazurkas, together with the Rondo in C minor* Opus i. He 
mixes up French and Polish, writes exuberantly about trifling day-to-day 
happenings, and in the midst of private jokes and details of Warsaw life 
gives many sidelights on his musical interests. During the spring of 182 $ he 
had the honour of playing to the Tsar who was visiting Warsaw* and was 
presented with a diamond ring. His Opus i came out in June and he appeared 
once or twice in public. 

4. FROM A LETTER TO JAN BIALOBLOCKI, 30 OCTOBER 1825: 

. . . The Barber of Serville [sic] was given on Saturday at the theatre 
which continues to be directed by Drnuszewski, Kudlicz and Zdano- 
wicz. I liked it very much. Zdanowicz, Szczurowski and Polkowski 
acted very well; so did Mme Aszperger and two other persons. One of 
them had a cold and was continually sneezing; the other, weepy and 
skinny, wore a dressing-gown and yawned in time with the music. 
Moreover a certain Mr RembielinsM, a nephew of the president, has 
arrived in Warsaw from Paris. He has spent six years there and plays 
the piano better than anyone I have ever heard. You can imagine what 
a joy it was for the likes of us who have never heard anything really 
perfect here. He does not appear as a professional but as an amateur. 
I won't go in for a long description of his rapid, smooth and rounded 
execution, but I'll tell you one thing bis left hand is as strongly 
developed as his right, which is rarely found in the same person. I 
should need more than a whole page to describe his splendid talent. , . . 

5. To JAN BIALOBLOCKI AT BISKUPIEC [BISCHOFSWERDER] 

Warsaw. [November 1825] 
Dear Johnny, 

Constance [Bialoblodd's sister] is in Warsaw, so it's hardly likely 
that I can refrain from scribbling a few lines to you. Although I have 



been able to scrape together very little fresh news for you during these 
last few days I must nevertheless tell you what has happened, but 
before I do so let me tell you how sorry I was to learn that you were 
worse, and how glad I am that* before long I shall see you completely 
well again. I don*t much envy you your heat-treatment, but if I knew 
that it would speed up your cure I too, like yourself, wouldn't 
shave for two months. I feel sure you have not yet received my 
other letter; never mind, you will get it. I could not write to you at 
Bischofswerder as I did not know your address; but Constance will be 
so kind as to send on the other letter with this one, if it was not 
forwarded. 

As things are in Warsaw (as you know from my previous letter), the 
performances of the Barber are universally praised, and it is rumoured 
that Freischutz, which they have long been preparing, will soon be 
given. I too have composed a polonaise on a theme from the Barber 1 
and my friends like it quite well; I am thinking of handing it over 
tomorrow to be lithographed. Louise [Chopin's eldest sister] has written 
an excellent mazurka such as Warsaw has not danced to for a long 
time. It is her non plus ultra, and really is a unique non plus ultra of its 
kind bouncing, charming; in short ideal for dancing and, without 
flattery, of a rare quality. When you come I will play it for you. I have 
been appointed organist at the High School. So my wife and all the 
children have a double reason for respecting me. Ah, my Lord! what 
a personage I have become the first in importance in the whole 
school after the Headmaster ! 

I play the organ once a week on Sundays at the Visitandines' church, 
while the other pupils sing. I can't write any more just now, niy dear 
Johnny. I must fly to the Czetwertynskis, and besides, Constance is 
going now. I'll send you a longer letter by post. Meanwhile we are all 
well and give you our love myself especially. 

Yours ever devotedly, 
F. E Chopin 

Mme Delert, Messrs Zywny, Bardzuiski, Leszczyfiski and all send 
their greetings, 

His correspondence with Bialoblocki was resumed after Christmas holidays 
spent at his birthplace, Zelazowa Wola t and a winter in which his health 
was far from good. He was now working hard for hisfnal school-examin~ 
ations*

6. To JAN BIALOBLOCKI AT SOKOLOWO 

Warsaw. Second day of Whitsuntide. [15 May 1826] 
Dearest Johnny, 

I am really ashamed to be answering your letter so late; but various 
circumstances which are inseparable from my person for you can 
imagine my state this year, since you had to go through the same thing 
some time ago have not yet allowed me to do what I have long wished. 
I have carried out some of your errands; I have bought you some pieces 
of music which, judging by my own taste, should give pleasure to one 
who is alone at home, as you are. As for Gliicksberg's [a music-dealer], 
Papa went there himself. Unfortunately he declared that he does not 
accept subscriptions for less than a month. He has no catalogue yet and 
cannot lend out more than a few pieces at any one time. We might 
have managed with that, but his charge is a thaler a month; worst of 
all is the fact that one can't know which few pieces to choose as he 
hasn't a catalogue. I have bought you the music but have not yet 
handed it over to Wysocki. The pieces are only those "Euterpe" 
things, collections of airs and other bits of Rossini, very well transcribed 
for piano by Diabelli in Vienna (like those vocal pieces called "Philo- 
meles"). I also bought a polonaise by Kaczkowski, very nice and 
charming to listen to and enjoy, and, what is more, good for loosening 
up your fingers which must be as stiff as wood, if I may say so. In 
addition, as you wished, a few of my own trifles. I shall not fail to let 
Wysocki have the lot this week. . . . [After some trivial local details 
Chopin returns to his musical life and experiences] ... I see fairly often 
that pianist Rembielinski whom I told you about. You wouldn't 
believe how splendidly he plays. He came to see me a few days ago, 
which gave me enormous pleasure. . . . Last Sunday I was at the 
Zamoyskis' where almost the whole evening was spent in admiring 
Dlugosz's Eolipantalion. 1 . . . Tve got a cupboard for my music and, 
finally, my top-boots are full of holes and I have to go out in shoes. . . . 

7. To JAN BIALOBLOCKI AT SOKOLOWO 

[Warsaw. June 1826] 
Dear Johnny, 

Don't expect to find in this letter the usual name-day compliments: 
those sentiments, expressions, protestations, apostrophes, touches of 
pathos and other similar nonsense, humbug and rubbish. Such things 
are all very well for those who, lacking real attachment, rely on 
trivialities. But when you've been bound to each other by eleven years

of friendship, have counted together 132 months, seen the beginning 
of 468 weeks, 3,960 days, 95,040 hours, 5,702,400 minutes and breathed 
through 342,144,000 seconds together, you don't need to be reminded 
of each other or to write complimentary letters, since you could never 
set it all down on paper. Coming down to facts (I begin by talking 
about facts, chiefly to get the following off my chest) : Your Highness 
has not written to me for months. Why? What for? Cur? Warum? 
Pourquoi? 1 am very much annoyed, and if there is no improvement 
there will be trouble between us. I can't write so often, that's obvious; 
you know that I am working as hard as I can for my diploma, but the 
dog won't get his bone one often hears them say here that first-year 
students must keep their fingers off it. Okam et oleum perdidi [Time and 
trouble wasted] if you remember your Tyrodnium [elementary Latin 
book]. But it seems to be no use talking. I'd better stop wasting paper 
and write pleasant, instead of unpleasant, news. 

Ecce homo! A man came into the world yesterday. Linde, 1 yes Linde, 
has an heir. We are all delighted and I expect you share our joy. In our 
barracks such pieces of news are frequent, as you will have learnt from 
my previous letter. 

There are strong rumours that in two or three weeks' time Frei- 
schutz will be given, and I believe it will make a great stir. Of course it 
will be frequently performed, and rightly so, for it is already an event 
when our opera can put on Weber's famous work. However, con- 
sidering the aim that Weber had in mind in his Frdschutz, its Germanic 
substance, its queer romanticism, its extraordinarily recherche harmony 
(which particularly suits the German taste) one may reckon that the 
Warsaw public, accustomed to Rossini's light melodies, will begin by 
praising it not from conviction, but rather in imitation of the connois- 
seurs, and because Weber is highly thought of everywhere. 

Sorry ! Eccefemina, non homo. The Headmaster has a daughter. Would 
you believe it ! Yesterday they said it was a boy, today a girl; however, 
this latter information is correct. . . . Do let me know whether you 
received the music. As a matter of fact, instead of my own poor efforts 
I sent you some of Alexander Rembielinski's waltzes. They ought to 
please you and, if one or two of them seem at first too difficult, just 
begin to move your stiff fingers (you were probably unable to play at 
Bischofswerder) and you will see that they are worthy of you that 
is, as handsome as you yourself, . * . 

If you saw what changes there are in our Botanical Gardens you 
wouldn't believe your eyes. They have kid out such shrubberies, paths

and flower-beds that it is a joy to walk in it, especially as we have been 
given a key. Don't be surprised if my writing seems rather wild, for I 
am unwell, and if you find no mention of my holidays don't be sur- 
prised either: I will discuss them in my next letter. If I don't send you 
my clavicembalistic trash don't be astonished fm like that. . . . 

Already in May 1826 Chopin has spoken of being unwell His sister 
Emilia (bom in 1812) was even more gravely ill she died of consumption in 
1827 and after the strenuous, summer-term^ with its examinations, the 
mother with Fryderyk and Emilia set off for Reinertz, now known as 
Duszniki, a watering-place in Silesia. 

8. TO WlLHELM KOLBERG, IN WARSAW 

Reinertz [Duszniki]. 18 August [1826] 
Dear Willie, 

After passing through Blonie, Sochaczew and ... [a string of place 
names follows], we arrived at Reinertz where we are now settled. For 
the last two weeks I have been drinking whey and the local waters. They 
say I am looking better. I've even put on weight and thereby grown 
lazy; you can blame that for the long rest my pen has had. But, 
seriously, when you hear about the life I am leading you will have to 
admit that it is difficult for me to stay at home for a moment. In the 
morning, not later than six o'clock, all the patients are at the pump- 
room, while a wretched wind-band made up of a group of nondescript 
caricature-figures, headed by a gaunt bassoon-player with a humpy, 
snuff-filled nose (who frightens all the ladies who happen to be afraid 
of horses), performs to the visitors as they stroll about. Then there is a 
kind of assembly or masquerade they don't all wear masks, only a 
small number do so, the kind of people who would do any mortal thing 
to be in the fashion. This strolling up and down the handsome avenue 
from the Kursaal to the town usually lasts until eight o'clock, according 
to the number of tumblers of water that each one must drink, after 
which we all go home to breakfast. After breakfast I generally go out for 
a walk until twelve, at which time one must have one's lunch so as to 
be able to go to the pump-room again after lunch. The masquerade is 
then usually even greater than in the morning, for everyone is dressed 
up, showing off in a different costume from the one worn in the morn- 
ing. The music blares out again and so it goes on until evening. Since I 
drink only two glasses of the Laubrunn after lunch I get home early for 
supper. After supper I must go straight to bed, so how can I find time 
for writing letters? I have given you a general idea of how one day 



follows another. But time passes so quickly that although I have been 
here such a long time I haven't seen everything yet. 

I do, of course, climb up the hills surrounding Reinertz and am often 
delighted with the view of the valleys. I am loath to come down, as I 
have to sometimes, scrambling on hands and knees; but I have not yet 
been where everybody else goes, as I am not allowed to. In the neigh- 
bourhood of Reinertz there is a rocky height called the Heuscheuer, 
from which there are marvellous views, but the air at the top is 
so bad that not everyone can go there. I am one of the unfortunate 
patients who are not allowed to. 

But it doesn't matter. I have already been up the so-called Einsiedelei 
hill to see a hermit who lives there. You climb up to one of the highest 
points in Reinertz, then go a hundred or more steps straight up an 
almost vertical stone-staircase to the hermitage, from where you have 
a splendid view over the whole town. We are also thinking of going to 
a place called Hohenmenze where there is said to be a hill in the midst 
of wonderful surroundings, I expect we shall carry out our plan. 

But why do I bother you with these descriptions which give but a 
faint notion of things, when it is impossible to describe everything as I 
should wish? As for the social customs here, I have got so used to them 
that nothing makes me raise an eyebrow. At first I found it strange that 
in general the Silesian women work harder than the men, but since I my- 
self am not doing a stroke of work it is easy for me to fall in with the idea. 

There were many Poles in Reinertz but their numbers are going 
down. They were all acquaintances of mine. There is plenty of fun 
among my compatriots and even the most distinguished German 
families join in all the party-games. In the house where we are staying 
there is a lady from Wroclaw [Breslau] whose children lively, clever 
boys speak a little French. Wishing to say something in Polish one 
of them, my pal, comes to me with "Zien dobry" [instead of Dzien 
dobry]. I replied "Dobry Dzie6", and since he is a nice boy I taught him 
to say "Dobry wieczdr" [Good evening]. The next day he got them 
mixed up and instead of "DzieA dobry" said "Zien wiesi6r" [Day 
evening]. I couldn't think why he made such a mistake and had great 
difficulty in making him see that it's not "zien wiesi6r" but "dobry 



Forgive this nonsensical scribble, wasting your time; perhaps you 
would rather do something else. I've finished and I'm off now to the 
pump-room for two glasses of water and a ginger-bun. 

Yours, always the same for ever, 
R Chopin 



I had a letter from Dziewanowski: I expect to answer him tomorrow. 
He tells me he wrote to you it's nice of him not to forget. Alfred 
Kornatowski was here with his mother and sisters. It seems that he is a 
friend of Fontana's. Tell Fontana 1 he left the day before yesterday. My 
respects to your father and mother. I really don't know what I have 
written I can see that there's a lot, but I don't feel like reading it 
through. 

While at Reinertz Chopin played twice at the little concert-hall for the 
benefit of two orphan children but it is curious to observe that he makes no 
mention of his public performances in his letter to Joseph Eisner, Principal of 
the Warsaw High School for Music, with whom he was to begin his serious 
music studies in the autumn of this year. 

9. To JOSEPH ELSNER IN WARSAW 

Reinertz. 29 August [1826] 
Dear Sir, 

Since coming to Reinertz I have been looking forward to the 
pleasure of writing to you, but since my time is completely taken up by 
the cure it has been impossible for me to do so, and only now can I 
find a moment to give myself the pleasure of conversing with you and 
informing you of the manner in which I have fulfilled the tasks you 
entrusted to me. I have endeavoured to carry them out to the best of 
my ability. I handed over the letter addressed to Mr Latzel: he was 
delighted to have it. As for Messrs Schnabel and Berner, they will 
receive your letters when I return via Wroclaw. Your kindness and the 
lively interest you have shown in me encourage me to think that you 
will not receive with indifference the news I give you of my health. 
The fresh air and the whey which I take very conscientiously have 
restored me to such a degree that I am quite altered from what I was in 
Warsaw. I am delighted and charmed by the splendid views that 
beautiful Silesia offers, but there is one thing that all the charms of 
Reinertz cannot replace: a good instrument. 

Can you believe, Sir, that there is not a single good piano here? I 
have seen nothing but instruments which give me more pain than 
pleasure. Fortunately this martyrdom will not last long; the time for 
my departure from Reinertz is approaching and we shall set off on the

Back in Warsaw after his holiday in Reinertz, Chopin took tip again his 
correspondence with his intimate school-friend. 

10. To JAN BIALOBLOCKI AT SOKOLOWO 

Warsaw. 2 October [1826] 

[After trivial boyish gossip] . . . You must know, my dear friend, that 
I have given up the High School. It would be ridiculous to have to sit 
at a desk for six hours a day when the German and German-Polish 
doctors have ordered me to get as much walking-exercise as possible. 
And it would be absurd to sit through the same lessons again when I 
might learn other things in the course of the year. With this in view I 
go to Eisner for lessons in strict counterpoint six hours a week. I follow 
lectures by Brodzinski, Bentkowski and others in fact, anything to do 
with music. Bed-time is at nine o'clock. All soirees and dances are ruled 
out. On Malcz's orders I drink emetic waters and eat nothing but 
oatmeal like a horse. But the air does not suit me here as it did in 
Reinertz. They din into my ears that I must perhaps return there next 
year, if only to go through the business of taking the waters at the 
Laubrunn but that's a long way off, and it seems to me that Paris 
would be better than the Czech frontier. Bardzinski is going there 
again this year, and I ... well, perhaps fifty years from now. God 
grant it may be so ! Give me a kiss, dear Johnny. You shall have a 
longer letter by post. 

F. F. Chopin 

This is Reinertz paper I am writing on. [The letter ends with greet- 
ings to acquaintances.] 

Life in Warsaw is depicted in the next letter. Chopin had written his 
Rondo i la Mazur (Op. 5) and was busy with other works.

thing fashionable. So far nothing has been engraved, but as I have not 
been to Brzezina's [music-shop] for four days I shall try to get you 
something tomorrow, if I can, so that Mr Dziewanowski can bring it 
with him. A very good resolution, but you will see the result when you 
open the music-parcel: you ought now to be as curious about the past 
as I am today about the future I In addition I am sending you my 
mazurka, the one you know about you may receive another later on, 
not now; otherwise you would be having too many pleasures at one 
time. These mazurkas have already been published, whereas my Rondo, 
which I wished to have lithographed, since it is older and has a better 
right to see the world, has to remain stifled among all my papers its 
fate is rather like mine ! 

The roads are good for sledges and for the last four days they have 
been running along with their bells tinkling. We've even had a few 
accidents of the sort that usually come with this season, for instance a 
carriage-shaft struck a lady on the head and killed her. Horses have 
bolted, sledges have been smashed up and so on. The New Year's Eve 
masked ball is said to have been very crowded but I haven't yet been to 
any such entertainment and I long and hope that we shall go this year 
with Bardzinski. Mme Szymanowska 1 is giving a concert this week, 
on Friday, and with higher prices. It appears that the pit-seats will 
cost a half-ducat, the stalls a ducat and the others in proportion. Of 
course I shall be there and I will let you know how she is received and 
how she plays. Write . . . [Usual greetings] 

For three months Fryderyk heard nothing of his friend, until the rumour 
began to go round that Bialoblocki had died. At the same time Chopin 9 s sister 
Emilia was entering the last phase of her illness. 

12. To JAN BIALOBLOCKI AT SOKOLOWO 

Warsaw. Monday 14 [actually 12] March 1827 
[After discussing the rumours] . . . We have illness in the house. 
Emilia has been in bed for the last month. She started to cough and 
spit blood, and Mamma became frightened. Dr Malcz ordered blood- 
letting. She was bled once twice; then countless leeches, blisters, 
synapisms, herbal remedies, all sorts of nonsense. During the whole 
time she ate nothing; she got so thin that you would not have known 
her, and only now is she beginning to recover somewhat. You can 
imagine what a state things have been in. Imagine it if you can, for I

am not equal to describing it. Carnival time carne to a sad end. Old 
Benik died, and you will realise what a blow that was to Papa. His 
daughter Clementine, who married Dolbyszew, died after less than 
nine months of marriage. In short, one sad event after another has 
darkened our house; and that last hellish piece of news about your 
death, coming from God knows where, cost me not only tears but 
money. Of course, as soon as I heard it (imagine how you would 
receive the news of my death! but please note I'm still alive!) I 
blubbered so much that I got a frightful headache, starting at eight in 
the morning. At eleven my Italian-master came and I had to miss the 
lesson. A few zlotys wasted. (Woyciechowski and Weltz also upset.) 
The next day they made me go to the theatre to take my mind off it, 
and that meant a few more zlotys. You might have written to tell me 
whether you were dead or not. I await your letter . . . can't write any 
more: it's four o'clock. [Greetings] 

During the next few months Chopin was absorbed in his music studies with 
Eisner, his fast large-scale work for piano and orchestra being the Variations 
on Mozart's "U d darem", his Opus 2, which was to make his name known 
in the outside world, thanks to young Schumann's celebrated outburst: ''Hats 
off, gentlemen! A genius!' 9 Now comes his first glimpse of the outside world. 
He writes to Titus Woyciechowski, a fellow-student, whose character was 
totally different from his own a strong, manly personality. Their early 
friendship was marked by an intense, but completely innocent, attachment on 
Chopin s side, while Titus responded with a sincere, if cooler, devotion. 

13. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. 9 September 1828 
Dearest Titus, 

You won't believe how I have been longing to hear from you and 
your mother, and how delighted I was to receive your letter. I was then 
at the Pruszaks' in Sanniki I spent the whole summer there. There's 
no need to tell you how I enjoyed my stay; you have been there your- 
self and know. I could not answer your letter at once, since I was on the 
point of returning home any day. And now I am writing like a madman, 
for I really don't know what's happening to me ! I am leaving today for 
Berlin to see one of Spontinfs operas. I am travelling by stage-coach 
to test my powers of endurance. It all started with the scientific mon- 
keys from every institution in Europe. Following the example of the 
congresses first held in the Swiss cantons and then in Munich, the King 
of Prussia has authorised his University to invite the most distinguished 

12 



European scientists to a Natural Sciences Congress to be held under the 
chairmanship of the celebrated Humboldt. Jarocki [Professor of 
Zoology in Warsaw], as a former student of the Berlin Academy, where 
he later obtained his doctorate, has been invited as a zoologist. Two 
hundred rooms have been reserved in Berlin for the scientists: they 
will have their meals together, etc. and other such German arrange- 
ments. The whole thing, including the invitations which are printed on 
vellum, promises to be on a grand scale, and of course Spontini will 
present his Cortez or Olympic Anyhow, Jarocki' s friend and teacher, 
Lichtenstein, who is secretary of the Congress, used to be a close friend 
of Weber. He is a member of the Sing-Akademie and (as Ernemann 
reminded me) on very good terms with Zelter, the president of that 
musical institution. Those who know Berlin well have told me that by 
making Lichtenstein's acquaintance I shall get to know the most 
important musicians in Berlin, apart from Spontini whom he apparently 
can't stand. I should like to meet there Radziwill 1 from Poznan (who 
in the world can doubt it?), for he is the best of friends with Spontini. 
I shall be there with Jarocki only two weeks, but it will be long 
enough for me to hear at least one first-class opera I can already 
imagine the high standard of performance. Arnold Mendelssohn and 
Hanke are the Berlin pianists, the latter being a pupil of Hummel On 
my return you shall have a description of what I have seen and now 
I must answer your request for Warsaw news. 

Firstly, Colli and Mme Toussaint sang a few weeks ago in the Barber. 
It so happened that I arrived just then in Warsaw from Sanniki with 
Kostus 2 for a few days. I was most curious to see that first act they 
only did the first act in Italian: all day long I rubbed my hands in 
anticipation. But on the evening itself if it hadn't been for Mme 
Toussaint I could have murdered Colli. He acted so much the Italian 
low comedian and sang so much out of tune that it was frightful. Once, 
as he rushed off the stage, he fell over. Need I say more? Just imagine 
this Colli fellow, in short breeches, with a guitar and a round, white 
hat, lying on the floor. Awful! . . . 

While at Sanniki I rearranged that C major Rondo (the last one, if 
you remember) for two pianos and tried it over with Ernemann at 
Buchholtz's. It goes quite well. We are thinking of playing it sometime 
at the Club. As for my new compositions, I have nothing apart from 
an unfinished Trio in G minor which I began shortly after you left. I

composer and made the first musical setting of Faust.

tried out the first Allegro with the other instruments before going to 
Sanniki and shall do the same with the rest of it after my return [from 
Berlin]. I imagine the Trio will have the same fate as my Sonata and 
Variations. They are already at Leipzig : the first dedicated, as you know 
to Eisner; and on the second I placed, perhaps too boldly, your name. 
My affection made me do it and I trust you will not take it amiss. 
Skarbek is not back yet. Jendrzejewicz is staying a year in Paris. He met 
there SowMski, that pianist who wrote to me briefly to say that before 
coming to Warsaw he would like to correspond with me and that, 
being on the staff of the Revue Musicale, published by Mr Fetis, 1 he 
would be very glad to have some news of the state of music in Poland 
and of famous Polish musicians, their careers, etc. It is no concern of 
mine and I shall reply to him from Berlin to the effect that it is not for 
me to deal with such things, and that in fact Kurpinski 2 here in Warsaw 
has partly begun to occupy himself with the question. Besides, my 
opinions are not yet worthy of a Parisian paper, in which nothing but 
the truth should appear. I have so far heard no opera either better or 
worse than our own. What troubles I should bring upon myself! At 
the moment Kurpinski is in Cracow and Zylinski is in charge at the 
opera. Yesterday Freischiitz was shockingly badly performed. The 
members of the chorus came in a quarter of a beat after each other. 
Papa says I shall lose the high opinion which I have of the state of 
things abroad. In a month's time I shall tell you for certain, since I shall 
be leaving Berlin towards the end of this month. Five days in a stage- 
coach! If I happen to fall ill I will return home by special coach and of 
course I'll let you know. Among other important matters I forgot to 
mention that Albrecht has died. Everything goes on as usual with us. 
Good old Zywny is the life and soul of our entertainments. I was 
supposed to go to Vienna this year by stage-coach with Papa and should 
doubtless have gone, but little Niezabytkowskf s mother kept us 
waiting and finally did not turn up. Papa spent the whole summer at 
home . . . [After many greetings Chopin ends:] Have mercy on me and 
write often a word, or half a word, or even a single letter: it will be 
dear to me. Forgive me for writing nonsense, but I haven't time to 
read over my letter. Once more adieu I

14. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Berlin. Tuesday 16 September 1828 
My dearest parents and sisters, 

On Sunday afternoon at about three o'clock we arrived by stage- 
coach in this too huge city. From the coach-station we were taken 
straight to the Kronprinz inn and we have so far remained there. We 
are well, and comfortably settled here. At once, on the first day of our 
visit, Mr Jarocki took me to Lichtenstein's where I saw Humboldt. 
Lichtenstein announced that he will introduce me to the leading masters 
of my art, and his only regret was that we had not arrived the day 
before, since his daughter had played with the orchestra at a matinee 
on that very day. I thought to myself, we didn't miss much. Was I 
wrong? I don't know yet, for I have not seen her and of course I have 
not heard her. On Sunday, the day of our arrival, Winter's Das 
Unterbrochene Opferfest was given at the Opera. As I was at the Lichten- 
steins' I could not go. Yesterday took place a fraternal dinner of those 
scientists figures of fun in my eyes, whom I have divided up into 
three classes. The chairman was not Humboldt (he is a very competent 
person) but some other stopgap whose name I can't remember just 
now i h a ve written it on a sketch which I made of him. The dinner, 
which lasted ages, prevented me from attending the concert given 
by Birnach, a nine-year-old violinist who is well thought of. Today I 
am going to Spontkd's famous opera Ferdinand Cortez; and to avoid 
the possibility of my finishing up with the "caricatures" I asked Mr 
Jarocki to permit me to dine alone, after which I sat down to write this 
letter. Then I'm off to the opera. It is rumoured that Paganini, the 
celebrated violinist, is coming here: it may turn out to be true. Radzi- 
will is expected about the 20th; I should like to see him come. 

So far I have seen nothing but the Zoological Exhibition, but I know 
most of the town, having spent these last two days strolling around the 
finest streets and bridges. I shan't trouble to describe all the famous 
buildings in detail. You shall hear all about them when I return. My 
general opinion of Berlin is that it is too spacious for the number of 
Germans in it. I should think that one could easily house twice the 
population. 

It was first suggested that we should live in the Franzosische Strasse, 
but the plan was altered, for which I am glad. It is a horribly gloomy 
street where hardly six people are to be seen at a time. This effect is 
doubtless produced by its width, which is similar to that of our Leszno. 
Only today shall I see Berlin as I conceive it to be. I should really prefer 
to spend the morning at Schlesinger's [music-shop] rather than crawl 

15 



round the thirteen rooms of the Zoological Exhibition, It is very fine, 
of course, but the aforementioned music-shop would be of more use 
to me. But good things never did any harm, so I shall go there as well. 
This morning I looked over two piano-factories. Kisling Eves at the end 
of the Friedrichsstrasse but he had no instrument completed, so I had my 
trouble for nothing. It's lucky that here in the landlord's room is a 
piano on which I can play. Our innkeeper admires me every day when 
I visit him, or rather his instrument. 

The journey was not so bad as it promised to be at the start. Although 
one is almost ground to a powder in these ill-sprung Prussian stage- 
coaches, things turned out quite well for me and I am really in very 
good health. The party in our coach consisted of a German lawyer from 
Poznan, remarkable for his heavy German humour, and a fat, greasy 
Prussian farmer who has travelled a great deal and has picked up his 
education in stage-coaches. Such was our company as far as the last 
posthouse before Frankfort, where we were joined by a Teutonic 
"Corinna'' [Mme de StaeFs heroine] full oach$ 9 ja$ and neins: a veri- 
table romantic doll. But it was all rather amusing, especially as she kept 
on nagging her neighbour, the lawyer, throughout the journey. 

The environs of Berlin on this side are not particularly beautiful, but 
are made attractive by the tidiness, cleanness and orderliness of every- 
thing; in short, by the planning and forethought which are to be seen 
everywhere. I have not yet been to the other side of the city and I can't 
go today; perhaps I shall tomorrow. The meetings of the Congress 
begin the day after tomorrow and Lichtenstein has promised me a 
ticket. The same evening Humboldt will hold a reception for the natural 
scientists. Mr Jarocki wanted to try to get me admitted, but I begged 
him not to, for it would be of no advantage to me and moreover the 
foreign gentlemen might look askance at me if they saw an outsider in 
their midst. Anyhow, I never wish to be out of my right place. Indeed 
when we were at table it seemed to me that my neighbour was giving 
me strange looks. He was a Mr Lehmann, a botany professor from Ham- 
burg. I envied him his huge, strong fingers. I had to use both hands to 
break my bread-roll; Ac, with one hand, squashed it into a flat cake. 
The fellow had paws like a bear's. He talked through me to Mr 
Jarocki and got so worked up by the conversation that he forgot him- 
self and fumbled about in my plate, sweeping up the crumbs with his 
great fingers. (He is a genuine scientist for he has also a huge nose and 
is clumsy.) I sat there on tenterhooks while he was messing up my 
plate, after which I had to wipe it with my napkin. 

MarylsH can have no taste at all if he says the Berlin women are 

16 



beautiful. They all have the same empty jaws, or, to put it another way, 
toothless mouths. It's true that they dress themselves up, but what a 
waste of all that handsome muslin cut up for the benefit of such kidskin 
dolls! 

Your sincere and loving 
Fryderyk 

15. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Berlin. 20 September 1828 

I am well, and from Tuesday onwards there has been something new 
at the theatre every day, as though put on especially for me. Best of all, 
I have already heard one oratorio at the Sing-Akademie and also, with 
great satisfaction, Cortez, Cimarosa's Secret Marriage and Onslow's 
Colporteur. However, Handel's oratorio St. Cecilia came nearest to the 
ideal which I had formed of great music. None of the most cried-up 
singers were there except Mile Tibaldi (contralto) and the young, 
seventeen-year-old Schatzel whom I previously heard at the Sing- 
Akademie and later in the Colporteur. I liked her best in the oratorio; 
perhaps I was in a better mood for listening. Even then there were 
"buts". Perhaps in Paris everything will be above reproach. 

Since that first time I have not been at Lichtenstein's for he is so busy 
with the organisation of the Congress that Jarocki can scarcely ex- 
change a word with him. All the same he managed to get me a ticket 
for that reception. I had an excellent seat, heard and saw everything 
and even had a good look at the Crown Prince. I saw Spontini, Zelter 
and Mendelssohn but spoke to none of them as I did not dare put 
myself forward. Prince Radziwill is supposed to arrive today: I'll go 
and inquire after breakfast. I saw Princess Lignicka at the Sing-Akade- 
mie and, noticing someone in livery talking to her, I asked my neigh- 
bour whether it was a royal chamberlain. "What ! That's His Excellency 
von Humboldt," he answered. His ministerial uniform had so changed 
him that I completely failed to recognise him, although I had the 
features of that great pedestrian (he once walked as far as Cimborasso) 
engraved in my memory. Prince Charles was also yesterday at the 
Colporteur or Hausirer as they call it here (we Poles call it, I think, 
Kramarz). He was in the royal box. 

Two days ago we visited the library. It is enormous but there are very 
few musical works. I saw there an autograph letter of Kociuszko. Just 
then Falkenstein, our hero's biographer, was making an exact copy of 
it and, observing that we were Poles (since we read with ease a letter 
which he himself could only make out with difficulty), he asked Mr 

17 



Jarocki to give him a German translation of its contents and wrote it 
down at dictation in his note-book. He is quite a young man and is 
employed as a secretary in the Dresden library. I saw there also the 
editor of a Berlin journal and exchanged a few words with him. 

Tomorrow Freischutzl . . . That's what I need. I shall be able to 
compare the women singers with ours. Today I received a ticket for a 
public dinner at the Exerdrhaus. My collection of caricatures is growing, 

16. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Berlin. Saturday 27 [September 1828] 

I am well, and having seen all there is to see I am coming home. On 
Monday week we shall greet each other. My peregrinations are doing 
me good. I do nothing but go to the theatre. Yesterday they did Das 
Unterbrochene Qpferfest, and some of the chromatic scales performed by 
Mile Schatzel carried me straight back to your bosoms. This word 
your [in Polish: wasz, prounounced "vash"] reminds me of a Berlin 
cartoon. There's a drawing of a Napoleonic soldier on guard with his 
rifle who calls out: "Who goes there?" A fat German woman who is 
passing answers "la vache" [the cow!]. She meant to say "die Wasch- 
erin" [the washerwoman], but she was trying to be elegant and trans- 
lated her profession into French to make it easier for the Frenchman to 
understand ! 

Among the most important events of my stay I may reckon the 
second dinner with Messieurs the natural scientists. On Tuesday, the 
day before the Congress broke up, there was a banquet accompanied 
by suitable songs. Everybody present sang, and those who were at 
table drank copiously and beat time to the music, Zelter conducting. 
Near him stood a huge gilt cup on a scarlet pedestal as a symbol of his 
supreme musical rank. They ate more than usual, and for the following 
reason: the worthy scientists, particularly the zoologists, had been 
concerning themselves principally with the improvement of meats, 
sauces, broths, etc., and they had made great progress in the science of 
eating during the few days of the Congress. At the Konigstadt theatre, 
in a comedy which I have heard about but have not seen, they took off 
the scientists in this sort of way: One asks the other as they are drinking 
beer, "How does the Berlin beer come to be so good just now?" and 
the answer is, "Don't you know we have the scientists here?" 

But it is time for bed. Early tomorrow morning we must be at the 
coach-station. We shall stop at PoznaA for two days on account of a 
banquet which Archbishop Wolicld has invited us to. What things I 
shall have to tell you as soon as we meet again! Au revolt. 

18 



On his return to Warsaw on 6 October Chopin at once resumed his studies 
with Eisner. But he was by this time an independent musical personality, 
gaining confidence with every day that passed and launching out boldly in the 
direction which he had chosen for himself. He was now eighteen and was 
entering a difficult emotional period. During these months of uncertainty he 
sought refuge in the devoted friendship of Titus Woyciechowski who supplied 
his need for affection and understanding. 



17. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Saturday 27 December 1828 
Dearest Titus, 

I have put off writing to you until at last my feelings of friendship 
got the better of my laziness. Although I am sleepy I have taken up my 
pen so that you may receive this letter for the ist and 4th of January 
[Titus's name-day]. In this short note I won't pile up on you a load of 
compliments, extravagant wishes and platitudes, for you know me and 
I know you: that has been the only reason for my silence. . . . 

A new comedy is going to be performed at Mme Pruszak's ; they have 
given me the part of Pedro in Marriage Schemes by Duval. . . . What 
will interest you most, however, is the fact that poor me has to start 
giving lessons. I will tell you why: [the words italicised are written 
by Chopin in Italian] N. has got the governess at the house in Marszal- 
kowska street into trouble. The young lady is going to have a baby and her 
mistress, the Countess, refuses to have anything to do with the seducer. The 
worst of it is that, before the whole thing came out, I was suspected of being the 
man because I had spent more than a month at Sanniki and always used to 
stroll in the garden with the governess. Yes, stroll about, but nothing more. 
She is anything but charming. Like a fool I had no desire for her lucky for 
me. Mme Pruszak has persuaded Mamma and Papa to let me give the 
lessons instead. [Then in Latin:] I have been wasting my time and trouble. 
Oh well, let them do as they please. 

The score of the Rondo a la Krakowiak is finished. The Introduction 
is original more so than I look in my felt greatcoat. But the Trio is not 
yet ready. Upstairs a room has been put at my disposal; the stairs lead 
up to it from the wardrobe-room. There I shall have an old piano, an 
old desk and a den of my own. My orphan Rondo for two pianos has 
found a foster-father in Fontana (you've perhaps seen him sometime at 
our house he goes to the University). He has practised it for about a 
month but has at last learnt it and we recently tried it over at Buch- 
holtz's to see how it might have sounded. I say "might have" because the 



two instruments were not in tune. We did not achieve the proper 
expressiveness and the thing did not go well in all those little details 
(you know what I mean) which give nuance to any piece of music. 

For the last week I have written absolutely nothing. I am running 
around from one place to another. This evening I am going to Mme 
Wincengerode's soiree and after that to another at Mile Kicka's. You 
can imagine how I feel at being asked to improvise when I would rather 
go to bed. Impossible to please everybody ! I rarely alight upon ideas 
like the ones which came so easily to my fingers when I used to play in 
the mornings on your piano. Wherever I go I find nothing but 
Leszczynski's miserable instruments not one with a tone anything 
like as good as your sister's piano or our own. The Polish Theatre 
opened yesterday with Preciosa and the French Theatre with Rataplan. 
Today they are doing Mr Geldhab and tomorrow Auber's Le Mafon. 
I shall be at dinner tomorrow with Mme Pruszak, as I was on Sunday. 
Kostus tells me you wrote to him, but don't think I am vexed because 
you did not write to me : I know your real feelings, and am not worried 
about a piece of paper. If I have written so much nonsense it is simply 
to remind you that you are in my heart as much as ever and that I am 

still the same old Fritz. - ^, 

F. Cnopui 

You don't like people to kiss you; but today, please! let me. On 9 
September at the Pruszaks' in Sanniki I recast the C major Rondo for 
two pianos it's not yet published. The G minor Trio is not quite 
completed. The score of the Rondo a la Krakowiak has been ready since 
27 December. 

When the spring of 182$ arrived it was clear that Chopin had nothing 

further to learn in Warsaw and must soon prepare for a period of study abroad* 

The young man had no wealthy patron to whom he could turn and his father 

had no choice but to appeal to the government for a grant. He did so in the 

following terms:

Government, a favour which I shall regard as the best possible reward 
for my efforts. 

I have a son whose innate gifts for music call for further development 
in this art. His Imperial Majesty Alexander, of blessed memory, Tsar 
and King of Poland, most graciously deigned to reward him with a 
precious ring as a token of His satisfaction when he had the honour of 
being heard by the Monarch. His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke 
[Constantine], Commander-in-Chief, has also allowed him on occa- 
sions to give proofs of his talent in His presence. Finally, many re- 
spectable persons and connoisseurs can support the view that my son 
might become a credit to his country in his chosen profession if he were 
given the opportunity to pursue his studies to their proper completion. 

He has finished his preliminary course of study, in witness whereof I 
may refer to the Director of the Musical High School and University 
Professor, Mr Eisner. He now only needs to visit foreign countries, 
viz. Germany, Italy and France in order to perfect himself according 
to the best models. 

Since my modest resources, based solely on my salary as a teacher, are 
insufficient to cover the expense of such a journey lasting perhaps three 
years I beg to submit to His Excellency the Minister a request that the 
Administration might draw from the fund which has been placed at 
the Viceroy's disposal some contribution towards my son's expenses. 
I am, with the greatest respect, Your Excellency's humble servant, 
Nicholas Chopin 

Assistant at the Warsaw High School 

This application was coldly turned down: public funds could not be 
"wasted" for such purposes, even though the Tsar himself was in Warsaw 
for his coronation as King of Poland. After he had taken his final examin- 
ation at the Music School in July, Chopin, at his father's expense, made his 
first real excursion into the outside world, travelling to Vienna in the company 
of four of his school-mates. 

19. CHOHN TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Vienna. 8 August 1829 

I am well and in good spirits. I don't know how it is, but the Germans 
are amazed at me and I am amazed at them for finding anything to be 
amazed about! Thanks to Eisner's letter, Haslinger [a music-publisher] 
could not do too much for me. He at once made his son play to me, 
showed me all the most interesting musical novelties and apologised 
for not introducing his wife as she was not at home. All the same, he 

21 



has not yet printed my things. I did not ask him about them, but 
showing me one of his most handsome publications he declared that my 
Variations would probably appear in a week's time in the Odeon. I 
hardly expected that. They are trying to persuade me to appear in 
public. Everyone here says that it would be a great loss to Vienna if I 
left without being heard. I simply can't grasp it. Schuppanzigh, for 
whom I also had a letter of introduction, told me that although he has 
stopped giving his winter season of quartet concerts he will try to 
arrange at least one during my stay in Vienna. I have been once at the 
Hussarzewskis': the old man was enthusiastic over my playing and 
invited me to dinner. There was a crowd of Viennese at the dinner and 
when I talked with them they all insisted that I must play in public. 
Stein at once offered to send one of his instruments to my lodging and 
lend it afterwards for my concert, should I give one. Graff, who makes 
still better pianos, told me the same thing. Wurfel maintains that if I 
wish to reveal something new and create a sensation I simply must play. 
A Viennese journalist, Mr Blahetka, whom I met at Haslinger's is also 
persuading me to play. They are all enormously pleased with my 
Variations. 

At Haslinger's too I met Count Gallenberg. He is in charge of the 
theatre, where I have already heard a few tiresome concerts. Haslinger 
asserts that it will be of the greatest advantage to my compositions that 
Vienna should hear them. Then the papers will sing their praises 
everyone guarantees that. In short, everyone who hears me says I must 
play, and Wurfel made the additional observation that, since I am here 
and my works are shortly to be brought out, I might as well play now, 
otherwise I should have to return here for that very purpose. They 
assure me that now is the best time, for the Viennese are hungry for 
new music. It would be unwise for a young artist to turn down such 
an opportunity. Besides, if I were thinking of appearing merely as an 
executant it would not matter much; but I shall be performing my own 
compositions and therefore I may confidently take the chance, and so 
forth. . , He wants me to start with the Variations, then play the 
Krakowiak Rondo so as to stress the novelty, and to finish with an 
improvisation. What will all this come to? I don't know. 

Stein is most kind and friendly to me but I shan't play on his piano: 
I prefer Graff's. HasHnger, Blahetka and Wurfel favour him too. I 
shall decide today. Whichever way I turn, people are dinning it into 
my head that I must play. I have quite a number of musical acquaint- 
ances; Czerny is the only one I have not yet met, but Haslinger has 
promised to introduce me. I have seen three operas: [Boleldieu's] 

22 



La Dame Blanche, Rossini's Cenerentola and Meyerbeer's II Crotiato. 
The chorus and orchestra are excellent. Today we have [MehuTs] 
Joseph in Egypt. At the Academy of Music I heard Mayseder pky a 
couple of solos. The town is pretty and I like it; they are trying to 
persuade me to stay here for the winter. Wiirfel has just arrived and 
I'm going with him to Haslinger's. 

P.S. I have made up my mind [to play]. Blahetka says I shall be a 
sensation, for I am a virtuoso of the first rank, to be counted in with 
Moscheles, Herz and Kalkbrenner. Wiirfel introduced me today to 
Count Gallenberg, Kapellmeister Seyfried and everyone we met as 
"a young gentleman whom he had persuaded to give a concert** 
(N.B. without any fee!). Gallenberg was very pleased about all this 
since his pocket is concerned. All the journalists look at me wide-eyed, 
and the members of the orchestra bow deeply, for the director of the 
Italian opera, whose season has just ended, walks with me arm in arm. 
As a matter of fact it is Wiirfel who has made all the arrangements. 
He will be at the rehearsal himself and is taking a sincere interest in 
my public appearance. He was very kind to me in Warsaw also: he 
mentions Eisner in the warmest terms. 

They find it surprising here that people like Kessler, Ernemann and 
Czapek can remain in Warsaw while I am there. But I have explained 
that I play merely for the pure love of music and do not give lessons. 
I have selected a Graff piano for my concert. I fear I may offend Stein 
by doing so, but I shall thank him gracefully for his kind offer. I hope 
that God will be with me. . . . Don't worry ! 

20. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Vienna. Wednesday 12 August 1829 

From my previous letter you learnt, my dearest parents, that I had 
allowed myself to be persuaded to give a concert; and so yesterday, 
Tuesday, at seven o'clock in the evening I made my bow on the stage 
of the Royal and Imperial Opera House! The sort of performance that 
took place yesterday in this theatre is called here a "Musical Academy'*. 
Since I got nothing out of it, and did not try to get anything, Count 
Gallenberg put it on quickly and arranged the programme thus: 

A Beethoven Overture 

My Variations 

Song by Mile Veltheim 

My Rondo 

then another song after which the evening ended with a short ballet. 
The orchestral accompaniment went so badly at rehearsal that I 



substituted a Free Fantasia for the Rondo. As soon as I appeared on 
the stage they started clapping; and the applause was so great after each 
variation that I could not hear the orchestral tuttis. [Chopin was on the 
stage, the orchestra down in the pit.] At the end they applauded so 
loudly that I had to come back twice and bow. Although my Free 
Fantasia did not turn out particularly well they clapped still louder and 
I had to take another bow. I came out the more willingly since the 
appreciation of these Germans is worth something. Thus Wiirfel had 
brought to a successful conclusion on Tuesday a project that had only 
been thought of on Sunday: I am very much indebted to him. 

It happened like this: On Saturday I made the acquaintance of 
Gyrowetz, Lachner, Kreutzer and Seyfried, and had a long conversa- 
tion with May seder. As I was standing in front of the theatre, up comes 
Count Gallenberg and suggests that I should play on Tuesday. I 
agreed, and I have not been hissed off the stage ! When I get back I will 
describe it all better than I can in writing. Don't worry about me and 
my reputation ! 

The journalists have taken me to their hearts; perhaps they will give 
me a few pin-pricks but that is necessary so as not to overdo the praise. 
Mr Demmar, the stage-manager, is particularly kind and pleasant to 
me. Before I went on he encouraged me so much by his reassurances 
and so took my mind off things that I had no trace of stage-fright, 
especially as the theatre was not full. My friends and colleagues distrib- 
uted themselves among the audience in order to hear the various 
opinions and criticism. Celinksi will tell you how little was said 
against me. Hube heard the worst: "It is a pity the young man looks 
so unimpressive" so declared one of the ladies. If that is the only fault 
they could find with me I have nothing to worry about. My friends 
swear they heard nothing but praise and they did not once have to give 
the sign for applause. I improvised on a theme from La Dame Blanche. 
Then the stage-manager begged me to choose another Polish theme 
he liked my Rondo so much at rehearsal that after yesterday's concert 
he shook my hand warmly and said, **Yes, the Rondo must be played 
here" so 1 selected Chmiel, which electrified the public, unaccustomed 
as it is to this kind of melody. My spies on the floor of the house declare 
that people were dancing up and down in their seats. 

Wertheim happened to arrive yesterday from Carlsbad with his 
wife and he came straight to the theatre. He couldn't at first realise that 
it was I who was playing; he came to congratulate me today. In Carls- 
bad he saw Hummel and says that Hummel asked after me and that he 
will write to Hummel today and tell him about my d^but Haslinger 

24 



is printing [the Variations, Opus 2] ; I have kept a copy of the concert- 
poster. 

The general opinion is that I play too quietly, or rather too delicately 
for those accustomed to the banging of the Viennese pianists. I expected 
to find such a reproach in the newspaper in view of the fact that the 
editor's daughter bangs the piano frightfully. It doesn't matter. There 
must always be some kind of "but ..." and I should prefer it to be that 
one rather than have it said that I play too loudly. 

Count Dietrichstein, a member of the Imperial entourage, came 
behind stage and had a long conversation with me in French. He compli- 
mented me and advised me to stay longer in Vienna. The orchestra 
was up in arms over my bad musical handwriting and sulked until I 
began to improvise, whereupon they joined in the clapping and 
exclamations of the whole audience. I can see that the orchestra is on 
my side, although I don't yet know how things stand with the other 
musicians. There is no need for them to be unfriendly they know I 
did not play for material gain. 

So there you have my debut, all the more successful since it was 
unexpected, Hube says that a man gets nowhere by following the 
common road and keeping to a prearranged plan. It's better to leave 
some things to chance. And so it was by the merest chance that I was 
persuaded to give a concert. If the papers flog me so soundly that I 
can't show myself in public I have made up my mind to become a 
house-decorator, for it is quite easy to run one's brush over the paper 
and one still remains a son of Apollo! 

I am curious to know what Mr Eisner will say to all this; perhaps he 
is displeased that I have played? But they really insisted so much that I 
could not refuse. Besides, it seems to me that no harm has been done. 
NidecH 1 was extraordinarily obliging yesterday: he looked over and 
corrected the orchestral parts and was sincerely delighted at my success. 
I played on a Graff piano. Today I am wiser and more experienced by 
four years. How surprised you must have been to notice that I sealed 
my last letter with a seal taken from a bottle of Madeira ! But I was so 
absent-minded that I picked up the first decent seal that came to hand 
left behind by a waiter and hastily stuck it on my letter. 

21. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Vienna. Thursday 13 August [1829] 

How happy I would be if at this moment we could all be together! 

Today I made the acquaintance of Count Lichnowski; he could not 

1 Thomas Nidecki, another pupil of Eisner, who was in Vienna on a government grant 

25 



compliment me enough, Wiirfel took me to meet him. He is the very 
one who was Beethoven's best friend. It is generally considered here 
that the Viennese aristocracy has taken a fancy to me. The Schwarzen- 
bergs, the Wrbnas, etc. praised particularly the delicacy and elegance 
of my playing witness Count Dietrichstein who came back-stage. 
Countess Lichnowska and her daughter, who today invited me to tea, 
are awfully pleased to hear that I shall be giving a second concert next 
week. She told rne that if I go on to Paris from Vienna I must not forget 
to go and see them and they will give me a letter for Countess someone- 
or-other, Lichnowski's own sister. Very kind of them. Czerny heaped 
compliments upon me, Schuppanzigh and Gyrowetz too. 

Today at the Museum of Antiquities some German fellow sees me. 
As soon as I open my mouth he asks, "Is that Chopin?" and then he 
literally jumps upon me, rejoicing to have the pleasure of making the 
closer acquaintance of such a Kunstler [artist], saying, "You really 
enchanted and transported me two days ago 1" It was the same man who 
sat next to MaciejewsH and was so thrilled by ChmieL 

I shall certainly not give a third concert, and would not even give a 
second if they were not so insistent. Besides, it occurred to me that 
they might say in Warsaw, "What ! He gave only one concert and then 
disappeared! Perhaps it was a failure." They promise me good press- 
notices. Today I paid a visit to one of the journalists: fortunately he 
liked me. I can't tell you how kind Wiirfel is to me quite indescrib- 
able. I shall play a second time without fee so as to keep on the right 
side of JVL le Comte who (entre nous) is rather hard up. I am to 
play the Rondo [<J la Krakowiak] and improvise. For the rest I am in good 
health and happy, eating and drinking well. I like Vienna and there are 
plenty of Poles here. There is even one in the ballet company. He was 
so anxious about me at my d^but that he brought me a sweet drink and 
said encouraging things, etc. Please tell Mr Eisner about everything 
and apologise for xny not writing; but I am so besieged by people that 
I don't know how my time flies. My thanks to Mr Skarbek who was 
most insistent on my giving a concert, for it was my first step into the 
outside world. 

22. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Vienna. 19 August 1829 

If I had a good reception the first time, it was even better yesterday. 
There were three bursts of applause when I appeared on the stage; there 
was a bigger audience too. Baron whatVhis-name, the business- 
manager, thanked me for the cash-takings, saying that "if the audience 



was so large it was certainly not on account of the ballet which is 
already well known". I have won over all the professional musicians 
thanks to my Rondo. From Kapellmeister Lachner down to the piano- 
tuner they all admire the beauty of this composition. I know that I 
have pleased the ladies and the artists. Gyrowetz, who was standing near 
Celinski, clapped and shouted Bravo ! What I don't know is whether I 
satisfied the petrified Germans. Yesterday one of them came in from 
the theatre as I was sitting at supper. The others asked him how he had 
enjoyed his evening. "The ballet was quite nice," he replied. "How 
about the concert?" they asked. It was easy to see that he had recog- 
nised me, although I had my back to him, for he started to talk of some- 
thing else. I felt that I ought not to hinder the outpouring of his feelings 
so I went to bed, saying to myself: 

"Unborn is he for whom mankind 
Nought but words of praise can find." 

I have played twice and been even better received the second time: 
so things are going crescendo just as I like. Since I am leaving at nine 
o'clock this evening I must spend the morning paying farewell visits. 
Yesterday Schuppanzigh reminded me that as I am leaving Vienna 
after such a brief stay I must return very shortly. I answered that I will 
come back here to study, whereupon the baron retorted, "In that case 
there is no reason at all why you should come": an idea which others 
confirmed. Such things are just compliments, but it is pleasant to hear 
them. They all refuse to look on me as a pupil Blahetka said that 
nothing surprised him so much as to find that I had learnt all that in 
Warsaw. My answer was that with Messrs Zywny and Eisner the greatest 
ass would learn. I am sorry I can't support what I am saying by 
press-notices: I know that a notice has been written and is with the 
editor of the paper I have subscribed to. Mr Bauerle, the editor, will 
send it off to Warsaw. Perhaps they have been waiting for my second 
concert. The paper comes out twice a week, on Tuesdays and Satur- 
days; you may even read something pleasant or disagreeable about me 
before I do myself. I have won the good opinion of the connoisseurs 
and those vthofeel music. We shall have plenty to talk about. I wanted 
to write differently but my head is so full of yesterday's events that I 
can't get my thoughts straight. So far I am all right as regards 
money. 

[Later] I have just come back from saying goodbye to Schuppanzigh 
and Czerny. There is more feeling in Czerny himself than in all his 
compositions. My bag is packed; I have only to go to Haslinger's and 

27 



then to the coffee-house opposite the theatre where I shall find Gyro- 
wetz, Lachner, Kreutzer and Seyfried. In two nights and one day we 
shall reach Prague. The express-coach leaves at nine o'clock tonight and 
I shall have a marvellous journey in delightful company. 

Chopin took with him letters of recommendation from several Viennese 
notabilities including Wiirfel who sang his praises to the director of the Prague 
theatre, describing him as "Friedrich von Chopin", the darling of the Warsaw 
court and public. 

23. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Prague. Saturday 22 August 1829 

After tender farewells I left Vienna. They really were tender, for 
Mile Blahetka gave me a signed copy of her compositions as a souvenir 
and her father sent his kindest greeting to Papa and Mamma, con- 
gratulating them on having such a son. Young Stein was in tears, and 
Schuppanzigh, Gyrowetz and the rest parted from me with deep 
emotion. So after all this fuss and with many promises to return I 
climbed into the coach. . . . [He gives details of his companions.] 
Haslinger expressed sincerely felt wishes for my return and promised 
in all seriousness that my Variations shall appear not later than five 
weeks from now so that the musical world may have possession of 
them by the autumn. He sends his best respects to Papa although he 
has not the pleasure of personal acquaintance. * , . 

After many bumpings and joltings we reached Prague yesterday at 
twelve o'clock and went at once to a table d'hote lunch. In the after- 
noon we went to see Hanka [a Czech scholar] for whom Mr Hube had 
given Maciejewski a letter of introduction. I was sorry I had not 
thought of asking Mr Skarbek to give me a letter to this famous 
philosopher. But we had spent so much time in the cathedral that we 
missed Hanka. On the whole the city is beautiful, as one sees it from 
the castle hill: it is extensive, ancient, and was once rich. I obtained 
six letters of introduction just before I left Vienna, five from Wiirfel 
and one from Blahetka to Pixis, 1 asking him to show me the con- 
servatoire. They would like me to play here, but I shall only be staying 
three days. Besides, I have no wish to spoil the success I had in Vienna 
(even Paganini was snubbed here), so I shall remain quiet, Wurfel's 
five letters are for the theatre-director, the Kapellmeister and the chief 
musical personalities. I shall deliver them, as he strongly urged me to do, 

1 Johann Peter Pfoeis (1788-1874), a German pianist and composer to whom Chopin 

dedicated his Fantasia on Polish Airs (Op. 13). 

28 



but I have no intention of playing. Wiirfei also kindly gave me a letter 
for Klengel in Dresden. I must stop now as it's time to go to Hanka's. 
I shall present myself as a godson of Skarbek and I expect there will be 
no need of a letter. 

24. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Dresden. 26 August 1829 

To the High and Mighty Professor Chopin and Family of Warsaw, 
my Beloved Parents, from their Son, now resident in Dresden! 

I am well and in the highest spirits. A week ago I was in Vienna, not 
knowing that I should soon be in Dresden. We paid a lightning visit 
to Prague but made good use of our time. Hanka was delighted to have 
from me news of Mr Skarbek. We had to sign his visitors' book, 
reserved for those who come to the Prague museum and especially for 
those who enjoy his esteem. He already has entries made by Brodzinski, 
Morawski, etc., so each of us had to think of something suitable in 
verse or prose. Szwejkowski wrote a harangue. What could a musician 
do? Fortunately it occurred to Maciejewski to make up a four-line 
stanza for a mazurka; I composed the music and wrote it in the book 
with my poet as something quite original. Hanka was delighted, the 
mazurka being written especially for him in recognition of his services 
in the field of Slavonic studies. He gave me a complete set of views of 
Prague for Mr Skarbek. . . . [He mentions the beauties of the town.] 
Blahetka's and Wiirfel's letters to Pixis ensured me a most courteous 
reception. Pixis postponed his lessons, made me stay with him and 
asked me all sorts of questions. Noticing on his desk a visiting-card 
with the name of Klengel I asked whether it might be a namesake of 
the great Dresdener who happened to be in Prague. He replied that it 
was Klengel himself who had just arrived and, finding him away from 
home, had left his card. I was very pleased as I had been given a letter 
for him in Vienna. When I mentioned this to Pixis he invited me to 
drop in after lunch as he had asked Klengel to come at that time. We 
actually met on Pixis's stairs and I listened to him playing his fugues for 
two hours. I did not play myself although they asked me to. He plays 
quite nicely but (entre nous) it might be better. 

Klengel gave me a letter for "The Most Illustrious Chevalier Mor- 
lacchi, First Conductor of the Royal Band", in which, as he told me, 
he asks him to make me acquainted with the whole musical life of 
Dresden and to introduce me to Mile Pechwell, his pupil and, according 
to him, the leading woman pianist here. He was most friendly and 
before I left I spent a couple of hours with him. He is going to Vienna 

29 



and Italy, so we had plenty to talk about a splendid acquaintance 
which I value far above poor old Czerny's (hush!). 

We spent three days altogether in Prague: I don't even know how 
the time flew. I have always something on my mind, which explains 
how, on the day before I left, I came out of the closet not properly 
buttoned up and walked straight into somebody else's room. I was 
right inside when an amused traveller said in amazement, "Good 
morning!" "I beg your pardon," said I, rushing out. You really could 
not tell one room from another. We left Prague by special coach about 
noon and reached Teplitz in the evening. Next day I found the name of 
Ludwik Lempicki in the "List of Arrivals" and went straight to pay 
my respects; he was pleased to see me and said there were lots of Poles 
here, including the elder Pruszak, Joseph Kochler and Kretkowski 
from Kamienna. They have their meals together in the German Room, 
but he will not dine there today as he is invited by the Prince and 
Princess Clary to their residence. They are an important, almost 
sovereign, family with huge estates and they own the town of Teplitz 
itself. Princess Clary is the sister of Chotek, the Governor of Bohemia. 
Lempicki asked me to give him the pleasure of accompanying him to 
a soiree at the Clarys*. He said that he is quite at home there and would 
mention it to them at dinner. As we were to spend the day-time 
visiting the neighbourhood, I accepted. 

We went everywhere; in the Wallenstein palace at Dux, we saw a 
fragment of the great leader's skull, the halberd with which he was 
killed and many other relics. In the evening, instead of going to the 
theatre, I got dressed, pulled on the white gloves I had worn at my 
last concert in Vienna, and at half past eight went off With Lempicki to 
the princely house. 

In we went; a small but cultivated assembly: a kind of Austrian 
prince, a general whose name I forget, an English sea-captain, a few 
young fashionables, and also, it appears, some Austrian princes and a 
Saxon general called Leiser, frightfully bemedalled and with a scarred 
face. After tea, during which I had a long talk with the Prince himself, 
his mother asked me to deign to take my seat at the piano (a good Graff). 
I deigned, requesting for my part that they would deign to give me a 
theme for an improvisation. At once among the fair sex, who sat around 
a large table, embroidering, knitting or weaving, there ran a murmur; 
"A theme!" Three charming little princesses put their heads together; 
then one of them referred the matter to Mr Fritsche (young Prince 
Clary's tutor, I imagine) and he with general approval proposed a 
theme from Rossini's Moses. I improvised and so successfully, as it 

30 



appears, that General Leiser had a long talk with me afterwards, and, 
hearing that I was going to Dresden, he at once wrote the following 
letter to Baron von Friesen [in French]: "Mr Frederic Chopin is 
recommended by General Leiser to Baron von Friesen, Grand Cham- 
berlain to H.M. the King of Saxony, who is requested to assist him 
during his stay in Dresden and to favour him with the acquaintance of 
a number of our principal artists." Underneath he added in German; 
"Mr Chopin is himself one of the most eminent pianists I have ever 
heard/* Such is an exact copy of General Leiser's note, written in 
pencil and left unsealed. That evening I played four times, and the 
princesses wanted me to stay longer in Teplitz and come to dinner the 
next day. Lempicki even undertook to bring me back to Warsaw with 
him if I would stay longer. But, not wanting to desert my colleagues, I 
declined with thanks. And so at five yesterday morning we left Teplitz 
in a coach hired for two thalers and reached Dresden at four in the 
afternoon. I at once met Lewinski and the Labedzkis. My trip is turning 
out fine: today I shall hear Goethe's Faust, and on Saturday, according 
to Klengel, the Italian opera. 

I am finishing this morning the letter I began yesterday. I must dress 
and go to Baron Friesen and Morlacchi, for I have no time to lose. 
We are thinking of leaving Dresden at the end of the week but before 
then we shall visit Saxon Switzerland if the weather allows. A couple of 
days in Wroclaw and then home. I am so eager to get back to you, my 
dearest parents, that I would rather not stop at the Wiesiolowskis'. 
What stories and goings-on I shall have to tell you! marvellous, 
fabulous ones ! 

P.S. Court Chamberlain Baron von Friesen received me very civilly 
and asked where I was staying. He stated that the chamberlain con- 
cerned with the orchestra was not in Dresden at the moment but that 
he would inquire who was replacing him, and that although my stay 
in the town was to be so short he would do his best to assist me in every 
possible way. Plenty of formalities and bows on both sides. I'll save up 
the rest of the story for the letter I shall send you from Wroclaw in a 
week or ten days' time. I have seen the Art Gallery, the Horticultural 
Show and the principal gardens; I have been paying visits and now I'm 
off to the theatre enough for one day, I hope! 

Second P.S. My letter had to wait until later at night: I have just 
come back from Faust. We had to be in the theatre-queue at half past 
four; the performance lasted from six till eleven. Devrient, whom I 
had already seen in Berlin, was Faust. They were celebrating Goethe's 
eightieth birthday. It is a frightening but powerful fantasy. During 

31 



the entr'actes they played excerpts from Spohr's opera of the same 
name. And so to bed. I am expecting Morlacchi here tomorrow 
morning. I shall go with him to MUe PechwelTs. I am not going to 
him: he's coming to me! Ha ha ha! ... Good night. 

Your Fritz 

On his return to Warsaw at the beginning of September Chopin sent off 
a long letter to his bosom friend Woyciechowski, describing his recent trip to 
Austria. The facts are the same as those contained in previous letters, but 
some further details of his Vienna concert are of interest. 

25. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. 12 September 1829 

. . . Three piano-makers offered to send an instrument to my lodging. 
I declined, for my room was too small and those few hours of practice 
would not have been of much use, especially as I was due to play in two 
days' time. Then in one single day I made the acquaintance of May- 
seder, Gyrowetz, Lachner, Kreutzer, Schuppanzigh, Merk and Levi 
in short, all the great musicians of Vienna; but that did not stop the 
orchestra from scowling at me during rehearsal, the main cause being 
that, having scarcely arrived, I had the nerve to play my own com- 
positions. Well, I began the rehearsal with your Variations which were 
to be preceded at the concert by the Krakowiak Rondo. They went 
well, but I had to begin the Rondo a couple of times and the orchestra 
got frightfully mixed up and blamed my bad writing. The cause of 
the confusion was that the rests were written differently above and 
below the stave, but it was agreed that only the top ones should count. 
It was partly my fault, but I had expected that they would understand. 
All the same this inaccuracy infuriated them, for these gentlemen are 
themselves virtuosi and composers. Anyhow they made such cutting 
remarks about me that I felt almost like falling ill in preparation for 
the evening's performance. However, Baron Demmar, the director, 
noticing this little prejudice on the orchestra's part (by the way, 
Wiirfel insisted on conducting and they don't like him I don't know 
why) proposed that instead of the Rondo I should improvise* When 
he said that* the orchestra opened their eyes very wide. I was so worked 
up that in despair I accepted, and who knows but what my bad temper 
and the risk I was running did not spur me on to a better performance 
in the evening. Anyway, the sight of the Viennese public did not put me 
out in the least, and as it is the custom for the orchestra to stay in their 
usual places [down below] instead of being on the stage, I sat down, 

32 



pale, with a young man wearing rouge to turn over the pages (he 
boasted that he had done the same for Moscheles, Hummel, Herz, etc,, 
when they were in Vienna), in front of a superb instrument, perhaps 
the finest then in Vienna, made by Graff* Believe me, I played out of 
sheer desperation. The Variations produced such an effect that although 
they applauded after each one I had to come out and take another bow 
at the end. In between, Mile Veltheim sang she is Kammersangerin 
to the King of Saxony. At last the moment came for me to improvise. 
I don't know how it all happened, but it went so well that the orchestra 
began to clap and I was again called back to the stage. So ended my first 
concert. The Viennese papers praised me so generously that I am not 
worried about the [Warsaw] Courier, A week kter I played again 
they insisted. I was glad I did, so that people at home should not say, 
"He pkyed once and fled". Another reason was that I had resolved to 
pky at a second concert that Krakowiak Rondo which had filled 
Gyrowetz, Lachner, other Viennese experts and even the orchestra with 
enthusiasm. (Forgive me for saying all this.) In the end I was recalled 
not once but twice. At my second concert I had also to repeat the 
Variations, for both the ladies and Haslinger were immensely taken by 
them. They will appear in the O deon collection that is honour enough, 
I suppose. Lichtenstein, Beethoven's patron, offered me his piano for 
the concert a great favour as it appeared to him that the tone of 
mine was too thin; but it's my way of playing, which once again the 
ladies found so attractive, particularly Mile Blahetka, the leading 
Viennese woman pianist who must have indeed been very impressed, 
for she gave me her own compositions with an autograph dedication 
as a souvenir when I left. N.B. She is not yet twenty, lives with her 
parents who were most kind and gave me letters for Prague, and is a 
bright, even a pretty, girl. The Viennese newspapers wrote of my 
second concert: "Here is a young man who does things in his own 
manner, a style which he knows how to employ with success and which 
is far removed from all other types of concerted music," etc. I imagine 
I need say no more, since the notice ends: "Today also, Mr Chopin 
gave general satisfaction". Forgive me if I am forced to pass on to you 
such opinions about myself, but I am writing to you and these things 
give me more pleasure than any number of Warsaw Couriers. I am close 
friends with Czerny and have often played duets at his house. He is a 
kind fellow, but nothing more. Klengel is, of all my pianistic acquaint- 
ances, the one who pleases me most. I met him at Pixis's in Prague. He 
pkyed me his fugues one might say that they form a sequel to Bach's: 
there are forty-eight of them, and as many canons. The difference 

33 



between him and Czerny is obvious. . . . [The letter ends with the 
usual affectionate greetings to Titus.] 

Returning to Warsaw on 12 September Chopin settled down to work 
again, his chief occupation being his first piano concerto in F minor. It is now 
that he reveals the secret of his love for Constantia Gladkowska> a young student 
of singing at the Conservatoire, whom he had met in the spring of this year. 

26. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKJ AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. 3 October 1829 
[After some preliminary enquiries concerning Titus's health, etc.] 

. . . You write that you have read about my concerts in two papers. 
If they were Polish ones you can't have got much satisfaction. They 
unfortunately not only couldn't translate correctly but even deliberately 
distorted to my disadvantage the opinions expressed in Vienna: I will 
explain it to you verbally later on. Hube, who returned last week after 
his visits to Trieste and Venice, brought me cuttings from the Vienna 
Sammler and the Zeitschriftfur Literatur in which my compositions are 
discussed in detail and abundantly praised forgive me for writing 
such things. They end by calling me **A virtuoso in his own right" and 
highly gifted by nature. If extracts like those were to fall into your 
hands I should have no cause for shame. You want to know what I 
think of doing with myself this winter. Well, I shan't stay in Warsaw 
I shall go where circumstances lead me I don't know where. The 
fact is that Prince RadziwiU, or rather his wife, who is very kind, has 
invited me to Berlin, even offering me accommodation in his own 
mansion. But what's the use of it, since I ought to go back to where I 
made my debut, that is Vienna, where I promised to return? One of 
the papers there wrote that a longer period in Vienna would be of 
great advantage to my future career. You yourself must feel the 
necessity for me to go back to Vienna, but not on account of Mile 
Blahetka I think I told you she is young, pretty and plays well 
because it is perhaps my misfortune that I have already found my ideal, 
whom I have served faithfully, though without saying a word to her, 
for six months; whom I dream of, in whose memory the Adagio of my 
concerto has been written, and who this morning inspired me to write 
the little waltz 1 I am sending you. Notice the pkce marked with a 
cross. No one but you knows of this. How I should enjoy playing it to 
you, dearest Titus ! In the Trio the bass-melody must stand out as far 
as the upper E flat in the fifth bar. There's no need to write about it 
you wiU feel it. 

1 Op. 70, No. 3 in D flat.

The only musical news is that every Friday we have music at Kessler's. 
Yesterday they played among other things Spohr's Octet wonderful, 
glorious ! Sowan gave a soiree a bore. It was there that I got to know 
quite well one Bianchi, who travels with the Chiavinis. He is a good 
violinist but brags too much, so far as I could judge* Soliva was 
pleasant and asked about you. . . . [Then after giving news of their 
common friends Chopin continues] I go every day to Brzezina's 
[music-shop]. Nothing fresh for you, apart from Pixis's concerto which 
I don't think much of. The Rondo seems to me the best part of it. 
You wouldn't believe how depressing Warsaw is for me just now. If 
it were not for my family's devotion I could not put up with it. How 
awful it is to have no one to go to in the mornings, no one with whom 
to share one's joys and sorrows. It is dreadful, when something weighs 
on your mind, not to have someone to whom you can unburden 
yourself. You know what I am referring to. I tell my piano things which 
once I used to tell you. Kostus will be pleased to learn that you have 
written and that you will be coming, or at least that you've promised 
to come. You must carry out your plan of coming here, I should go 
crazy with joy if I could go on my travels with you, but we must go in 
different directions I shall be going to study in Italy, by way of 
Vienna, and next winter I am to go to Paris with Hube. But all these 
plans may be changed, for the fact is that Papa would rather send me to 

Berlin, which I certainly don't want I'm sorry I sent you that waltz 

which might make you angry with me, but I swear I only wanted to 
give you pleasure you know how terribly fond of you I am. 

F. Chopin 

27. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTXJRZYN 

Warsaw. 20 October 1829 
Dearest Titus, 

You must be wondering why this craze for writing letters has come 
over me sending you three letters in such a brief space of time. At 
seven o'clock this evening I am setting out for Poznan, going to visit 
the Wiesiolowskis. So I'm writing before I go because I don't know 
how long I shall be staying there, my passport being valid only for a 
month. I intend to return after two weeks. The reason for my journey 
is that Radziwill will be on his estates near Kalisz. There was also a 
suggestion that I should go on to Berlin and stay at his residence, and a 
lot of similar proposals, all very fine and amusing, but I don't see the 
point of them, even if they all came to pass, which I doubt. It's the old 
saying: "The promises of princes never mean much/' But Papa simply 

c 35 



won't believe that they are nothing but belles paroles, so that is why I 
am going I think I wrote to you about it already. You know my little 
habit of repeating for the tenth time, as a novelty, something I have 
already mentioned. . . . 

I must tell you that Kessler gives little musical at-homes every Friday. 
We all go and play there is no definite programme, we play whatever 
happens to turn up. Thus on the Friday before last we had Ries's 
Concerto in C sharp minor, played with quartet accompaniment, and 
also HummeFs E flat major Trio and Beethoven's last Trio, f ve never 
heard anything so great: in it Beethoven snaps his fingers at the whole 
world. [He then mentions minor works that were played.] Although 
these things came after Beethoven's Trio they did not suffice to efface 
the enormous impression which the Trio made on me, particularly as it 
was well performed. Serwaczyiiski accompanied, which he does 
extremely well. . . . 

Eisner has praised the Adagio of my concerto. He says it is original; 
but I don't wish to hear any opinions on the Rondo just yet as I am not 
quite satisfied with it. It will be interesting to see whether I shall have 
completed it by the time I get back. I was told yesterday that a certain 
young lady has arrived from St Petersburg I can't remember her 
name [Leonora Neuman] but she is said to be pretty and to play the 
violin marvellously- 

[After further slight gossip Chopin makes the first mention of his 
celebrated Etudes in a postscript.] I have written a big Technical Exer- 
cise in my own special manner. I'll show it to you when we meet.

* , t -,, . Antonin [near Poznanl. 4 November 1829 

My dear Chopin, l J 

I gratefully accept the dedication of your Trio which you are kind 
enough to offer me. I should even be glad if you would hasten its 
publication so that I might have the pleasure of playing it with you 
when you pass through Poznan on your way to Berlin. Accept, my 
dear Chopin, my renewed assurances of the interest which your talent 
arouses in me and of the high esteem in which I hold you. 

Antoni, Prince Radziwill 

29. CHOPIN TO TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

_ ,-. Warsaw. Saturday 14 November 1829 

Dearest Titus, 7 

Your last letter, in which you send me your warmest greetings, 
reached me at RadziwilTs place at Antonin. I was there a week and 

36 



you can't imagine how well it suited me. I have just returned by the 
latest stage-coach and I was hard put to it to find reasons for declining 
to stay longer. If it had been left to my own choice I could have stayed 
there until they kicked me out, but my private affairs especially my 
concerto, which is still unfinished and urgently calls out for the com- 
pletion of its Finale forced me to quit that Paradise. It contained two 
Eves, the young princesses, extraordinarily charming and kind, musical 
and sensitive creatures. The old Princess herself knows that it is not 
birth that makes a man what he is, and she is so winning in her manner 
that it is impossible not to like her. You know how fond of music the 
Prince is. He showed me his Faust and I found many things in it so well 
conceived, even inspired, as I should never have expected from a 
Governor-General. Among other things there is a scene in which 
Mephistopheles tempts Marguerite by playing his guitar and singing 
under her window, and at the same time one hears the chanting of the 
choir in a neighbouring church. This contrast makes a great effect in 
performance; in the score you can see how artistically the song is 
written, and still more so the diabolic accompaniment under the solemn 
chant. This will give you some idea of his conception of music; more- 
over he is a confirmed Gliickist. Dramatic music has no meaning for 
him except in so far as it depicts situations and emotions consequently 
the overture has no proper conclusion but leads straight into the intro- 
ductory scene. The orchestra remains off-stage so that the audience 
shall not be disturbed by the movements of the string-players and the 
beatings and blowings of the orchestra. When I was there I wrote an 
Alia polacca for piano and 'cello [published as Op. 3]. It is merely a 
series of brilliant effects, a salon-piece for the ladies: you see I wanted 
something for Princess Wanda to learn I was giving her lessons at the 
time. She is young, seventeen, pretty, and God knows how pleasant 
it was to place her little fingers on the keys. But, joking apart, she has 
plenty of genuine musical feeling and you don't have to tell her 
crescendo here, piano there, quicker, slower and so on. I could not get 
out of sending them my Polonaise in F minor [Op. 71, No. 3] which 
intrigued Princess Eliza, so please send it to me by the next post for I 
should not like them to put me down as a boor. I don't want to write 
it out from memory, dear boy, for I might make it different from what 
it really is. You can form some idea of the Princess's character when I 
tell you that I had to play that Polonaise for her every day, and nothing 
pleased her so much as its trio-section in A flat. . . . Princess Radziwill 
wished that I might be in Berlin in May, so there is nothing to stop me 
from going to Vienna for the winter. So far as I know I shan't be leaving 

37 



before December: Papa's name-day is on the <5th, so I shall perhaps go 
towards the end of the month. I hope to see you, but I am making no 
plans : if I were to go before you arrive (but I don't think it's likely) I 
should write and tell you. There is nothing I desire more than to see 
you, even if it has to be out of the country. You can't imagine what I 
lack most in Warsaw: someone to talk to, someone I can trust. You said 
you would like to have my portrait: if I could steal one from Princess 
Eliza I would send it to you she sketched me twice in her album and 
they say the likeness is good. Miroszewski hasn't time [to make a 
portrait] just now. My dear Titus, you are too kind and, believe me, 
I'm nearly always thinking of you. As long as I live I shall never give 

you up. 

Yours devotedly, 

F.Ch. 

Let me remind you again about the F minor Polonaise. Be a good 
boy and send it to me by the next post. I have written a few exercises- 
if you were here I should play them well. [The letter ends with small 
items of news concerning various friends.] 

During this winter 0/1829-30 Chopin was chiefly occupied in putting the 
finishing touches to his fast concerto and preparing for his official debut in 
Warsaw. After numerous private rehearsals the concert was given on ij March 
and was such a success that it had to be repeated on the 22nd. 

30. TO TlTUS WOYOECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Saturday 27 March 1830 
My dearest friend, 

Never have I felt your absence so much as at this moment; you are 
not here and I have no one to whom I can pour out my feelings, A 
single glance from you after each of my concerts would have been 
more to me than all this praise from journalists or people like Eisner, 
Kurpinski, Soliva and so on* As soon as I got your letter I wanted to 
describe the first concert* but I was so distracted and occupied with 
preparations for the second one, which took place on the following 
Monday, that when I sat down to write I couldn't collect my thoughts. 
I am still in. the same state today, but I won't wait until I can think 
calmly, as it is time for the post and calm moments are rare with me. 
Well then, my first concert, although it was sold out and there was not 
a box or seat to be had three days beforehand, did not make on the 
general public the impression I thought it would. The first Allegro of 
my concerto, which relatively few could grasp, called forth applause, 

38 



but it seems to me that people felt they had to show interest ("Ah, 
something new!") and pretend to be connoisseurs. The Adagio and 
Rondo produced the greatest effect and exclamations of sincere 
admiration could be heard. But the Pot-pourri on Polish Airs [pub- 
lished as Op. 13] did not in my opinion fully achieve its aim. They 
applauded because they felt they must show at the end that they had 
not been bored. Kurpinski discovered fresh beauties in my concerto 
that evening, but Wiman admitted again that he doesn't know what 
people see in my first Allegro. Ernemann was completely satisfied, but 
Eisner regretted that the tone of my piano was too woolly and pre- 
vented the runs in the bass from being heard. That evening everybody 
up in the gallery and those standing at the side of the orchestra were 
satisfied, but the audience in the stalls complained about my playing 
too quietly and I would like to have been at "Cinderella's" [a Warsaw 
cafe] to hear the arguments that must have raged about me. This is 
why Monacki, in the Polish Courier, after praising me to the skies, 
particularly for the Adagio, ends by advising me to show more energy. 
I considered very carefully where this energy should come from, and 
at my second concert I played, not on my own piano, but on a 
Viennese instrument. Diakow, the Russian general, was kind enough to 
lend me his piano better than that Hummel one and at once the 
audience, which was larger than at the first concert, was satisfied. They 
applauded straightaway, were delighted that each note sounded like a 
little pearl and praised me for playing better than at the first concert. 
When I came forward at the end there were calls for a third concert. 
The Krakowiak Rondo had an enormous effect and there were four 
rounds of applause. Kurpinski was sorry I had not played my Fantasia 
[on Polish Airs] on the Viennese instrument and the next day Grzy- 
mala expressed the same opinion more strongly in the Polish Courier. 
Eisner's view is that I could only be properly judged after the second 
concert, but frankly I myself would have preferred to play on my own 
piano. The general feeling, however, is that the instrument I used was 
better suited to the hall. You know how the first programme was 
arranged; well, the second began with Nowakowski's symphony (as 
a compliment to the composer), then came the first movement, 
Allegro, of the concerto, Bielawski pkyed Beriot's Variations and then 
came my Adagio and Rondo. I began the second half with the Krako- 
wiak Rondo, then Mme Mayer sang in her very best style an ark from 
Soliva's Helen and Malvina. Finally I improvised and greatly pleased 
the boxes on the first balcony. To be quite frank, I did not improvise 
in the way I felt inclined to, for it would not have suited that kind of 

39 



audience. All the same, I am surprised that the Adagio made such a 
general impression: wherever I go they speak of nothing else. You have 
of course had all the newspapers, or at least the main ones, and you 
can confirm that everyone was delighted. Mile de Moriolles sent me a 
laurel wreath and today somebody else sent me a poem. Orlowski has 
written mazurkas and waltzes on themes from my concerto, and 
Sennewald, Brzezina's partner, has asked for my portrait [to have it 
engraved and sold], but I could not allow that it would be going too 
far: I have no desire to see myself used for wrapping up butter, which 
is what happened to LeleweFs portrait. 

I will send you my portrait as soon as I possibly can; you want it and 
shall have it, but no one else. Well, I might give it to one other person, 
but not before you, who are dearest to me. No one but myself has read 
your letter. Now, as always, I carry your letters about with me. In May, 
when I go for a walk outside the town, thinking of my approaching 
journey, what a joy it will be to take out your letter and learn again 
beyond doubt that you love me; or at least I can look at the hand and 
writing of one to whom I am absolutely devoted! They want me to 
give another concert but I have no desire to do so. You can't imagine 
what a torture the three days before a public appearance are to me. 
Besides, I shall be finishing the first Allegro of my second concerto 
[in E minor, Op. n] before the holidays that's why I shall wait until 
after the holidays before giving a third concert, although I know that 
even at this moment I could have a much larger audience, for the 
people in high society have not heard me often. Among the voices 
from the stalls, at my last concert, calling for a third one, there was 
one shouting: "In the Town Hall!" so loudly that I heard it on the 
stage. But I doubt whether I shall take any notice, and if I do give a 
concert it will certainly be at the theatre. It's not a question of making 
money the theatre did not bring in much, for the box-office clerk 
had a free hand and took charge of everything. After deducting 
expenses I did not get five thousand [zlotys] from both concerts, 
although, as Drnuszewski reminded me, for a concert with a pianist 
the audience had never been so large as at my first concert and even 
more so at the second. What concerns me most is the fact that at the 
Town Hall I should have just the same difficulties and yet not make 
a very much better impression by my playing. I could not play to 
suit everyone and should have to choose between the aristocracy and 
the townsfolk. If and when I do play, I still feel: 
"Unborn is he for whom mankind 
Nought but words of praise can find/* 

40 



Dobrzynski looks askance at me because I did not select his sym- 
phony; JMme Wodzinska is furious that I did not reserve her a box . . . 
and so on. [He ends with references to friends and neighbours.] 

31. TO TlTUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTUBZYN 

Warsaw. Saturday 10 April 1830 
(Anniversary of Emilia's death) 
My dearest friend, 

I intended writing to you last week but I simply don't know where 
the time went to. I must tell you that our society is frightfully busy with 
music-making, not even pausing during Easter week, and last Monday 
there was a grand soiree at Filipeus's house, where Mme Sowan sang 
charmingly a duet from Semiramide and I had to accompany a comic 
duet from [Rossini's] II Turco sung by Soliva and Gresser: it was 
encored. I need not give you further details except to mention that 
Mme Gladkowska inquired after you. 

Plans are now ready for a soiree to be given at Lewicki's where, 
among other things, Prince Galitzin is to play Rode's Quartet. They 
will be doing Hummel' s Sentinelle and will finish with my Polonaise 
for 'cello, to which I have added an Introduction especially written for 
Kaczynski. We have tried it over and it goes well. Such is my news of 
the drawing-rooms and musical events, so now I turn to journalistic 
and musical novelties which concern me no less than the reports from 
the salons, inasmuch as they contain favourable opinions of myself. 
I would like to send them to you. In a half-page article in the Warsaw 
Gazette there's said to be a dig at Eisner, for Soliva told me when we 
dined at the Moriolles' that if he had not had pupils about to make their 
debut, and had not been afraid of stirring up trouble, he would have 
answered it himself. He told me you had written to him and I expect 
that if he replies he will not forget to mention the incident. It's not 
easy to give you a picture of all this in a few words: if I could I would 
send you the papers to give you a clear idea of the affair. But, as the 
saying goes, "A wink's as good as a nod'*, so I will just give you a brief 
hint of what it's all about. After my concerts there was a flood of 
notices, particularly in the Polish Courier* Although they were inspired 
by one-sided praise they were at all events tolerable. The Official 
Journal also devoted a few pages to singing my praises, but among other 
things it brought out in one of its numbers such a heap of silly things 
(with the best intentions in the world) that I was in despair as soon as I 
read a reply in the Polish Gazette, whose author very justly took away 
from me all that the other had exaggeratedly attributed to me. I must 

41 



tell you that the article in the Official Journal maintains that, just as the 
Germans are proud of Mozart, so the Poles will be proud of me an 
obvious piece of nonsense. But earlier in the article it is stated that if I 
had fallen into the hands of some pedant or Rossiniste (stupid expres- 
sion!) I should not, so to speak, be what I am. Although I am in fact 
nothing, the article is right, for if I had not learnt from Eisner, who 
understood how to teach and convince me, I would certainly know 
less than I do today. This stab about Rossinistes [Kurpinski is referred 
to] and this praising of Eisner (who has merely presented his pupil) 
infuriated you know whom so much that, writing in the Warsaw 
Gazette, he starts off his article with Fredro's play The Friends and 
ends up with Rossini's Le Comte Ory, while in the middle he thunders: 
"Why should we owe gratitude to Eisner since it is clear that he can't 
shake pupils out of his sleeve and has merely shown that, with the 
exception of myself, you can't make bricks without straw." (I ought 
to explain that at my second concert they played a symphony by 
Nowakowski [another of Eisner's pupils].) Thirty-five years ago Eisner 
wrote a quartet which has in its title the phrase: "in the best Polish 
style", an addition which was made by the publisher on account of the 
work's Polish minuet; so today's press-notice makes fun of this quartet 
without mentioning the composer's name. Soliva says that he might 
employ the same turns of phrase to make fun of Cecilia [an opera by 
Kurpinski], inasmuch as the author of the article, while still speaking 
of me with affection and delicacy, really thumbs his nose at me and 
advises me to study Rossini but not to copy him. He tenders me this 
advice as a result of that other article, which says that I have originality 
& fact which the Gazette does not deny. . . . With regard to a third 
concert which they are expecting more than ever here, I shan't give it, 
at least not until shortly before my departure, when I might play my 
new concert.o. This new one is not yet finished and I should have to 
play the Fantasia on Polish Airs which is requested and your Variations 
[i.e. Op, 2] which I am just waiting for. The Leipzig Fair has begun and 
Brzezina will be receiving a consignment [of music from Vienna]. . . 
Constantine [the Russian Viceroy] has just driven past with Valerian 
SkarzynsH and behind them rides Gendre [his spy]; carriages roll past 
and in the distance I can see a bright pattern made by ladies' hats. The 
weather is beautiful . . . and here comes CeMski, the man who makes me 
take exercise. The good fellow always pays attention to my health. I 
shall walk down the street with him and I shall perhaps at least see some- 
one who will remind me of you for you are the only one I care for. 

R Chopin 

42 



By the way, among the ridiculous pieces of news I must add that 
Orlowski has made up mazurkas and gallops from themes of mine 
of course I have asked him not to publish them. 

32. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Saturday 17 April 1830 
Papa's birthday 1 
My dearest friend, 

What a sense of relief I feel in the midst of my unbearable melancholy 
when I receive a letter from you; I needed one especially today for I 
have never been so depressed. I wish I could throw off the thoughts 
which poison my happiness, but I take a kind of pleasure in indulging 
them. I don't know what is wrong with me and perhaps it will calm 
my mind if I write you a letter you know how I enjoy writing to 
you. ... I don't want to read or hear what people write or say about 
me. Nevertheless, on Sunday I felt I should Hke to hear what Kurpinski 
had to say about the article in the Warsaw Courier, but it looks as if he 
were trying to keep out of the way, for he was not to be found among 
the learned assembly gathered together at Minasowicz's for the Easter- 
feast. No, he wasn't there; Ernemann and I were the only musicians. 
But since I was determined to find out what sort of face he would show 
me, I went twice to wish him a happy Easter, but missed him both 
times. I saw Soliva today. This Italian is perhaps a rogue, but he showed 
me what he had written in reply to that article note that it was in 
French, and for his private use only, not for publication in any news- 
paper, and was in fact excellent. On the whole he speaks up very fairly 
for Eisner against those others, without mentioning any names. He is 
nice to one's face, not that it matters much, but I am merely polite and 
see him only when I cannot avoid it, in spite of all his invitations, . . . 
My sisters would be most interested in reading your letters, but they 
never get a chance to, because I keep them entirely to myself and read 
them daily, for myself alone, in the silence of my soul. Louise becomes 
quite nasty about it, especially when I told her you send her no greet- 
ings. Tomorrow is Easter in the Russian church but I shall not be 
going to any feast. I have never eaten so little at an Easter-feast, even 
when I was at the one given by the Pruszaks on Monday (or was it 
Sunday? can't remember) where they had masses of people, hams, 
cakes, etc. I did not even stay to dinner. There was a huge party with 
Lewinski as host, Alfons, the Mleczkos, Dziewanowski, whom I

15 April 1771.

couldn't stand, and everybody. N. has asked me to be godfather to 
his little boy: I could not refuse, particularly as it was at the request of 
that unfortunate girl [Le. the governess. See p. 19] who is leaving for 
Danzig. Mme Pruszak will be the godmother. It is all to be kept from 
my parents who are supposed to know nothing. You know I had an 
idea last week of coming to spend a week with you, but it came to 
nothing as I found myself suddenly with so much to do I had to get 
on with my composing at full pressure. If you come during the sessions 
of the House you are bound to arrive in time for my concert. I have a 
kind of presentiment that you will come, and if you do I shall have 
complete faith in dreams, for I am always dreaming of you. It so often 
happens to me to mix up day and night, to live in dreams and to sleep 
during the day indeed it's worse than being asleep, for my feelings 
are still awake; but instead of renewing my strength in such a day- 
trance, as I would if I were really asleep, I feel only more tired and 
exhausted. Keep me in your affection, I beg you. 

F. Chopin 
Kindest regards from my parents, sisters and Zywny.

Warsaw* Saturday 15 May [1830] 
My dearest friend, 

It must have seemed strange to you that Fritz should not have 
condescended to answer your letter at once, but I did not have the 
information you asked for and I had to delay my reply. I can now tell 
you, dear boy, that Mile Sontag will definitely arrive in June, or per- 
haps at the end of May. What is more, during the session of the Diet, and 
at the express command of His Excellency Minister Mostowski, Miles 
Gladkowska and Wolk6w wiH make their respective debuts, one in 
Paer's Agnese [di Fitz-Henry] and the other, i.e. Wolk6w, in I/ Turco* 
How do you like the choice of operas? Yesterday I went to a soiree at 
Soliva's where there was practically no one else apart from the Sowans 
and the Gressers. Gladkowska sang an aria which SoHva had expressly 
composed for her and inserted into the opera; this aria is to be her 
show-piece and there are in fact some lovely things in it. He has 
managed to suit her voice perfectly. In Turco Wolk6w will also sing 
an aria suitable for displaying her voice; it is by Rossini and was written 
for one of the famous singers who appeared in that opera. She sings it 
weU youll see when you come, I imagine you will not miss the chance 
of hearing MUe Sontag and so 1 am grateful to the kdy ! She is said to 
be in Danzig at this moment but will come to us from there. And 

44 



then Mr Woerlitzer, pianist to His Majesty the King of Prussia, has 
been here for the last two weeks. The young fellow plays quite nicely. 
He is Jewish and hence learns very quickly. He has a thorough grasp of 
the few pieces he let us hear. He has been to see me. He is really still a 
child he's sixteen. Moscheles' Variations on Alexander's March is his 
show-piece. It seems to me he plays them perfectly, leaving nothing to 
be desired. He has twice appeared in public and each time played 
these Variations. When you hear him you will be pleased with his 
playing although, entre nous, he is still far from justifying the Court- 
title which he bears. There is another Frenchman here, a M. Brandt: 
he thought of giving a concert, then he came to see me, thought it over 
and changed his mind. ... I don't yet know how things stand with 
my travels. I think that instead of going abroad this year I shall linger 
on here until I am down with fever and that will be the end of every- 
thing. I shah 1 stay on through June, July, until I have lost the desire to 
go at all. You know why, of course . . . simply because of the heat. The 
Italian opera in Vienna only begins in September, as Henneberg told 
me yesterday, so there is no need for me to hurry, all the more since 
the Rondo of my new concerto is not finished: I must be in the right 
vein for that. Actually I am in no hurry about it: the first Allegro is 
completed, so I am not worried about the rest. I could easily give 
another concert if I wanted to, as I have not yet pkyed my Variations 
here: they have just appeared [in Vienna], so Blahetka tells me in his 
letter, and Haslinger brought them to the Leipzig Easter-fair. I expect 
that Magnus, who has gone on private business to Galicia, will go on 
from there to Vienna and will bring them back to me. The Adagio of 
my new concerto is in E major. It is not meant to create a powerful 
effect; it is rather a Romance, calm and melancholy, giving the impres- 
sion of someone looking gently towards a spot which calls to mind a 
thousand happy memories. It is a kind of reverie in the moonlight on a 
beautiful spring evening. Hence the accompaniment is muted: that is, 
the violins are stifled by a sort of comb which fits over the strings and 
gives them a nasal and silvery tone perhaps it's not a good idea, but 
why be ashamed of writing badly, against one's better knowledge, 
since only the result in actual performance will reveal the mistake? In 
all this you will observe my inclination to do things wrongly in spite 
of myself. Yes, it is so; in spite of myself some idea comes into my head 
and I take pleasure in indulging it, perhaps quite wrongly. I am sure 
you will understand me. 

I stood as godparent, with Mme Pruszak, to N/s little boy. He has 
been adopted and you wouldn't believe what a pretty child he is. At 

45 



seven o'clock this morning Mile Dupont married Mr Cechowski, 
Mme Skrodzka's brother. Dr Bixel you know the old man, he's 
sixty-three -has married his late wife's niece, a seventeen-year-old girl 
The church was full of sightseers and the young lady considered it 
strange that anyone should be sorry for her so I was told by the 
bridesmaid, Mile Moriolles. I shall be going to see her as soon as I have 
posted this letter: she has sent for me. You know that she is supposed 
to be my sweetheart. I am quite ready to admit it and so one must be 
obedient and respect the mask of hidden feelings. You know, I never 
thought that I could be so dissimulating as I am now, when I have not 
the courage to confide to you what is wrong with me. ... I do hope 
that this time you will come for my concert. I intend to try out the 
first movement at home towards the end of May, in two weeks' time. 
And I shall play it at the beginning of June, so as to get it out of the 
way before the start of the general festivities announced in the Courier. 
Write and let me know when you will be in Warsaw, for I should 
regret it still more than the first time if I had to appear in public without 
your being present. No ! you don't realise how fond of you I am, and 
have no means of showing it, yet I have long wished that you might 
know it. Oh, what would I not give to press your hand ! . . . You would 
never guess half of my miserable life. 

F. Chopin 

I can't tell you the order of the programme as I don't know it yet. I 
shall try to get Teichmann. He was to have sung a duet from Gliick's 
Armide with Mme Mayer at my second concert, as he is afraid of appear- 
ing by himself, but unfortunately Mme Cymmerman. sang it with 
Polowski during the previous week, and so Kurpinski did not wish 
them to sing the same thing it might look as if they thought they 
could sing it better. I have written such a lot, and yet I would like to 
go on writing. I was going to send a new waltz to amuse you, but you 
shall have it next week. Kindest regards from my parents and sister, not 
forgetting Mr Zywny. 

34. To TITUS WOYCEECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Saturday 5 June 1830 
My dearest friend, 

You have missed five of Mile Sontag's concerts ! Never mind, you 
will still have time to hear her if you arrive on the I3th. I think the 
1 3th is a Sunday and you will be en route just when I am trying out the 
first movement of my second concerto. I am taking advantage of the 
absence of Mile Sontag who told me yesterday with her own pretty 

46 



lips that she is making a trip to Fischbach at the command of ELM. the 
King of Prussia. You can't imagine how delighted I was to make her 
closer acquaintance I mean in her room, sitting beside her on the sofa, 
for as you know, one can take no liberties with this "messenger from 
heaven", as some of her admirers here quite correctly call her. Prince 
Radziwill introduced me in the handsomest manner, for which I am 
most grateful. However, I did not take much advantage of the 
acquaintance during her week's stay among us, seeing how weary she 
was of the visits of all those admiring bores: the chamberlains, senators, 
district-governors, generals and adjutants who hung around her, 
gazing into her pretty eyes and talking about the weather. She received 
them all very civilly, for she is so good-hearted that she couldn't be 
unkind if she tried; but yesterday she had to lock herself in her room 
in order to put on her hat to go to rehearsal the footman in the 
ante-room was at his wits' end to know what to do with so many 
callers. I did not visit her once although she asked to see me about a 
song which Radziwill arranged for her and which he sent over to me to 
make a fair copy. It consists of variations on a Ukrainian dumka; the 
theme itself and the ending are attractive, but neither Mile Sontag nor 
I like the middle part. I've altered it somewhat, but it is still not right. 
I am glad that she is going away after today's concert as it will mean an 
end to the trouble I am having, and in the meantime Radziwill will 
perhaps turn up himself for the end of the session of the Diet and will 
give up the idea of his Variations. Mile Sontag is not beautiful but she 
is attractive in the highest degree. She charms everyone by her voice 
which has not a very great range, for we usually only hear it between 
these notes: 



but it is extraordinarily cultivated. Her diminuendi are the non plus ultra, 
her portamenti wonderful and her scales, particularly the chromatic 
scales, are unsurpassable. She sang us an aria of Mercadante very, very, 
very charmingly, and Rode's Variations, especially the last one with 
the trills, couldn't have been better. The Variations on a Swiss theme 
gave such pleasure that, when she was recalled, instead of making deep 
curtsies she sang them again ! Such kindness is indescribable. The same 
thing happened again yesterday with Rode's Variations. She sang us 
that celebrated cavatina from the Barber and the one from The Thieving 
Magpie; you wouldn't believe how different it is from what you have 

47 



hitherto heard. She also sang the aria from Freischiitz, you know the one 
I mean, marvellously. Once when I went to see her I found Soliva 
there with his young ladies [Gladkowska and Wolkow]. While I was 
there they sang that duet of his, the one with "barbara sorte" that ends 
in the major you know the one and Mile Sontag told them that 
their voices were too rough and that, although their training was good, 
they must produce the voice in a different way if they don't want to 
lose it altogether within two years. In my presence she told Wolkow 
that she had great facility and many pretty effects but "too shrill a 
voice", and she invited them to come to her frequently and she will 
show them her method as far as possible. That is a piece of more than 
natural amiability, it is coquetry to such a degree that it becomes 
naturalness itself; for one cannot suppose that a human being could 
remain so perfectly natural without employing all the refinements of 
coquetry. She's a million times prettier and more attractive hi morning- 
dress than in full evening toilette, although those who have not seen 
her in the morning still find her irresistible. On her return she will 
go on giving concerts until the 22nd, after which she intends, as she 
told me herself, to go to St Petersburg so hurry up and get here in 
order not to miss more than those first five concerts. There is great 
talk of Pasta's coming here: the two of them may sing together. We 
have also a Mile Belleville, a Frenchwoman who plays the piano very 
charmingly, with an extraordinarily light touch, and very elegantly 
ten times better than WoerHtzer. She is giving a concert on Wednesday. 
She was present at that famous soiree musicale at Court, where Mile 
Sontag sang. The two young ladies both performed. So did Woer- 
litzer but he was not so well received, as I was told by Kurpinski him- 
self, who accompanied Mile Sontag. People expressed their surprise 
to me that I was not invited, but I myself felt no surprise. . . . 

I've still something to say about Sontag. She has some entirely 
original ornamentation which is enormously effective, but in a different 
way from Pagamni. Perhaps it is because her genre is smaller. It is as 
though she breathes over the stalls of the theatre a scent of the freshest 
flowers, which caresses deliriously but rarely moves one to tears. 
Radziwill declared that she acts and sings Desdemona's last scene in 
Otello so movingly that no one can refrain from tears. As a matter of 
fact I mentioned it to her and asked whether she would not give us that 
scene in costume (she is said to be a perfect actress as well). She replied 
that it was true she had often seen tears in the spectators' eyes, but it 
exhausts her to act on the stage and she had vowed to appear in operatic 
roles as rarely as possible. But do come and refresh yourself in the bosom 

48 



of friendship after your rustic hardships; Mile Sontag will sing for you 
and in this way you will absorb new strength for your labours. What 
a pity that I can't send myself instead of a letter ! Perhaps you would 
not want to have me, but I want you and I'm waiting here cleanly 
shaved. 

F. Chopin 

Mile Sontag will today sing excerpts from Semiramide. Her concerts 
are short; she usually sings four groups and in the intervals only the 
orchestra plays. Indeed one needs a breathing-space after she has sung 
she rivets one's attention so much. The young ladies from the Con- 
servatoire will not appear this month. Mile Belleville played my 
Variations [Op. 2] in Vienna and even knows one of them by heart. 
It's a pity I have come to the end of my paper for I just can't tear 
myself away from my letter or from you do you love me like that? 

35. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Saturday 21 August 1830 

[In another long letter to his friend he tells of minor events in War- 
saw while he himself is hesitating about going abroad. His chief interest 
was the debut of Constantia Gladkowska in Paer's Angela.] 

. . . My chief interest in Warsaw has been Angela. I went to the per- 
formance. Gladkowska leaves little to be desired she is better on the 
stage than in the concert-hall. I need say nothing of her acting in 
tragedy which is first-class; and as for her singing, if it were not occa- 
sionally for those high F sharps and Gs, we need look for nothing better 
in her class. You would be enchanted with her phrasing, and her 
nuances are splendid; and although her voice trembled at the beginning 
when she came on, she later sang with great confidence. The opera was 
cut: perhaps that is why I did not notice its defect of boring longueurs. 
Soliva's aria in the second act is very effective: I knew it might be so 
but I did not expect the effect to be quite so great. Last time she sang 
very charmingly the Romance which she has to sing with her harp in 
the second act. (Ernemann accompanied on the piano off-stage without 
destroying the illusion.) I was very satisfied. At the end Angela was 
recalled and greeted with enthusiastic applause. A week today MUe 
Fioville makes her d6but in II Turco* Wolk6w is more popular. I ought 
to tell you that this opera, Angela, has an awful lot of opponents who 
don't know themselves what they have against the music. I don't 
deny that the Italian [Soliva] might have chosen something more 
suitable for Gladkowska perhaps La Vestale might have been a luckier 
choice for her, but the other is pretty and has many rare beauties and 

49 



virtuoso moments which the young singer brought off marvellously. 
Szczurowski is terrifying: he has something of Talma, Kemble, 
Devrient and Z6lkowski in him I can't say what it is exactly* but he is 
perfect as the madman. According to Soliva, Zdanowicz is nonplus ultra. 
Mme Salamonowicz is wretched, Nawrocka always affected and 
Zylinski idles about on the stage. Yesterday at the rehearsal of II Turco 
I was furious at the cold, casual way in which he beats the Turk. 
Wolkow sang and acted very well indeed the role is one that she 
simply had to play and she hit it off perfectly. Perhaps it's the way 
she uses her eyes rather than her throat that will appeal to the public. 
Once or twice she goes up to D with purity and assurance. I don't 
doubt that she will be more popular than Gladkowska. The quintet 
went splendidly and the General [Director of the Theatres] was 
beaming. . . . 

Now what about me? I shall leave next month on day x but I must 
first try out my concerto, now that the Rondo is finished. Tomorrow 
Kaczynski and Bielawski will be at our house, and at ten in the morning, 
incognito, in the presence of Eisner, Ernemann, Zywny and Linowski 
I shall rehearse my Polonaise for Piano and 'Cello and the Trio. We 
shall play until we've mastered them. That is why I have not invited 
anyone apart from those I have mentioned plus Matuszynski, the only 
one who has remained true to me and isn't a false hypocrite, scoundrel, 
rogue like ... I leave you to guess who! [He is referring to Titus who 
had not written.] 

36. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Still in Warsaw. Tuesday 31 August 1830 
My dearest Titus, 

I badly needed your letter as soon as it arrived my cold vanished. 
How I wish that my letters could produce such interesting results! 
How delighted I should be if, when people read them, they could lose 
all hypocrisy and falseness. But I am sure this letter won't produce that 
effect. As far as I can see, it is sure to provoke fresh outbursts and arouse 
anger in your lion-heart. It's a good thing I'm forty miles away for my 
letter might call down at once on my head the full force of your 
vengeance, I am guilty of a great fault but I can't help enjoying it: yes, 
I am still in Warsaw. I give you my word, however, that there is really 
nothing to induce me to go abroad. You can take it from me that next 
week, that is, in September (it's the ist tomorrow) I am leaving, yes, 
I am leaving to obey the call of my vocation and of my common sense 
(which must be very small since it is not strong enough to put all other 

50 



ideas out of my head). The time for my departure is near and this week 
I must rehearse my complete concerto with the orchestral quartet so 
as to come to an understanding with them in advance and get them to 
do what I want, otherwise (as Eisner says) the orchestral rehearsal 
would not turn out well. Linowski is hard at it, copying out the parts, 
and has already started on the Rondo. I tried over my Trio last Sunday 
and perhaps because I had not heard it for a long time I felt quite 
pleased with myself (lucky man!). However one new idea came into 
my mind, that of replacing the violin by a viola, for although with the 
violin the fifth sounds better and the viola is therefore less used, never- 
theless the viola will sound stronger in contrast to the 'cello, whose 
part is written within its own proper range, and that's how I shall 
send it to the printer. So much for myself, now about other musicians 
and you will say that in this case also I have kept to the precepts of 
egotism which you have impressed upon me. Soliva drilled Mile 
Wolkow so well for last Saturday that she charmed both the stalls and 
the pit by her coquetry, her excellent acting and lovely eyes and teeth. 
She was prettier than any of our actresses; but in the first act I scarcely 
recognised her voice. She came on in a rich costume, seeming to walk 
by the sea-side, with lorgnette in hand and flashing deadly glances . . . 
she moved with such elegance that no one would have taken her for 
a beginner. All the same in spite of the tremendous applause and 
brav os she was so nervous that I did not recognise her until her aria 
in the second act, which she nevertheless did not sing so well as at the 
second performance two days ago, when the first act also went better. 
As for the singing, Gladkowska is incomparably better, and when I 
saw Wolk6w on the stage I did not expect such a difference. We all 
agree that we shall not have another like Gladkowska for clarity and 
intonation and that superior expressiveness which she displays on the 
stage. It sometimes happens to Wolkow to sing out of tune, whereas 
I have twice heard the other girl in Angela and she never produced a 
single doubtful note. When I saw them two days ago I recited your 
string of compliments, for which they were very grateful. . . . 

Two days ago I paid a second visit to General Szembek's camp. I 
must tell you that he is still established at Sochaczew and he arranged 
that Michael [Skarbek] should take me there to see him. Since, however, 
the idea fell through, he sent his adjutant Czajkowski to fetch me he's 
the brother of that Mile Czajkowska who swoons when she plays. 
Szembek is very musical, an excellent violinist (he was once a pupil of 
Rode) and a confirmed admirer of Paganini hence a good type of 
musician. He ordered his band to perform. They had practised all the 

51 



morning and I heard amazing things. Everything was played on the 
sort of trumpet they call bugles. Would you believe it, they performed 
chromatic scales with incredible speed, making diminuendi towards the 
lower notes. I had to single out for praise their soloist who, I see, won't 
be in the service much longer, poor fellow, for he looks consumptive 
although he is still quite young. It gave me something to think about, 
hearing the cavatina from Masaniello played on those trumpets 
with complete accuracy and fine shading. Szembek has a piano in his 
camp and when I played he somehow understood me, really and truly, 
without pretence. The Adagio [F minor Concerto] impressed him most, 
and he kept me playing until I was late for II Turco. By the way, there's 
a very long article in one of the Berlin papers about musical life in 
Warsaw. In its first mention o Angela it correctly praises her [Glad- 
kowska] for her singing, feeling and acting, and then goes on: "This 
young artist is a product of the Institute established under the direction 
of Messrs Eisner and Soliva. The first of these, who is a professor of 
composition, has formed a group of pupils among whom we may 
mention Messrs Orlowski, Chopin and others, who in due course will 
contribute towards, etc." Damn the fellow they couple my name with! 
"They've played you a nice trick!" hummed Bouquet with his red 
eyes, and Ernemann added that I ought to think myself lucky to be 
mentioned in the second place. That is all the article says about pupils, 
and it ends: "We shall consider later an appraisal of the work done by 
Messrs Eisner, Soliva and Kurpinski". It's all the stupid work of some 
smart Warsaw fellow. . . . 

I had a long talk with Vincent Skarzynski yesterday. He adores you 
and asked all about you. They all talk to me about Olesia, but not a 
word about you-know-who. And I am glad that the secret is buried in 
my heart and that something that came originally from you ends up 
with me. [He refers to a girl Titus had fallen in love with.] You can be 
glad to think that in me you have a kind of abyss into which you can 
fearlessly throw everything, as if to your second self, for your soul has 
long lain at the bottom of it. I keep your letters like a lover's ribbon. 
I have the ribbon, so write to me and in a week's time we shall embrace 
each other. 

Yours ever, 
F. Chopin 

. , . Just imagine ! Mile F. insists on my taking her as a pupil, to teach her 
piano-playing and . . . other things. Papa has nothing against it and 
has even on occasions given me a push towards her. She comes to see 
me but I have no desire for her. Poor girl, she has to pky concertos 



but has no idea. I advised her to go to Ernemann but he didn't want 
her and he advised her to go to Dobrzynski, saying that, since they 
both come from Lithuania, they would get on well together. All this 
is not really serious. 

Chopin's state of hopeless indecision, caused by his frustrated feelings for 
Constantia Gladkowska, continued through the summer months of 1830. 
By a psychological twist he pours out to the calm and steady Titus, who was 
over two hundred miles away, all the emotions which should have been 
expressed to the girl. 

37. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Saturday I think it's the 4th [September 1830] 

Dearest Titus, 

Let me tell you, hypocrite, that I am in a still crazier state than usual. 
I am still here I have not the strength to fix on the day for my de- 
parture; I believe that when I leave it will be to forget home for ever; 
I feel that I am leaving home only to die and how awful it must be 
to die far away from where one has lived! How frightful it will be for 
me to see some cold-hearted doctor or servant by my death-bed instead 
of my family. Believe me, I have sometimes thought of coming to find 
peace of mind with you at Chodkiewicz; but I go out, I wander 
moping about the streets and come home again ... to what purpose? 
merely to kill time. I have not yet had a rehearsal of my concerto; but 
whatever happens, before Michaelmas I shall cast aside all that is dear 
to me and find myself in Vienna, condemned to eternal regrets. What 
is all this nonsense I'm writing ! You who know so well what a man's 
strength is, explain to me why it always seems today that things will 
happen tomorrow. The only answer that comes to my mind is: "Don't 

be such a fool"- and if you know a better one, please let me have it 

[He acknowledges himself that the rest of his letter is made up of 
"idle nothings" and ends:] 

... I can't let myself go in today's letter. If I did, little Mile Moriolles 
wouldn't see me at all, and I like to be nice to other decent folks if I 
am certain that they are kindly disposed towards me. I haven't been 
to see her since she returned, and I don't mind admitting that I some- 
times put the blame for my melancholy on her by doing so I seem 
to convince people, and I appear outwardly calm. My father laughs at 
it although he would cry if he knew the truth. I kugh too, but only 
outwardly. . , .

Warsaw. 18 September 1830 

My dearest friend! Filthy Hypocrite! Disgusting Count Ory! 
Abelard, etc., 

I don't know how it comes about, but I feel wonderful, and father 

and mother are delighted Last Wednesday I rehearsed my concerto 

with the quartet. I was satisfied, but not excessively people say that 
my latest Finale is most attractive (that's because it is easiest to under- 
stand). I will write and tell you how it goes with orchestra when we 
have rehearsed it next Wednesday. I want to try it once more tomorrow 
with the quartet. When rehearsals are over I shall be going away, but 
where to? since there is nothing that attracts me anywhere. In any case 
I don't intend to stay here in Warsaw, and if you suspect it's because of 
a love-affair, as many people in Warsaw do, put such thoughts out of 
your mind and believe me when I tell you that where my self-interest 
is concerned I can be above all such things. Even if I had been in love I 
could be strong enough to hide an idle passion which could come to 
nothing. Think as you like, but my letter will make things clear. I am 
sending it by the count whom I met yesterday in Podwale Street; he 
promised to honour our humble abode with his fat person. I shouldn t 
like to travel with you. Honestly, if we did it would spoil the moment, 
more precious than a full thousand monotonous days of ordinary life, 
when we should embrace each other for the first time on foreign soil. 
It would take away all my anticipation and I shouldn't be able to greet 
and welcome you with the words which come to one's lips when joy 
has banished all cold and formal expressions and heart speaks to heart 
with a heaven-inspired tongue! Heavenly tongues! what an un- 
fortunate expression: as bad as saying "heavenly liver*' or "heavenly 
navel" all so disgustingly materialistic. But let us return to the 
moment when I shall see you abroad; perhaps I shan't be able to con- 
trol myself and I shall blurt out what I never cease to dream of, what is 
constantly before my eyes, what rings at every moment in my ears, and 
what gives me the greatest joy in the world and at the same time the 
greatest misery. But don't go and think I am in love that is something 
I am reserving for later on. 

I have begun a Polonaise with orchestra but at present it's just an 
idea, a sketch; it hasn't even a proper beginning. Anyhow I am writing 
to you today in advance, to reassure you and tell you that I shall not be 
leaving before Michaelmas. Nothing can be clearer. I can see you 
growing red with anger and throwing my letter aside. But, my dear 
boy, we have to do not what we would like but what we can. Don't 

54 



imagine that it is concern for my pocket that is holding me back. Such 
reasons against my leaving would be of little weight, but in so far as 
money is required to achieve anything, well, I have, thank God, just 
about enough, and I am not worried on that score. So it would be 
difficult for me to exclaim against the position assigned to me by the 
Berlin paper and which I deserve. Fortunately that Viennese news- 
paper wrote about me in a different tone in its notice of my Variations. 
The notice is short but so enthusiastic, so lofty and profound, and yet 
so philosophic that it is impossible to translate. It ends by saying that 
these Variations have not only outward attractions but inner merits 
which will endure. This German writer has paid me a great compli- 
ment and I shall thank him for it when I see him. There is no bias in 
what he says and he attributes to me just what I would wish to have, 
namely individuality. I would not talk at such length about myself to 
anyone but you. You mean so much to me, and I would Hke to mean 
much to you, so that is why I have sung my own praises, just as 
merchants cry up their own goods. To be mentioned second after 
Orlowski is neither too much nor too little for me. Today his new 
ballet is being given its first performance with stage-machinery by 
Lesbenier. They are expecting wonders. Yesterday I went to Cichocki's 
(the fat fellow's) birthday party. I played Spohr's quintet for piano, 
clarinet, bassoon, French horn and flute most beautiful, but badly 
written for the piano. Everything he tried to write expressly for piano 
display is intolerably difficult and it is often impossible to work out a 
fingering. The quintet was supposed to be played at seven o'clock but 
we did not begin until eleven. You'll be surprised to hear that I did not 
fall asleep but there was a charming young lady present who reminded 
me of my ideal. Just imagine ! I was there till three o'clock. The quintet 
began so late because the ballet rehearsal lasted until eleven: you will 
gather from that what an enormous ballet it is. There will be a kicking- 
up of heels today! 

Yesterday I wrote to Bartek in London. Antoni Wodzinski has 
returned from Vienna. I am definitely going there but I cannot tell you 
the exact date. I had intended leaving a week tomorrow by the Cracow 
stage-coach but I put it off. I know you think I have been persuaded 
to give up the whole project but please do believe that I am thinking of 
what is best for me. ... If only my health remains good I mean to 
spend my whole life working. I have sometimes wondered whether 
I am really lazy or whether I ought to work more than my physical 
strength allows. But honestly I am convinced that I am not yet an utter 
sluggard and that, when I really must, I can work twice as hard as at 

55 



present. You will admit that by trying to exculpate myself in this way 
I am only making myself appear the worse. I know my love for you is 
hopeless, and I only scribble all this nonsense to try to make you love 
me steadily and more deeply. One often spoils things by trying to 
improve them, but it seems that whatever I do or say makes no differ- 
ence to you either way. My feelings for you have to seek out some 
superhuman means of forcing your heart to respond to them. You are 
not the master of your own inclinations, but I am of mine and I won't 
let myself be thrown aside just as trees are stripped of the foliage which 
gives them their character, their happiness and life. Even in winter I 
shall keep my green leaves. There will be spring in my head and, please 
God, the full warmth of summer in my heart. So you needn't be 
surprised at all this talk of vegetation. Enough of this! Let it end in a 
kiss. 

Yours ever, 

F. Chopin 

Only now do I realise what a lot of nonsense I have written. You can 
see that my imagination is still working hard from yesterday and that I 
slept badly forgive me for being so tired I was dancing mazurkas. 
Father and mother send their warmest greetings, my sisters too. Louise 

is rather unwell but she'll soon be better, we hope 1 keep your letters 

near my heart, with that ribbon. These lifeless things cannot know 
each other, but they cancel that they both come from the hands of 
my friends. 

39. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Wednesday morning 22 September 1830 
My dearest friend, 

Having the opportunity of sending you a letter I can perhaps explain 
why I am still here. For the last few weeks my father has not really 
wanted me to leave, on account of the disturbances which have broken 
out all over Germany. Apart from the Rhineland provinces and Saxony 
(where they already have a new king), Brunswick, Cassel, Darmstadt, 
etc., we heard that in Vienna also a few thousand people have started 
a rebellion something to do with flour. I don't know what the flour 
has to do with it, but I do know that there has been trouble. In the 
Tyrol too there has been a row. Italy is at boiling-point and one may 
expect to hear about trouble there at any moment, so Moriolles told 
me. I have done nothing yet about my passport, but everyone declares 
that I shall get one for Austria and Prussk not a hope for Italy and 
France. And I know for a fact that several people have been refused 

56 



passports altogether, but surely that could not happen to me. Thus I 
shall certainly be leaving in a few weeks' time for Vienna via Cracow. 
Their memories of me have lately been revived [by the publication of 
his Op. 2] and I must take advantage of it. So don't be surprised at 
either me or my parents you now know the whole story. 

Yesterday Poletyllo came to see me; he leaves early tomorrow morn- 
ing, and as I am rehearsing the second concerto with full orchestra 
(apart from the trumpets and kettledrums) I have invited him to come, 
to please you he'll tell you all about it. I know that the smallest 
details will interest you. I'm sorry you are not here: I shall have to 
rely on Ernernann's opinion of my concerto. Kurpinski will be there 
too, and Soliva and the whole musical world, but I have little faith in 
these gentlemen, apart from Eisner. It will be curious to see how the 
Italian [Soliva] looks at the conductor [Kurpinski], how Czapek looks 
at Kessler, FiHp at Dobrzynski, Molsdorf at Kaczynski, Le Doux at 
Soltyk, and Poletyllo at the lot of us. History offers no precedent of all 
these gentlemen being brought face to face. Our house will witness 
this event: I'm doing it as a rare treat. . . . [Here follows local gossip 
of arrivals and departures, etc.] 

My second concerto is finished and I feel like a novice, just as I felt 
before I knew anything of the keyboard. It is far too original and I shall 
end up by not being able to learn it myself. It's a pity that I must write 
to you today, just when I cannot collect my thoughts. When I start 
thinking about myself I feel so awful that I often seem to lose all sense 
of reality. If my gaze is concentrated on something that interests me I 
could be run over by horses without being aware of it. Indeed that is 
what very nearly happened in the street two days ago: on Sunday I 
was suddenly struck by a single unexpected glance [from Constantia] 
in church, at a moment of delicious mental numbness, and I ran out of 
the building, remaining in a complete daze for a quarter of an hour, 
not knowing what had happened to me. I ran into Doctor Paris and 
simply couldn't explain my confused state. I was obliged to put it down 
to the fact that a dog had run between my legs and made me fall down. 
It's terrible to think what a lunatic I sometimes seem to be. I would 
like to send you a few odds and ends of things I've written, but I haven't 
time to copy them out today. ... I must sincerely beg you to excuse 
today's letter this is all I can write, as today is one of my holidays. 
Besides, the University term begins today and I must go and see about 
Eisner, Bielawski, music-stands and mutes for the violins. I had an 
awful shock when I found yesterday that I had forgotten about the 
latter without them my Adagio would be a failure; as it is I don't 

57 



suppose it will have any remarkable success. The Rondo is effective and 
the first movement Allegro is impressive. Oh, this cursed self-admir- 
ation! But it is you, the egoist, who are to blame, if anyone, for this 
conceit of mine: one picks up one's manners from one's friends. There 
is, however, one thing in which I do not imitate you: the making of 
swift decisions. Nevertheless I have made up my mind, quietly and 
without a word to a soul, to clear out on Saturday week, without so 
much as by-your-leave, in spite of all weepings and wailings and 
implorings on bended knee. And so, with my music in my knapsack, 
my ribbon next to my heart and my soul slung over my shoulder, I 
shall jump into the stage-coach. Tears as large as peas will flow 
throughout the town, from the statue of Copernicus to The Springs 
and from King Sigismund's column to Blank, but I, cold and as dry- 
eyed as a stone, shall only smile at my poor sisters, who will take such 
an emotional leave of me. I am using too many auxiliary verbs, and 
today especially because well, I no, the fact is that if you were not 
far, far away beyond Hrubieszow I would order you to come here; 
but I know that you would prefer 1 perhaps as a penance for your 
other enormous sins to bring consolation to others rather than me, 
even if you hated the sight of them. If only I could somehow bring 
consolation to you I would do so; but, believe me, there's no remedy 
for all this except in Vienna. You are alive, you have feelings which 
others enter into, and so you are torn between happiness and misery. I 
understand you, I can pierce to the bottom of your soul and but let 
me embrace you, for words fail rne. 

F, Chopin 
[A short postscript contains the usual greetings from his family.] 

40. TO TlTUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Tuesday 5 October [1830] 
My dearest friend, 

I badly needed your letter, to allow me to get on quietly with what 
I have to do. You can't imagine how this cursed but inevitable killing 
of time wearies me. After the orchestral rehearsal of my second concerto 
it was decided that it should be given a public performance, and so I 
shall appear in it next Monday, the nth. Although in one way I am not 
too pleased about it, on the other hand I am curious as regards the 
general effect it will make. I believe the Rondo is bound to impress 
everyone. Indeed after hearing this Rondo Soliva said to me; [in French] 
"It does you the greatest credit". Kurpinski spoke at length of its 
originality and Eisner of its rhythm. If only I did not have to have those 

58 



wretched clarinets and bassoons in between the concerto-movements 
I could produce what one might call a very nice evening, with Glad- 
kowska singing in the first half and Wolkow in the second. As an 
overture I shall not have the usual Leszek or Lodoiska but William Tell 
You can't imagine what I had to go through before the young ladies 
received permission to sing. The Italian was quite willing, but I had 
first to apply to a higher authority, to Mostowski who readily gave 
permission it was all one to him. I have no idea what they will sing. 
All Soliva told me was that one of the arias requires the accompani- 
ment of the chorus. We have already had two performances of 
[Rossini's] Magpie. Gladkowska was rather nervous on her first 
appearance and did not sing her first cavatina as well as she did the 
second time. She is admirable when she sings: 




She does not clip it short like Mme Mayer, but gives the notes their 
full value: 




i.e. not rapid gruppetti, but every one of the eight notes fully sung. In 
the last act they added, or rather substituted, after the funeral march, 
the prayer from Rossini's Mahomet which suits her voice, in place of 
the aria in the Magpie which lies too high for her. So much for the 
opera. Wolk6w is now learning the Barber and then Fioravanti's 
Travelling Italian Opera, in which the pair of them will sing a duet 
that's why Soliva did not want them to sing a duet at my concert. I 
shall play on the instrument which Mile dc Belleville refused to let me 
have when she was here, and not later than a week after my concert 
Warsaw wiU have seen the last of me. My trunk is already bought, all 
my outfit is ready, my musical scores have been corrected, my hand- 
kerchiefs stitched and my trousers tailored. It only remains to say 
good-bye the worst of all. . . . [The rest of this letter contains little of 
significance and ends with further expressions of his devotion to Titus.] 

41. TO TlTUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Warsaw. Tuesday 12 October 1830 
My dearest friend, 

I hasten to let you know that yesterday's concert went off very well. 
I can inform Your Lordship that I was not the least bit nervous and I 

59 



played as I do when I am alone. The haU was full. We started with 
Corner's symphony, then My Highness played the Allegro of the E 
minor Concerto which I reeled off with ease on a Streicher piano. 
Deafening applause. Soliva was delighted he conducted on account of 
his "Aria with chorus" which Mile Wolkow sang charmingly, dressed 
in blue like an angel. After this aria came my Adagio and Rondo and 
then the interval. When my friends had had their refreshments and 
came down from the stage where they had been posted in order to give 
me a useful account of the effect produced, the second half began with 
the William Tell overture. Soliva conducted it well and made a great 
impression. The fact is that on this occasion the Italian showed himself 
so amiable that I cannot be too grateful to him. Then he conducted 
Mile Gladkowska's aria. She was dressed in white, with roses in her 
hair, which suited her admirably, and she sang the cavatina with 
recitative from the Donna del Lago. Apart from the aria from Angela 
she has never sung anything better. You remember "O quante lagrime 
per te versai". She delivered the "Tutto detesto" down to the low B 
in such a way that Zielinski declared that that B alone was worth a 
thousand ducats. I must tell you that the aria had been transposed to 
suit her voice, which gained greatly by it. When Mile Gladkowska had 
been led from the stage we got on with rny Pot-pourri on Polish Airs. 
This time I understood what I was doing, the orchestra understood what 
it was doing and the audience realised it too. This time, as soon as they 
heard the first bars of the Mazurka in the Finale, they burst into 
applause and at the end the usual silly business I was called back. 
Not a soul hissed and I had to come back and bow four times this 
time in a civilised manner, for Brandt had taught me how to do it. 
If Soliva had not taken my scores home to look over them and had not 
conducted in such a way that I was not allowed to run on at breakneck 
speed, I don't know how it would have gone last night; but he suc- 
ceeded so well in keeping us together that I can assure you I have never 
before managed to play so well with orchestra- The audience enjoyed 
my piano-playing and still more Mile Wolk6w: she looks marvellous 
on the stage. Now she wiU appear in the Barber next Saturday, if not 
Thursday but I can think of nothing but packing, for I am leaving 
via Cracow either on Saturday or Wednesday. . . * 

I must finish, my dear friend, for Mr Lasocki is waiting for rne to 
drive to Ernemann's with him to see about his daughter's lessons. Later 
I wiU have my gruel, but first of all I will have a kiss from you. 

Your ever devoted 
R Chopin 

60 



My sisters, father, mother, Zywny and all are well and send you 
their greetings. 

Chopin left Warsaw with Titus on 2 November 1830. His old teacher 
Eisner and a crowd of fellow-students accompanied him as far as the village 
of Wola and sang a short cantata in his honour. There is no truth in the 
story of a silver goblet filled with Polish earth having been given to him at 
parting. Chopin was destined never to see Poland again, but he took with 
him memories and impressions to which he clung tenaciously and which 
coloured the rest of his life and work. "Zal" (regret, nostalgia) was the word 
he used in order to define for Liszt the bitter-sweet feeling that permeates 
most of his music. 

42. To ms FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Wroclaw. Tuesday 9 November 1830 
My darling parents and sisters, 

We arrived here at six o'clock on Saturday evening [6 November] 
after a most comfortable journey in excellent weather. We are staying 
at the "Golden Goose*'. We went straight to the theatre where they 
were doing the Alpine King [a comedy by Raimund) which is shortly 
to be put on in Warsaw. The people in the pit were amazed at the 
new scenery but we were not particularly thrilled. Not a bad perform- 
ance. On Sunday we had Auber's Le Mafon badly done. Today 
it's Winter's Unterbrochenes Opferfest. I am curious to see how it will 
go. The singers are nothing to speak of, moreover the theatre is 
very cheap stalls: two Polish zlotys. I like Wroclaw better on this 
visit. 

I handed over my letter to Sowinski. I have only been able to see 
him once he came here last evening but we were out. As a matter of 
fact we were at the local music club where the conductor Schnabel had 
invited me to the rehearsal for the concert to be given that evening. 
They have such concerts here three times a week. At rehearsal the 
orchestra turned out to be, as usual, quite small, with a piano and a 
local civil servant, an amateur called Hellwig, who was getting ready 
to play Moscheles's first E flat Concerto. Before he took his seat 
Schnabel, who had not heard me for four years, asked me to try the 
piano. I could hardly refuse, so I sat down and played a couple of 
Variations, Schnabel was frightfully pleased; Mr Hellwig took fright 
and the others began to entreat me to play in the evening. Schnabel 
pressed me so sincerely that I had not the heart to refuse the old fellow. 
He's a great friend of Mr Eisner's; but I told him I would do it simply 

61 



to please A/m, for I had not played for two weeks and I have no inten- 
tion of appearing in public in Wroclaw. Old Schnabel said he knew all 
about that, and that when he saw me at church yesterday he had wanted 
to ask me but had not dared. So I drove back to the inn with his son to 
fetch my music and I played them the Romance and Rondo from my 
second concerto. At the rehearsal the Germans were surprised by my 
playing. "Was fur ein leichtes Spiel hat er !" ["How light his touch is !"] 
they declared but about the composition itself, not a word. Titus 
actually heard somebody say that I could play but not compose. 
N.B. The day before yesterday we had opposite us at the table d'hote a 
very friendly-looking individual. I got into conversation with him and 
discovered that he is an acquaintance of Scholtz in Warsaw and a friend 
of the gentleman for whom Scholtz gave me letters of introduction. 
He's a merchant of the name of Scharff and is extremely kind. He 
showed us all over Wroclaw, hired a cab himself and took us for 
lovely drives. Next day he took me to the Stock Exchange and finally 
obtained for us visitors' tickets for yesterday's concert and sent them to 
us before the rehearsal You can imagine the surprise of both Scharff 
and the gentleman who procured the tickets when the visitor turned 
out to be the leading figure of this musical evening ! Besides my Rondo 
I improvised for the connoisseurs on themes from La Masaniello 
After that they finished up with an overture and then there was dancing. 
Schnabel wanted to treat me to supper; however I accepted nothing 
but a cup of bouillon. 

Of course I have met the local chief-organist, Mr Kohler he offered 
to show me the organ today. Also Baron somebody or other Nesse 
or Neisse, a pupil of Spohr, who is said to be a capital violinist. Another 
local connoisseur and musician called Hesse, who has travelled all over 
Germany, paid me many compliments, but with the exception of 
Schnabel, whose joy was self-evident and who kept chucking me under 
the chin and patting me on the back, none of the other Germans knew 
what to make of me. Titus had great fun watching them. As my repu- 
tation is not yet fully established, they are surprised at me but are afraid 
to show it. They didn't know whether the composition was really good 
or whether it only appeared to be so. One of these local experts came 
up to me and praised the novelty of the form, saying he had never yet 
heard anything quite like it. I don't know who it was but perhaps he 
understood better than any of them, Schnabel, overflowing with kind- 
ness, went so far as to offer me his carriage, but we came back home at 
nine o'clock when the dancing began. I am glad I obliged the old 
man. 

62 



I was thanked for the pleasant surprise by a lady to whom, as the 
leading woman-pianist here, the director introduced me after the con- 
cert; she said she was sorry that I am not to play in public. That civil 
servant fellow [Hellwig] cheered himself up by singing Figaro's aria 
from the Barber feebly. 

They had much to say of Eisner yesterday and praised some orchestral 
variations of his in which there is an echo effect. I told them to wait 
until they had heard his Coronation Mass only then would they realise 
what a composer he is. These Germans are awful, at least the crowd 
last evening. Our friend Mr Scharff is an exception. 

Off to Dresden at two o'clock tomorrow. Kisses, kisses, kisses for 
you. My best respects to Messrs Zywny, Eisner, Matuszynski, Kolberg, 
Marylski and Witwicki. 

43. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Dresden. 14 November 1830 

I have scarcely been able to find a moment to tell you about myself. 
I have just come back from a Polish dinner, that is one at which none 
but Poles were present. I left them there and have come home alone to 
write to you, for the post leaves at seven o'clock and I still want to 
hear La Muette again. 

We were reluctant to leave Wroclaw: our acquaintance with the 
gentleman for whom Scholtz gave me letters made our stay in the town 
very pleasant. Of course the first person I visited here was Mile Pech- 
well. She played at the music club on Friday and introduced me there. 
That very same evening the theatre was giving La Muette and it was 
difficult for me to choose, but since it was important to support the 
lady I went to the soiree. Another important reason which induced me 
to go was that the best local singer, Mme Palazzesi, of Italian extrac- 
tion, would be singing. So dressed up in all my best, I ordered a sedan- 
chair and climbing into this funny sort of box I had myself carried to 
Kreissig's where the soiree was to be held. On the way I couldn't help 
laughing at the thought of being transported by these liveried chair- 
men; I felt like kicking out the bottom of the chair but I restrained 
myself. The vehicle deposited me at the very foot of the stairs. I got 
out and had myself announced to Mile Pechwell; the host came 
forward with many bows, civilities and compliments, and showed me 
into the room, on both sides of which I observed eight huge tables 
with a crowd of ladies sitting at them. I was less dazzled by the dia- 
monds which bedecked them than by their knitting-needles. Honestly, 
there was such a vast number of ladies and knitting-needles that one 

63 



might have feared some uprising against the gentlemen, who would 
have had to fight with spectacles and bald heads ! there were as many 
of the ones as of the others. The sounds of music coming from the 
other end of the salon suddenly interrupted the click of these needles 
and the chink of tea-cups. First they played the Fra Diavolo overture, 
then the Italian sang not at all badly. . . . 

As I was going to Klengel's this morning I met him in front of his 
house. He recognised me at once and was so extremely amiable that he 
touched me to the heart. I have the highest esteem for him. He first of 
all asked me where I was staying and then invited me to visit him 
tomorrow morning. He encouraged me to play in public but I turned 
a deaf ear. I have no time to waste, and Dresden will bring me neither 
fame nor money. . . . 

Apart from my friend Klengel, for whom I must certainly play to- 
morrow, there is nothing here worth consideration. I enjoy conversing 
with him because one can learn something by it. 

The picture-gallery is the only place I have revisited in Dresden. It 
is enough to have seen the Griines Gewolbe once but I was greatly 
interested to go over the gallery again. If I lived here I would go once a 
week, for thefe are certain pictures which make me feel as though I 
were listening to music. 

Good-bye for the present. 

Your Fryderyk 

44. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Prague. 21 November 1830 

My week in Dresden went by so quickly that I scarcely noticed it. 
Leaving the house in the morning I didn't get back until nightfall. 
Klengel, when I came to know him better, I mean when I had played 
my concertos to him, said that my playing reminded him of Field's, 1 
that I have a rare kind of touch and that he had indeed heard a lot 
about me but had never expected to find me such a virtuoso. These 
were not hollow compliments for he confessed that he doesn't like to 
flatter people or be forced to praise them. So as soon as I left him (I 
spent the whole morning until noon with Klengel) he went off to 
Morlacchi and Liittichau, the General Intendant of the theatre, to find 
out whether it would be possible for me to appear in public in the 
course of the four remaining days of my stay in the town. He after- 
wards told me he had done it for Dresden's sake, not for mine, and that 

1 John Field (1782-1837), the Irish piamst-composer who lived for years in Russia and 
acquired fame by his poetical playing of his Nocturnes. 



he would be happy to persuade me to give a concert if the arranging of 
it did not take too long. The next morning he came and explained that 
he had tried everywhere himself but (this was on Wednesday) there 
was not a single free evening before Sunday on Friday there was to 
be the first performance here of Fra Diavolo and on Saturday, i.e. 
yesterday, Rossini's Donna del Lago in Italian. . . . 

I shall send you the rest of my news from Vienna where we are due 
to arrive at nine o'clock on Tuesday morning. . . . 

Chopin and Titus remained only one day in Prague and went straight on 
to Vienna where they arrived early on 23 November. Anxious about matters 
on which he could not question his parents, he writes at once to his school- 
friend 9 MatuszyAski, who was hard at his medical studies. 

45. To JAN MATUSZY&SKI IN WARSAW 

Vienna. [24 November 1830] 
Dear Johnny, 

Let me have your correct address. You know what's happening to 
me. How glad I am to be back in Vienna and to be making so many 
interesting and extremely useful acquaintances, and even to think that 
I might fall in love! I am not thinking of you others at home. All I do 
is to look now and then at that ring made from hair by Louise, and 
which becomes dearer to me as I travel further away from them all. 
And I love you too better here than in Warsaw. But am I still loved? 
[referring to Constantia], You, Aesculapius, if you don't write to me, 
may the devil take you, may lightning strike your house at Radom and 
may you lose the button off the top of your cap ! I gave orders in 
Prague for all letters to be sent on to Vienna but I have so far received 
none. Has all this rain been bad for you? I have a feeling that you are 
ill. For God's sake don't take risks ! You and I are made of the same clay 
and you know how many times already I have fallen to pieces. But my 
special clay will not fall to pieces in the rain now for my inside tem- 
perature is ninety degrees Reaumur. But oh, dear ! there's not enough 
clay in me to make a rabbit-hutch. Oh, you rogue ! You've been to the 
theatre, I bet you've made great play with your opera-glasses and 
made eyes at other people, you've shot your glances at the Epaulettes 
[of Russian officers, of whom Chopin was jealous] if you have done 
all this, may the lightning strike you; you are not worthy of my 
devotion. Titus knows all about me and is glad, for he has always 
esteemed me and sympathised with my feelings in advance. If I am 
writing to you it is for my own sake, for you are not worth it. Mile

Heinefetter looked lovely in Qtello yesterday and sang divinely. Ill 
write later and tell you everything, but do let me have your address. 
Give me a kiss and embrace my schoolfellow Alfons for me. I have 
written to Marcel. Love to all my friends. 

F. Chopin 

My pen is like a thick spoon and I can hardly hold it you needn't 
be surprised at the nonsense I have written. I would have written more, 
but I'm afraid to I can't collect my thoughts. 

[This letter was delivered to Matuszynski by Chopin's sisters and 
he adds:] Orders are: not to be inquisitive old ladies. I send all my love 
and kisses including a dozen of the best for my worthy schoolfriends. 
Please don't interfere with the seal 



46. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Vienna, i December 1830 

It rejoiced my heart to receive the first letter from you for four weeks, 
that is, since the time when I bade you farewell. It gave me a better 
appetite and I had to pay the "Wild Man" (that's the name of the 
excellent inn where we have our meals) a whole Rhenish florin plus a 
few pence for having heartily devoured so many strudels. We were 
both in good spirits, for Titus also had a letter from home. I thank 
Celinski for the note which was enclosed it carried me back home to 
your family circle. I could imagine myself sitting at the piano, with 
Celinski standing opposite me, watching Mr Zy wny offering snuff to 
LinowsM. Only Matuszynski was lacking to complete the picture: I 
suppose he's still feverish but enough of these tales. I too wiH get a 
fever of madness, there are so many pretty German girls here, but 
when will I get it, when? 

Just think! Mile Blahetka is in Stuttgart with her parents; perhaps 
they will return here for the winter. I had that piece of news from 
Haslinger who gave me a warm welcome, but all the same he has not 
printed my Sonata [in C minor, Op. 4) or my second set of Variations 
[on "The Swiss Boy"]. He will get a sharp reminder as soon as Titus 
and I are settled. We have rented three rooms at the Kohlmarkt, in 
the main street. It's true they are on the third floor but they are beauti- 
fully, most handsomely and elegantly furnished, and the monthly rent 
is quite low. My share costs me 25 Rhenish florins. They are occupied 
at the moment by a kind of general-admiral, an Englishman, but he is 
moving out today or tomorrow. If he is an admiral I shall attract all the 
admiration* so the house will lose nothing by the change. (Don't read 

66 



out this letter to everybody or they will think I am becoming con- 
ceited!) Moreover the housekeeper, or rather the landlady of the apart- 
ment, is something of a baroness, a pretty widow, quite young, who, 
as she told us, had lived in Poland and had already heard about me in 
Warsaw. She knows the Skarzyiiskis and used to frequent high society; 
she asked Titus whether he knows that pretty Mme Rembielinska and 
so on. Such a worthy lady is worth 25 florins, if not more; besides she 
loves Poles, has no use for Austrians, is a Prussian and a very sensible 
woman. 

As soon as we are settled, Graff the piano-maker will send us a piano. 
Wiirfel no sooner saw me than he began talking about my giving a 
concert. He himself is not well and stays indoors; he can only give 
lessons at home. He had an attack of blood-spitting which has left him 
very weak. But he keeps harping about a concert and told me that 
the papers here have been full of my F minor Concerto : I know nothing 
of this and was not inquisitive enough to find out. I shall in fact give 
a concert, but I have no idea of when, where and how. 

I've a swollen nose which has prevented me from presenting myself 
at the Embassy or going to see Mme Rzewuska who receives all the 
best people and lives next door to Hussarzewski. I have been to see him 
a few times it didn't matter about my nose. He does not advise me, 
as Wiirfel does, to play without fee. Dr Malfatti welcomed me as if I 
had been his cousin, most warmly and cordially. As soon as he read my 
name he embraced me and said that Mr Wladyslaw Ostrowski had 
already written to him about my coming, and that he would do all 
he could to help me. He added that he will bring me to the notice of 
Mme Tatyszczew, the ambassador's wife, and will procure for me all 
necessary acquaintances, even at Court. He doubts, however, whether 
it will be possible to do anything there, since the Court is in mourning 
for the King of Naples ; but he will try to be helpful He has also prom- 
ised to introduce me to Baron Dunoi, president of the local music 
club he will, it seems, be a most desirable acquaintance. I have made 
another perhaps equally useful acquaintance, thanks to Klengel's letter 
Mr Mittag. He's a man who sees things in the right light and I believe 
he will be more useful to me than all these other musical gentlemen. I 
have already been to see Czerny (always and to everyone: "Your 
humble servant"), who asked me, "Have you been working hard?" 
He has lately been happily engaged in arranging some overture or 
other for eight pianos (sixteen hands). Otherwise I have so far seen none 
of the other local pianists, I have paid two visits to Mme Weyberheim 
who is Mine Wolf's sister; I am invited there for tomorrow evening 

p 67 



a small gathering of amateurs and from there I shall go on to 
Rosalia Rzewuska's. She has a reception between nine and ten and 
Hussarzewski has already notified her of my arrival. I shall meet there 
the famous Mme Cibini for whom Moscheles wrote his Sonata for 
four hands. 

Two days ago I went to Stametz's banking-house; notwithstanding 
my letters of introduction I was received there like any ordinary 
individual who comes to draw money I was given a form to hand in 
to the police in order to receive a visitor's permit, that was all. But it 
may all turn out differently later on. At the same time I went to Mr 
Geyerniiiller's, since Titus has his deposit of six thousand zlotys there. 
Having taken note of my name, without troubling to read the rest of 
the letter, he declared "that he was pleased to make the acquaintance of 
such an artist as myself, but he would not advise me to appear in public, 
for there are so many good pianists here that one needs to have a great 
reputation in order to achieve anything." He ended by adding "that 
he can afford me no assistance as times are so bad, etc. ..." I had to 
swallow all that with my eyes popping out of my head ! I let him 
finish his tirade and then told him that I really did not know whether 
it was worth my while to appear, since I had not had time to call on 
any of the important residents or on the Ambassador, for whom I had 
an introduction from the Grand Duke [Constantine] in Warsaw, etc. 
You should have seen his face at that moment ! I left with apologies 

for having interrupted him in his business. Just wait, you b 

Jews! 

I have not yet been to see Lachner, the director of the orchestra, as 
I have no place in which to receive him if he returns my call. We 
moved from the "Stadt London" inn, where the food was extra- 
ordinarily salty, to the "Golden Lamb" in Leopoldstadt and we shall 
hang on here in the meantime until that bewhiskered, lank, dried-up, 
green-purple-yellow-faced English seaman clears out from the 
baroness's place. In that "lavishly appointed" apartment the expres- 
sion comes from Titus who is resolved to make a smart fellow out of 
me I shall at length be able to play and think of giving a concert, 
but not without a fee. Well, we shall see. 

There are many people, including Mme Szaszek, Mme Elkan, Roths- 
child, the Voigts and others, whom I have yet to see. Today I shall go 
to the embassy Baron Meindorf wiE be there. Hussarszewski suggested 
that I should ask him to tell me what is the best time for finding 
Tatyszczew at home. I have not yet touched the money I drew from the 
bank two days ago. I expect I shall manage to go carefully with it. All 

68 



the same I would at least ask that you might let me have something for 
the journey to Italy if my concerts do not bring in anything. I spend 
most money on theatre visits, but I don't regret it, for Mile Heinefetter 
and Mr Wild sing nearly every evening. This week I have heard three 
completely new operas: yesterday Fra Diavolo (Masaniello was better), 
before that Mozart's Tito and today William Tell I don't envy Orlow- 
ski for having accompanied Lafont [a famous violinist] ; perhaps the 
time will come when Lafont will accompany me. Am I being too 
presumptuous? Well, please God, it may come to pass. Nidecki intends 
to spend the whole winter here. 

I have given the whole of this week to looking after my swollen nose, 
going to the theatre and to Graff's piano-shop where I play every day 
after lunch to loosen up my fingers which are stiff after travelling. 
Yesterday I introduced Nidecki to Graff. Honestly I don't know how 
this week has flown; we have not had time to look round and I have 
taken no decisive step towards giving a concert. The question is: which 
concerto shall I play? F minor or E minor? Wurfel maintains that the 
F minor is finer than Hummel's A flat which Haslinger has just pub- 
lished. Haslinger is clever quite nice to me, but he wants to appear 
casual so as to get my compositions for nothing. Klengel was surprised 
to hear that he had not paid me for my Variations [Op. 2]. Perhaps he 
thinks that by affecting to treat my things lightly I will take him 
seriously and give them to him for nothing. But I've finished with 
giving things for nothing now it's "Pay up, animal!" Graff advises 
me to take the Landstandischer Hall (where they have concerts of 
religious music) for my concert it is the best and handsomest hall. 
For that I need Dietrichstein's permission but I shall easily obtain it 
through Malfatti. 

Everyone says I've put on weight. . . . Things are going well for me 
and I trust that by the grace of God and Malfatti (incomparable Mal- 
fatti!) they will go still better. 

On 29 November 1830 a revolt against Russian domination had broken 
out in Warsaw, and by the time Chopin wrote this next letter the struggle 
was at its height, the uprising being finally crushed in September 1831. If 
Chopin appears in his letters to show surprisingly little concern at what was 
happening in Poland it must be remembered that he knew his letters were being 
censored and the slightest indiscretion on his part would lead to immediate 
expulsion from Vienna. He could only refer obliquely to political events. 
Titus had at once returned home on hearing the news and Chopin had wanted 
to go with him but had been persuaded to stay where he was.

47. To HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Vienna. Wednesday before Christmas I have 
no calendar and don't know the date. 
[22 December 1830] 
My dearest parents and sisters, 

It was seven weeks yesterday that I left you. Why did I leave? . . . 
but it is done. Yesterday, Tuesday, at the exact hour when they 
accompanied me to Wola [a village on the outskirts of Warsaw] I 
was at a dance at the Weyberheims. There were plenty of handsome 
young people and no old ones at all. They tried to get me to dance and 
dragged me into the cotillion, but I only took a few turns and then 
came back home. Mme Weyberheim herself and her charming 
daughters had invited a number of musical people to their party, but I 
did not play as I did not feel in the right mood. She introduced Mr 
Likt whom Louise knows he is a kind, pleasant and frank German 
who took me to be someone important, so I did not like to disillusion 
him by my playing. I met there also the nephew of Mr Lampi whom 
Papa knows: a handsome, friendly boy who paints superbly. Talking 
of painting, Hummel came to see me yesterday morning with his son 
who has done a portrait of me, so lifelike that it could not be bettered. 
I am seated in my dressing-gown on a piano-stool with an inspired 
look on my face where that comes from I don't know. It is a pencil 
or rather chalk drawing m quarto and you would think it is an engraving. 
Hummel p&e is extraordinarily kind. Since he is very friendly with 
Duport, who used to be a famous ballet dancer and is now manager 
of the Karntnerthor theatre, he introduced me to him yesterday 
evening. Mr Duport is said to be very tight-fisted; he was very 
charming to me, thinking perhaps that I will play for nothing, but 
he is mistaken. We had a slight preliminary discussion about my 
wanting to play, but nothing definite was settled as to the time or 
conditions. If he offers too little I shall give my concert in the large 
RedoutensaaL 

Wiirfel is better; last week I met at his house Slavik the celebrated 
violinist, who is still only a young man of twenty-six at most. I liked 
him very much. As we were returning together lie asked me whether 
I was going home. "Yes, I am," I answered. "In that case you'd better 
come along with me to a compatriot of yours, Mme Bayer/ * said he. 
It so happened that Kraszewski had sent me a letter for her from Dresden 
with the one for the Vicereine at Milan; I hadn't had time to deliver 
the letter as I didn't know where she lived, and there are thousands of 
Bayers in Vienna. "Certainly," I said to Skvik. "Just give me time to 

70 



go back for the letter." It was in fact the very same lady. Her husband 
is a Pole from the neighbourhood of Odessa who Eves near the 
Chomentowskis. His wife, who had already heard a great deal about 
me, invited us to dinner for the next day, Sunday, when Slavik played 
and delighted me as no one has done since Paganini. He too enjoyed 
your humble servant's playing and we determined to write a violin 
and piano duet together, an idea which I had already had in Warsaw. 
He is truly a violinist of genius. As soon as I meet Merk and I shaE 
do so any day now at Mechetti's we shaE form a trio. ... I must teE 
you that I am now living on the fourth floor. Some English people 
heard from my predecessor [the Admiral] about my beautiful apart- 
ment and wanted to rent one room. But when they arrived they used 
the pretext of looking over one to inspect aE three, and they liked 
them so much that they offered me on the spot 80 florins if I would let 
them take over the rooms, which 1 was only too delighted to do. 
Baroness Lachmanowicz, my good and kind landlady, who is Mme 
Uszak's sister-in-law, had a suite of rooms just like mine on the fourth 
floor: I was shown them, I took them, and now I am lodged as weE for 
10 florins a month as I was for 70. Of course you think your poor boy 
is living under the tiles. Not at aE there's still a fifth floor above me 
before you come to the roof, and I am a clear 60 florins in pocket by 
the deal. People still come to see me and even His ExceEency Count 
Hussarzewski has to climb up all my stairs. But the street is marveEous, 
right in the centre of the town, close to everything. When I go down- 
stairs I have the most lovely walks Artaria's music-shop to my left, 
Mechetti's and Haslinger's to my right, behind me the theatre. What 
more can one want? 

I can't write to Mr Eisner yet his quartet has not been published 
yet, but I have been to see Czerny about it. Malfatti grumbled at me 
for promising to go to dinner at Mme Szaszek's at two o'clock and 
not turning up until four. I am to dine out with him again today, 
Saturday, and if I am late he has promised to perform a very painful 
operation on me: I can't say what it is but it's extremely unpleasant. I 
can see Papa getting angry at my absent-mindedness and rudeness 
towards people; but it wiE all be put right, for I am glad to say that 
Malfatti is reaEy very fond of me. 

Nidecki comes and plays here every morning. When I write my 
Concerto for two pianos we shaE give its first performance together; 
but first of aE I must appear as a soloist. Haslinger is as amiable as ever 
but says nothing. I don't know whether I ought to make straight 
for Italy or what. Please do write and teE me. Mamma is glad that 



I am out of the way, but I am not. It just happened like that. . . . 
Give my love to Titus and ask him to write, for God's sake. You 
can't imagine what a joy it is for me to receive your letters. Why is 
the post so slow! Anyhow, don't blame me for worrying about 
you. . . . 

I have met a very charming fellow, Leidenfrost, a friend of Kessler's; 
he often conies here but I have been only once to see him. If I am not 
invited out I dine in town with him. He knows everyone in Vienna, 
and as soon as he knows where there is anyone worth seeing 
he takes me along. Yesterday, for example, everybody was out 
walking on the Bastei: archdukes in morning-dress, the nobility, in 
fact aU Vienna. I met Slavik there and arranged to meet him 
today in order to select a Beethoven theme for our [piano and 
violin] Variations. In some ways I'm glad I'm here, but on the other 
hand . . . ! 

How comfortable I am in this room! Facing me are housetops, down 
below pygmies. I am right above them. But best of aU is when, 
after playing on my marvellous Graff piano, I go to bed with your 
letters in my hand. Even in my dreams I see only you. Yesterday 
they danced mazurkas at the Bayers'. Slavik lay on the floor like a 
sheep, and there was a certain old German countess with a long 
nose and pock-marked face who skilfully held up her dress with 
two fingers (as they did in olden times) and kept her head turned 
stiffly towards her partner so that the bones of her neck stuck 
out. With her long skinny legs she somehow performed a strange 
kind of pas de valse. And yet she is a dignified creature, serious 
and well-educated who talks a lot and knows the manners of good 
society. 

Best known among the many Viennese entertainments are those 
evenings in the beer-halls where Strauss or Lanner (who correspond to 
the Swieszewskis in Warsaw) play waltzes during supper. After each 
waltz the applause is terrific: but if they pky a "quodlibet", i.e. a 
pot-pourri of opera-tunes, songs and dances, the audience are so 
delighted that they can scarcely contain themselves. It just shows you 
how corrupted the taste of the Viennese public is. 

I wanted to send you a waltz I have written but the hour is too late 
you'll receive it some time or other. Nor can I send the Mazurkas, as 
I have not copied them out yet; they are not meant for dancing. If you 
see Fontana tell him that I mean to write, and if there Is no letter for 
Matuszynski today then he will get an enormous one by the next 
post.

48. To JAN MATUSZYNSKI IN WARSAW 

Vienna. Christmas Day [1830]. Sunday 
morning. Last year at this time I was at the 
Bemardines' Church. Today I am sitting all 
alone in my dressing-gown, gnawing at my 
ring and writing. 
Dearest Johnny, 

I have just returned from seeing Slavik, the famous violinist whom 
I have made friends with; Tve heard nothing like him since Paganini 
he can play ninety-six notes staccato with one stroke of the bow, and 
other such things: incredible ! While I was with him the idea came into 
my mind to pour out my grief on the piano when I reached the house, 
and to draw from my tears an Adagio for the variations on a Beethoven 
theme which he and I are writing. But a single step towards the post 
office, where I never fail to call in as I pass, gave another direction to 
my feelings. The tears which were to have fallen on the keys moistened 
your letter; I am dying to read your writing. Do you know why? 
Yes, you do. But it was not only on account of my angel of peace 
[Constantia] ; for as truly as I love her I would, if I could, employ every 
tone which that blind raging feeling has inspired in me to evoke, if only 
in some slight degree, those songs whose scattered echoes still haunt the 
banks of the Danube, those songs which the army of Sobieski sang. 
You advise me to choose a poet? But you know that I am the most 
irresolute creature in the world and that only once in my life have I 
been able to make a correct choice. My God! She and my sisters can 
at least help by rolling strips of lint for bandages while I . . . ! If it were 
not that I should perhaps be a burden to my father I would return at 
once. I curse the moment of my departure, and you will agree (knowing 
the situation I am in) that since Titus left, too many troubles have 
fallen on my head all at once. All these dinners, soirees, concerts, dances 
which I am up to the neck in bore me to death. I feel so depressed, dull 
and gloomy here. I enjoy all those things, but not in such cruel circum- 
stances. I can't do as I would wish I must get dressed, comb my hair, 
put my shoes on; in a drawing-room I pretend to be calm, but on 
returning home I vent my rage on the piano. I have no one to exchange 
confidences with and I must behave charmingly to everyone. There 
are plenty of people who like me, paint my portrait, make a fuss of me 
and try to be agreeable, but what's the use when I have no peace of 
mind except perhaps when I take out all your letters or open my 
album with the view of Sigismund's column, or look at my ring. For- 
give me, Johnny, for complaining like this to you but it seems to take 

73 



half the load off my shoulders and calms me down I have always 
shared my feelings with you. Did you get my card? Of course my 
letters do not mean so much to you since you are at home; but I read 
and re-read your letter endlessly. . . . Has there really been something 
of a change? Has there not been illness? I could easily imagine these 
things in the case of such a sensitive creature [Constantia]. Aren't you 
perhaps just imagining it? Perhaps it is the shock of what happened on 
the 29th [of November]. God forbid that I should be the cause of it! 
Soothe her, tell her that as long as I have strength . . . that until my 
dying day . . . and even after my death my ashes shall be laid at her feet. 
But you could not possibly tell her all I will write. I would have 
written long ago, I would not have suffered these torments so long 
but you know what people are; if anything should happen to fall into 
the wrong hands her reputation might suffer, so you had better be my 
interpreter. Speak for me and I will agree with everything you say. 
Those expressions of yours in French went straight to my heart. A 
German who was walking along the street with me could scarcely 
support me by the arm as I was reading over your letter. He couldn't 
conceive what was the matter. I felt like seizing all the passers-by and 
kissing them. Never before have I felt so overcome it was the first 
letter I had had from you. I am boring you, Johnny, with my foolish 
raptures but I can't pull myself together and write in an ordinary 
everyday manner. 

Two days ago I dined with a Polish lady whose surname is Bayer and 
Christian name Constance: I like to go there as it reminds me of . . . 
All her music, handkerchiefs and table-napkins are marked with her 
name, I go there with Slavik, for whom she has a certain tender 
feeling. We played all morning and afternoon, and as it was Christmas 
Eve and the weather was beautiful, really spring-like, we did not leave 
the Bayers* until it was quite dark. I said good-bye to Slavik who had 
to go to the Imperial Chapel, and at twelve o'clock I walked slowly by 
myself to St Stephen's. When I got there the congregation had not 
yet begun to arrive. I had not come for the service but merely to con- 
template the huge building at such an hour* There I stood, in the darkest 
corner at the foot of a gothic pillar. How can I describe the splendour 
and grandeur of the great vaulted roofs not a sound to be heard 
only now and then the sacristan's footstep as he went round lighting the 
tapers in the depths of the shrine aroused me from my trance. Graves 
behind and beneath me, everywhere, except above my head. A gloomy 
harmony arose within me I felt my isolation more than ever. It 
pleased me to drink in this tremendous spectacle until people and lights 

74 



began to arrive on the scene, and then, pulling up the collar of my 
greatcoat as (you remember !) I used to do on the Krakowskie Przed- 
miescie [the Piccadilly of Warsaw], I set off to hear the music at the 
Imperial Chapel. No longer alone, but escorted by bands of revellers, 
I walked through the beautiful streets of Vienna to the Castle, where I 
listened to three sections of a not very striking and sleepily performed 
Mass, and then came home to bed at one o'clock. I dreamt about you 
and my friends, about them and my dear sisters. 

Next morning I was awakened by an invitation to dinner at Mme 
Elkan's, the Polish wife of a banker. I got up, played a little in a 
gloomy mood. Then Nidecki came with Leidenfrost and Steinkeller 
and when we separated I went off to dine with Malfatti. Szaniasio [a 
Pole who had worked for the Russians], who is completely on the side 
of the Poles today, was there and ate as much stew and cabbage as, I 
guarantee, any Carmelite priest; and I was quite a match for him. I 
must tell you that that rare man (a man in the full sense of the word), 
Dr Malfatti, is so thoughtful in every way that when we go to dinner 
with him he takes care that we have Polish dishes. Wild, the famous and 
indeed the leading German tenor of the day, came after dinner, I accom- 
panied him from memory in an aria from Otello which he sang in 
masterly fashion. He and Heinefetter are the mainstays of the opera 
here, which is moreover so wretched that it is no credit to Vienna. 
To hear Pasta is supposed to be one purpose of my travels. Anyhow you 
know that I have a letter from the Saxon court to the Vicereine at 
Milan. But how am I to make the journey? My parents tell me to do as 
I please, but I don't like to. Shall I go to Paris? People here advise me 
to wait. Shall I return home or stay here? or kill myself? or stop 
writing to you? Do tell me what to do. Ask those who have influence 
with me, send me their advice and I will follow it. I shall stay here all 
next month, so write before you set out for the north-east [to join the 
forces facing the Russians] although I hope you won't need to go. 
Write, then, poste restante to Vienna before you leave and go as well 
to see my parents and Con . . . Take my place as long as you are there. 
Visit them often so that my sisters may see you and imagine that you 
have just come to see me, and that I'm in the next room. Sit beside 
them so that they will think that I am there behind them. Go to the 
theatre and I'll be there too. 

I read the newspapers regularly: I've been promised Polish ones. I 
have no thought of giving a concert. Aloys Schmidt, a Frankfort 
pianist who is well known for his Etudes, is here. He is over forty 
I've made his acquaintance and he has promised to visit me. He intends 

D* 75 



to give a concert so I must take second place. He is a very competent 
person and I hope we shall get on well from a musical point of view. 
Thalberg plays famously but he is not my man; he is younger than I, 
popular with the ladies, writes Pot-pourris on themes from Masaniello, 
produces piano with the pedal instead of with the hand, takes tenths as 
easily as I do octaves and wears diamond shirt-studs. Moscheles does 
not impress him so it's not surprising that he liked only the tutth of my 
concertos. He too writes concertos. 

I am finishing this letter to you three days later. I have been re-reading 
the crazy nonsense which I have set down for you; I'm sorry, Johnny, 
if you have to pay postage on it all. But today in an Italian restaurant 
I heard someone say [in German] "God made a mistake when he created 
the Poles!" so don't be surprised if I can't write down my thoughts 
properly. And don't expect to receive any news from a Pole, for the 
other fellow replied, "There's nothing to be got out of Poland" [Pro- 
verb: In Polen 1st nichts zu hokn]. The b s ! They are really enjoying 

themselves just now, although they try to hide their feelings. 

Const ... I can't even write that name, my hand is not worthy! 
Oh, how I tear my hair when the thought comes that she may forget 
me! Those fellows ! Gresser! Bezobrazow! Pisarzewski! It's too much 
for me. Today I feel like Othello ! 

I was going to fold down this letter and seal it without using an 
envelope but I forgot that they can read Polish where you are, at home. 
Never mind, allow me to use what is left of the paper to describe my 
life here. I am lodged on the fourth floor in what is really the most 
beautiful street, so high up that I must lean right out of the window to 
see what's going on down below. Young Hummel has drawn a picture 
of my room (you will see it in my new album when I return to the 
bosom of my family) : it is large, neat, with three windows. My bed 
is placed opposite the windows; on the right is my marvellous piano 
and to the left a sofa. There are mirrors between the windows and in 
the centre a fine, large, mahogany round table; polished parquet floor. 
Very quiet. The gentleman is not at home to visitors after dinner and 
so I can fly towards you all in my thoughts. In the morning my un- 
bearably stupid servant wakes me, I get up, my coffee is served, I sit 
down to play and often have to drink my coffee cold. Then at about 
nine my German-teacher comes; after the lesson I usually play and then 
Hummel draws my portrait and Nidecki practises my concerto at 
least that is what has happened lately. All the while I am in my dressing- 
gown until noon, at which time a worthy little German fellow, Leiden- 
frost, turns up (he works at the prison) and if it is fine we go for a walk 

76 



on the ramparts around the town. Then it is time for me to go to lunch 
if I have an invitation, and if not we both go to the "Bohemian Cook", 
a restaurant where all the University students eat. After lunch one 
drinks black coffee at the finest cafe such is the fashion here. Then I 
pay my calls, come home at nightfall, tidy my hair, put on my evening 
shoes and then go off to a party. About ten or eleven, sometimes 
twelve but never later, I come home, play the piano, have a good cry, 
read, look at things, have a laugh, get into bed, blow out my candle 
and always dream about you all. ...

49. To JAN MATUSZYI^SKI IN WARSAW 

Vienna. New Year's Day [1831] 
Dearest creature ! 

So now you have what you wanted. Did you receive my letter? 
Did you hand over my note? Today I regret having written it. I threw 
out a beam of hope where now I see only darkness and despair. 
Perhaps she is fooling me and making a joke of it. ... Perhaps. . . . 
Such thoughts come to my mind at the moment when your 
old schoolfriends, Rostkowski, Schuch, Freyer, Kijewski, Hube, 
etc. are chatting gaily in my room. And I laugh and laugh, but 
in my heart, even as I write this, a terrible foreboding oppresses 
me. It all seems to me a dream, a state of mental confusion; I 
feel I am at home with you and that all I hear around me is also 
only a dream. These voices to which my spirit is not accustomed 
make no more impression on me than do the rumble of carriages in 
the street or any other commonplace noise. Only your voice or Titus's 
would arouse me from this deadly state of apathy. To live or to die: 
it seems all one to me today when there is no letter from you. Tell my 
parents that I am in good spirits, that I have everything I need, that I 
am having a marvellous time and am never alone. Tell her the same, if 
she jokes about me. But if she does not, then say that she must not 
worry and that I am depressed too, wherever I am. I am unwell but I 
don't want my parents to know. Everyone asks what is the matter with . 
me. I am out of spirits. Hube is taking care of me: I have a cold in the 
head. Anyhow you know what is wrong with me. 

Our poor parents! And what are my friends doing? Why am I so 
desperately lonely today? Why can't you be here with me at such an 
awful time? Your flute will have plenty to lament over, but let my 
piano be the first to pour out its grief. In a month's time I may set off 
for Paris if things are quiet there. 

77 



There is no lack of entertainment here but I feel little desire to amuse 
myself in Vienna. Merk, the leading 'cellist here, has promised to 
come and see me, bringing his 'cello. Today is the first day of the new 
year how gloomily I am beginning it ! Embrace me, for I love you all 
more than my life write as often as you can. Where is she? At Radom? 

You have been digging trenches You write that you will be joining 

forces in the field then how can you give her my note? Don't send it 
by anyone ! Be careful perhaps my parents would think ill of me. One 
more embrace! You are going to the wars; then return a colonel! My 
God Oh, why can't I be with you? Why can't I be a drummer-boy? 

Forgive the confusion of this letter, but I am writing as if I were 
drunk. 

Yours 

Fryderyk 
[The above letter exists in several versions.] 

50. To JOSEPH ELSNER IN WARSAW 

Vienna. 29 January 1831 
Dear Mr Eisner, 

I feel ashamed that your kindness, of which I received so many 
proofs when I left Warsaw, has once again anticipated the paying of my 
debt towards you it was I who should have written as soon as I 
reached Vienna. But if I have so long postponed writing it was because 
I was sure that my parents would not fail to communicate to you all 
the most interesting news from me, and I waited until I could tell 
you something definite about my plans. However, from the day on 
which I learnt of the events of 29 November until now, I have experi- 
enced nothing but distressing fears and melancholy, and it has been 
useless for Malfatti to try to convince me that every artist is a cosmo- 
politan. Even if it were so, as an artist I may be still like a child in its 
cradle, but as a Pole I am a man over twenty. So I hope that, knowing 
me as you do, you will not think ill of me for having allowed my feel- 
ings for my people at home to take first place and for having so far 
done nothing about a concert. Today, in every respect, incomparably 
greater difficulties stand in my way. Not only does the continuous round 
of mediocre piano-recitals spoil this kind of music-making and frighten 
off the public, but in addition the events in Warsaw have changed my 
situation here for the worse, to the same extent as they might have 
improved my chances in Paris. 

Nevertheless I hope that somehow all wiU turn out for the best and 
that before the Carnival is over I shall produce my first concerto, which 

78 



appreciate at the time. Things which appeared at one time to be 
important now seem commonplace, and others which I regarded as 
commonplace now seem incredible, extraordinary, too great, too 
sublime. The people here are not my sort; they are kind, but not 
spontaneously so they are kind from habit, they do everything too 
systematically, in a flat mediocre way which gets on my nerves. I do 
wish I could be indifferent to mediocrity. 

I feel strange and depressed I don't know what to do why am I 
all alone ! 

i May, Vienna 

It was beautiful on the Prater today crowds of people who meant 
nothing to me; I admired the greenery and the scent of spring flowers 
this innocence of nature brought back to me my feelings as a child. 
A storm appeared to be coming up and I came back home there was 
no storm but melancholy took possession of me why? Even music 
gives me no relief today it is already late at night but I have no wish 
to sleep; I don't know what's wrong with me and I have already 
begun the third decade of my life. 

52. TO HIS PARENTS IN WARSAW 

Vienna. 14 May 1831 
My darling parents and sisters, 

This week I have been kept on a strict diet as regards letters. I have 
made this clear to myself by saying that I shall receive some next week, 
so I am waiting patiently as I presume you are all well, whether in 
town or country. For myself, my health is good that, I feel, is a great 
blessing in a time of misfortune. If it weren't for my exceptionally good 
health I don't know what I should do. Perhaps Malfatti's soups have 
instilled into me some soothing medicine which has eliminated any 
tendency towards illness. If so, I am sorry that our regular banquets 
came to an end last Saturday, for Malfatti has gone off to the country 
with his children. You can't imagine what a pretty place he lives in: a 
week ago today I went to see him with Hummel. He showed us over 
his property, pointing out all its beauties as we went along, so that 
when we reached the top of the hill we had no desire to come down 
again. The Court honours him with a yearly visit, for Princess Anhalt 
is his neighbour and I am sure she envies him his garden. From one side 
you can see all Vienna stretched out at your feet so that the town seems 
joined to Schonbrunn: on the other side are high hills over which are 
scattered villages and monasteries, making one forget the splendour, 
tumult and bustle of the town. 

80 



I also went yesterday with Kessler to the Imperial Library. I must tell 
you that it had long been my intention to visit what is perhaps the 
richest collection of old musical manuscripts in Vienna, but I had never 
managed to do so. I don't know whether the Bologna library is on a 
larger scale or more systematically arranged, but just imagine my sur- 
prise when among the latest manuscripts I saw a volume in a case 
bearing the name CHOPIN. It was fairly thick and nicely bound. It 
struck me that I'd never heard of another "Chopin" (there used to be 
a "Champin") and then it occurred to me that his name had got mixed 
up with mine, or something of the kind. I took it out, looked at it 
it was my writing. You see Haslinger had presented the manuscript of 
my Variations [Op. 2] to the library. I said to myself: "Fools, you have 
something there worth keeping I" 

Last Sunday there was to have been a grand firework display but it 
was spoiled by the rain. It's a queer thing, but the weather is nearly 
always bad when there are to be fireworks and that reminds me of an 
anecdote on the subject: A certain individual had a handsome brown 
frock-coat, but whenever he put it on down came the rain. Although 
indeed he rarely wore it, he never reached home dry ! So he went to 
his tailor, told him about it and asked what might be the cause of the 
phenomenon. The tailor was surprised, shook his head and requested 
the gentleman to leave the coat with him for a few days as an experi- 
ment, for it was impossible to determine whether the occurrence was 
connected with the hat, boots or waistcoat. There must be something 
somewhere. So the tailor put on the coat and went out into the street 
down came the rain in torrents: in fact the poor fellow had to take a 
cab to get home, for he had either forgotten to take his umbrella or 
(what seems more likely, as many people declare) his wife had gone off 
to see her cousin or friend, taking the umbrella with her. Be that as it 
may, the tailor was drenched and the coat soaked. He had to wait until 
it dried out, otherwise it would have remained wet ! After waiting some 
time it occurred to the tailor to take the coat to pieces to see whether 
there was not some spell which induced storm-clouds. Great idea 1 He 
unstitches the sleeves nothing to be seen. He unstitches the coat-tails 
still nothing. He unstitches the front and what does he find? Well, 
in the lining he finds a fragment of a poster announcing a firework- 
display. Now all was clear : he removed the piece of paper and from that 
moment the coat has never once been wet ! 

Forgive me if I have nothing very encouraging to report about 
myself, but I may be able to cheer you up kter. All I desire is to live up 
to your expectations which I have so far failed to do.

53. TO HIS PARENTS IN WARSAW 

Vienna. 28 May 1831 

I have just come back from the post office, but there was nothing for 
me. . . . Oh, how time flies ! The end of May is already here and I am 
still in Vienna; June will be beginning and I shall still be here, for 
Kumelski has had a relapse and is in bed again. 

I see that my letter promises to be tiresome, but please don't think 
that it is the result of my beginning to feel ill I am quite well and am 
enjoying myself. I was up early today and played till two, then I went 
to lunch where I met my good friend Kandler who, as you know, has 
promised me letters for Cherubini and Paer [in Paris]. After visiting 
our patient I shall go to the theatre where there is to be a concert at 
which we shall hear Herz, that Jewish violinist who only just avoided 
being hissed off at Mile Sontag's concert in Warsaw, and Dohler, a 
pianist who is to play works by Czerny. To end the concert Herz will 
pky his own Variations on Polish Airs. You poor Polish Airs ! You 
can't foresee what Jewish tunes you will be larded with called Polish 
music in order to entice the public. Just try to defend Polish music 
in Vienna after things like that; just express an opinion about it 
and they will take you for a madman, all the more since Czerny, that 
Viennese specialist in the manufacture of all sorts of musical sweetmeats, 
has not yet written variations on any Polish theme. 

Yesterday after lunch I went with Thalberg to the Evangelical Church 
where Hesse, a young organist from Wroclaw, performed to a select 
Viennese audience all the cream, from Stradler, Kiesewetter, Mosel, 
Seyfried, Gyrowetz, etc., down to the beadle. The boy has talent and 
knows how to handle an organ. Hesse left with me a page from his 
album to fill in, but I don't know what to write no idea. On Wednes- 
day I was at the Bayers* with Slavik until two in the morning. He is 
the only one of the artists here with whom I am in sympathy and 
intimate contact. That evening he played like a second Paganini, but 
a Paganini rejuvenated, one who with time will surpass the first. I 
shouldn't believe it if I had not heard him frequently: I really am sorry 
that Titus has not met him. He makes the listener speechless and brings 
tears to one's eyes more than that, he makes even tigers cry, for both 
Prince G. and Iskr. went away deeply moved. 

And what is happening to you all? I dream and dream about you! 
Will this blood-bath ever stop? I know you will try to say, "Patience!" 
and so I will endeavour to console myself. 

On Thursday evening Fuchs gave a party at which Limmer, one of 
the best Viennese artists, produced his compositions for four 'cellos. 

82 



Merk, as usual, makes them sound more attractive than they really are. 
We were there till twelve, as Merk felt like playing his Variations with 
me. Merk tells me he enjoys playing with me, just as I do with him, so 
we must produce a good impression when together. He is the first 
'cellist whom I have admired on close acquaintance: I don't know how 
I shall like Norblin [in Paris] by the way, don't forget to send me a 
letter for him. 

On 11 June 1831 Chopin made his only noteworthy appearance during 
this second fruitless period in Vienna: he took part in a benefit concert at the 
Kdrntnerthor theatre and played his E minor Concerto with orchestra, the 
first movement being (as in Warsaw) separated from the other two by vocal 
numbers. Little notice was taken of the whole affair. 

54. To ms PARENTS IN WARSAW 

Vienna. 25 June 1831 

My health is good; that is my one consolation, for in some strange 
way my departure is still being held up. I have never known anything 
like it. You know how undecided I am, but here I meet obstacles at 
every step. They promise me a passport every day, and every day I am 
kept running to and fro, trying to get back the one I deposited at the 
police-station. Today I had a fresh piece of news: that my passport has 
been mislaid and that not only will they not trouble to look for it but 
that I shall have to apply for a new one. We Poles have to put up with 
queer things these days. I am all ready to go but I can't move. I took 
Bayer's advice and I'm having a passport made out for England; how- 
ever I shall go to Paris. Malfatti is giving me a letter for his good 
friend Paer. Kandler has already written to the Leipzig musical papers 
about me. 

I didn't get home last night until twelve, for it was St John's day, 
which is also Malfatti's name-day. Mechetti had prepared a surprise 
for him: Wild, Cicimara, Miles Emmering and Lutzer, together with 
your humble servant, gave him an unusual musical treat, I have never 
heard the quartet from Rossini's Moses better performed; but "O 
quante lagrime" was incomparably better sung by Mile Gladkowska 
at my farewell concert in Warsaw. Wild was in good voice and I per- 
formed the duties of conductor. Cicimara declared that there is no one 
in Vienna who accompanies like me. I thought to myself: I am per- 
fectly well aware of it. (Hush!) 

A huge crowd of strangers on the terrace was able to listen to this 
concert. The moon shone marvellously, the fountains played, and a 

83 



divine scent from the open Orangery filled the air in a word, a 
magnificent night and a most enchanting spot. You cannot imagine the 
beautiful proportions of the salon where they sang: huge french 
windows, flung open to their full extent, lead on to the terrace from 
which you can see all Vienna; mirrors everywhere, but few lights. A 
smaller salon adjoining on the left, forming an extension of the ante- 
room, gave an impression of vast spaciousness to the whole apartment. 
The frank geniality of our host, the general elegance, the easy atmos- 
phere, the lively company, the wit that reigned over all, and an 
exquisite supper kept us there a very long time, and it was not until 
about midnight that we climbed into our carriages and dispersed 
homewards. 

I am doing my best to keep my expenses down and I guard every 
kreutzer as I did that ring in Warsaw [given to him by the Tsar in 
1825]. You may sell it if you like. I am already costing you quite 
enough, I'm sorry to say. ... By the way, a few days ago I spent an 
evening with Fuchs and he showed me his collection of 400 autographs 
among which he already has the bound manuscript of my Rondo for 
two pianos. He had invited a few people to meet me. Fuchs presented 
me with a page in Beethoven's hand. 

I was really delighted to get your last letter all my dearest friends 
writing on the same sheet of paper! In return I kiss those tiny hands 
and feet, the like of which are not to be found in Vienna. 

55. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK, ADDRESSED TO MUNICH 

Warsaw. 29 June 1831 
My dear boy, 

I have just received the letter which Mr Scholtz was good enough to 
deliver himself. I am very glad to learn that it is not your health which 
is preventing your departure. God grant it may remain good! As I 
notice that you have already drawn on the money intended for the 
remainder of your travels I am sending a little extra allowance we 
should like to send more, but that is all we can afford. You indicate 
that you drew from Mr Stein 450 Rhineland florins, i.e. 1,800 zlotys. 
I am adding 1,200, which will give you 3,000 zlotys. So you will 
receive three hundred Rhineland florins net, for I have paid down 
roubles in hard cash in addition to 223 zlotys for bank-charges: the 
sum advised by Mr Scholtz, who declares that it is difficult to transfer 
money abroad. Well now, my dear boy, you won't have too much 
money, so try not to stay too long in Munich, so as to avoid spending 
the little you have. I rely on your prudence. Let us know as soon as you 

84 



can whether you will be able to go and see Roman and whether you 
have made any friends where you are now. I am glad Mr Kumdbki is 
travelling with you; at any rate you are not on your own. Be as 
economical as you can my heart bleeds that I cannot give you more. 

Your loving father, 
Ch. 

56. STEFAN Wrrwicia 1 TO CHOHN IN VIENNA 

Warsaw. 6 July 1831 
My dear Mr Fryderyk, 

Allow me to remind you of myself and to thank you for the charming 
songs. Not only I, but everyone who knows them likes them enor- 
mously and you too would admit that they are very beautiful if you 
heard how your sister sings them. You must really become the creator 
of Polish opera: I am profoundly convinced that you could do it, and 
that as a Polish national composer you will open up an unbelievably 
rich field for your talent, in which you will achieve extraordinary fame. 
Would that you might keep before your eyes this one thing: national 
feeling, national feeling and again national feeling an almost meaning- 
less expression for ordinary writers, but not for a talent such as yours. 
There is a native melody as there is a native climate. Hills, forests, 
rivers and meadows have their native, inward voice, but not everyone's 
spirit can perceive it. I am convinced that Slavonic opera, called into 
life by a true talent, by a composer who feels and thinks, will one day 
shine over the world of music like a new sun, will reach higher than all 
others, will be as singable as Italian opera, while richer in feeling and 
incomparably more profound. Whenever I think of this, dear Mr 
Fryderyk, I rejoice in the sweet hope that you will be the first to draw 
on the vast treasures of Slavonic folk-song: if you failed to follow this 
path you would be wilfully renouncing the most splendid laurels. 
Leave imitation to others, let mediocrity occupy itself with that. You 
must be original, national. At first you may not be generally under- 
stood, but perseverance and self-development in your chosen field 
will assure your fame with posterity. Whoever wishes to rise to great 
heights in any art, and to become a real master must set himself a 
great goal. Forgive me for writing this: believe me, these counsels and 
wishes of mine spring from my sincere friendship and the esteem in 
which I hold your gifts. Should you go to Italy you would do weU to 

1 Stefan Witwicki (1802-1847), a Polish poet and friend of Chopin who made his home in 
France after the failure of the Polish insurrection of 1830. Chopin set several of his poems 
to music. They were published as part of Op. 74. 

85 



spend some time in Dalmatia and Illyria to get to know the folk-song 
which is so closely related to our own go also to Moravia and 
Bohemia. Seek out the folk-song of the Slavonic nations as a mineral- 
ogist hunts for stones and minerals on mountains and plains. You might 
even think it worth while to write down some of these songs: it would 
be an extremely useful collection for you yourself and would justify 
the time spent on it. Once more, please forgive my unasked-for 
scribblings: I will say no more about it. 

Your parents and sisters are in the best of health I often have the 
pleasure of seeing them. Our life here is one continual fever. I have 
had such bad luck with my health that I have not so far been able to 
join the forces in the field. While others were playing with bullets I 
have been playing with pills; however, I am in the National Guard 
artillery. They tell me that you are weary and miserable out there. I 
fully appreciate your position: no Pole can remain calm when the life 
of his fatherland is at stake. But we must hope, dear friend, that you 
will remember that you did not leave home to languish abroad, but 
to develop your art and become the consolation and pride of your 
family and country. It is with the consent of your respected mother 
that I make so bold as to give you this advice. The fact is that if one is 
to do useful work one's mind must be free, not yearning and worrying. 

Good-bye, dear Mr FryderyL With all my heart I wish you health 
and prosperity. 

Your friend, 
Witwicki 

If you care to set any more songs to music, putting two verses to- 
gether as you did in "The Messenger", don't worry if there is an odd 
verse at the end I can add an extra one. Adieu. 

57. CHOPIN TO HIS PARENTS IN WARSAW 

Vienna. Saturday [16] July 1831 

I see from your last letter that you have shaken off misfortune: 
you must believe also that no harm can come to me. Hope ! Sweet 
Hope! 

At kst I have my passport. We have given up the idea of going on 
Monday and shall wait until Wednesday before setting off for Munich 
via Salzburg. I must tell you that I have had my passport stamped with 
a visa for London. The police stamped it after it had been held up at 
the Russian embassy for two days and had been returned to me with a 
permit for Munich, not London. Never mind, I reflected, provided that 
M. Maison, the French ambassador, gives his signature. That was not 

86 



the only trouble we had persons travelling to Bavaria must have a 
health certificate with respect to cholera, without which they may not 
cross the frontiers of the Kingdom of Bavaria. We have already spent 
half a day running about with Kumelski to get one: the matter is to be 
settled after lunch. I am glad that while climbing all those govern- 
mental stairs we were at least in good company, for judging by 
his Polish countenance, correct speech and lids passport, no less a 
person than Alexander Fredro was after a similar certificate for his 
servants. 

Everyone here is simply terrified of the cholera you have to laugh. 
They sell printed prayer-sheets against cholera, they eat no fruit and as 
far as possible keep away from the town. I am leaving my Polonaise 
for 'cello with Mechetti. I see from Louise's letter that Mr Eisner was 
pleased with my press-notice. I'm all right here but a little depressed 
and lacking in spirits : I feel tired, but there are times when I am as merry 
as at home. When moments of gloom appear I go and see Mme 
Szaszek, where I usually find a few kind and pleasant Polish ladies. 
Their sincere expressions of hope for my future always cheer me up 
and I begin taking off the Viennese generals. That's the latest parlour- 
trick I've invented. You haven't seen it yet, but those who have 
split their sides ! And then there are days when you can't get a couple of 
words out of me, however you might try; and then I take a 30- 
kreutzer trip to Hietzing or some other place near Vienna just to 
refresh my spirits. 

Zacharkiewicz from Warsaw has been to see me. His wife, when she 
noticed me at the Szaszeks', could not get over her surprise at seeing 
what a real man I have become. I have let my whiskers grow on the 
right cheek quite a lot to see. It doesn't matter about the left side 
because I sit with my right side turned to the audience. 

That good fellow Wiirfel was here two days ago. Czapek, Kumelski 
and several others came too and we made a trip to St Veit. It's a pretty 
place, which is more than I can say of the so-called "Tivoli" where there 
is a kind of sledge-run, carrousel or slide, which you come down in 
little sledges they call it the Rutsch. It's awfully silly. But crowds of 
people slide down from top to bottom in these little coaches there's 
no point in it and I could not be bothered to look. But later, as there 
were eight of us, all good friends, we started a sledge-race to see who 
could get down quickest, pushing with our feet. It became a general 
sport, and from being an indignant condemner of this stupid Viennese 
amusement I soon became an ardent participant. But after a time I 
recovered my common sense and reflected that strong and healthy 

87 



bodies were enjoying themselves thus, and intelligent brains were 
indulging in this nonsense at the very moment when the whole of 
humanity is calling to such people to defend it. Damn the lot of 
them! 

But before I forget I am sure I shall have to draw from the banker 
Peter a little more money than Papa has provided for me. I am as 
careful as I can be, but honestly I must take this money, otherwise I 
shall have to start my journey with a very light purse. You might 
reproach me later on if I fell ill or something (which God forbid) and 
ask why I didn't take more. I am sorry, but after all I have lived on the 
money I had during May, June and July and I have to buy my own 
dinners more often than during the winter. I am not taking this step on 
my own initiative but rather because other people have cautioned me. 
It grieves me to have to ask you for anything just now. Papa has 
already spent a pretty penny on me: I realise how he has to struggle to 
make that penny, but worrying does not help and we must keep on 
hoping. It is harder for me to ask than for you to give, and easier for 
me to take than to repay. But God will have mercy on me amen! 
and say no more. 

In October it will be a year since my passport was issued: I shall 
certainly have to renew it how shall I set about it? Write and tell me 
whether you can send me a new one and what method you will adopt. 
Perhaps it can't be done ! 

I often run after someone looking like Johnny or Titus when I am 
out. Yesterday I could have sworn, from behind, that it was Titus but 
it was only some blasted Prussian! I hope you won't receive from all 
these epithets a bad impression of my Viennese education. It's a fact 
however that, apart from "Your obedient servant, sir" when they take 
their leave, they have not so many polite and select expressions in their 
conversation as we have; but while I have been here I have picked up 
nothing that is essentially Viennese. For example, I can't dance a waltz 
properly that speaks for itself! My piano has heard nothing but 
mazurkas. . . . 

Your devoted son, 
Fryderyk 

We learn from Karasowski's summary that, in a tetter (now lost) to his 
parents dated 20 July 1831, "Fryderyk tells his parents that he is leaving with 
Kumelski en route for Munich via Linz and Salzburg. He is in good health, 
and Steinkeller has supplied him with money; but being afraid that it may not 
suffice he asks for some more funds to be sent on to Munich. 93

58. FROM CHOPIN'S ALBUM 

[Stuttgart. After 8 September 1831] 

Stuttgart. How strange ! This bed on which. I shall lie has been slept 
on by more than one dying man, but today it does not repel me ! Who 
knows what corpses have lain on it and for how long? But is a corpse 
any worse than I? A corpse too knows nothing of father, mother or 
sisters or Titus. Nor has a corpse a sweetheart. It cannot speak in its 
own language to those around it. A corpse too is pale, like me. A corpse 
is cold, just as I am cold and indifferent to everything. A corpse has 
ceased to live, and I too have had enough of life enough? But can a 
corpse have had enough of life? If it were sated with life it would look 
well; but it looks miserable can life have so little influence on the 
features, the facial expression and the physiognomy of man? Why do 
we live on through this wretched life which devours us and only serves 
to turn us into corpses? The clocks in the Stuttgart belfries strike the 
midnight hour. Oh, how many people have become corpses at this 
moment ! Mothers have been torn from their children, children from 
their mothers how many plans have come to nothing, how much 
sorrow has sprung from these depths and how much relief! How 
many dishonest guardians and oppressed creatures have turned 
to corpses! Thus we see that a corpse may be good or bad! 
Virtue and vice come to the same thing ! So it seems that to die is man's 
finest action and what might be his worst? To be born, since that is 
the exact opposite of his best deed. I am therefore right in being angry 
that I was ever born into this world! Why was I not prevented from 
remaining in a world where I am useless? For I am indeed a useless 
creature. What good can my existence bring to anyone? I can't help 
mankind. I have neither strong legs nor a brazen face. And even if I 
had, would I have anything else? Supposing I had strong legs you 
have to have them but what about a corpse? No, it has not got them, 
no more than I have: and that's one more point of resemblance. Thus 
I have almost everything to enable me to establish an exact comparison 
with Death. I don't wish death for myself at present, unless things are 
bad with you, my darlings, and you yourselves wish for nothing better 
than death. If it is not so, I long to see you again, not for my own 
immediate happiness but in an indirect way, for I know how you love 
me. She [Constantia] was only pretending or is pretending. Ah! 
What a puzzle to be solved! Yes, no, yes, no, no, yes she loves me, 
she loves me not I've lost count. . . , Does she love me? Really? Let 
her please herself. At present I have loftier, far loftier feelings than 
mere curiosity in my soul. [Lines are here crossed out.] One can still 

89 



I have pleasant memories. Father ! Mother ! Sisters dear ! All you who are 
most dear to me, where are you? Perhaps corpses? Perhaps the Musco- 
vite has played a foul trick on me ! Oh, wait, wait ! What's this? Tears? 
How long is it since they flowed! How is this, seeing that an arid 
melancholy has so long held me in its grip. Ah! for how long have I 
been unable to weep ! How good it feels and sorrowful. Sad but kindly 
tears! What a strange emotion! Sad but blessed. It is not good for one 
to be sad, and yet it is pleasant a strange state to be in. A corpse must 
be just like that, blessed and wretched at the same moment. It moves 
into a happier existence and all is well; it regrets leaving what is past, 
and mourns for it. A corpse must feel as I did when I ceased to weep. I 
realise that it was a kind of momentary death of my feelings for a 
moment I died as regards my heart, or rather my heart ceased to exist 
for me. Why not for always ? Perhaps Icould bear that more easily. Alone ! 
all alone! [Three lines crossed out.] Oh, my misery is indescribable! 
My heart can scarcely bear it. My heart almost bursts when I think of the 
joys and the enormous pleasures I have enjoyed this year. My passport 
expires next month I am not entitled to live in a foreign country at 
least I have no official right one more point of likeness to a corpse. 

Stuttgart. I wrote the above lines not knowing that the enemy has 
reached my home! The suburbs are stormed burnt down. Johnny! 
Where are you? Wilhelm has surely perished on the ramparts. I see 
Marcel a prisoner! Sowinski, good lad, is in the hands of those 
scoundrels! Oh, God, art Thou? Thou art, but Thou avengest not! 
Hast Thou not seen enough of these Muscovite crimes or or art 
Thou Thyself a Muscovite? My poor kind father ! Perhaps you are 
hungry and cannot buy bread for mother. My sisters have perhaps 
fallen victims to the unleashed fury of the Muscovite scum. Paszkiewicz, 
that hound from Mohilev, is master of the residence of the first mon- 
archs in Europe! The Muscovite is lord of the world. Oh, Father, is 
this the joy reserved for your old age? Poor, suffering tender Mamma, 
did you survive your daughter [Emilia] only to see the Muscovite 
trample her bones underfoot and reduce you to slavery? Oh, church- 
yard of Powonski [where Emilia was buried] ! Have they respected her 
grave? They have trampled on it & thousand other corpses are piled 
on it. They have burnt down the town ! Oh, why could I not slay even 
a single Muscovite! Oh, Titus, Titus! 

Stuttgart. What is happening to her? Where is she? poor girl 
perhaps in the hands of Moscow. A Muscovite is seizing her, strangling 

90 



her, murdering, killing! Oh, my darling! here I am alone: come to 
me. I will wipe away your tears. I will heal your wounds by recalling 
the past, those days when Muscovy meant nothing those days when 
only a few Russians strove to win your favour; but you scorned 
them because you had me, me not that Grabowski! [who kter 
actually married Constantia]. Have you a mother? And is she such a 
bad one? Mine is good, and yet perhaps I have no mother now. Perhaps 
the Muscovite has killed her, murdered her. My distracted sisters 
will not surrender themselves never my father is in despair, help- 
less, no one will assist him in lifting up Mamma and here am I 
doing nothing, idle-handed, only heaving sighs and pouring out my 
grief on the piano, going crazy what more can I do? Oh, God, 
God ! Make the earth to tremble and let this generation be engulfed ! 
May the most frightful torments seize the French for not coming 
to our aid !

EARLY YEARS IN PARIS MARIA WODZINSKA 
GEORGE SAND MAJORCA AND THE RETURN TO FRANCE 



59. To ALFONS KUMELSKI IN BERLIN 

Paris. [18 November 1831] 
My dear friend. 

You inform me that you have been ill why was I not with you? 
I would not have allpwed it and I am surprised that that Galop Infernal 
[the last wild dance at a ball] did not avert your illness. Anyhow, 
nothing in this world is worth thinking about; if you were here you 
would be convinced of the truth of that maxim: every Frenchman 
jumps about and yells even when he hasn't a sou. 

I reached Paris quite safely although it cost me a lot, and I am de- 
lighted with what I have found. I have the finest musicians and opera 
in the world. I know Rossini, Cherubini, Paer, etc., and shall perhaps 
stay here longer than I intended not because things have been too 
easy for me but because they may gradually turn out weH. You, how- 
ever, are the lucky one you are drawing near home, while I may 
perhaps never see my people again. . . . [He goes on to give some 
account of his friends.] 

I expect to learn something about the Bayers today as I am invited 
to dinner with Radziwill (whom I found here), Valentin Radziwill 
that is, the elder brother of the one who married Stecka. We shall 
meet at the Komars', with whom Bayer was in correspondence. Yester- 
day I dined with Mme Potocka [Delfina], that pretty wife of Mieczy- 
slaw Potocki. I am gradually acquiring the entree to society, although I 
have but one ducat in my pocket anyhow I am better off than you! 
But I am not telling you of the impression this great city has made on 

92 



me after Stuttgart and Strasbourg. You find here the greatest splendour, 
the greatest filthiness, the greatest virtue and the greatest vice; at every 
step you see posters advertising cures for ven[ereal] disease nothing 
but cries, noise, din and mud, past anything you can imagine. One 
disappears in this swarming confusion and in one respect it's very 
convenient: no one inquires how anyone else manages to live. You can 
walk about in winter dressed like a tramp and yet frequent the best 
society. One day you may eat the most copious dinner for thirty-two 
sous in a restaurant full of mirrors and gilded mouldings and lit by gas 
and the day after you may go for lunch to a place where they'll give 
you just about enough to feed a bird, making you pay three times as 
much. This sort of thing happened to me to start with, until I had paid 
the price of my lesson. And what numbers of tender-hearted young 
ladies ! They do go for the men, but all the same there are plenty of 
strong, tough fellows about: I regret that the memory of Teresa 
(notwithstanding the efforts of Benedict who considers my mis- 
fortune a mere trifle) has not allowed me to taste the forbidden fruit. 
I have got to know a few lady vocalists and such kdies here, 
even more than those Tyrolese singers, would willingly 'join in 
duets". 

Sometimes on my fifth floor (I'm living at 27 boulevard Poisson- 
niete you wouldn't believe what a charming place I have a little 
room, handsomely furnished in mahogany, with a little balcony on 
the boulevard from which I can see from Montmartre to the Pantheon 
and all along the finest districts: people envy me my view but not 
my stairs) well, as I was saying, sometimes in the evening as I look 
over my letters, or make an entry in that album, or look over 
those notes, it seems to me that all these memories are a dream; I 
can't believe that those things all really happened that outing to 
Schwarzbach seems especially incredible those Americans! Oh, did 
you ever see anything like it! When shall we ever go over it all, 
tete a tete? 

I expect to stay here three years. I am very intimate with Kalk- 
brenner, the leading European pianist, whom I am sure you would like. 
(He is the only one whose shoelaces I am not fit to untie: all these people 
like Herz, etc. I tell you they are mere boasters; they will never play 
better than he.) So if I stay here three years you, my dear Bezendzio, 
will perhaps turn up, and I shall embrace you and play the Masaniello 
for you. Keep your spirits up and may everything turn out as 
you would wish. I hope it may be so : take a lesson from Newazendzio 
in the fairy story he lost many friends in the war, his parents are old 

93 



and instead of helping them he is a burden to them; his love is un- 
requited and today, deserted by his friends, he must sigh his soul away 
in places like Berlin! 

Yours ever, 

Fritz 
[A postscript mentions a few other acquaintances.] 

60. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

Warsaw. [27 November 1831] 
My dear boy, 

I was glad to see from your last letter that in several respects it will 
be more advantageous for you to be in Paris than it was in Vienna, for 
I am convinced that you will miss no opportunity of perfecting your- 
self in your chosen art. To know famous artists, to converse with them 
and hear them play their own works and to profit by their experiences 
cannot but be of the greatest advantage to a young man who is trying 
to shape a career for himself. It is very flattering that Mr Kalkbrenner 
has shown such friendship towards you, and as your father I am most 
obliged to him for it. But, nay good lad, I cannot imagine how, with 
the talents which he says he finds in you, he should believe it necessary 
for you to spend three years under his guidance in order to make an 
artist out of you and give you a "solid foundation". I am not in a 
position to understand this last expression although I asked your true 
friend Eisner to explain it I refer you to his letter. You know I have 
done all that lay in my power to encourage your talents and develop 
them, and that I have never put an obstacle in your way: you know 
also that the mechanics of piano-playing occupied little of your time 
and that your mind was busier than your fingers. If others have spent 
whole days working at the keyboard you rarely spent an hour playing 
other men's music. Taking everything into account, the period of three 
years baffles me. However, I don't wish to stand in your way, but I 
should be glad if you would postpone your decision until you have 
weighed the matter carefully, listened to advice and thought it over. 
You have only just arrived; you say yourself that you can't yet hold 
your head up and show what you have in you. So wait a while 
genius may reveal itself immediately to those who understand, but they 
may not perceive its lofty intention; so give them time to know you 
better and do not take upon yourself something which might only 
hold back your progress. I will say no more on the subject; I hope that 
as I write you will have already received the little extra allowance which 
I have sent: you should apply to Mr I. Laffitte. 

94 



I send you a loving kiss, entreating you not to trust too much in 
strangers. Your mother takes you to her heart. 

Ch. 

In letters sent at the same time Chopin's sisters, Isabella and Louise, 
reinforce their father's arguments concerning the three years 9 course with 
Kalkbrenner. Some paragraphs of Louise's letter show Eisner's opinion of 
Kalkbrenner's proposition, 

61. LOUISE CHOPIN TO FBYDERYK IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 27 November 1831 

. . . Kalkbrenner had filled me with admiration: I could see him in 
my imagination as a man such as I would to God all men were. I saw 
his nobility, moral superiority; in a word, if I myself had been con- 
cerned I would have signed a pact handing over to him myself, or even 
you. Yes, you, my dearest I would not have hesitated to place you in 
his hands. But next day we went to see good Mr Eisner, who not only 
loves you but desires more than anyone that you should attain fame and 
profound knowledge perhaps I am expressing myself badly: if so, 
forgive me, my dear. As soon as he heard your letter he expressed 
dissatisfaction with Kalkbrenner's proposition, crying, "Ah, jealousy 
already ! Three years !" and shaking his head although I talked to him 
(I was amazed that his immediate opinion was contrary to mine) and 
pointed out Kalkbrenner's merits and his love of art, and repeatedly 
quoted those sentences of yours showing that he was completely dis- 
interested, etc. It was no good. Eisner continued to exclaim and said he 
would write to you himself, adding, "I know Fryderyk; he is a good 
lad, and has no vanity or desire to push himself forward: he is easily 
influenced. I'll write to him and tell him how I see the matter.'* And 
indeed this morning he brought his letter, which I am enclosing, and 
continued to discuss the business with us. We, judging in the simplicity 
of our hearts, could never have believed that Kalkbrenner was anything 
but a completely honourable man. But Eisner does not quite believe 
it and observed today: "They've recognised genius in Fryderyk and are 
already scared that he will outstrip them, so they want to keep their 
hands on him for three years in order to hold back something of that 
which Nature herself might push forward. Mme Szymanowska [a 
famous pianist] is supposed to have said of Kalkbrenner: 'He is a 
scoundrel*, and so he is trying to speculate on Fryderyk's talent to 
claim at least that he is his pupil. But in spite of all his love of art his 
real aim is to cramp his genius." 

95 



Eisner says he can't understand what sort of "solid foundation" 
Kalkbrenner demands, and he goes on to say, "If he possesses this 
'foundation 5 himself, well, as far as technique is concerned, you can 
acquke and assimilate it too, if you want to, without having to sign on 
as a pupil for three years." For Eisner does not want you to imitate 
anyone, and he expressed a correct opinion when he said: "All imitation 
is as nothing compared with originality; once you imitate you will 
cease to be original. Although you may still be young your ideas may be 
superior to those of more experienced writers. You have inborn genius, 
and your compositions are fresher and better: you have the style of 
playing of Field, although you took lessons from Zywny so what 
does it all prove?" Besides, Mr Eisner doesn't wish to see you merely 
as a concert-giver, a composer for piano and a famous executant that 
is the easy way and is far less significant than writing operas. He wants 
to see you in the role Nature intended and fitted you for. Your pkce 
must be with Rossini, Mozart, etc. Your genius should not cling to the 
piano and to concert-giving; operas must make you immortal [This 
argument is continued at some length.] 

What infuriated Eisner immensely was what he called Kalkbrenner *s 
audacity and arrogance in asking for a pencil to cross out a certain 
passage [in the E minor Concerto] when he had merely glanced at the 
score, never having heard the complete effect of the concerto with 
orchestra. He says that if Kalkbrenner had offered you some advice, as 
for instance, to try to write a shorter first movement [Allegro] in 
another concerto that would have been different. But to instruct you 
to strike out what was written, that he cannot forgive. . . . 

62. JOSEPH EISNER TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 27 November 1831 
My dear friend, 

It was with great pleasure that I learnt that the leading pianist (as 
you described him), Kalkbrenner, received you so kindly. (I knew his 
father well in Paris in 1805 and already at that time his young son was 
reckoned among the very best pianists.) All the more then do I rejoice 
to hear that he has promised to reveal to you the secrets of his art. 
Nevertheless I am surprised that he fixes a period of three years in 
which to do it. Could he possibly decide, immediately after seeing and 
hearing you for the first time, how long you will require in order to 
absorb his method? Or that you must devote your musical genius 
simply to piano-playing, and your artistic endowment to the same 
species of composition? I expect that when he comes to know you 

96 



closer and better he will change his views. If he wishes to serve the 
general aims of our art by helping you with his artistic knowledge, if 
he is to be your friend, then you must show your gratitude to him as his 
pupil. ... So far as you are concerned, and also even Nidecki, I would 
never have thought of turning you into my pupils. I may say that with 
pride, however much I may congratulate myself on having given you 
lessons in harmony and composition. In teaching composition one 
should not lay down rules, especially to pupils whose gifts are self- 
evident; let them find out for themselves, so that one day they may 
surpass themselves by themselves. One should provide them with the 
means of finding out things they have not yet discovered. . . . 

One cannot advise a pupil to devote too much attention to a single 
method or manner or national taste, etc. What is true and beautiful 
must not be imitated but experienced according to its own individual 
and superior laws. No one man and no one nation must be taken as 
the unsurpassable, perfect model. Only eternal and invisible Nature 
can be that, and she contains it within herself. Men and nations can only 
offer us examples, more or less successful, to profit by. A final word: 
Those things by which an artist, always taking advantage of everything 
which surrounds and instructs him, arouses the admiration of his 
contemporaries must come from himself, thanks to the perfect culti- 
vation of his powers. . . . 

Joseph Eisner 

63. CHOHN TO TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Paris. 12 December 1831 
My very dearest friend ! 

Your letter restored me to life! What about that bruise of yours? 
I had all sorts of different accounts and put all sorts of interpretations on 
certain phrases in letters from home; and Kot [Constantine Pruszak] 
who wrote to me expressed himself so strangely that I was terrified by 
the thoughts that rushed to my mind. Oh, well, we shall meet again 
in this life ! What changes, what miseries who could ever have fore- 
seen them ! Do you remember that midnight council of war in Vienna 
the day before you left? [Chopin had proposed returning to Warsaw 
himself.] The wind has blown me here, where one breathes freely; 
but perhaps for that very reason because it's so easy one falls 
to sighing still more. 

Paris is whatever you care to make of it. You can enjoy yourself, get 
bored, laugh, cry, do anything you like, and no one takes any notice 
because thousands here are doing exactly the same everyone goes his 

97 



own way. Well, I really don't know whether any place contains more 
pianists than Paris, or whether you can find anywhere more asses 
and virtuosos. You must understand that I arrived here with very few 
recommendations. Malfatti gave me a letter for Paer; I had a few letters 
from Vienna for publishers and that was all. 1 was in fact at Stuttgart 
when I received news of the capture of Warsaw, and it was only there 
that I fully made up my mind to come to this other world. 

Thanks to Paer who is Court Conductor I got to know Rossini, 
Cherubini, etc., Baillot, etc. He also introduced me to Kalkbrenner. 
Just imagine how curious I was to hear Herz, Liszt, Hiller and the rest 
they are all nobodies compared with Kalkbrenner. I confess 1 have 
played as well as Herz, but I long to play like Kalkbrenner. If Paganini 
is perfection itself, Kalkbrenner is his equal but in quite a different field. 
It is impossible to describe his calm, his enchanting touch, his incom- 
parable evenness and the mastery which he reveals in every note he 
is a giant who tramples underfoot the Herzes, Czernys and of course me ! 

What happens? On being introduced to Kalkbrenner he invites me 
to play something. Willy nilly, not having heard him beforehand but 
knowing how Herz plays, I sit down at the piano, having put aside 
every shred of conceit. I played my E minor Concerto which the 
Rhinelanders the Lindpainters, Bergs, Stunzes and all Bavaria 
could not praise highly enough. I surprised M. Kalkbrenner, who 
at once questioned me as to whether I was a pupil of Field, for he found 
that I have the style of Cramer and the touch of Field. I was terribly 
pleased to hear that and even more pleased when Kalkbrenner took 
his seat at the piano to show off to me but got lost and had to stop. 
But you should have heard how he took the repeat I never imagined 
anything like it. From that time we have been seeing each other daily, 
either at his house or mine, and now that he has got to know me well 
he proposes that I should become his pupil for three years and he will 
make of me something very, very . . . ! 

I have told him that I know how much I still have to learn but I 
don't want simply to imitate him, and three years is too long. Mean- 
while he has convinced me that I can play splendidly when I am in- 
spired but abominably when I am not something that never happens 
to him. When he had observed me closely he declared that I had no 
"school", that I am going along fine but might take the wrong turning. 
He added that after his death, or when he completely gives up playing, 
there will be no representative of the great school of piano-playing left. 
He says I cannot, even if I wanted to, create a new school since I haven't 
mastered the old one. He sums me up thus: I have not a perfect 

98 



mechanism and the free expression of my ideas is thereby cramped; my 
compositions have a personal stamp on them and it would be a pity if 
I didn't become what I promise to be, etc. So far as that goes, if you 
yourself were here you would say: Learn, my lad, while you have the 
chance ! 

Many people advise me against it, judging that I play as well as he, 
that he is only doing it out of vanity so that he may later on describe 
me as his pupil, etc. None of that is serious. You must realise that if 
everyone without exception respects Kalkbrenner's talent, they can't 
stand him as a man for he is not a bit hail-fellow-well-met with every 
imbecile and, believe me, he is superior to all the pianists I have ever 
heard. I have written to my parents about this. They seem to agree, 
but Eisner thinks it's a question of jealousy. Notwithstanding all this 
business I am giving a concert on 25 December: you should realise that 
I have already an enormous reputation among the artists. Baillot, the 
famous rival of Paganini, will play, and Brodt, the celebrated oboist. I 
shall play my F minor Concerto and my Variations in B flat. Concern- 
ing these I received a few days ago a ten-page review from a German in 
Cassel who is full of enthusiasm for them. After a long-winded preface 
he proceeds to analyse them bar by bar, explaining that they are not 
ordinary varktions but a fantastic tableau. In the second variation he says 
that Don Giovanni runs round with Leporello; in the third he kisses 
Zerlina while Masetto's rage is pictured in the left hand and in the 
fifth bar of the Adagio he declares that Don Giovanni kisses Zerlina 
on the D flat. Plater 1 asked me yesterday where her D flat was, etc ! 
I could die of laughing at this German's imagination. He insisted that 
his brother-in-law should offer the article to Fetis for the Revue Musicale, 
and Hiller, a good fellow with enormous talent (a former pupil of 
Hummel, whose concerto and symphony were played with success 
two days ago he's a man of Beethoven's type, but full of poetry, fire 
and spirit) well, Hiller only just managed to protect me by telling Mr 
Brother-in-law that, far from being clever, the idea is very stupid. 

But to return to my concert. I shall also play on two pianos with 
Kalkbrenner, accompanied by four other pianos, his March followed 
by a Polonaise. It's a crazy thing. One of our two instruments is an 
enormous pantaUon which, of course, Kalkbrenner will have, and the 
other, which falls to my lot, is a monochord piano which is tiny, but 
its tone carries, like little bells on a giraffe. Add to these two the four 
large pianos which form the orchestra. Hiller, Osborne, Stamaty and 
Sowinski will take them. Sowiiiski is not a patch on the late Alexander 

1 Count Ludwik Plater, a leading figure among the Polish Mgrts in Paris. 

E 99 



Rembielinski (I've met a pupil of his here). He has not many brains 
but is of good appearance and has a kind heart. Norblin, Vidal and the 
famous viola-player Urhan never heard anyone like him will help 
me. The tickets are selling. It has been hard to get singers. Rossini 
would have let me have some from the Opera if he had been able to 
do so independently of M. Robert, the other director, but the latter 
does not wish to have two or three hundred similar requests on his 
hands. 

But I haven't mentioned the Opera yet. Never have I heard the 
Barber as last week with Lablache, Rubini and Malibran (Garcia), nor 
Otello as with Rubini, Pasta and Lablache; or again, Italiana in Algeri 
as with Rubini, Lablache and Mme Raimbeaux. Now, if ever, I 
have everything in Paris. You cannot conceive what Lablache is like ! 
They say that Pasta has gone off, but I never saw anything more 
sublime. Malibran impresses you merely by her marvellous voice, but 
no one sings like her. Miraculous ! Marvellous ! Rubini is an excellent 
tenor. He sings true notes, never falsetto and sometimes his ornamental 
runs go on for hours (but sometimes his decorative passages are too 
long and he deliberately uses a tremolo effect, besides trilling endlessly 
which, however, brings him the greatest applause). His mezza voce 
is incomparable. 

Schroder-Devrient is here but she's not such a sensation as in 
Germany. La Malibran played Othello and she was Desdemona. 
Malibran is small while the German lady is huge it looked as if 
she would stifle Othello! This was an expensive performance 
all seats cost 24 francs to see Malibran with a black face and not 
very good in the part. They are going to give [Bellini's] II Pirated and 
Sonnambula. Pasta has already left they say she won't sing again. The 
orchestra is marvellous, not to be compared however with the real 
French Opera, the Academic Royale. If ever magnificence was seen in 
a theatre I doubt whether it reached the level of splendour shown in 
Robert le Diable, the very ktest five-act opera of Meyerbeer, who wrote 
II Crodato, It is a masterpiece of the modern school, in which devils 
(the huge chorus) sing through megaphones and spirits arise from thek 
graves not like in The Charlatan [an opera by Kurpinski], but in 
groups of fifty or sixty. On the stage there's a diorama [transformation 
effect] in which, towards the end, you see the inside of a church and the 
whole church itself at Christmas or Easter all lit up, with monks and 

1 Chopin's first acquaintance with anything by Bellini. By this time Chopin's musical 
style and personality were formed; he had a long list of compositions to his credit and 
there is not the slightest indication that the hearing of a few opera performances exercised 
any new and marked "influence" on him.

congregation seated, with censers and, what is more, with a grand organ, 
whose sound, when heard on the stage, enchants and amazes one and 
practically drowns the whole orchestra. No one will ever stage any- 
thing like it! Meyerbeer has made himself Immortal! But he had to 
wait for three years in Paris before he could produce it and they say he 
had to spend 20,000 francs on the cast. Mme Cinti-Damoreau's singing 
could not be bettered I prefer her to Malibran* Malibran amazes 
you the other ravishes you, and she does her chromatic scales better 
than Tulon, the famous flautist. Impossible to have a more perfectly 
trained voice, and it seems to cost her so little effort that she coquets 
with the public. 

Nourrit, the French tenor, sings with extraordinary feeling, but 
Cholet (who is at the Opera-Comique where they are doing [Auber's] 
Fra Diavolo, [Ries's] The Robber's Bride, and Zampa, a delightful new 
opera by Herold) is the principal "leading-man" or "seducer". He 
annoys one, but is marvellous a genius with a true romantic voice. He 
has formed his own special style. At the Opera-Comique they are giving 
at this moment La Marquise de Brinvilliersyou know, the old lady who 
poisoned people in the days of Louis XIV or XV. The music is by eight 
different people: Cherubini, Paer, Berton, Herold, Auber, Batton, 
Blangini and Carafa de Colobrano. I suppose it would be hard to 
bring together a finer ensemble for a concert! Write and tell me what 
you think of all this. After all you must not think that I have become 
a bit of a fool, nor do I wish to make a fool of myself. 

Pixis shows me the greatest respect, partly because of my playing and 
partly because he is jealous about his girl who has kinder looks for me 
than for him! 

For pity's sake, do write or come yourself. 

Yours till death or perhaps very soon, 
R Chopin 

I live at 27 boulevard Poissonniere, but you didn't give me your full 
address and I had to inquire from Wodzinski Pleyel's pianos are the 
last word in perfection. Among Poles I see Kunasik, Morawski, 
Niemojowski, Lelewel and Plichta, besides a vast number of imbeciles. 
We often meet at Mile Jaczorek's but that's all. She is pretty. Olesz- 
czynski is thinking of doing an engraving of me. [He gives details of 
other visits.] 

I sometimes only wish you were here for I nearly go mad with 
nostalgia, especially when it rains. Mile Gladkowska has married 
Grabowski, but that does not put an end to platonic attachments. 
Baillot has just arrived: I seal my letter. Love me.

I simply must write to you about my little adventure with Pixis. 
Just imagine, he keeps in his house a very pretty fifteen-year-old little 
person whom (as he says) he intends to marry and whom I met at his 
pkce in Stuttgart. On his arrival here Pods invites me to come and 
see him, without saying a word about the young lady (whom I had 
already forgotten) having come with him. If he had, I might have 
visited him sooner! He asks me to visit him, so I go during the week. 
Well, on the stairs his young ward, with great satisfaction, asks me in, 
says, "It's all right, Mr Pixis is out come in and sit down he won't 
be long, etc." (A nervous trembling came over both of us.) I make 
some excuse, knowing the old man is jealous; I say I'll call again kter, 
etc. Meanwhile, as we were chatting so cosily and delightfully on the 
stairs in the innocence of our hearts, up comes little Pixis, glares (just 
like Soliva in Warsaw) through his huge spectacles to see who is up 
there talking to his belle. He rushes wildly up and stops in front of me 
with an abrupt "Bonjour!" for me and, "What do you think you're 
doing here?" for her, followed by a tremendous outburst of curses in 
German for daring to receive young men in his absence. I too, feeling 
blameless, smilingly back up Pixis and reproach her with coming 
outside so lightly clad in nothing but a silk dress. At length the old 
fellow calmed down, recovered himself, took me by the hand and 
showed me into the drawing-room, not knowing how to make enough 
fuss of me he was terrified that if I lost my temper I might play a 
dirty trick on him when he was out, or rather on his ward. Later on 
he came downstairs with me to the door, and noticing that I was still 
endeavouring to suppress a smile I couldn't conceal my joy at feeling 
for the first time that someone could think me capable of such a thing 
he went, as I observed, to the housekeeper's lodge and asked whether 
I had been upstairs a long time, etc. From that moment Pixis cannot 
praise my talent enough to all the publishers, particularly Schlesinger 
who has commissioned me to write something on themes from Robert 
le Diable which he paid Meyerbeer 24,000 francs for. How do you like 
that? Me, a seducer! 

64. To JOSEPH EISNER IN WARSAW 

Paris. 14 December 1831 
Dear Mr Eisner, 

Your letter [see No, 62] was a fresh proof of that fatherly concern and 
those really sincere good wishes which you have so graciously reserved 
for me, the most devoted of your pupils* In 1830, although I realised 
how much I had still to learn and how far I was from being able to 

102 



follow successfully any of the examples which you offered me (if I had 
wished to allow myself to be tempted by them), nevertheless I dared to 
think to myself: "I mil approach his achievement, in however small a 
measure, and if I cannot produce an opera like Ms Lokietek [The Dwarf 
King], perhaps some Laskonogi [Skinny-legs the nickname of a famous 
Polish king] will come from my brain. But today, seeing all my hopes 
in that direction dashed, I am forced to think of making my way in 
the world as a pianist, postponing only to a kter period the loftier 
artistic aims which you rightly put before me in your letter. To be a 
great composer requires enormous experience which, as you yourself 
taught me, can be acquired by hearing not only other men's works but 
one's own. Nearly a score of gifted young men, pupils of the Paris 
Conservatoire, are sitting waiting with folded hands for someone to 
produce their operas, symphonies or cantatas, which no one but 
Cherubim and Lesueur have seen in manuscript. (I say nothing of the 
small theatres which it is so difficult to force one's way into; and even 
when one has done so, like Thomas Nidecki at Leopoldstadt, great merit 
may lead to very little artistic reputation.) 

Meyerbeer, who for ten years enjoyed a magnificent reputation as an 
operatic composer, had to work three years, pay his way and remain 
in Paris before finally (when they had had enough of Auber) managing 
to stage his Robert le Diable, which was a sensation. In my view, so far as 
making a name in the musical world is concerned, he is a lucky man 
who can be both composer and executant at the same time. I am al- 
ready known here and there in Germany as a pianist; a few musical 
papers have mentioned my concertos and have expressed the hope that 
I shall shortly be seen taking my place among the leading exponents 
of my instrument which is as good as saying: Work hard, lad, and 
we'll make a gentleman out of you. Today I have before me a unique 
opportunity of realising the promise that is within me: why should I 
not profit by it? In Germany there is no one I would take piano lessons 
from, for although a few people there felt that I still lacked something, 
I could not then see in my own eye the beam which today prevents me 
from aiming higher. Three years is a lot far too long, as Kalkbrenner 
himself admitted after observing me more closely. That should prove 
to you that a real virtuoso with a well-deserved reputation does not 
know the meaning of jealousy. However, I would even agree to three 
years' work if I could thereby make a great step forward in my plan for 
the future. I am firmly convinced that I shall not be an imitation of 
Kalkbrenner: he has not the power to extinguish my perhaps too 
audacious but noble wish and intention to create for myself a new 

103 



world. And if I do work it will be in order to stand more firmly on my 
own feet. It was easier for Ries, since lie was known as a pianist, to 
achieve fame in Berlin and Frankfort with his opera The Robber's 
Bride; and Spohr too was long known as a violinist before he wrote his 
Jessonda and Faust. I am sure you will not refuse me your blessing 
when you know on what basis and with what enterprise I shall 
proceed. 

My parents have doubtless informed you that my concert is post- 
poned until the 25th. Tm having awful trouble in arranging it, and if it 
were not for Paer, Kalkbrenner and especially Norblin (who sends his 
respects) I could never give it in such a short time they all reckon that 
two months is very little time for Paris. Baillot, who is very pleasant 
and obliging, will play a Beethoven quintet and Kalkbrenner and I a 
duet, accompanied by four pianos. I only know Reicha by sight: you 
know how curious I was to meet this gentleman I know a few of his 
pupils, who have completely changed my ideas of him. He does not 
like music he does not even go to the Conservatoire concerts. He 
refuses to discuss music with anyone, and during his lessons he does 
nothing but look at his watch, etc. It's the same with Cherubini he 
rambles on about the cholera and revolution. These gentlemen arc 
dried-up puppets: one must regard them with respect and use their 
works for purposes of study. Once again Fetis, whom I know and from 
whom one can actually learn a lot, has gone to live outside Paris and 
only comes to town for his lessons otherwise he would long ago have 
been locked up for debt in the St-Pelagie prison. He owes more than 
the Revue Musicale brings in. I must tell you that in Paris debtors can 
only be arrested A domicile so Fetis does not stay at his "domicile" but 
goes outside the city where the law cannot touch him at certain times. 
The crowd of people concerned with all branches of the art of music is 
amazing. There are three orchestras: those of the Academie, the Italian 
opera and the opera in the rue Feydeau are excellent. Rossini is the 
director of his own opera, which has the finest stage-production in 
Europe. Labkche, Rubini, Pasta (who has just left), Malibran, Dev- 
rient-Schroder [sic], Santini, etc., enchant their fashionable audiences 
three times a week. Nourrit, Levasseur, Derivis, Mme Cinti-Damoreau, 
and Mile Dorus raise the level of the Grand Opera. Cholet, Mile 
Casimir and Prevost are the stars of the Op6ra-Comique: briefly, it is 
only here that one can fully realise what singing is. Today, unquestion- 
ably, it is not Pasta but Malibran (Garcia) who is the leading European 
prima donna she is fabulous ! Valentin Radziwill is crazy about her and 
we frequently imagine how you would admire her. . . . 

104 



I could go on writing for ever, but I won't bore you any longer. 
Please rest assured of the eternal gratitude and respect with which I 
remain 

Your most devoted pupil, 

F. F. Chopin 
My respects and best New Year wishes to your wife and daughter. 

65. To TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT POTURZYN 

Paris. 25 December 1831 
My dearest friend, 

This is the second year that I must send you birthday greetings over 
ten frontiers! If I could see you just once in flesh and blood it would 
fix you in my heart better than ten letters. So let me go on to some- 
thing else I don't want to write without thinking of what I am going 
to say, and I haven't bought one of those little books containing 
various forms of greetings which girls and boys hawk round the 
streets here for two sous. They are a queer lot here! As soon as it gets 
dark all you hear is street-vendors shouting out the titles of the latest 
pamphlets, and you can often buy three or four sheets of printed 
rubbish for a penny, such as "How to get and keep a lover", or "Priests 
in love", or "Romance of the Archbishop of Paris and the Duchesse de 
Berry", and a thousand similar obscenities often very wittily put 
together. Honestly one can't be surprised at the way of making a few 
pennies that they think up. I must tell you that there is terrible poverty 
here and little money about. You meet with crowds of beggars with 
menacing looks on their faces, and you often hear threatening remarks 
about that imbecile Louis-Philippe who is still only just hanging on to 
his Ministry. The lower classes are completely exasperated and ready 
at any time to break out of their poverty-stricken situation, but un- 
fortunately for them the Government is extremely severe on such 
movements and the slightest gathering in the streets is dispersed by 
mounted police. As I told you, I'm living on the fourth floor it's the 
most marvellous situation, being on the boulevards with a private 
balcony (a very graceful wrought-iron one) overlooking the street, and 
I can see far away to right and left. 

General Ramorino [an Italian revolutionary who had also helped 
the Poles] has come to stay in the street opposite me at a place called the 
Cite Bergere where a large courtyard forms a passage. Of course you 
know what a great reception he had in Germany and how the French 
in Strasbourg seized the shafts of his carriage and dragged it through 
the streets in a word, you know of the popular enthusiasm for our 

105 



General. Paris did not want to be behind the others in this respect. 
There are the medical students, the so-called "Young France" group, 
who wear beards and have a special way of tying their scarves I must 
mention that each political party wears them differently (I'm speaking 
of the extremists): the Carlists have green waistcoats; the Republicans 
and Bonapartists, i.e. "Young France", have red ones; the Saint- 
Simonians or "New Christians" (who are devising an original religion 
of their own and have already a huge number of converts they too 
preach equality) have blue ones, and so on. Well, a thousand of these 
anti-Government agitators made their way through the town with a 
tricolour banner to salute Ramorino. Although he was at home, he 
didn't want to get into trouble with the Government (he's a fool in 
that respect) and refused to show himself in spite of their cheers and 
cries of, "Hurrah for the Poles", etc. His aide-de-camp (Dzialynski, I 
think) came out and said that the General would be pleased to receive 
them another day. And in the meantime he cleared out the very next 
day. 

A few days later a huge crowd, not only of young people but of 
townsfolk, which had assembled in front of the Pantheon, made a rush 
for the right bank of the Seine. They came on like an avalanche, 
increasing their numbers with each street they passed through, until 
they reached the Pont Neuf where the mounted police began to break 
them up. Many were arrested, but all the same a huge body of people 
collected on the boulevards under my window, intending to join up 
with those coming from the other side of the town. The police could 
do nothing against the tightly packed throng; a company of infantry 
was brought up, hussars and mounted gendarmes rode along the 
pavements, the national guard showed equal zeal in dispersing the 
inquisitive and murmuring populace. They seize and arrest free citizens 
panic reigns shops are closed crowds gather at every corner of 
the boulevards whistles are blown reinforcements are rushed up 
there are sightseers at every window (as there used to be at home on 
festive days). This went on from eleven in the morning until eleven at 
night. I was looking forward to seeing something happen, but it all 
came to an end at about eleven, with their singing the "Marseillaise'* 
in a vast chorus. You cannot conceive what impression the menacing 
voices of the rebellious populace made on me. It was expected that the 
riots (Imeutes they are called) would begin again the next day, but the 
silly fools have so far given no sign of life. Only Grenoble has followed 
the example of Lyons, but the devil knows what may still happen in 
this world. At the Franconi theatre they give nothing but dramas and 

106 



tableaux featuring horses the whole story of these last decades of 
Polish history. Everyone rushes like mad to see all the costumes. You 
can see there Mile Plater, who takes part with other characters who 
have names like Lodoiski, Faniski one woman is called Floreska, and 
there is a General Gigult, supposed to be Mile Plater's brother, and so 
on. What gave me the biggest laugh was a poster in one of the smaller 
theatres announcing that during the interval they would pky 
"Dobraskfs mazurka Jesore Polska mirgineta* [instead of: Dombrowski's 
Jeszcze Polska nie zginela, the Polish national song]. I swear I'm not 
joking I have witnesses who were as surprised as I was that the French 
could be such idiots! 

By the way, my concert was postponed from the I5th [of January] 
on account of the singers, whom the opera-director V6ron refused to 
let me have. However, there is today a grand concert at the Italian opera 
with Malibran, Rubini, Schroder-Devrient and Cavadory. Herz too 
will play I am most curious to hear him and Beriot the violinist 
whom Mme Malibran has fallen in love with. I can't tell you how much 
I wish you were here I feel so miserable with no one to confide in. 
As you know, I make acquaintances easily and enjoy talking to them 
about anything that comes into my head; well, I have more than 
enough of such companions but no one with whom I can share my 
feelings. So far as my feelings are concerned, I am always out of step 
with other people. It depresses me horribly and I would give anything 
for a breathing-space, a whole day during which no one would look 
at me or say a word. If I'm in the middle of a letter I can't bear it when 
the bell rings and in strides a huge, fully-grown, powerful, bewhiskered 
creature who sits down at the piano, improvises God knows what, 
storms, bangs like a madman, writhes about, crosses his hands and 
hammers on one note for fully five minutes with one enormous finger 
which Heaven intended for holding the whip and reins of some farm- 
steward away in the Ukraine such is the portrait of Sowinski who has 
no other merits than a good appearance and a kind heart. Never could 
I have a better opportunity of conceiving what is meant by charlatanism 
or stupidity in art than just now, when I so often have to listen to him 
as I move about my room while getting washed. I blush to the ears I 
would like to kick him out, but I must deal gently with him and even 
return his affection. You cannot imagine anything like it, but since the 
people here take him to be someone (that is, those whose knowledge is 
limited to knowing how to tie a cravat) I am forced to fraternise with 
him. What drives me to absolute desperation is his collection of coarse, 
meaningless songs with horrible accompaniments, furbished up without 

E* 107 



the slightest knowledge of harmony or the rales of prosody, and with 
codas in the style of contredanses. This, if you please, he calls a "Collec- 
tion of Polish Folk-Songs". You know how I have wanted to feel and 
understand our national music and how far I have succeeded in doing 
so. Well then, you can imagine how nice it is for me when he sometimes 
picks up here and there something of mine, something whose beauty 
often depends on the accompaniment, and strums it in his best, low- 
down dance-hall, village-organist style. It's useless for me to say 
anything, for he cannot understand that what he has stolen can be better 
played than in the way he plays it. He's a kind of fake Nowakowski. 
And as for talking! He goes on about every mortal thing, particularly 
about Warsaw where he has never set foot. 

My closest Polish acquaintances are the Wodzinski brothers and the 
Brykczynskis, the best of good fellows. Young Wodzinski is always 
asking me why you don't come. They hope you will come, as they 
don't know you. But! think I know you and I have a good idea where 
you will go first. Just now, I was getting ready to describe a ball at 
which at least one goddess with a rose in her dark hair enchanted me, 
I received your letter and it has driven fashionable, up-to-date thoughts 
out of my head. I fly away more eagerly than ever towards you. I take 
your hand and burst into tears. I got your letter from Lw6w that 
means it will be still longer before we see each other, if at all indeed, 
for, seriously, my health is wretched. Outwardly I am cheerful, 
especially among my own people (by that I mean the Poles) but inside 
me I am tortured by all sorts of forebodings, anxieties, dreams or 
insomnia, longings and indifference, the impulse to live, followed by 
a wish to die a kind of delicious trance or unconsciousness. Sometimes 
sharp, vivid memory will torment me. Everything seems sour, bitter, 
salty a ghastly mix-up of feelings agitates my mind. I am a bigger fool 
than ever. Dear Titus, do forgive me it's all over. 

And now I must get dressed and go, or rather drive to the dinner 
which is being given today for Ramorino and Langerinann [another 
officer who had fought for the Poles]. There will be a few hundred 
guests at the hugest of all restaurants, "Au Rocher de Cancale". A few 
days ago Kunagik and our good friend Biernacki brought me an 
invitation. Your letter of today was something quite new you 
bestowed on me four pages and thirty-seven lines: upon my word, 
such a thing has never happened before, I declare! You have never 
been so generous and I really needed it very, very much. What you 
write concerning my character is so very true exactly what I myself 
believe. Don't get wrong ideas about it, dear boyI shall travel in 

108 



my own coach: I am only hiring a man to look after the horses [he 
refers to the possibility of his taking lessons with Kalkbrenner]. 

Dear Titus, forgive the confusion of this letter. I must close, otherwise 
I can't take it with me to the post. I must be my own master and 
servant. For pity's sake write. I embrace you. 

Yours eternally, 

I send this letter trusting to your charity. 

Chopin's Paris debut, postponed at fast to 15 January, had to be put off 
again until 26 February owing to the illness of Kalkbrenner. His family in 
Warsaw became anxious about his difficult circumstances and his father and 
sister Louise wrote together. 

66. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYZ IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 24 February 1832 
My dear boy, 

The obstacles you meet with and the difficulties you encounter in 
trying to give a concert worry me all the more when I think of the 
frustration caused by your incessant running about, which leaves you 
no time for rest. Besides, it entails expenses which must end by causing 
you embarrassment. I am worried too that you say nothing of the 
pupils that Mr Kalkbrenner was to secure for you. The acquaintances 
which you are continually making in high society will, I am sure, be 
useful to you and will help you to become known: but if by ill luck 
you happen to be in real want, it will have a bad effect on your work, 
for which you require peace of mind. I cannot conceal my anxiety over 
this and I shall be very pleased if you can reassure me on this point. 

According to your last letter your concert is to take place on the 26th 
of this month. God grant you may succeed, but I fear that these delays 
may bring things to nought. However, as the date is not far from your 
birthday, let me wish it may be a happy one and give you my warmest 
kiss. This latest date for your concert will perhaps be luckier than the 
others [since it came just before his birthday : i March] . As for ourselves, 
well, we have bread to eat, we struggle along and our health is quite 
good; as for yours, I'm glad that people say you look better than you 
did. Your mother and I take you once more to our hearts. 

CL 

Louise in her letter asks him to let her know privately if he is really in need 
of money. The first concert in Paris was a great artistic success but brought in 
little money. Chopin was obliged to apply elsewhere.

67. CHOPIN TO THE SOCI&TE DES CONCERTS DU CONSERVATOIRE , PARIS 

Paris. 13 March 1832 
Gentlemen of the Committee, 

I am exceedingly desirous of the favour of being allowed to appear 
at one of your admirable concerts and beg to submit an application for 
the same. Though I may have no special claim to put forward, I have 
confidence in your generous disposition towards artists and I venture to 
hope that my request will be favourably received. 

I am, Gentlemen, Your humble obedient servant, 

F. Chopin 

[In the margin is a note, probably by the secretary: Request too late- 
Answered.] 

68. ANTONI ORIOWSKI TO ms FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Paris. Spring 1832 

. . . dear Chopin sends you warm greetings. He has been so depressed 
during these last few days that sometimes when I go to see him we 
haven't the heart to say a word to each other. He is homesick. But 
please don't mention it to his parents: it would worry them. 

Things are bad here. There is great poverty among artists. The 
cholera is causing rich people to flee to the provinces. The worst of all 
is that none of the musicians (although they are as numerous as dogs) 
look like dying. If half of them would, the others might do better. 
There's still time for it to happen. 

69. CHOPIN TO JOSEPH NOWAKOWSKI IN WARSAW 

Paris. 15 April 1832 
My dear Nowakowski, 

You ask me about something which means a very great deal to me. 
I need not tell you how gladly I would see you arrive here to play 
together, to exchange confidences, to share your feelings and enjoy 
myself. Only don't set out and this is something which as your 
sincere and frank friend I cannot keep from you don't set out, I repeat, 
without funds, at least without enough to keep you decently for some 
time. It's very difficult to get pupils here and harder still to give con- 
certs. Baillot, Herz and Blahetka have this year had to call off their 
advertised concerts, in spite of the fact that the epidemic had not reached 
the town at the time when the concerts should have taken place. The 
public is indifferent and bored with everything. There are various 
reasons for this, but the political situation is chiefly to blame. ... So I 
advise you to put off your visit until May at any rate until the French 



opera returns from London. Otherwise you will miss Robert le Diable, 
William Tell, and Moses. I hope you understand French (I'm sure you 
do) so as to be able to fend for yourself, and then I guarantee that you 
will have a pleasant time in Paris. I'll introduce you to the leading 
European personalities: you shall make the doser acquaintance of those 
divas who appear less formidable the nearer one approaches them. 

I wish I could give you my ticket for the Conservatoire concert. 
That's something that would exceed your expectations. The orchestra 
is unsurpassable. Today they are giving Beethoven's symphony with 
choir [sic] and one of his quartets played by the massed strings of the 
orchestra violins, vioks and 'cellos: fifty string players all told. This 
quartet is being repeated by special request. They did it at the previous 
concert. You could have imagined that no more than four instruments 
were playing, yet the tone of the violins could be compared to a Castle, 
the violas to a Bank, and the 'cellos to a Lutheran Church. 

Give me your love. I'm expecting you. 
F. F. Chopin 

70. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

_ f , , Warsaw. 28 June 1832 

My dear boy, J 

I am glad to see from your letter of 6 June that you were lucky 
enough not to be involved in the riot which occurred and which was 
instigated by rascals. Some papers say that Poles took part and thus 
abused the hospitality they enjoy: have they not had their fill of such 
nonsense? They have caused enough trouble here. I am sure their num- 
bers were small, for who would be so mad as to share their destructive 
ideas? Thank God the level-headed section of the nation has triumphed, 
and order has been restored. Of course the income which your talents 
were bringing in will have temporarily stopped, but this cannot last 
the arts always recover when tranquillity returns. Let me know how you 
stand and what money you have. Has your fine friend [Schlesinger, 
the publisher] kept his word and paid for your compositions? You can 
say what you like, but I cannot approve of your disdain for certain 
people. I don't know what has turned you against them and I don't 
like such expressions as "muck". Anyhow you are old enough to think 
for yourself and weigh things up, and not be led away by your own or 
anyone else's fancies. 

Let me advise you to save what you can, so as not to find yourself 
without a penny, especially as you intend visiting other countries. 

Your mother and I send our love. 
Ch.

It was at this time that Chopin s affairs took a turn for the better. He was 
introduced to the Rothschilds and soon won the sympathy and patronage of 
this powerful family. As soon as it was known that he gave lessons to 
Rothschild's wife and daughters, there was a rush on the part of other wealthy 
families to secure the services of such an exceptionally distinguished teacher. 
From this moment Chopin 9 s future was secured and he had no need to do 
violence to his own instincts by exhibiting his talents to large and miscellaneous 
audiences. Henceforth the Parisian atmosphere in which he lived was to be 
one of secluded luxury. 

71. CHOPIN TO FERDINAND HIIXER IN FRANKFORT 

Paris. 2 August 1832 

Your Trios, my dear fellow, have long been polished off and, glutton 
that I am, I have swallowed up your manuscripts into my repertoire. 
Your concerto will be played this month at the Conservatoire com- 
petition by Adam's pupils: Mile Lyon plays it very well. La Tentation, 
an opera-ballet by Halevy and Gide, tempted no person of taste, for it 
is as uninteresting as it is out of tune with the spirit of the century just 
like your German Chamber of Deputies. 

Maurice [Schlesinger] is back from London where he had gone for 
the production of Robert le Diable (it was not much of a success). He 
tells us that Moscheles and Field will be coming to Paris for the winter. 
Here's some news for you: Osborne has been in London for the last 
two weeks, Pixis is at Boulogne, Kalkbrenner is at Meudon, Rossini at 
Bordeaux. All your friends await you with open arms. Liszt wants to 
say a few words after me. 

Good-bye, dear friend. 

Yours ever, 

F. Chopin 
[Liszt's postcript to this letter is lost] 

72. JULIUS SLOWACKI TO ms MOTHER 

Paris. 3 September 1832 

. . . During dinner Plater looked in to invite us to an artistic evening 
at his place a party for men only, Chopin, the famous pianist, played 
for us and we recited various poems, etc. in a word, a pleasant 
evening. . . . 

A few days later Straszewicz gave a similar party but, as usual, 
nothing went right in spite of long preparations, and the party bored 
us to death from ten till two in the morning. However, before it was 



112 



over Chopin got tipsy and improvised quite marvellous things on the 
piano. 

On 28 September 1832 Chopin's sister Louise married Kalasanty Jendrze- 
jewicz and on this occasion Nicholas Chopin wrote to Fryderyk another long 
letter full of the usual cautious recommendations: not to make enemies, to be 
careful with his money, and so forth. He says he is growing old and is glad 
to see his children settled. The tone and contents of these letters are so uniform 
that it is unnecessary to reproduce them all. Meanwhile Joseph Eisner, 
Fryderyk 9 s old master, had not given up hope of seeing his pupil become the 
creator of a Polish national opera. But as Chopin was now settled in his 
career as a teacher and composer for piano there was less prospect than ever 
of this hope being realised, and after a few more letters on the subject the old 
man gave up in disappointment. 

73. JOSEPH ELSNER TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

r^ c j i 11 r - j Warsaw. 13 November 1832 

Dear Fryderyk and dear mend, 

I am not writing to remind you of my existence, as I have no need 
to do so, knowing full well from your letters home that you still 
remember me kindly. Nor do I write to assure you that I too always see 
you before me, although not with my physical eyes, and I seem to 
converse with you about music, its general progress and its possible 
future destiny as the language of sentiment, etc. Ajid finally I do not 
write to inform my dear Fryderyk of what he must know well already 
that I esteem and love, yes, really love him; for both as a man and a 
genius he deserves all this from those who are in a position to under- 
stand such things. No! I am merely writing because your friend 
Nowakowski asked me to. And I would really like to say so much 
that I don't know where to begin. Having so many things to write I 
shall never be able to accomplish my task satisfactorily as the saying 
goes: "All excess leads to evil." 

However, I cannot forbear mentioning that my work on The Metre 
and Rhythm of the Polish Language in three volumes (containing my 
dissertation on Melody, which you already partly know) is now 
finished. However, it cannot be published just yet, since the question 
of Nationalism obviously occupies the most important place in it, apart 
from the discussion of the present trend of music. 

Nationalism, although it may be dressed up in the most moderate 
and restrained language, is like a beautiful woman whose very attrac- 
tions may prevent her from being exhibited in the market-place, even 
when heavily veiled. 



My third volume deals with the close connection between poetry 
and music, and to convince you Sapienti pauca [a hint for a wise man] 
of how far the development of my thoughts on this topic might be of 
use, not only to Polish opera-composers but also to those who write 
German, French and Italian operas, allow me to quote one short 
passage from the preface: 

"Having carefully considered all this, one must recognise that opera 
as a stage-spectacle is still far from having reached the peak of its true 
possibilities, especially from the aesthetic standpoint, wherein it still 
has to be brought to perfection. To this perfection it must be brought 
by the combined efforts of the poets and composers of all civilised 
nations." 

What a pity that I cannot debate all this with you and your colleagues 
people like Mickiewicz! Well, there you are I said I must not and 
could not write, and I have gone and filled the greater part of my 
paper! It is always like that: a man takes on the colour of the society 
he mixes with. You yourself transformed the few bars of an idea you 
once had for a "Chorus of Devils" into an "Angelic Chorus" how- 
ever, you did it because a pair of beautiful eyes asked you to. I have 
said more than enough I must stop. I had only to mention the poet's 
name, Mickiewicz, and at once Hell with its horrors and Heaven 
with its hopes arise before my eyes and would make me forget that I 
am on earth were I not in Warsaw. Keep well and be assured that 
no one outside your family loves and respects you more than I. (I say 
this without being acquainted with the young lady with whom, 
according to your dear sister Louise, you are to be united, so I can't 

speak of her.) 

Your friend, 

Joseph Eisner 
[He sends greetings to his friends in Paris] 

74. CHOPIN TO DOMINIC DZIEWANOWSKI IN BERLIN 

[Paris. Second week of January 1833] 

... I have found my way into the very best society; I have my place 
among ambassadors, princes, ministers I don't know by what miracle 
it has come about for I have not pushed myself forward. But today all 
that sort of thing is indispensable to me: those circles are supposed to 
be the fountain-head of good taste. You at once have more talent if 
you have been heard at the English or Austrian embassies; you at once 
play better if Princess Vaudemont has patronised you. I can't write 
"patronises", for the poor old thing died a week ago. She was rather 

114 



like the late Mme Zielonkowa or Mme Polaniecka, the mistress 
of that great estate. She received the Court and did much good, giving 
shelter to many aristocrats during the first Revolution. She was the first 
of the noble ladies to frequent the Court [of Louis-Philippe] after the 
revolution of July [1830] and was the last of the ancient Montmorency 
family. She always had a host of little black and white bitches, canaries, 
parrots, and was the owner of Paris high society's most amusing 
monkey which used to bite the other countesses at her parties. 

I enjoy the friendship and esteem of the other musicians: I wouldn't 
write this, seeing that I have been here only a year, if I did not have 
proof of it in the fact that men of the highest reputation dedicate their 
works to me before I dedicate mine to them. For example, Pixis has 
inscribed his latest Variations for Military Band with my name. More- 
over they write variations on themes from my works, and Kalkbrenner 
has composed variations on one of my mazurkas. Pupils of the Con- 
servatoire, pupils of Moscheles, Herz, Kalkbrenner, in fact complete 
artists, have lessons from me and set my name next to Field's; and 
indeed, if I were a bigger fool than I am, I might imagine I had reached 
the peak of my career. However, I see how far I have still to go, and I 
realise it all the more from mixing intimately with the first artists and 
observing how far each of them falls short of perfection. 

But I feel ashamed of having written so much nonsense. I have 
boasted like a child or someone with an uneasy conscience, who 
defends himself before being attacked. I would cross it all out, but I 
haven't time to write a second letter. Besides, you have perhaps not 
yet forgotten what I am really like; so remember then that I am just 
as I used to be, except that I have one side-whisker only, the other 
simply won't grow. 

I have five lessons to give today. You will imagine that I am making 
a fortune but my cabriolet and white gloves cost more than that, and 
without them I should not have bon ton. 1 am all for the Carlists, I hate 
the Louis-Philippe crowd; I'm a revolutionary myself so I care 
nothing for money, only for friendship, which I entreat you to give me.

75. To THE CHAIRMAN OF THE POLISH LITERARY SOCIETY IN PARIS 

Paris. 16 January 1833 

I received yesterday, the I5th, the notification of election to associate 
membership, with which die Literary Society has been pleased to 
honour me. 



I would request you, Mr Chairman, to convey my expressions of 
gratitude to my compatriots who have given me such a convincing 
proof of their encouragement and indulgence. The honour of belonging 
to their number will be for me a spur to fresh endeavours in keeping 
with the aims of the Society, at whose disposal I readily place my 
entire service and strength. 

I remain, with deep respect, 

Your obedient servant, 

F. F. Chopin 

Born i March 1810 at the village of Zelazowa Wola in the Province 
of Mazovia. 

76. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 13 April 1833 

I am very glad, my dear boy, that you have got over your concert, 
but I see all the same that you cannot fall back on such enterprises if 
you are in need of money, since the expenses swallow up the takings. 
However, if you are satisfied, we are. But I must go on repeating that 
as long as you have not put a couple of thousand francs on one side, I 
shall regard you as one to be pitied, notwithstanding your talent and 
the flattering compliments you receive. Compliments are so much 
smoke which won't keep you alive in times of need. May God preserve 
you from poor health or illness, or else you will be reduced to poverty 
in a foreign country. I confess that such thoughts often trouble me, for 
I see that you spend as fast as you earn and you can't take the slightest 
little trip at your own expense, even within France itself. You men- 
tioned going to England. What with? In a country like that where 
everything is so dear! If you go on in this way you will always be a 
true Parisian. Don't go and think I want you to be mean; no, I want to 
see you less careless about the future. The fact that the papers say 
nothing about your progress does not worry me I am not so vain as 
to mind. Your well-being is what matters. I am also interested by what 
you say of Kalkbrenner's obvious insincerity I see he has been the 
cause of your migraine and I am anxious for your sake. I feel it was very 
good-natured of you to give him a dedication [of the E minor Con- 
certo]. If he comes here I shall have very little desire to see him I 
cannot hide my feelings. Your Nocturnes and Mazurkas [Opp. 9 
and 6-7] have been reprinted at Leipzig and were sold out here within 
a few days. Jawurek told me he had been too late to get copies. Mr 
WalewsH's cousins say he will be arriving here; in that case get him 
to bring a copy of your [E minor] Concerto if it is in print and Isabella 

116 



will try to play us some portions of it. Louise has no piano yet for I 
have not been able to afford one. . , . [He ends with some family news.]

77. CHOPIN, LISZT, AND AUGUSTS FRANCHOMME TO FERDINAND HILLES 
AT FHANKFORT 

Paris. 20 June 1833 

[In this joint letter the sentences written by Liszt are given in italics.] 

This is the tiventieth time at least that we have arranged to meet either at 
my place or where we are now for the purpose of writing to you, and we have 
invariably been prevented by some visitor or other hindrance. I dont know 
ivhether Chopin will have the courage to apologise: for my part I think we 
have gone so far in rudeness and impertinence that no apologies are admissible 
or possible. We fully shared your grief and wished more eagerly than ever 
we could have been with you in order to moderate the bitterness of your 
sorrow [Hiller had just lost his father]. 

He has expressed himself so well that I have nothing to add in the 
way of apology for my neglect, or laziness, or influenza or, or you 
know I can explain myself better by word of mouth, and when I come 
along the boulevards with you to see you home I shall try to obtain 
your pardon. I am writing without knowing what my pen is scribbling, 
because at this moment Liszt is playing my studies and putting honest 
thoughts out of my head: I should like to rob him of the way to play 
my own studies. As for your other friends here in Paris, I have often 
seen during this winter and spring the Leo family and their circle. 
Certain of the ambassadors' wives have given parties and at every one 
there were inquiries about the gentleman at Frankfort. Madame 
Eichtal sends a thousand greetings. Pkter and all his family were 
saddened by your departure and he has asked me to condole with you 
on your bereavement. 

Mme Apponyi cannot forgive me for not bringing you to her house 
before you left She hopes that when you return you will remember your 
promise to her. I could say the same for a certain lady who is not an ambas- 
sador's wife. Do you know Chopin s marvellous studies? They are admirable 
all the same they will only last until such time as yours are published 
some slight modesty on the author 9 s part! a nasty little remark from His 
Highness, for I must explain that he corrects my spelling (according 
to M. Malet's book of rules). 

You will come back to us in September, won't you? Try to let us 
know beforehand when it will be, for we pkn to give you a serenade 
or musical party. The most distinguished artists in the capital will be 

117 



there, namely Mr Franchomme [PRESENT! writes Franchomme], 
Mme Petzold and the Abbe Bardin, the ballet-dancers from the rue 
d'Arnboise and my neighbours; Maurice ScUesinger, uncles, aunts, 
nephews, nieces, brothers-in-law, etc. 

Compiled by 
K Liszt, R Chopin, Aug. Franchomme 

By the way, I met Heine yesterday and he asked me to grussen you 
herzlich und herzlich. Again by the way, excuse my use of vous instead 
of tu. If you have a moment send us a line we are longing for news of 
you. 

Paris. 5 rue dela Chaussee d'Antin. fmliving in Franck's apartment 
he is off to London and Berlin. I arn most comfortable in these rooms 
where we used so often to meet. Love from Berlioz. As for old Baillot, 
he is in Switzerland, at Geneva, so you understand why I can't send you 
the Bach concerto. 

In the early autumn 0/1833 Chopin spent some days at the country house Oj 
Auguste Franchomme, a professor of 'cello-play ing at the Conservatoire, with 
whom Reformed an early and lasting friendship. They often played together 
and in 1832 had published a joint composition: a Grand Duo on themes from 
Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable. 

78. CHOPIN TO AUGUSTE FRANCHOMME AT LE COTEAU, AZAY-SUR-CHER 

Paris. Begun Saturday the I4th and finished 
Wednesday the i8th [September 1833] 
Dear friend, 

It's no use my apologising for my silence. If only my thoughts could 
post themselves without having to be put down on paper ! Anyhow 
you know me too well not to realise that unfortunately I never do as I 
ought. I had a comfortable journey (except for an unpleasant episode 
caused by an extremely odorous gentleman who was travelling to 
Chartres: he got into the coach unexpectedly during the night). 

I found more jobs to do in Paris on my return than I had when I left. 
They will doubtless prevent me from coming to join you at Le Coteau 
Coteau! Oh, Coteau! Be a good chap and tell everyone that I shall 
never forget my stay in Touraine and that such kindness leaves me with 
eternal gratitude. People say I have put on weight and look well. I do 
really feel very well, thanks to the ladies next me at table who looked 
after me like mothers. 

When I think about it, it all seems like such a lovely dream that I 
would like to go on sleeping. Oh, those country-girls at Pornic and 



that game with the flour! or rather your nicely shaped nose which 
you had to plunge into it I 1 

An interesting visit interrupted this letter which I began three days 
ago and I can only finish it today* Hiller sends his love. So does 
Maurice [Schlesinger] and everyone. I delivered your note to your 
brother: he was out. Paer, whom I saw a day or two ago, spoke of your 
returning. Come back vigorous and well, like me. 

A thousand kind regards to the Forest family: I can't find words to 
express my feelings towards them. Forgive me. Give me your hand 
and let me slap your shoulder and give you a hug. Au revoir, my 
friend.

79. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

[Warsaw, Early in 1834] 
My dear boy, 

I was beginning to be anxious about you for we only received your 
letter of the yth on the i8th, but I can well imagine that you were too 
busy to write sooner. I don't know where you got the idea that I was 
ill. No, no, my boy I thought I had told you that our health is as good 
as can be expected at our age, and we never lose the consoling hope of 
seeing you again one day. But take care of yourself. Don't work too 
hard and don't tire yourself out with formal visits and long evening 
parties. I know it all helps your reputation and keeps you cheerful. It 
worries me very much that you have not a real friend living with you. 
As you point out, the other arrangement did not work after all you 
can't receive your friends in a room full of smoke, especially as you 
don't smoke yourself. It is miserable, however, to be entirely on one's 
own, without a soul to talk to. I rejoice to hear you speak of your 
principles. Yes, my dear boy, a young man can easily be led astray if he 
does not keep an eye on himself. Your talent and social gifts might 
easily turn someone's head. At your age you must avoid any kind of 
impropriety; do not be led into intrigues it might cause you a lot of 
embarrassment. You know this so-called "great world" which is very 
small when one looks at it closely. But one sees what it is and keeps 
quiet. . . . How are things going, my boy? Do you manage to save up 
a few pennies? (I am always harping on that!) Don't miss any oppor- 
tunity of doing so, believe me. Try to form a little reserve; but I would 
advise you to put it into things which you can turn back into money 

1 A wedding-ring was placed on a pyramid of flour and the game was to lift it off with 
one's nose. Chopin could do this easily with his long fine nose.

whenever you like. What are your plans for the spring and summer? 
What about that little trip to Germany you have been advised to make? 
Or will you rather stay quietly in Paris if you have plenty of lessons? 
It would really be a good idea to give the German critics something to 
write about, by letting them hear you play your own works you 
might even cover the expenses of the trip. I will not trouble you with 
advice on the matter: you have enough discernment to do the right 
thing. [He ends with family news.] 

Ch. 

As you are living alone, if you decide to share your lodging choose 
well and take someone whose behaviour you can be sure of. In these 
days lambs in wolves* clothing are to be found everywhere. 

Although Chopin s works, which were now being published regularly in 
France, Germany and England, met with a generally favourable reception, a 
German critic, Ludwig Rellstab, writing in the review Iris im Gebiet der 
Tonkunst, attacked them savagely. To make matters worse, he published a 
spurious letter, supposed to come from Chopin, in which Fryderyk is made to 
use coarse and childish language against his critic. Someone named Kallert 
replied on Chopin s behalf. 

80. ISABELLA CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 26 April 1834 

[Isabella continues one of her father's letters] . . . Well, at last, after 
worrying terribly about Fryderyk's not writing, about there being no 
letter from him, we received one yesterday knowing how we love 
you, you can imagine our joy. Oh, my dear brother, it is true that your 
letters bring new life to the whole family. Papa is happy, Mamma's 
mind is more at rest, we are more cheerful, and good temper and joy 
(a rare thing with us) make themselves felt. 

So you are going to take a trip [to Germany] which will cover as 
many miles and take as much time as if you were to come here. But 
we are far away, although always close to you. We are always thinking 
about our chances of seeing you. If you could at least arrange a meeting 
with Papa and Mamma somewhere it would indeed be a unique bles- 
sing for them. Nothing in the world is impossible, so it may happen 
one day, but when? 

I read Kallert 's answer to Rells tab's review and like it very much. 
He describes your career from childhood just as if he was familiar with 
your circumstances. Everything he says is correct, and he writes with 
praise (quite justifiable) for your character and attributes your talent 

120 



to your moral education and intelligence* He ends with a note to the 
effect that he has read your "answer" in Iris and guarantees that you 
did not write such a thing. If you had written it he would regret, not 
that he had come to your defence, but that he had spoken as he did of 
your character. I am delighted to see the Germans taking this attitude 
towards new talents all in all, it's a sign of progress. One can see that 
Kallert is a man of wide education; he understands both you and the 
spirit of the age. 3f you haven't read the article try to get hold of it: 
it would be worth your while. . . . [She teUs him further that she is 
studying his latest compositions and that Louise has received the alburn 
containing the Nocturnes, Op. 15, with his portrait engraved by 
Vigneron.] 

81. HECTOR BERLIOZ TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

[Paris. First week of May 1834] 
[The words italicised below are written in Italian.] 
My dear little Chopin* 

There 9 s going to be an outing to No. 10 rue St Denis, Montmartre: I 
hope that Hiller, Liszt and De Vigny will be accompanied by Chopin. 
This is awfully silly. 
So much the worse ! ! 

H.B. 

[Berlioz was living at what was then the village of Montmartre with 
his new bride, Harriet Smithson.j 

In the second half of May 1834 Chopin accepted Hitter* s invitation to visit 
Aachen for the Lower Rhineland musical festival. Mendelssohn came from 
Dusseldorf to join them. While on board a Rhine steamer, Hiller wrote to 
his mother, and Chopin added the following postscript in German: 

82. CHOHN TO MME R. HILLER IN PARIS 

[End of May 1834] 
Gracious Lady! 

Today I am like the steam in our steamer and I vanish into thin air. 
I feel as if one part of me were floating away to my people at home 
while the other comes to greet you respectfully in Paris, finds you in 
your boudoir and presents its compliments. Ferdinand is well and looks 
as if he would be nice to eat ! Sorry I have not enough paper left to 
write down all I would like to tell you 

Your servant, 
Ck 

121 



One single remark is worth extracting from the next joint letter from 
Nicholas Chopin and Isabella. After his usual appeals to Fryderyk to take 
care of his health and money the father adds: 

"By the way, you did not let us know whether you have finished your 
third concerto. I confess I doubt whether you have, and I should not be sorry if 
you had not, for it demands too much mental tension, and if one sleeps badly 
one is less fit for work, as I have already pointed out." 

Of the projected concerto in A major all that survives is an arrangement of 
the first movement, published as an Allegro de Concert (Op, 46} in 1841. 
It was now that the Wodzitiski family, whose three sons had been boarders 
unth the Chopins in Warsaw, appeared again on Fryderyk' $ horizon. Mme 
Teresa Wodzinska t the mother, wrote to invite him to visit her in Geneva, 
and her daughter Maria enclosed a little piece of music she had composed. 
The stage was being set for Chopin's second serious love-affair. 

83. To FELIX WODZINSKI IN GENEVA 

Paris. * 8 July 1834 
My dear Felix, 

You have certainly been thinking : "Fritz must be down in the dumps, 
for he has replied neither to me nor Maria." But you surely remember 
that I always put off doing things. I was too late in going to see Mile 
Fanche [who would have taken his letter to Geneva] and so I had to 
wait for the departure of our good friend Wolff. But for the fact that 
I have just returned from the Rhineland and have work in hand which 
I cannot throw on one side I should have set off at once for Geneva to 
thank you and accept your esteemed mother's invitation. But fate is 
hard on me and it can't be done. It was so charming of your sister to 
send me her composition. It gave me inexpressible pleasure and on that 
same evening I improvised in one of the Parisian salons on the attrac- 
tive little theme composed by that Marynia whom I used to chase 
through the rooms at Pszenny in days gone by. . . . But today ! I now 
take the liberty of sending to my esteemed colleague Mile Maria a 
little waltz I have just published [E flat, Op. 18], May it give her a 
hundredth part of the pleasure I experienced on receiving her Varia- 
tions. I must now close, thanking you once more most warmly for your 
mother's gracious mention of me, her true and faithful servant in whose 
veins also a little Kujawski blood flows [a reference to his mother 
Justyna Krzyzanowska], 

Embrace dear Antoni for me and smother Casimir with my kisses. 
As for Mile Maria, make a very elegant and respectful bow, appear 

122 



to be surprised and whisper to yourself: "Good gracious! How it has

84. JAN MATUSZY^SKI TO ms BROTHER-IN-LAW IN POLAND 

[Paris. 1834] 

. . . My first thought was to call on Chopin, I cannot say how glad we 
were to meet again after five years of separation. He has grown tall and 
strong, so that I scarcely recognised him. Chopin is now the leading 
pianist in Paris. He gives many lessons, never for less than twenty 
francs. He has composed a good deal and his works are much sought 
after. I am living with him at 5 rue de la Chaussee d' Antln. It is rather 
far from the Medical School and the hospitals, but I have very good 
reasons for staying with him he's the only friend I have. We spend 
our evenings at the theatres or pay visits or else we stay in and enjoy 
ourselves quietly at home. 

85. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FREDERYK IN PARIS 

My dear boy, Warsaw. 7 September 1834 

We received your letter of 20 August and read it with the pleasure 
we feel each time we hear from you; for what can be so satisfactory to 
your dear mother and me as to see you prosper and deserve the esteem 
of worthy people? So now you are settled with your own furniture, 
and indeed not without some little luxury, if I may say so. But I quite 
understand that you had to have it since you give your lessons at home, 
and now, as always, people judge by appearances. But go steady, my 
boy. Try rather to take advantage of the offers of the three bankers 
you mention [Rothschild, Leo, Eichtal]. 

I am glad that Johnny [Matuszynski] is living with you. I have always 
been fond of him; he is a good lad and his behaviour proves it, since in 
spite of difficult circumstances he has managed to find himself a respect- 
able occupation. I am obliged to him for having remembered us in 
the midst of the pleasure of that party you gave. I have read the poem 
written in your honour and the commentary on your waltz. I myself 
keep off verse-scribbling and never try my hand at it; however the 
following came into my mind: 

If Fortune smile upon your youthful days 
Enjoy her smile, but fear her turning wheel; 
And be not blinded, follow prudent ways 
Lest you one day the sting of want may feel ! 

123 



As it seems you will be remaining abroad for some time to come, I 
must tell you, my boy, that there should have been a notice in the 
French Official Gazette of n June to the effect that every Pole is re- 
quired to obtain an extension of his passport. As you left before the 
troubles began and took no part in them, I do wish you would make 
inquiries about this at the embassy. I confess I should not like to see 
you finding yourself through carelessness numbered among the 
emigres. Do not fail to do this and let me know what happens it is 
easy for you to do this since you are well known. 

[The rest of this letter, to which Louise and Isabella also made contri- 
butions, is concerned with local Polish affairs.] 



86. JOSEPH EISNER TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 14 September 1834 
My dear friend, 

Everything I read or hear about our dear Fryderyk fills my heart 
with joy, but forgive my frankness it is still not enough for me, your 
fortunate (though of little merit) teacher of harmony and counterpoint, 
who will always be your true friend and admirer. As I journey through 
this "vale of tears" I would like to live to see an opera of your com- 
position, which would not only increase your fame but benefit the art 
of music in general, especially if the subject of such an opera were 
drawn from Polish national history. I am not exaggerating when I say 
this. Firstly, you know me, you know that I cannot flatter; secondly, 
I recognise in addition to your genius the nature of your gifts. As 
the critic of your Mazurkas stated, only an opera can show your 
talent in a true light and win for it eternal life. "A piano-work", 
says Urban [a German critic] "is to a vocal or other instrumental 
composition as an engraving is to a painted picture." This view is 
as correct as ever, although certain piano works, especially your 
own when performed by yourself, may be regarded as illuminated 
engravings. 

What a pity I cannot see you and discuss all this with you I should 
have so many, many things to say. Anyway, I wish I were a bird at this 
moment and could fly to see you in your Olympian abode (which the 
Parisians regard as a swallow's nest) and thank you personally for your 
gift which is doubly precious to me. I can understand the Parisians, for 
they love you as we do. Take care of yourself and love me as I do you. 
Now and ever your true friend and well-wisher, 

Joseph Eisner

87. ANTONI ORIOWSKI TO HIS FAMILY IN POLAND 

[1834] 

, . . Chopin is well and strong. He is turning all the women's heads 
and making all the husbands jealous. He is the ktest fashion. We shall 
doubtless soon be wearing gloves a la Chopin. But he is tormented by 
homesickness. 

88. F. KALKBRENNER TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Paris. 28 December [1834] 
My dear Chopin, 

We never see you nowadays. The countless distractions and pleasures 
of Paris make you forget your old friends. Do come and dine with us 
tomorrow. You will find us with Liszt and a few other friends who like 
us will be delighted to see you. Addio. 

F. Kalkbrenner 
Sunday morning. 

89. MME TERESA WODZHSTSKA TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

Geneva. 28 February 1835 
Dear Mr Fryderyk, 

Allow me to recall myself to your memory, Felix and Marynia 
[Maria] have already been engaging your attention whilst I, wishing to 
spare your time, have not written at all, as they passed on your good 
news to me. However, having today a good opportunity, thanks to 
our compatriot Mr Darowski, I should like to request you to let us 
have some news of yourself and your family, for I am sure you 
frequently receive news from Poland. What are your esteemed parents 
doing? And your sisters? Dziewanowski, who was here last year, 
gave us a few details about them. 

Are we not to have the satisfaction of seeing Mr Fryderyk here? I 
don't know how long I shall be staying here; I think, however, that 
before leaving this part of the world I shall first visit Paris to see certain 
connections of mine there. Forgive me, dear Mr Fryderyk, if I ask you 
to obtain for me a collection of the autographs of the famous people 
among whom (quite rightly!) you live: Poles, Frenchmen, Germans, 
etc. it's all the same to me even a bearded Jew, such as we see at 
home, provided that he is worthy of it. I shall be immensely grateful: 
and above all reserve your friendship for us : ours has long been given 
to you.

90. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

[Warsaw, n April 1835] 
My dear boy, 

I am writing briefly without waiting for your letter which surely 
cannot be long in coming* Things are just the same with us, i.e. we are 
in fairly good health. I am glad you got through the Carnival time 
without being unwell Do take care of your health, my boy; let nothing 
prevent you from having your proper amount of sleep. I am convinced 
that there is no other kind of excess to harm you, for you do not 
permit yourself any I know you well enough. Your good friend 
[Matuszynski] is quite right to keep you at home as much as possible 
and you are wise not to become overburdened with lessons, but rather 
to cultivate your genius by new compositions which will make your 
style more widely known and cause you to stand out from other com- 
posers. You still haven't mentioned whether you have finished your 
third concerto or whether you are publishing the first one [F minor]. 
I feel the ktter cannot fail to be successful. Owing, I think, to certain 
intrigues, the dedication was not given to the first person intended, so 
whom are you keeping it for? It surprises me that so far you have not 
had a chance to associate the fruit with its tree [i,e. dedicate the con- 
certo to someone who was concerned in its conception] : there must be 
some living obstacle in the way. Can't you overcome it? Although you 
attach little importance to it, such a thing always calls attention to a 
publication. 

So Kalkbrenner is going to Vienna: I am glad he knows that you 
have connections there. Some German papers have announced that he 
might come here if so I shall be delighted to see him and perhaps even 
to hear him. I have neither seen nor heard M. Lafont [a French violinist], 
for I haven't set foot in the theatre since your last concert: I am not 
much interested in what goes on there. The description of the surprise- 
party [organised by Liszt and others] which was forced on you made me 
think that it must have cost you the value of several days* work; but 
when people drop in on you you have to take it in good part, which I 
am pleased you did, for the news gets around, and if one is in the fore- 
front of fashion in one respect one must at all costs keep up appearances 
in others. 

By the way, we still have the plan of travelling to a watering-place, 
but my work and Louise's confinement will not allow us to leave 
before the last days of July, supposing I get a permit. What are you 
thinking of doing until then? Where are you likely to be going? 

Ch. 

126 



The plan mentioned in the above letter was carried out in the summer of 
1835* Nicholas Chopin and his wife arrived in Carlsbad on 15 August to 
find to their joyful surprise that Fryderyk had travelled post-Jiaste from France 
to get there before them! They all joined in a letter to the rest of the family 
in Warsaw. 

91. CHOHN TO LOUISE AND KALASANTY JENDRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

Dear children, Carl$bad - l6 AugUSt [l835 ^ 

Here is the first letter written by Papa and myself that you have 
ever received. Our joy is indescribable. We never stop embracing each 
other what more can we do? What a pity we can't all be together 
here! How good God is to us ! I can't write sensibly it's better not to 
try to think of anything today only enjoy the happiness that is 
offered to us. That's all I can do today. I find rny parents exactly the 
same, only a trifle older. We go for walks arm in arm with darling 
Mamma; we talk about you all, we imitate the tantrums of my little 
nephews, and we tell how much we have been thinking about each 
other. We all eat and drink together; we exchange tender caresses and 
then shout at each other, I am at the summit of my happiness. I see 
again those same little mannerisms and habits which I grew up with, 
and that hand which it is so long since I kissed. 

Well, now, children, let me embrace you! Forgive me I can't 
collect my thoughts or write about anything but our happiness at 
being together at this moment. To think that what I had so long 
only dared hope for has today come true, and happiness, happiness, 
happiness is here! In my joy I smother you with kisses, you and rny 
brother-in-law niy dearest friends in this world. 

Cfa. 

After three weeks 9 stay in Carlsbad Chopin accompanied his parents on 
their way home as far as Tetschen, near the Polish frontier, where they 
visited the Thun-Hohenstein family. It was here that on jtj September he 
wrote out his fast version of the A fiat Waltz, Op. 34. His return journey 
was to take him to Dresden and Leipzig, In Dresden he met the Wodzinski 
family again and was at once taken by the charm and beauty of Maria who 
was now sixteen. 

92. MARIA WODZI&SKA TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

[Dresden. September 1835] 

Although you like neither receiving nor writing letters I wish to 
take advantage of Mr Cichowski's departure to send you news of 

127 



Dresden from the time you left. I shall perhaps bore you but not by 
my playing. On Saturday, after you left us, we all walked sadly about 
the drawing-room where you had been with us a few minutes earlier. 
Our eyes were filled with tears. My father soon came home and was 
upset at not having been able to say good-bye. My mother kept on 
reminding us mournfully of some little characteristic of "her fourth 
son, Fryderyk" as she calls you. Felix looked quite dejected; Casimir 
tried to make his usual jokes but they didn't come off, for he was acting 
the comedian half-laughing and half-crying. Papa made fun of us and 
laughed too, but it was only to prevent himself from crying. At eleven 
the singing-master came ; the lesson went very badly for we couldn't 
sing. You were the sole topic of conversation. Felix repeatedly asked me 
to play that Waltz 1 (the last thing you played and gave to us). They 
enjoyed listening as I enjoyed playing, for it brought back the brother 
who had just left. 

I took the waltz to be bound. The German bookbinder stared when he 
was shown just one sheet. (He didn't know, this German, who had 
written it !) No one could touch anything at dinner: we kept on looking 
at your usual place at table and then at "Fryderyk's corner" the little 
chair is still in its pkce and will probably stay there as long as we are 
in this house. 

In the evening we were taken to my aunt's so as to avoid the gloom of 
the first evening when you were not there. Father came along later, 
saying that he too could not possibly stay in the house that day. It did 
us good to leave a place which reminded us too keenly of what we had 
lost. Mamma can speak of nothing but you and Antoni. When my 
brother reaches Paris do spare a little time for him, I beg you. If you 
but knew what a devoted friend you have in him a friend such as is 
hard to find. Antoni is thoroughly good-natured, in fact too much so, 
for he is always being taken in by others: besides he is careless and 
never gives a thought to anything, or at least only very rarely. We 
have so often tried to talk some sense into him, but I think that if you 
gave him some advice he would take it, coming from you. I know how 
fond of you he is and I am sure that whatever you say will be as gospel 
to him. Please, please don't be indifferent to him. He will be so glad, 
now he's away from home, to find a friendly heart to understand him. 
I will say no more. You know Antoni well and you will come to know 
him still better. Later on you will say that he makes himself out to be 
worse than he really is. If ever it happens by a miracle that you feel like 

1 La Valse de T Adieu, Op. 69, No. I, the manuscript of which has the inscription: 
"For Mile Maria. Dresden. Sept. 1835". 

128 



writing, "How do you do? I am sorry I can't write more/* add, I beg 
you, yes or no to the following question; Was it you who composed 
the song "If I were the sun shining in the sky'* [known in English as 
"The Maiden's Wish"]? I received it a few days ago and I haven't 
the heart to sing it, fearing that if it is really yours it may have been 
quite altered, as for example "The Warrior" was. 1 

We never cease to regret that you are not called Chopinski, or at 
least that there isn't some other indication that you are Polish. If there 
were, the French could not question our pride in being your com- 
patriots. But I am boring you. Your time is so valuable that it is really 
a crime to make you waste it in reading my scribblings. Anyhow I'm 
sure you won't trouble to read it ail. Little Maria's letter will be thrown 
aside when you've read a few lines so I need not blame myself for 
wasting your time. 

Adieu (quite simply). A childhood friend does not require high- 
flown phrases. Mamma sends you a tender embrace. My father and 
brothers embrace you most cordially (no, that's not enough) most 
I don't quite know what to say. Josephine asks me to convey her 
regrets at not having been able to say good-bye. I asked little Teresa 
"What shall I tell Fryderyk from you?" and she answered, "Give him 
a nice kiss and all my compliments." Adieu. 

Maria 

P.S. Before you got into the coach you left the pencil belonging to 
your note-book on the piano. You must have missed it badly on your 
journey and we are keeping it here, with great respect as if it were a 
relic. Thanks once more for the little watering-can. Little Miss 
Wozinska [sic] came to see me this morning having made a great 
discovery. "Sister Maria," she said, "I know how to say Chopin in 
Polish: Chopena." 

93. FELIX MENDELSSOHN TO ras SISTER FANNY HENSEL 

Leipzig. 6 October 1835 

. . . On the same day, after I had accompanied the Hensds to Delitsch, 
Chopin arrived: he intended to stay only one day and so we spent it 
together making music. I cannot deny, dear Fanny, that I have ktely 
found that you did not do him full justice in the opinion you expressed; 
perhaps he was not in the right mood for playing when you heard him, 
as may quite often be the case with him. But on me his playing has 
again made an enchanting impression and I am convinced that if you 

1 These two songs had already been published anonymously about 1830. 

I2p 



and father had heard some of his better pieces played as he played them 
to me you would both say the same. 

There is something fundamentally personal and at the same time so 
very masterly hi his playing that he may be called a really perfect 
virtuoso; and as every kind of perfection is welcome and gratifying 
to me, this day was a most agreeable one, although completely different 
from the previous ones which I have spent with the Hensels. It was a 
joy to be once again with a proper musician, not one of those half- 
virtuosos and half-classics who would like to combine "the honours of 
virtue and the pleasures of vice" in music, but with someone who has 
his own perfectly defined manner. And if that manner is far removed 
from mine I can get on with it splendidly but not with those half-and- 
half people. 

It really was a sight to be seen on Sunday evening when I had to pky 
him my oratorio [St Paul] while inquisitive Leipzigers crowded on 
tiptoe into the room so as to be able to say they had seen Chopin. 
Between the first and second parts of the oratorio he dashed off his new 
studies and latest concerto to the astonishment of the Leipzigers, and 
then I went on with my St Paul just as if an Iroquois and a Kaffir had 
met and conversed. 

He has also a quite charming Nocturne I have remembered some 
part of it by heart to play to Paul who will love to hear it. Thus the day 
went happily by and he gave me a serious promise to come back during 
the winter if I will compose a new symphony and perform it in his 
honour. We took an oath on it before three witnesses and now we 
shall see whether we both can keep our word. Before he left, my copies 
of Handel's works arrived and Chopin showed a quite childish joy 
over them. They are really so beautiful that I myself cannot sufficiently 
rejoice in them. 

Nicholas Chopin and his daughters wrote again to Fryderyk in December 
3 #35, but the only details worth noting here are the references to his intention 
of returning to Dresden in the following summer. The father observes: 
"Your stay in Dresden seems to have been very pleasant since you propose to 
return there next year;' 9 but Louise is more explicit: 

"When I told Mme Linde that you may be going to Dresden again next year 
she answered, *Yes, if certain persons are there. Oh, Mark has conquered his 
poor little heart, but you and I, Madame, who know him . . .* " 

It so happened that Chopin fell ill at Heidelberg on his return journey from 
Dresden in 1835. Not wishing to alarm his parents, he kept silent on the 
matter, but later in the year they heard of it in a roundabout way, and since 

130 



he left them for a long period without news during the autumn they assumed 
that he had been gravely ill in Paris. 

94. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDEHYK IN PAWS 

Warsaw. 9 January 1836 
My dear boy, my good friend ! 

Never was a letter more longed for or more impatiently awaited 
than the one we have just received. Here is the reason: for more than 
three weeks the rumour had been going round that you were danger- 
ously ill; everyone was inquiring whether we had any news and we 
didn't know what to make of it. Finally the dreadful news [that their 
son was dying] came to our knowledge, just before Christmas, and 
you can t imagine what a state we were in, nor our mortal anxiety. 
Mme Zawadzka, who had lately had letters from Paris, tried to re- 
assure us by quoting from another letter in which it was stated that you 
had given a musical party for Mr Lipinski [a Polish violinist] and that 
Mme Mickiewicz had been present. Good Mme Fontana carne to tell 
us that her son [Julian] had written to her on 12 December and had 
often mentioned you in his letters. All that scarcely sufficed to calm us 
until last Monday when your real friend, ZieMski, read in the 
Journal des Debats of 24 December that you were going to improvise 
at a soiree at No. 3 rue de la Chaussee d'Antin, and he rushed to tell 
Louise and her husband. Luckily I happened to be there and we ran 
to Lourse's cafe where I read the newspaper article for myself. That 
was enough to reassure most people, but your family still had their 
doubts and unfortunately the usual time for your letter was beginning 
to go by, which made our anxiety all the more unbearable. Anyhow 
our fears are now at an end and all is forgotten. It's a pity that in your 
previous letter you did not mention having been ill [in Heidelberg], 
otherwise we could have assigned all these rumours to an earlier date. 
What a blessing that Providence allowed you to fall in with two 
guardian angels [the Diller kdies at Heidelberg] who lavished their 
care on you and still, as you say, often inquire about your health. I 
know you don't like writing but, my dear boy, I am sure they would 
like you to send them a few lines. I gather from your letter that you 
are as busy with your compositions as with your lessons, but I am sorry 
to see you giving yourself very little rest. These long social evenings, 
although they are, as you say, indispensable, can only do you harm, 
especially at a time of the year when it's so easy to catch cold. I know 
that these great parties enable you to make worth-while acquaintances, 
but what about your health? I notice that Dresden has become a very 

P 131 



interesting and attractive spot for you. At your age one is not always in 
complete control of oneself and one may be subjected to impressions 
that are not easily effaced. But what should stop you next spring from 
making a little tour and "smelling new smells"? You have only to save 
as hard as you can, for I might easily send you a travelling-companion 
[Chopin's mother] to Berlin or Dresden; but it would be at your 
expense. I have mentioned this plan to your loving mother. During the 
holidays Barcinski [Isabella's husband] and I could go and bring her 
back home. What do you think of the idea? You'll say it's a castle in 
the air. Never mind, we are building it. I think that, if it can be done, 
no one would look after you better than your mother. The prospect 
of this brief separation will become tolerable to me when I consider 
the cause of it. But you need health and money, so you'd better be 
thinking of both that is the only way to see Dresden again with all it 
contains to interest you if you can't blot it out of your mind. 

Mr Wodzinski was here before the holidays: he came to see us, but 
without his sons. By his eagerness in asking for news of you we later 
saw that he had been inquiring about the rumour that was going round, 
and on the pretext of waiting for the next post, to see whether you 
would mention Antoni, he postponed his departure for two days. I 
am glad to learn that you are pleased with Antoni and that you find 
him quite decent the thoughtlessness and lack of steadiness which I 
saw in him used to frighten me and I am glad to be reassured. 

You see now, my dear boy, what trouble a delay of nearly a fortnight 
in writing has caused. I know that you don't always have time to 
write. Then get Johnny to do so and you need only add a few words. 
The longer your letters are the better we like them, but we shall never- 
theless be pleased to have whatever you write. . . . 

[After this the father goes on to ask a few more questions and then 
writes a long postscript to Johnny, begging him to keep an eye on 
Fryderyk, to make him wear strong shoes, go to bed early and so forth, 
Johnny must do all this even at the risk of having a row with his friend !] 

Among Chopin s fashionable Parisian friends was the Marquis Astolphe 
de Custine (1790-1857), a traveller and dabbler in literature and the arts, 
best known for his La Russie en 1839, a very successful travel book. He had 
a country place at Saint-Gratien where he received his friends (including some 
doubtful characters whose tastes corresponded to his own). He set out to 
cultivate Chopin s friendship and his numerous letters bear the stamp of an 
over-sentimentalised personality. 

132 



95. MARQUIS DE CUSTINE TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Paris. 1 8 March [probably 1836] 

You arc fond of engravings and I am sending you, Monsieur, the 
most attractive I could find. As soon as I have a free moment I shall 
come to see you and put forward a scheme of mine for the time when 
you will come, as I hope, to stay at Saint-Gratien, We should like to 
spend some of the days when you will be here in visiting the environs 
of Paris: Ermenonville, Mortefontaine, Chantilly and we so hope the 
trip will be as beneficial to you as it will be pleasant to us if it is made 
in your company. 

For myself, I should wish the idea might please you as much as it 
does me. While hoping for fine weather, I renew my thanks for the 
pleasure you have given me and assure you of my highest esteem. 

A. de Custine 

96. F. J. FETIS TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Brussels. 25 March 1836 
Dear Mr Chopin, 

When I had the pleasure of seeing you on my last visit to Paris I 
expressed the desire of having some particulars concerning yourself for 
the biographical article which I am devoting to you in my Historical 
Dictionary of Musicians. This information is very necessary since at 
this moment the page on which your name is to appear is with the 
printer. So may I ask you to be good enough to fill up the enclosed 
form containing various questions which I should like you to answer. 
Please send the form back by return of post if possible. 

Yours sincerely, 

F<tis 

Rue Bodenbrouk No. 15 
Brussels. 

Chopin sent the form back on 27 March. For the answer to "Date of Birth* 9 
he gave once again: i March 1810. 

97. FELIX MENDELSSOHN TO CHOPIN IN PAKIS 

Leipzig. 28 March 1836 
My dear friend, 

This is to be regarded as an invitation to you without my having 
composed the symphony [see letter 93] or knitted the stockings. To tell 
the truth I have done neither only out of consideration for you and 
so as not to force you to come to Leipzig in the middle of winter, for 

133 



I am sure you would have come at once if I had done the knitting or 
composing we agreed upon. 

But I am writing to ask whether you will have time to come to the 
Lower Rhineland musical festival which is to be held at Diisseldorf at 
Whitsun. Some of our local musicians who will he present have asked 
me to write and invite you; they think there is a chance you might 
accept. Although I am doubtful myself, fearing that the festival you 
have already heard [in 1834] may inspire you with little desire to sacri- 
fice your time and make such a long journey, I do not hesitate to write, 
at the risk of being laughed at, for the mere possibility of seeing you 
again and spending a few days with you is attractive to me. 

Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with chorus, will be given as well 
as a Psalm by Handel, a Beethoven overture (hitherto unknown the 
third he wrote for Fidelio], my St Paulof which you heard a few 
fragments when you were here and lots of other things which will 
interest you. Do come; it would be a great joy for me, and if you can't, 
don't laugh at my invitation which I would not have risked sending 
but for the earnest wish of those who will be there and who would like 
to see and hear more of you than they did on your last visit. 

Forgive the French of this letter; without flattering myself I find it 
awful. I haven't spoken a word since you last saw me. I should be very 
glad if you could send me a few lines in reply, and although I know you 
never answer letters I beg you to do so this once. You might take the 
opportunity of telling me what you are composing, what Hiller is 
doing, whether you have news of Liszt, etc. Give them my regards and 
don't forget ine, an inhabitant of the marshes (as you must think of 
Germany). Adieu. Forgive the bad style of yours 

R Mendelssohn-Bartholdy 

Of course, if you require a formal invitation, I could send you a 
letter from the Mayor, signed by all the Committee or as many other 
signatories as you like. But I don't think it would produce much effect 
on you. 

[Robert Schumann added a postscript in German:] A thousand greet- 
ings and good wishes, and also an urgent request do come to the 
Rhineland if you possibly can. With love and respect. 

Robert Schumann 

Mendelssohn asks you to let him have your decision in a brief note or 
verbally through Panof ka. We are absolutely convinced you wiU come. 

But they were wrong. Chopin had his eyes fixed on other things in Germany. 
A long rambling letter from his family in Warsaw (9 May 1836] informed him 

134 



that "Mme Wodzinska is going to a watering-place [Marienbad] Jor the 
summer" and his father asked him, ""Let us know what you plan to do this 
summer. Will you be staying in Paris?" 

Liszt was living with Marie d'Agoult in Switzerland. The reports of the 
fabulous success in Paris of his rival Thalberg had reached him and he could 
not remain inactive in Geneva while his position was being threatened. 

98. MME ANNA LISZT TO CHOPIN IN PAWS 

Paris. 12 May 1836 
Dear Mr Chopin, 

I received this morning a letter from my son announcing his arrival 
for the I4th and asking me to inform you. He will be here for four or 
five days at most and is anxious to see his best friends of whom you are 
the first. Adieu. I send you a fond embrace. 

A. Liszt 

99. LISZT TO COUNTESS D'AGOULT IN GENEVA 

Paris, 14 May 1836 

. . . My mother finds me depressed and thoughtful I cannot sit still, 
even at table, and must walk up and down the room. [The problem of 
Thalberg !] Chopin, whom I saw this morning, loves me tenderly and 
exclusively. I was extremely delighted to hear him speak as he did. He 
openly criticises Thalberg to a certain extent and above all refuses to 
admit the slightest possibility of a comparison between us. ... 

In spite of these fine words of Liszt one must not be misled into thinking 
tliat there was any romantic friendship between him and Chopin. The 
cordiality of the earliest days had quickly evaporated owing to inborn differ- 
ences in character and particularly because of some unpardonable indiscretions 
on Liszt's side. Chopin s other friends were aware of the situation, as appears 
from this letter ofHiller: 

100. FERDINAND HIIXER TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Frankfort. 30 May 1836 
My dear friend, 

Although I am convinced you will not answer this letter any more 
than you have the others which I have written, I simply must have a 
little chat with you. Yesterday I heard about you from Wodzinski, 
whom I met by pure chance on my arrival from Diisseldorf and whom 
I endeavoured to entertain a little. He left yesterday for Weimar, etc. 
Among other things he told me he had seen Liszt at your place if it 

135 



wasn't a joke I would ask you to write to me about it. It is not yet nine 
weeks since I left Paris and during that time I have seen so many 
people and places that it seems like a dream. At Weimar I saw 
Hummel; at Diisseldorf, Mendelssohn. If you would like to have 
details of the Festival, go and ask Leo [Chopin's banker], to whom I 
have written a long letter about it. All in all, it went splendidly. What 
does please me is that Felix [Mendelssohn] will be coming here before 
long and will stay six or eight weeks. There will be bloody battles 
between us but, as we shall really understand each other, peace will 
soon be made. May we still hope to see you this summer? It would be 
delightful. We have a charming apartment, my piano has arrived safe 
and sound, and although there are plenty of things I could do with, I 
think I shall have a pretty comfortable summer. . . . 

I haven't opened my piano three times since I left Paris. Good-bye, 
dear friend. Go and see the Cherubinis and give them our kind regards ; 
tell them we enjoyed their letter and that I shall be writing soon. My 
compliments to M. and Mme d'Este 1 and greetings to Matuchinsky [sic] 
and Baron Stockhausen, Alkan, etc. Bond regards to the Plater family. 
Remember me to those who may forget me and give my thanks to those 
who do remember. Good-bye, dear boy; try to be happy and satisfied. 

Believe me, yours ever sincerely, 
Ferdinand Hiller 

All my own and my mother's compliments to the good Eichtals. 
By the way, I had a letter from Dessauer [a Czech composer] which 
does not tell me much adieu. I need hardly tell you that my mother 
still adores you and wears the ring you gave her as if she was engaged 
to you ! 

In July 1836 Chopin carried out his plan of joining Mme Wodzinska and 
Maria at Marienbad, and when the family returned to Dresden at the end of 
August he accompanied them. He was deeply in love with Maria and on 
p September at "the twilight hour" he proposed to her and was accepted. He 
left for Paris two days later 9 calling at Leipzig on his way in response to the 
following note from Schumann: 

101. ROBERT SCHUMANN TO CHOPIN IN DRESDEN 
Dear and Honoured Sir, ^ Leipzig. 8 September 1836 

You need only write the one word "Yes" or get someone to write 
it for you in answer to the question whether, as I have just heard, you

the piece published after his death as Fantaisie-lmprompttt, Op. 66. 

136 



are in Dresden or not. Being on the point of returning home via 
Dresden, I would never forgive myself if I had been anywhere near 
Your Magnificence without giving a sign of my love and respect. I 
beg you most longingly to say Yes and to give me your address. 

Your devoted 

Robert Schumann 
Mendelssohn will be back here in a week's time. 

102. ROBERT SCHUMANN TO HHNRICH DORN [a conductor] IN RIGA 

Leipzig. 14 September 1836 
My dear Sir, 

Just as I received your letter two days ago and was on the point of 
answering it, who do you think walked in? Chopin! That was a 
splendid treat. We spent a wonderful day together, one in whose 
honour I took a day off yesterday. He gave me a new Ballade in G 
minor. It seems to me his most inspired work (if not the one most 
filled with genius), and I told him I liked it best of all his works. 1 After 
a long pause for reflection he said with great emphasis, 'Tm glad you 
think so ; it is my favourite too.' ' Besides that he played a whole number 
of new studies, Nocturnes and Mazurkas everything incomparably. 
It fills you with emotion merely to see him sitting at the piano. You 
would love him. However Clara [Wieck] is a greater virtuoso and 
plays his compositions with even more significance than he does 
himself. Try to conceive such perfection, a mastery which seems 
unconscious of itself . . . ! 

Your sincere friend, 
R. Schumann

Dresden, 14 September 1836 
Dear Fryderyk, 

As we agreed, I am sending you my letter for Madame Nakwaska; 
I would have sent it two days ago if I had not had to have a tooth out 
after you left, which caused me great suffering. I cannot get over my 
regret at your having to leave on Saturday. On that day I was so unwell 
that I could not give enough attention to "the twilight hour" [his 
engagement to Maria] and we did not discuss it sufficiently. Had you 
stayed, we could have gone into it more fully the next day. As Mme 

1 This remark of Schumann's has been consistently misused by writers who have taken 
Schumann's words of 1836 to apply to Chopin's entire output! Schumann had still to 
hear Opp. 24-6s>

Girardin says somewhere, "Tomorrow is always the day that matters 
it is still to come/* 

Don't imagine that I should think of taking back what I said. No, 
but we should have carefully decided on the line to be followed. Until 
all is settled I shall merely ask you to say nothing : look after your health 
for everything depends on that. Casimir arrived on Sunday. I find him 
quite altered from what he was when he left. If the air in Bohemia is 
opium-drenched, then the air where he has come from [Poland] must 
be laden with Digitalis. A nice prospect for Maria! Who knows what 
she will be like in a year's time . . .? 

I shall try to stay here another two weeks from today, and by the 
1 5th [of October] I shall be back in Warsaw for the wedding [of her 
son Felix]. I shall be seeing your parents and sisters and I shall teU them 
you are well and cheerful, but I shan't mention "the twilight hour". 
Nevertheless rest assured that I am on your side; we must take these 
precautions if my wishes are to be fulfilled. We must allow time for 
the feelings of both parties to be tested. Adieu. Go to bed at eleven and 
drink only eau~de-gomme [an aromatic syrup drink], Mr Matuszynski 
will agree with me and will send you, like Skorzewski, to Marienbad 
or Franzensbad. Keep well, dear Fryderyk. I give you my solemn 
blessing like a loving mother. 

T.W. 

Maria is sending you some slippers by Mr Germany. They are rather 
large but, I might add, that is to allow you to wear woollen stockings. 
Dr Paris recommended it and I take it that you will obey since you 
gave your promise. One last word: remember this is a testing-time. 

[Both Casimir and Maria added postscripts 1 to their mother's letter. 
Casimir relates Warsaw gossip; Maria writes as follows:] 

We are inconsolable over your departure; the three days which have 
passed since then have seemed like ages. Are you like us? Do you miss 
your friends a little? Yes, you do I can answer for it and I'm sure I am 
right; at least I need to believe so. I persuade myself that this YES is 
what you would say. Am I not right? 

I am sending you the slippers which are now ready. I am upset about 
their being too big, although I took one of your Warsaw boots, made 
by Takowski, as a pattern, carissimo maestro, but it's just like the 
Germans. Dr Paris consoles me for it by saying that they will suit you 
very well as you must wear nice warm woollen stockings in winter. 

1 These postscripts should never have been published as separate letters, thus giving a false 
picture of the girl's feelings. In a joint letter she could make nothing but non-committal 
and commonplace observations which her mother would of course read. 

138 



Mamma had a tooth out it has made her feel quite ill and today she 
has had to stay in bed. In two weeks we shall be off to Poland. I shall 
be so happy to see your parents. And your good sister Louise will she 
recognise me? Adieu, mio carisslmo maestro. Don't forget Dresden now, 
and Poland later on. Adieu, au revoir. Ah, if it could only be sooner! 

Maria 

Casimir told me that our piano at Sluzewo is so broken down that 
it can't be played on. So think about Pleyel for us. In happier days than 
these (so far as we are concerned) I hope to hear you playing that same 
piano; au revoir, au revoir, au revoir. All this gives one hope. 

104. MME TERESA WODZI&SKA TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Dresden. 2 October [1836] 
"The Twilight Hour" 
My dear Fryderyk, 

I am very grateful to you for sending me some brief news of Antoni. 
I received your letter yesterday and I confess I was waiting for nothing 
else. I am leaving tomorrow and in twelve days' time I shall be in 
Warsaw where I shall embrace your parents and sisters for you. Write 
to us as often as you can and send your letters "per Mr J. G. Adolphe" 
to Torun via Baden. I receive all my correspondence that way. 

I have been asked to write to you on behalf of Mr Byczkowsld, a 
painter, who has been ordered to leave the country. I know little of 
him except that he seems to be a worthy man and, what is most in his 
favour, he seems to be unlucky. I gather from your letter that you were 
not telling the truth when you solemnly promised to obey my orders, 
for you don't say a word about wearing woollen stockings with your 
slippers or going to bed before eleven you only say how Kunzel lied 
to Mme Nakwaska. Speaking of Kunzel, he is already back. He is 
sulking because you did not go to see the Kaskels. Moreover a number 
of people are angry with me, thanks to you, and I am losing my good 
name on your account. That's how it is in this world. Maria particularly 
asks you to wear those slippers every day and also to send her, whenever 
you have the chance, some new novelettes which will be appearing in 
great numbers about the time of the New Year. Josephine remains 
fairly calm; she is looking forward to our return. I think she will get 
on well. Oh, dear, if only I could be sure of arriving back in Poland 
when and as I would wish ! I don't know whether my business afiairs 
have been settled because, as I say, they [her friends in Dresden] are ill 
disposed towards me because of you, and Kaskel merely said, "I have 
passed on your orders." 

F* 139 



I will write to you from Warsaw; and now I must repeat: Take care 
of your health and all will be well. Give Mme Ossolinska our greetings. 
Her brother was here only one day: he is well. Mile Mallet sends her 
regards and asks about Grzymala: an unhappy love-affair! Your 
portrait is said to be such a good likeness that Maria says it will establish 
her reputation as a painter. . . . 
[Maria's postscript:] 

My best thanks for the autographs [see letter 89] and please may we 
have more? Mamma told me to write that. Now we are off to Warsaw 
as fast as we can go. I am looking forward to seeing your family soon 
and next year you yourself. Casimir had a great deal to tell us about 
Lucy [her brother Felix's bride] and, in spite of your saying that you 
disagree, he considers that she resembles me. I am greatly flattered, for 
she is said to be very pretty. Good-bye until May or June at the latest. 
I entrust to you the memory of 

Your most faithful Secretary, 
Maria 

105. CHOPIN TO MME WODZI&SKA AT SLUZEWO 

Paris, i November 1836 
Honoured and most gracious Madam! 

I am sending you a letter from Pamplona signed by Antoni. I 
employed the method recommended by Mme Diller and it seems to 
have succeeded. It seems to me that the contents of this letter were such 
as to cause it to be signed quickly, and thanks to Vincent Skarzynski's 
postscript you can see that Antoni is just the same he is popular, they 
are kind to him and are looking after him, and he is as well as is to be 
expected and is not all alone. 

I have eagerly awaited this letter. In the meanwhile time has passed 
for your family in celebrations and ceremonies: Felix's wedding is 
surely over, with joy and feasting. Of course there were dancing and 
toasts, besides a couple of days of paying and receiving visits. Why 
are there no mirrors which show one everything that is going on, or 
magic rings which transport one to wherever one's thoughts incline? 
I can hear my parents continually asking questions about me. 

... I am so glad that this letter of mine today is really only written 
on the cover of Antoni's, otherwise it would convey little by itself, at 
least in so far as the amount of news is concerned. I simply can't think 
of any news to write about. But those autographs of celebrities and of 
Antoni and Mme Anatole come to my rescue I won't send any others 
to my Secretary as I am afraid of making this letter too bulky. I will 

140 



send them together with some music at the beginning of the winter. 
Mme Zofia [Ossolinska] still remembers you affectionately and really 
enjoys talking about you. Cichowski, my present neighbour, often asks 
after you. 

What ! Twelve o'clock already ! At twelve I have a lesson to give 
and so on until six o'clock Then to dinner, and after dinner social visits 
until eleven. As I respect you, I assure you I am not lying : I do remember 
the slippers and when I play I think of "the twilight hour". Please send 
me a line to say whether you receive Antoni's letter. 

Yours devotedly, 
E Chopin 

Please give my best respects to Mr Wodzinski and tell my Secretary 
that I am inexpressibly gkd that she did not forget to write. I expect 
she will not forget either that she is not on terms with Heidlerf?]. As 
for Felix, he is surely not concerned at this moment with asking to be 
remembered to anyone at all ! I embrace Casimir ; and will Mile Maria 
please explain to Teresa (as well as saying that I kiss her little hands) that 
the "gentle young man" [himself ] thinks sadly of her and whenever he 
sees a little child he cries [in baby language] "No, not you, not you. I 
want little Teresa who is so sweet.'* 

Good health to all at Sluzewo and to all my friends in the neighbour- 
hood and in Dresden. . . . 

106. To JOSEPH BRZOWSEI IN PARIS -_ . _ . , 

J [Pans. 13 December 1836] 

I am having a few friends here today, among them Mme Sand; 1 
moreover Liszt is to play and Nourrit 2 will sing. If it will give Mr 
Brzowski any pleasure I shall expect him this evening. 

It was now becoming painfully obvious to Chopin that the Wodzifeki 
family in Warsaw had changed their minds regarding the engagement that 
Mme Wodzitiska had so rashly consented to without consulting the men of 
the family. From the moment Maria and her mother reached Poland a marked 
cooling-off becomes evident. Months passed without Chopin receiving any news. 

107. MME TERESA WODZI^SKA TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

My good Fryderyk, Slu2eW ' * 5 ^^ ^ 7 

It is a long, long time since we received your letter, followed shortly 

afterwards by the parcel of music which I shall rather scold you than 

1 The first appearance of George Sand in Chopin's correspondence. 

2 Adolphe Nourrit, a celebrated French tenor. He committed suicide at Naples in 1839. 

141 



thank you for sending. How could you send that "Keepsake" [a hand- 
somely bound album] ! Another thing: when you wrote about the 
piano you did not state what payment was to be made. We must know 
in advance in order to get the money together. Please let us know also 
to what address in Danzig the piano is being sent, for we reckoned 
that, if Adolphe were informed from there of its arrival, I could at once 
send a cart to fetch it it's only twenty-five miles, and we could have 
the piano before the spring. Life here is very depressing: since our 
return from Warsaw we have not set foot outside the house and have 
entertained no guests. The young people, i.e. my husband, Felix and 
his wife, and Casimir, drive about and enjoy themselves for, believe 
me, there are plenty of balls, concerts and theatrical performances in 
the district. 

But we older ones, myself, Maria and Teresa, spend lonely days in 
this country-house where the clock seems to strike the hours louder 
than ever, reminding us that it is time to eat or go to bed. Without a 
piano, or pencils, books, etc., we have nothing to occupy ourselves 
with. Speaking of pencils, Teresa sends one of her drawings, with her 
best compliments. It remains for me to ask you to let me know whether 
Mr Dzierozynski is, or has not been, in Paris, and where he is now. 
He is a Warsaw lawyer. A thousand francs belonging to a poor person 
were deposited with him that is why I must express some anxiety 
about him. 

The autographs are superb and the postscript by Heine and d'Arlin- 
court charming, as also de Custine's little note. I don't know what you 
thought of my last letter I said nothing about anyone, perhaps because 
I was compelled to dispatch it sooner than I intended. It's always like 
that as soon as the woodmen come [to collect the letters] they keep 
on yelling: "Hurry up, we have three miles to go to the post/' That is 
what is happening at this moment I shan't have time to read over my 
letter to see whether I haven't said something silly. 

Mme Glinska is still in Dresden. Josephine is expecting me there 
but I don't know when I shall manage to get away. Adieu, my dear 
Fryderyk. 

Yours in sincere affection, 

T.W. 
[Maria's postscript:] 

Mamma has been scolding you so I will thank you very, very 
warmly, and when we meet I shall thank you still more. You can see 
that I am lazy about writing, for the fact that I am postponing my 
thanks until we meet frees me from the obligation to write at length 

142 



now. Mamma has described our mode of life so I have nothing fresh 
to report except that a thaw has set in an important piece of news, 
isn't it? especially important for you to know. The quiet life we lead 
here suits me and that is why I like it for the time being, of course: 
I wouldn't wish it to be Hke that always. One has to make the best of 
things when one has no other choice. I try to find things to do to pass 
the time. At the moment I'm reading Heine's Deutschland which is 
awfully interesting. But I must stop now and give you my blessing. 
I hope I do not need to reassure you of the sentiments of 

Your faithful Secretary 
Maria 

108. CHOPIN'S MOTHER QUSTYNA CHOPIN) TO FRYDERYK IN PAHIS 

[Warsaw. End of February 1837] 
Dear Fryderyk, 

The ist and 5th of March [Fryderyk's birthday and name-day] 1 are 
approaching and I am prevented from embracing you. There is 
no happiness on earth that my heart and mind would not wish 
to bless you with. So many loving thoughts fill me that I don't 
know how to begin wishing you good fortune. So I will only ask 
God to keep you in His care and pour upon you every possible 
blessing. 

Mme Wodzinska told me you had promised to keep early hours, 
which pleased me greatly, for that is what your health requires ; however 
she says you did not keep your word. Particularly at this time when the 
influenza is raging and bad nights and chills make it so easy for one to 
catch the disease! Do be on your guard, my dear child, especially 
against chills. Write often; for, believe me, whenever a month passes 
without a letter from you, each of us tries to deceive the other by finding 
explanations for your silence, and we try to reassure each other although 
in our hearts we have very different thoughts. How nice it is that the 
fortune-teller prophesies happiness to every one ! I can well believe that 
you were curious to see her, but it calls for too much courage to 
listen to her predictions. If she had foretold something unpleasant she 
might have filled you with anxiety for a certain time, notwithstanding 
the greatest efforts of your reason. Promise me, dear Fryderyk, that you 
won't see her again. I have no fresh news for you; your sisters will tell 

1 How is it possible to doubt after this that the correct date of Chopin's birth is I March 
1810? stated repeatedly by himself and his intimate friends, and now by his own mother 1 
The entry in the parish baptismal register, made seven weeks after his birih, was clearly due 
to his father's imprecision in saying how old the child was on 23 April 1810, when he was 
baptised. (See also p. xiii.) 

143 



you everything that might concern you. We are impatiently awaiting 
your next letter, dear Fryderyk. Don't worry on our account: look 
after your health that is the surest way of contributing to our happi- 
ness. I clasp you to my heart. 

Your devoted 
Mother 

Chopin had sent to Maria Wodzinska some time previously a small 
music-album covered in red leather with her name Maria in gold letters. 
Into this his sister Louise copied for her prospective sister-in-law a number of 
Fryderyk 9 s Polish songs and the Lento con gran espressione in C sharp 
minor generally knoum as a posthumous Nocturne. This album was pub- 
lished in facsimile by Kornelia Parnas in 1910 in the belief that it contained 
Chopin autographs. In fact everything, words and music, is in the hand- 
writing of Louise (confirmed by the recent discovery of several pages of 
Louise's writing}. 

109. MARIA WODZINSKA TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

[Sluzewo. 1837] 

I can only write these few words to thank you for the pretty cahier 
you sent me. I shall not say with what joy I received it words would 
not suffice. Please accept the assurance both of my sincere gratitude 
for it and of the lifelong attachment felt for you by all our family and 
particularly by your least gifted pupil and childhood friend. Adieu. 
Mamma sends you a tender kiss. Little Teresa never ceases to speak of 
her "Chopena". Adieu. Do not forget us. 

Maria 

And that was that! The last tetter Chopin was to receive from Maria 
Wodzifiska. When he realised that his hopes had come to nothing he took 
all the letters he had received from the Wodzinskis and tied them together 
with a ribbon to form a bundle on which he wrote the words Moja bieda 
[My misfortune}* But other excitements were in the air: 

110. GEORGE SAND TO LISZT IN PARIS 

Nohant [George Sand's country-house]. 28 March 1837 

. . . Come and visit us as soon as possible. Love, consideration for 
others and friendship call you to Nohant. "Love": Marie [d'Agoult] is 
rather unwell. "Consideration": Maurice and Pelletan [her son and his 
tutor] are well. "Friendship": myself is stout and well. 

Marie told me I might expect Chopin: tell him please that I ask him 

144 



to come with you, that Marie cannot live without him and that I 
admire him. 

I will write to Grzymala 1 and persuade him to come too. I would 
Hke Marie to have all her friends around her and thus be surrounded 

by love, consideration and friendship. 

G.S. 

Chopin did not accept this invitation: he was not yet quite dear of the 
Wodzinski family. 

111. CHOPIN TO MME WODZD^SKA AT SIUZEWO 

Paris. 2 April 1837 

With Mme Nakwaska's kind permission I am adding a few words 
to her letter. I am expecting news from Antoni himself. I shall send it 
to you at once, even if it is a queerer sort of letter than the one to which 
Vincent added some lines. I beg you not to worry about him. So far 
they are all still in the town. We have no details because each of those 
who wrote gave news mainly of themselves. You must certainly have 
received at Sluzewo my letter written a month ago and it will have 
pacified you as far as possible about your boy in Spain who must, must 
write me a few lines. I will not try to express in a letter my grief at 
hearing of your mother's death. I was grieved not so much for her 
sake (I did not know her) as for the sake of you and your family whom 
I do know. (Not very logical, is it?) I confess that there has come over 
me a feeling such as I experienced at Marienbad when faced with 
Mile Maria's book; I could have written nothing in it if I had sat there 
a hundred years. There are days when I am completely at a loss for 
words. Today I would rather be at Sluzewo than be writing to Sluzewo. 
I could say more than I could ever write. 

My respects to Mr Wodzinski, to Mile Maria, Casimir, Teresa and 

Felix. -* r ^ i 

Yours truly, 

F. Ch. 

112. GEORGE SAND TO COUNTESS D'AGOULT IN PARIS 

Nohant. 5 April 1837 

Tell Mickiewicz that my pen and my house are at his service and only 
too glad to be ready for him; tell Grzymala that I adore him; tell 

1 Count Wojciech [= Albert] Grzymala (1793-1870) settled in Paris after the Polish 
revolt of 1831 and became one of Chopin's closest friends. He was a businessman and a 
great amateur of the arts, being intimately acquainted with Delacroix, George Sand and 
their circle.

Chopin that I worship him, and tell all those you love that I love them 
too and that they will all be welcome if you bring them. . . .

113. CHOPIN TO ANTONI WODZII&SKJ AT SARAGOSSA (SPAIN) 

[Paris. End of May 1837] 
My dear, dear friend, 

You are wounded! far from home and here am I unable to 
send you anything. Your family can think of nothing but you. For 
God's sake let your only thought be to get well and return home. 
The papers say that the Legion you were in was completely wiped out. 
Don't join the Spanish Army. Remember you can shed your blood 
in a worthier cause. 

Titus [Woyciechowski] has written: he wants me to meet him 
somewhere in Germany. I was ill again this winter and the doctors are 
sending me to Ems. I have done nothing about it so far because I 
cannot leave Paris just now. I am writing and preparing a manuscript. 
I think of you more than you may imagine and love you as always. 

F.C. 

[In the margin] Believe me, I think of you as often as I do of Titus. 
I may go for a few days to George Sand's place but your money will 
not thereby be delayed, for I shall leave instructions with Johnny 
for those three days. 

114. MARQUIS DE CUSTINE TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

[Saint-Gratien. May 1837] 
Dear Chopin, 

Believe me when I tell you that, in spite of appearances to the 
contrary, I love you more on your own account than for myself. I will 
prove it, for I am not afraid to come troubling you again, and indeed 
it is the last time I shall try to persuade you to take my advice. 

You are ill: what is worse, your illness might become really serious. 
You have reached the limit in physical and spiritual suffering. When 
griefs of the heart turn into illness of the body we are lost; and that is 
what I wish to save you from. I am not trying to console you. I respect 
your feelings (moreover, I can only guess at them) but I wish them to 
remain feelings and not become physical sufferings. It is one's duty to 
live, when one possesses a fountain of life and poetry such as yours: 
do not waste this treasure, and don't treat Providence with contempt 
by making light of its most precious gifts. Such a crime would be 

146 



unforgivable, for God himself will not make good the time you 
deliberately waste. 

To preserve your past which holds such a promising future there 
is only one way open to you: to let yourself be treated as a sick child. 
You must be persuaded that one single thing is of consequence: your 
health; the rest will take care of itself. I am sufficiently your friend for 
you to allow me to go to the heart of the matter. Is it money that is 
keeping you in Paris? If so, I can lend you some; you can pay me later, 
but you must take three months* rest. If it is love that has failed you, 
let us see what friendship can do. Live for yourself you will have 
plenty of time later on to get rich. 

Three months' rest and sensible treatment rationally carried out will 
put a stop to your illness: but you must have this rest! Mental worry 
will pursue you wherever you find yourself alone, that is true; but 
physical rest will at length mean rest for your spirit, and your talent will 
carry you on its wings to another world that will console you for this 
one. Get away from the routine of your life in Paris: my place ofiers 
you an opportunity difficult to find elsewhere a month in the country 
with proper diet, followed by a trip to the BJbine. Ignace [his Polish 
companion] is to take my horses to Strasbourg: if this way of travelling 
is too slow for you, we shall find another. But once you reach the Rhine 
you are at Ems, and from there you can go anywhere, for Ems, properly 
understood and applied, means health. 

I have said all this before; but as a friend, I feel I must repeat it. 
You need not answer this except by coming here on Tuesday or 
Wednesday of next week to Saint-Gratien where you will be as free 
or freer than I, since you will have none of the trivial duties of master 
of the house to perform. This is the last time I shall trouble you, but 

my insistence needs no excuse, does it? A j o ,/ 

7 A. de Custine 

In order not to appear unfriendly, Chopin went somewhat unwillingly 
to Enghien and Saint-Gratien for a few days in June, but he came back to 
Paris, uncertain how he would spend the summer. The Wodzinskis still gave 
no sign, although he wrote a letter (a very colourless one!} to Mme WodziAska 
on 18 June giving her news ofAntoni and putting out a few hints: 

"The doctor orders me to Ems but I don't know where or when I shall go ... 
when you write to Antoni I expect to receive a few words as well." 

He makes only the most casual reference to Maria. In this state of uncer- 
tainty he accepted an invitation from Camille Pleyel (the piano-manufacturer) 
to accompany him to London.

115. JULIAN FONXANA TO STANISLAS KOZMIAN AT 28 SHEHRARD STREET, 

GOLDEN SQUARE, LONDON 

[Paris. July 1837] 

Dear Stanislas, 

I am writing to you on behalf of Chopin who is about to leave. 
It's almost as if I were coming too, for we are both packing and 
getting ready to go I to the Ile-de-France and he to your part of the 
world. Well, he will hand this letter to you. I am sure you will be 
glad of the opportunity of getting to know him better. ... I have 
promised him that he will find in you an agreeable companion and an 
excellent adviser in everything concerned with London. I know you 
will render him every friendly service if you can help him in any way. 
You have long known how I feel about him I need say no more. 
He is coming for a short stay a week or ten days to get a breath of 
English air. He does not wish to meet anyone, so I beg you to keep his 
visit secret, otherwise he will have all the artists after him, together 
with the leading male violinist or else that female Paganini[?]. If you 
know of a good hotel in your neighbourhood give Chopin the address. 
I'm recommending the Sablonni&e 1 to him as I can't remember any 

other names. 

Warmest regards. 

Julian 

116. CHOPIN TO JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[London. Mid-July 1837] 

My dear friend, 

Thank you for recommending me to Kozmian. I should be lost in 
London without him thank you for sending on my letters: but for 
them I should still be sighing and sighing. But may all the devils in 
hell take you for saying that the mud here seemed dry to you. Lovely, 
grey mud ! 

I will tell you later what agreeable thoughts and disagreeable 
sensations the sea gave me, and also the impression made on my nose 
by this sooty Italian sky: it can scarcely support such columns of grey 
air. But I will leave all that rill later and will only say now that I am 
having a respectable time. You can tell Johnny [who was a doctor] 
that one can have a good time here, if one stays only a short time 
and takes care. There are such tremendous things ! Huge urinals, but 
all the same nowhere to have a proper p ! As for the English women, 

1 The Sablonniere and Province Hotel was situated at the corner of Leicester Square and 
the south side of Cranbourn Street. A restaurant and bar now occupy the site. Chopin Tery 
probably stayed there: it was a good-class hotel. 



the horses, the palaces, the carriages, the wealth, the splendour, the 
space, the trees everything from soap to razors it's all extraordinary, 
all uniform, all very proper, all well-washed BUT as black as a gentle- 
man's bottom ! Let me give you a kiss on the face. 

RCh. 

Kozmian asks me to add that you will find here shopkeepers with 
names like DUPPA [dupa in Polish means "backside" !] painted up 
on their shops. What price London now! ! 

During his short stay m London Chopin remained incognito so far as the 
musical world was concerned. He played once privately at Broadwood's house 
in Bryanston Square and went to a number of opera performances. But he 
was by no means in England for the sake of his health and he was not afraid 
to spend money on seeing the sights. He visited Hampton Court, Richmond, 
Blackwall, Chichester, Brighton and Arundel He was at this last place on 
election-day (his friend, Lord Dudley Stuart, being a candidate), and sitting 
on top of the stage-coach he witnessed all the excitements of a Dickensian 
("Eatanswill") election, joining in the fun with gestures and exclamations. 

117. To MME WODZI&SKA AT SLUZEWO ~ . & . 

Pans. 14 August 1837 

. . . [He discusses Antoni's last letter] ... It will make him more 
eager to get back if you and Mile Maria would be so kind as to send 
him a few words through me; for, as you observe, he complains in 
his letter that no one writes to him from home, in spite of my keeping 
him informed of your activities whenever I myself hear from you. 

Your last letter reached me in London where I idled away all last 
month. I had thought I might go on to Germany via Holland, but I 
came back home; the season is far advanced and will doubtless end 
for me completely in my rooms here. I hope to receive from you a less 
gloomy letter than the last one. My next may be nothing more than 
a footnote to one from Antoni. Yours devotedly> 

F. Chopin 

My respects to Mr WodzinskL May I remind Mile Maria of her 
brother. ... All your acquaintances here are well and are not at all 
concerned with the cholera or depressing thoughts. Mme Zofia 
OssoMska is said to have heard from Geneva that they are expecting 
you there. 

But the Wodzifiskis were not to be drawn, and the season did in fact end 
for Chopin in his rooms in Paris.

He was to receive two more letters from Mme IVodzinska. But by the 

beginning of i$j$ his prospetis had changed and the figure of George SanJ 
was now assuming a role of the first importance. 

118, GEORGE SAND TO EUGENE DELACROIX IN PARIS 

[Paris. April 1838] 
My dear Lacroix, 

I am leaving at five tomorrow morning and I would not like to 
go without speaking of your picture Medea which is something magni- 
ficent, superb, heart-rending. You are indeed a splendid dauber. To 
help you to make up your mind to come this evening I must tell you 
that Chopin will play to a small group of us, quite informally; and it 
is at such times that he is really sublime. Come at midnight if you are 
not too sleepy, and if you meet anyone I know don't breathe a word, 
for Chopin is terrified of outsiders. Good-bye. Even if you don't come, 
remember to give me a little of your love. 

George 

119, MME TERESA WODZII^SKA TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

[Sluzewo. Spring 1838] 

Forgive me, my good Fryderyk, for interrupting your silence but 
I simply must inquire about your health. I have seen a good deal of 
your parents and sisters: they are all well. Your father has a slight 
cough. I have a request to make it is that you will try to persuade 
them to reprint Niemcewicz's Historical Songs: one can't get them for 
love or money here. You ought to set them to fresh music, with fine 
engravings, and they would sell like hot cakes, for everyone in the 
Poznan district would buy them. I am sure you will show yourself 
enthusiastic towards this plan and I hope to learn from you whether 
or not my suggestion has been accepted, and above all whether your 
health is good and you have gained weight. 

God bless you. 
T.W. 



120, GEORGE SAND TO CARLOTTA MABiiANi 1 IN PARIS 

[Nohant 23 May 1838] 
Darling, 

I received your lovely letter but I can't answer you fully just 
now because as you know in love-time the weather is changeable. 

1 Carlotta Marliani : a Frenchwoman married to an Italian refugee, Count Marliani, who 
became Spanish consul in Paris.

There's a lot of YES and NO with ifs and buts in the course of a 
and one will often say in the morning, "This is unbearable," only 
to say in the evening, "This is absolute heaven.'* So before I write 
I am waiting for my barometer to register something steady for a 
certain time at least, if not something definitely stabilised. I am not 
blaming anyone at aH 9 but that's no reason for being . . . 

What George Sand was waiting for was an to lier "declaration of 

war": the immense letter to Chopin's friend, Grzymala^ now follows 

and which deserves the closest attention for the light it throws not on 
George Sand's method of attack but on Chopin s character as by one cf 
the most experienced women of the nineteenth century. By the md of 1837 
Chopin s engagement to Maria Wodzinska was a dead and he was 

seeing a great deal of George Sand; hit scruples and hesitations lield him back. 
To overcome these George Sand puts her case to Grzymala, Chopin s most 
intimate and trusted friend in Paris. It is scarcely to be believed t)mt both of 
them could have been deceived as to Chopin s character and attitude towards 
sex-relations. Grzymala s own estimate of his friend will be found in the last 
letter in this book (No. 348}. 

121. GEORGE SAND TO WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. June 1838] 

It would never occur to me to doubt the sincerity of your advice, 
my dear friend; never allow such a fear to cross your mind. I believe 
in the gospel you preach, without knowing it fully and without going 
into it, because as soon as it can claim a believer such as yourself, it 
must be the sublimest of all gospels. Receive, then, my blessing for your 
counsels and trouble not yourself about my thoughts. Let us state the 
question clearly for the last time, since my entire future behaviour will 
depend upon your final answer on this matter; and since we were 
bound to come to it, I am vexed that I did not overcome my dislike 
of questioning you when I was in Paris. I felt that what you might tell 
me would take the gilt off my "romance". And indeed it has gone 
somewhat dull or rather is losing a lot of its colour. But what of it ! 
Your gospel becomes mine, when it ordains that one must put one's 
own happiness last, and banish it from one's mind when the happiness 
of those we love claims all our strength. Listen carefully, then, and give 
me a dear, straightforward and categorical answer. This young kdy 
[Maria Wodzinska] whom he wants or ought, or thinks he ought, to 
love, is she the right one to secure his happiness or is she likely to 
deepen his sufferings and melancholy? I am not asking whether he loves 



her or whether she returns his love, or whether he loves her more than 
me. I have a pretty good notion* judging by my own feelings, of what 
must be going on inside Mm* What I want to know is which of the 
two of us he must forget or give up, if he is to have any peace or happi- 
ness or indeed any life at all, for his nature seems too unstable and too 
frail to be able to stand up to great anguish. I don't want to play the 
part of the evil spirit. I am not the Bertram of Meyerbeer's opera 
(Robert k Diable] and I will not battle with his childhood friend if she 
is a pure and lovely Alice; had I known that there was a prior attach- 
ment in our dear boy's life and a feeling in his mind, I would never 
have bent down to breathe the scent of a flower intended for some 
other altar. He too would surely have warded off my first kiss if he had 
known that I was as good as married [to Mallefille, her lover at the 
time]. We did not deceive each other, we surrendered to the passing 
gale which carried us away for a while to another world. All the same, 
of course, we had to come back to earth when the divine flame had 
cooled and the journey through the empyrean blue had ended. We are 
like poor birds, who have wings indeed, but whose nest is on the 
ground, and while the song of angels beckons us heavenwards the cries 
of our nestlings bring us back to earth. 

For myself I refuse to give way to passion, although a very dangerous 
fire still smoulders sometimes deep in my heart. The thought of my 
children will give me strength to crush anything that might part me 
from them or from the mode of life which is best for their education, 
health and well-being, etc. . . . Hence I cannot live permanently in 
Paris on account of Maurice's illness, etc. etc. . . . Besides, there is a 
noble creature [Mallefille], perfect in respect of love and honour, whom 
I shall never give up because he is the only man who, having been 
at my side for nearly a year, has not intentionally caused me a minute's 
pain, no, not a single minute. He is, moreover, the only man who has 
surrendered to me completely and absolutely, without regret for the 
past or reservations for the future. And then his nature is so good and 
kindly that I could in time bring him to understand everything and 
know everything [about her past]. He is like a piece of soft wax on 
which I have placed my seal and when I like I shall be able, with a little 
care and patience, to change the impress. But today that is out of the 
question and his happiness is sacred to me. So much for myself: pledged 
as I am and bound up fairly closely for some years I cannot wish that 
our dear boy should for his part break the bonds which restrain him. 
Were he to come and place his life in my hands I should be greatly 
alaf med, for since I am responsible for another's happiness I could not 

152 



take the place of someone he might have left for me. I feel that our love 
can only last In conditions such as those In which It was born, that is, 
that when from time to time a favourable breeze wafts us towards each 
other we should take a trip to the stars and then separate for the return 
to earth, for we are the children of Mother Earth and it Is not God's 
will that we should follow our earthly pilgimage side by side. Heaven 
Is where we meet, and the fleeting moments we shall spend there will 
be so divine that they will equal a whole life spent In this vale of tears. 

So my duty Is fully mapped out for me. But I can, without for- 
swearing myself, perform it in two distinct ways: the first would be 
to keep as far as possible from Chopin, to avoid trying to occupy his 
thoughts and never to find myself alone with him; the second would 
be to do the opposite and come as close as possible to Mm without 
causing MallefiUe any misgivings. I could slip into Ms thoughts when 
he is at peace with the world, I could from time to time permit a chaste 
embrace whenever it pleased the wind of Heaven to lift us up and carry 
us to the skies. I shall adopt the first of these methods if the young lady 
Is marked out to bring him happiness true and pure, to fulfil Ms every 
need, to order and tranquillise Ms Hfe; if, in a word, she and only she 
Is the one to ensure his happiness, while I could only be an obstacle to 
it. 

If his spirit, which is excessively, perhaps crazily or perhaps wisely, 
scrupulous, will not allow itself to love two different beings in two 
different ways; if the one week that I may spend with him during each 
season is likely to prevent Ms being happy at home for the rest of the 
year then, yes, in that case I swear that I will do my best to make Mm 
forget me. I shall adopt the second method if you tell me one of two 
things: either that his domestic happiness can and must be achieved by 
means of a few hours of chaste passion and gentle poetry; or that 
happiness as a family man is out of the question for him and that 
marriage or any similar union would be the graveyard of tMs artist- 
soul, and that he must be kept from it at all costs and even be helped 
to overcome his religious scruples. Such is, more or less is, in fact 
the result of my conjectures. It will be for you to teU me if I am wrong; 
I believe the young kdy to be charming and worthy of all love and 
respect, because a man such as he can only love what is pure and lovely. 
But I think that you dread marriage for him and the bonds of everyday 
life, real life, business matters, domestic cares, everything in fact wMch 
seems remote from Ms nature and contrary to the inspirations of Ms 
muse. I should dread it for Mm also ; but I can make no pronouncement 
and can affirm nothing in the matter because in many respects I have no 

153 



knowledge of him. I have seen only that side of his nature which Is 
lighted up by the sun. You must therefore give me some precise in- 
formation on these points. I simply must know exactly how he stands 
so that I can determine my attitude. Folio wing my own preferences, 
I had thought out our romance along the following lines : that I should 
remain in complete ignorance of his positive life, as he should of mine; 
that he should keep to his own ideas on religion, fashionable society, 
poetry and art, without my ever having to call them into question and 
reciprocally; but that, wherever and on whatever occasion in our lives 
we happened to meet, our souls should be at the peak of their goodness 
and happiness. For I am convinced that one is a better human being 
when one loves with sublime emotion; and so far from committing 
any crime one rather draws near to God, the source and centre of this 
love. These are, perhaps, the things which you ought to try in the last 
resort to make Mm understand, my friend, and you could perhaps 
set his mind at rest without coming into conflict with his ideas of duty, 
devotion and religious sacrifice. What I should most dread and what 
would distress me most, what would make me resolve to be dead far 
him> would be to see myself become a source of terror and remorse 
in his soul. No; unless this vision of another woman is to be the ruin 
of him, quite apart from myself, I cannot begin to fight against the 
image and memory of another. I have too much respect for the notion 
of property to do it, or rather it is the only form of property that I 
respect. I have no wish to steal anyone from anyone, unless it be 
prisoners from their gaolers, victims from their executioners, Poland 
from Russia. Consequently you must tell me whether it is some 
Russia whose memory haunts our boy; in that case I shall pray Heaven 
to grant me all the allurements ofArtnide to save him from surrendering. 
But if it is a Poland let him go on. Nothing is so precious as a father- 
land, and a man who has one already must not make unto himself a 
new one. In that case I shall represent for him an Italy which one visits 
and enjoys on spring days but where one cannot remain permanently, 
because there is more sunshine than beds and tables, and the comfortable 
things in life are to be found elsewhere. Poor Italy! A knd that one 
dreams of, longs for or regrets; but where no one can remain, since 
she herself is unhappy and cannot impart a happiness she does not 
possess. 

There is one last supposition that it is right for me to mention. It 
may be that he no longer loves this childhood frimd at all and may even 
feel a real repugnance to forming a lasting bond. But his feeling of 
obligation, of family honour or such-like may command him to sacri- 

154 



fice himself without question. If such be the case, you* my good friend, 
must be his guardian angel; I can scarcely interfere, but you must. 
Save him from the too relentless claims of conscience, save him from 
his own virtue, prevent him at all costs from sacrificing himself, for in 
such matters (it is all the same whether we are speaking of marriage or of 
one of those liaisons which, without having the public character of 
marriage, have the same binding power and last as long), in such 
matters, I repeat, the sacrifice of the partner who gives up his future 
is out of aU proportion to what he may have received in the past. 
The past is something conceivable and finite; the future is indefinite, 
because unknown. Whoever, in return for a certain finite amount of 
devotion, calls for the devotion of another's whole future life is asking 
something wicked; and if he upon whom the call is made finds difficulty 
in defending his own rights, while paying due regard to generosity and 
fairness, it must fall to friendship to save him and to become the sole 
judge of his rights and duties. Be firm over this, and be assured that I 
who loathe seducers and am always on the side of women when they 
are seduced and betrayed, I who am called the defender of my sex and 
glory in the title, I have in cases of necessity used my authority as a sister, 
a mother and a friend to break off more than one such engagement. I 
have ever condemned the woman when she sought her own happiness 
at the cost of the man's; I have ever absolved the man when he has 
been asked for more than liberty and human dignity can pledge. A 
vow of love and faithfulness is crime and cowardice when the lips utter 
what the heart disavows; and everything may be demanded of a man 
save cowardice and crime. Apart from that special case, my friend I 
mean the case in which he would be ready to make too harsh a sacrifice 
I think it is better not to fight his ideas or go violently against his 
instincts. 

If his heart can, like mine, contain two different loves, one which is 
so to speak the body of life while the other is the soul, so much the 
better, for then our position will be adapted to our feelings and 
thoughts. Just as one cannot be sublime every day* so one cannot be 
happy every day. We shall not see each other every day; every day 
we shall not be consumed by the sacred fire, but there will be some fine 
days and some holy flames. 

Perhaps you had better consider explaining to him rny situation 
with regard to M. [Mallefille]. As he is not aware of it, there is a danger 
that he might take upon himself a kind of obligation towards me which 
might embarrass him and produce a painful struggle against the other 
person. I leave you completely free to decide whether or not to impart 

155 



this to him confidentially; you may tell him whenever you think the 
time opportune, and you can hold it back If you think that the revela- 
tion might add to the suffering he has not had time to recover from. 
Perhaps you have already told him. In any case I approve of and con- 
firm all you have done or will do. 

As for the question of [physical] possession or non-possession, that 
seems to me one which is secondary to the question we are now dis- 
cussing. It is, however, one which is important in itself since therein 
lies a woman's whole life, her dearest secret, her most carefully thought- 
out system, her most mysterious seductiveness. To you, my brother 
and friend, I will give a simple explanation of this great mystery which 
is the subject of such strange comments whenever my name is mentioned. 
The feet is that I have neither secret nor theory nor doctrine nor fixed 
opinion nor prejudice. I make no claim to special powers; I do not put 
on a show of spirituality; I have no preconceived notions, no fixed 
habits nor, I think, any false principles either in the direction of licence 
or restraint. I have largely trusted to my instincts which have always 
been noble; I have sometimes been mistaken about people but never 
about myself. I can blame myself for uttering many foolish words, but 
not platitudes or spiteful things. I hear a great deal about questions of 
human morality, modesty and social virtue, but I still do not see it 
all clearly and so I have not come to any settled opinion. But I am not 
frivolous in my thinking on these matters and I may confess to you 
that the desire to harmonise my feelings with some theory or other has 
been the great problem and the great cause of suffering in my life. My 
feelings have always been stronger than my rational thinking, and the 
boundaries I have tried to fix for myself have proved useless. I have 
changed my ideas a score of times. Above all I have believed in faith- 
fulness, I have preached it and practised it. Others have failed me in 
that respect and I have failed them. And yet I felt no remorse because 
whenever I was unfaithful I was the victim of a kind of fatality, of my 
own instinctive urge towards the ideal, which compelled me to leave 
what was imperfect for something which seemed doser to perfection. 
I have experienced various kinds of love: I have loved as an artist, as 
a woman, a sister, a mother, a nun, a poet and so on. Some of these 
loves have been born and have died in a single day without ever being 
revealed to the one who inspired them. Some have made my life a 
martyrdom and have driven me to despair, almost to madness. Others 
have kept me cloistered for years in a state of extreme spirituality. 
And all the time I have been perfectly sincere. My whole nature moved 
into these different phases just as (as Sainte-Beuve used to say) the sun 

156 



moves into the signs of the Zodiac. Whoever judged me from outward 
appearances would have thought me mad or a hypocrite. To 
who have followed my course by reading the depths of my soul I have 
appeared what I really am; one who revels in all that is beautiful, who 
is hungry for the truth, sensitive in her feelings, weak in her judge- 
ments, often ridiculous, always sincere* never petty or vindictive, not 
inclined to suffer fools gladly and, thank God, quick to forget evil 
things and evil people. 

There, my dear friend, you have my life; and you see it is nothing 
to boast of. There is nothing to admire, much to be pitied, nothing 
which a kind heart will condemn. I am certain that those who accuse 
me of having been an evil woman have lied, and I could easily prove it 
if I took the trouble to draw on my memories and tel my story: but 
1 have not the patience to do it, and my memories are as short-lived as 
my rancours. 

So far I have been faithful to whomsoever I have loved, perfectly 
faithful in the sense that I have never deceived anyone and have never 
ceased to be faithful unless I had very strong reasons which, through 
another's fault, had killed my love. I am not of an inconstant nature. 
On the contrary, I am so used to giving my exclusive affection to one 
who loves me truly, so slow to take fire, so accustomed to living with 
men without reflecting that I am a woman, that I was rather disturbed 
and frightened at the effect this little person [Chopin] had on me. I still 
have not got over my amazement, and if I were very proud I should feel 
humiliated at allowing my heart to fall straight into infidelity just 
when my life seemed calm and settled for ever. I think that all this 
would be wrong if I had been able to foresee, to argue against and to 
fight this aggression; but it was a case of sudden invasion and it is not 
in my nature to regulate my conduct by reason when love takes com- 
mand. So I am not blaming myself; but I can plainly see that I am still 
very susceptible and frailer than I thought I was. What does it matter? 
I have scarcely any vanity and this proves that I ought to have none at 
all, and should never boast of anything in the way of valour or strength. 
It saddens me only because I see my fine sincerity, which I had so long 
practised and had become a little proud of, damaged and jeopardised. 
I shall have to tell lies like the rest of them. That, I can assure you, is 
more mortifying to my good opinion of myself than to be mocked for 
a bad novel or hissed for a bad play. It hurts me a little; perhaps such 
pain is a last trace of pride, or perhaps a voice from above which cries 
out and tells me that I should have kept a better watch over my eyes 
and ears and, above all, my heart. But if Heaven would have us remain 

157 



faithful to earthly affections, why docs it sometimes allow angels to 
lose their way among us and meet us in our path? 

And so the great question of love arises once more within me. Two 
months ago I said, "There is no love without fidelity", and it is very 
certain that I BO longer felt the same tenderness towards poor M. 
when I saw him again. It is certain that since he returned to Paris (you 
must have seen him) instead of impatiently awaiting his arrival and 
being sad when he is not there I suffer less and breathe more freely. 
If I thought that this cooling off might be hastened by the frequent 
sight of C. I feel that it would be my duty to refrain from seeing him. 

That is the point I was coming to to discuss with you this question 
of possession: for certain minds the whole question of fidelity is in- 
separable from it. It is, 1 believe, a wrong idea; one may be more or less 
unfaithful, but when one has allowed one's soul to be invaded and when 
one has granted the simplest caress, urged to it by the feeling of love, 
the infidelity has akeady been committed and what follows is less 
serious, for he who has lost the heart has lost everything. Better to lose 
the body and keep the soul intact. Hence, as a matter of principle, I 
think that a total consecration of the new bond does little to aggravate 
the initial fault, but rather that the attachment may even become more 
human, more powerful and dominating after possession. That is quite 
probable and even certain. And so, when two persons wish to live 
together, they should not violate nature and truth by retreating from a 
complete union; but should they be compelled to live apart, the wisest 
thing for them and hence a duty and true virtue (which means 
sacrifice) is to abstain. I had not yet seriously thought about all that, 
and if he had asked for it in Paris I should have yielded, obedient to 
that innate uprightness which makes me hate caution, restrictions, false 
distinctions and subtleties of any kind whatever. But your letter makes 
me think of abandoning that resolution altogether. Besides, the uneasi- 
ness and gloom with which I have accepted the renewal of MallefuVs 
caresses and the courage I have needed to hide the fact from him all 
this is a warning to me. I shall therefore follow your advice, dear friend. 
May this sacrifice of mine be as it were an atonement for the perjury 
I have committed. 

I say "sacrifice" because it will cost me dear to see our angel [Chopin] 
suffer. He has so far shown great strength; but I am not a child. I could 
well observe that his human passion was making rapid strides and that 
it was time we kept apart That is why, the night before I left, I did not 
wish to be left alone with him and I practically turned you both out 
of doors. 

158 



And since 1 am telling you everything, I wish to say lie 
me By one single thing the fact that he had had in his own the 

wrong reasons for abstaining. Until that moment 1 had considered it a 
fine thing that he abstained out of respect for me, out of shyness, even 
out of fidelity to another. There was an element of sacrifice in all that, 
and hence strength and chastity* as properly understood. It was that 
which charmed and allured me the most in him. But at your house, 
just as he was leaving us, and as if to overcome a final temptation, he 
said two or three words which did not at all correspond to my ideas. 
He seemed to despise (in the manner of a religious prude) the coarser 
side of human nature and to blush for temptations he had had, and to 
fear to soil our love by a further ecstasy. I have always loathed this way 
of looking at the final embrace of love. If this last embrace is not 
something as holy, as pure and as sacrificial as the rest, no virtue lies in 
abstaining from it. This phrase, "physical love", which is used to convey 
the idea of something whose name is known only in Heaven, displeases 
and shocks me as being at once a blasphemy and a false idea. Can there 
be for lofty natures a purely physical love, and for sincere natures a 
love which is purely intellectual? Can there ever be love without a 
single kiss, and a Mss of love without sensual pleasure? To scorn thejlesh 
can only have a wise and useful meaning for creatures who are nothing 
\>nt flesh; but when two people love each other it is not the word scorn 
but respect that should be used when they abstain. In any case those 
were not his actual words. He said, I think, that "certain actions" might 
spoil our memories. It was foolish of him to say that, wasn't it? And 
can he mean it? Tell me, what wretched woman has left him with 
such impressions of physical love? Poor angel. They should hang all 
women who make vile in men's eyes that which in all creation is most 
holy and most worthy of respect, the divine mystery, the subHmest 
and most serious act of universal life. The magnet draws the iron to it, 
the beasts are attracted to each other by the difference in the sexes, 
the world of pknts obeys the laws of love, and man, who alone in this 
world has received from God the gift of feeling divinely that which 
animals, plants and metals feel in a material sense man, in whom the 
electric attraction is transformed into an attraction which is felt, under- 
stood and intelligent man alone regards this miracle taking place in 
both his body and soul as a wretched necessity, and he speaks of it with 
words of scorn, irony or shame. That is strange indeed! And as a result 
of this separation of the spirit and the flesh we need to have convents 
and brothels. 

This is a frightful letter. It will take you six weeks to read it through. 

159 



It is my If Ms happiness depends, or is going to depend, on 

her, let him go Ms way. If he is to be unhappy, prevent it ! If 1 can make 
him happy without putting an end to the happiness he receives from her, 
1 can adopt the same attitude [Le. share her love with two persons}. 
If he cannot obtain happiness from me without being unhappy on her 
account, we must avoid each other and he must forget me. The only 
choice lies in these four alternatives. I will be firm on this, I promise 
you: for fas future is at stake, and if I have no great virtue so far as I 
myself am concerned I am ready to sacrifice myself for one whom I 
love. You must tell me the plain truth. I rely on you and expect it from 
you. There is no point in your writing me a letter which I can show to 
Dustily myself. Mallefille and I have not come to that. We respect each 
3ther too much to call for, even mentally, an account of the details of 
var lives. . . . [Here follow some sentences about a friend.] 

3had thought of going to Paris, and it is still not impossible that if 
my business affairs, which Mallefille is looking after, drag on I shall go 
and meet him. Don't say a word to the boy [Chopin]. If I do come I 
will notify you and we shall give him a surprise. In any case, since you 
wiH need time to obtain freedom to travel, you should begin to take 
the necessary steps now, for I must have you at Nohant this summer 
as soon and for as long as you can. You will see how pleasant it is; 
there are none of the things you fear: no spying, no gossip, no pro- 
vincial neighbours; it's an oasis in the desert. There's not a soul for 
miles around who knows what a Chopin or a Grzymala is. No one 
knows what goes on in my house* I see only intimate friends, darlings 
like you, who have never thought any evil of those whom they love. 
You will come, my dear good fellow; we shall have comfortable talks 
and your depressed spirit will revive in the country air. As for the boy, 
he can come if he likes, but in that case I should like to be notified in 
advance because I shall dispatch Mallefille either to Paris or Geneva. 
I shall have plenty of excuses and he will never suspect anything. If 
the boy doesn't want to come, leave him alone; he is afraid of what 
people might say, he is afraid of I know not what. In creatures I 
love I respect everything I do not understand. I shall go to Paris in 
September before everybody leaves. My attitude to him will depend on 
the reply you are going to send me. If you do not know the solution 
of the problems I am putting to you, try to get it out of him; search in 
the depths of his soul I must know what is going on there. 

But now you really know me. I do not write two such letters in the 
space often years. I am so lazy and I hate talking so much of myself. 
But this letter will spare me the necessity of saying any more. You 

160 



know me by heart now and I give you a signed, blank cheque for any 
amount you like for the day when you settle the accounts of the Holy 
Trinity [i.e. never]. 

I send you my warmest regards, dear, kind friend; and if I do not 
seem to have spoken of you in the course of this long chat it is because 
I felt I was speaking to tny other self, the one who is beyond ail doubt 
the best and dearest of the two.

My dear friend, 

I simply must see you today even if late at night, at twelve or one. 
Don't be afraid that I have some trouble in store for you. You know 
how I have always valued your sincerity it is a question of giving me 
some advice.

give him a surprise.

My dear friend, 

You can't give me a surprise because I saw Mr Marliani yesterday and 
he told me about her [George Sand's] arrival. I shall be at home till 
five, working away at my lessons (I've just finished two). God knows 
how things will turn out. I am really unwell. I have been to your 
house every day to embrace you on your return. Let's have dinner to- 
gether somewhere.

[Port Vendres. Beginning of November 1838] 
Darling, 

I am leaving France in two hours. I am writing from the shores of 
the bluest and clearest sea: it's like a sea off Greece, or a Swiss lake in the 
finest weather. We are all well. Chopin arrived yesterday evening at 
Perpignan as fresh as a rose and as pink as a beetroot and in good health, 
having stood up like a hero to his four nights in a stage-coach, . . . Our 
trip is beginning "under the happiest auspices", as the saying goes; the 
sky is wonderful. We are warm, and if you were with us we should be 
completely happy. ... I shall spend a week at Barcelona, . . .

Palma. 15 November 1838 
My dearest friend, 

Here I am at Palma, among palms, cedars, cacti, olive-trees, oranges, 
lemons, aloes, figs, pomegranates, etc. everything that is to be found 
in the hot-houses of the Jardin des Plantes* The sky is like turquoise, the 
sea like lapis lazuli, the mountains like emerald and the air as in Heaven. 
In the day-time, sunshine; everyone goes about in summer clothes and 
it's hot. At night, guitars and songs for hours on end. Enormous 
balconies with overhanging vines: Moorish ramparts. Everything, 
including the town, has an African look. In a word, life is marvellous. 
Love me still. Do caE at Pleyel's, for the piano hasn't arrived yet. 
Which route have they dispatched it by? It won't be long before you 
receive the Preludes. It is settled that I shall live in a wonderful monas- 
tery on the most fabulous site in the world: sea, mountains, palm-trees, 
a cemetery, a crusaders' church, ruins of a mosque, olive-trees a 
thousand years old. Oh, my dear fellow, I am really beginning to live. 

162 



I am close to all that is most beautiful. 1 am a better man. Hand the 
letters from my parents to Grzymaia* and anything else you want to 
send me: he knows the safest address. Embrace Johnny, How quickly lie 
would recover here ! Tell Pleyel he will receive the manuscripts soon. 
Don't say much about me to my acquaintances. I wiH write fully later 
on. Tell them I'll be back at the end of the winter. There f s only one 
postal collection a week! I am sending this through the local French 
consulate. Send off my letter to my parents just as it is. Post it yourself. 

Yours, 

Ch. 
I* 11 write to Johnny later. 

Chopin wrote to Pleyel hi the same strain, being mainly concerned about 
the small cottage piano that was to be sent to him. **J dream of music but I

127. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Palma. 3 December [1838] 
My dear friend, 

Hand over to Fontana my letter for my parents. Here I am, coughing 
and trying to clear my throat, but still loving you. We often speak of 
you. Not a single letter from you yet. This is the devil's own country 
as far as the post, the population and comforts are concerned. The sky 
is as lovely as your soul; the earth is as bkck as my heart. 

Yours ever affectionately, 

Ch. 

[George Sand's postscript:] 
Dear Grzym, 

Are you receiving our letters? We have written three or four times 
and are worried and miserable at your silence, especially as we have had 
news from Mme MarlianL The safest way of aU those we have tried is 
to address: Mr Canut y Mugnerat at Palma de Mallorca, Balearic 
Islands. Mark the envelope: "For Mme G. Sand". It is absolutely 
necessary to pay postage right to the frontier. 

Chopin has been rather unwell these kst few days. He is now much 
better but he suffers somewhat from the frequent changes of tempera- 
ture. At last we are getting a Homond stove, and may Heaven grant us 
its protection for there are neither doctors nor medicines here. Maurice 
[her son] is very well. The lack of a piano is a source of great distress 

G 163 



to me on the boy's [Chopin's] account. He has hired a local one which 
gives him more vexation than consolation. All the same he is working. 
In three days* time we shall be living in our lovely monastery which is 
magnificently situated. We have bought some furniture and so behold 
us, house-owners at Majorca! I cannot get on with my own work yet. 
"We are not yet settled and have neither donkey, servant, water, fire nor 
safe means of dispatching manuscripts. In such circumstances I am 
cooking instead of writing. . . . 

128. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Palma. 3 December 1838 

Dear Julian, 

Don't give my landlord notice about my rooms. I can't send you the 
manuscript [of the Preludes] as I haven't finished it. I have been as ill 
as a dog during these last two weeks: I caught a cold in spite of the 
eighteen degrees of heat, the roses, oranges, palms and figs. The three 
most celebrated doctors on the isknd have seen me: one sniffed at what 
1 spat, the second tapped where I spat from, and the third sounded me 
and listened as I spat. The first said I was dead, the second that I am 
dying, and the third that I'm going to die and I feel the same as 
always. I can't forgive Johnny for not advising me what to do in the 
event of acute bronchitis which he might have expected me to catch 
at any time. It was all I could do to stop them bleeding me or applying 
blisters and setons; but thanks to Providence I am today just as I was. 
However it is all having a bad effect on the Preludes God knows when 
you will receive them. In a few days I shall be living in the most beauti- 
ful surroundings in the world: sea, mountains, everything. It is a huge, 
old, deserted Carthusian monastery whose monks seem to have been 
cleared out by Mendizabel [the Spanish president] especially for me. It's 
near Palma impossible to imagine anything more marvellous: 
arcades, the most poetical cemetery I know I shall be all right there. 
There Is only one thing: I have no piano. I have written directly to 
Pleyel, rue Rochediouart. Find out what's happening. TeU him that 
the day after I wrote I fell seriously ill but I am better now. Otherwise 
say little about me and my manuscripts. Write ! So far I haven't had a 
single letter from you. Tell Leo [his banker] that I have not yet sent the 
Preludes to Albrecht: give them my love and say I'll write. Post my 
letter yourself at the Place de la Bourse and write. Love to Johnny. 

Ch. 

Don't tell people I have been ill or they will make a fantastic story 
out of it.

Palma. 14 December 
Dear Julian, 

Still no word from you, while this is my third letter to you, If not 
the fourth. Did you pay postage In advance? Perhaps my family have 
not written? Perhaps some misfortune has occurred to them? Or are 
you lazy? No, you are decent, not lazy. I am sure you have dispatched 
my two letters to my family (both from Palma) and have written to 
me, only the post here Is the most irregular In the world and has not 
delivered them. I learnt only today that on I December the piano was 
loaded on to a merchant vessel at Marseilles. I suppose the piano will 
spend the winter in port or at anchor (for everything conies to a stand- 
still as soon as it rains) and I shall receive it when I am ready to leave. 
That will be delightful, as I shall have the pleasure not only of paying 
500 francs duty but of packing It up again. Meanwhile my manuscripts 
sleep while I get no sleep at all. I can only cough and, covered with 
poultices, await the spring or something else. Tomorrow I am going 
to that marvellous monastery at VaUdemosa to write in the cell of some 
old monk who perhaps had more fire in his soul than I have but stifled 
It, stifled It and put it out, for it was of no use to him. I expect to send 
you my Preludes and Ballade shortly. Go and see Leo. Don't tell him 
I'm ill or he will be worried about his thousand francs. See Pleyel as 
well 

Your

Palma. 28 December 1838 

or rather Valldemosa, a few miles away; between the cliffs and the sea 
a huge deserted Carthusian monastery where in a cell with doors larger 
than any carriage-gateway in Paris you may Imagine me with my hair 
unkempt, without white gloves and pale as ever. The cell Is shaped like 
a tall coffin, the enormous vaulting covered with dust, the window 
small. In front of the window are orange-trees, palms, cypresses; 
opposite the window is my camp-bed under a Moorish filigree rose- 
window. Close to the bed is an old square grubby box which I can 
scarcely use for writing on, with a leaden candlestick (a great luxury 
here) and a little candle. Bach, my scrawls and someone else's old 
papers , . . silence . . . you can yell . . . still silence. In short, I am writing 
to you from a queer place. 
I received two days ago your letter of the 2nd of this month, but 

165 



since it is holiday time and the post will not go before next week I can 
take my time in writing to you. The money-bill which 1 am sending 
will of course take a month of Sundays to reach you. Nature is a very 
fine thing, but one ought to have nothing to do with people. There 
are neither roads nor postal services here. I have come here many times 
from Palma, always with the same coachman but always by a different 
route. Roads are made by the torrents and repaired by landslides. You 
can't drive through this way today because it's ploughed up, tomorrow 
only mules can pass, and what vehicles they have ! And so I tell you, 
Julian, that there is not a single Englishman here, not even a consul. 
Never mind what they say about me in Paris. Leo is a Jew ! I can't send 
you the Preludes for they are not finished: I feel better and will hurry 
up. I'll send the Jew a short open letter with my thanks which he can 
swallow right down to his heels (or wherever you like). Scoundrel! 
I went to see him the day before I left so that he need not send anyone 
to me. ScHesinger is a still bigger hound, putting my Waltzes in an 
album and selling them to Probst [of Breitkopf and Hartel], when I 
yielded to his pleading and gave them to him for his father [A. M. 
Schlesinger] in Berlin. AH those lice bite me less where I am now. What 
do I care if Leo is furious? I'm only sorry for you, but in a month's 
time at most you will be clear with Leo and my landlord. Use the 
money from Wessel [his English publisher] if you need it. What's my 
servant doing? Give the concierge 20 francs from me as a New Year's 
present when you receive that money and pay the chimney-sweep if 
he turns up. I don't think I left any considerable debts behind me. In 
any case I vow that in a month at most we shall be clear. Tonight the 
moon is marvellous. Never have I seen it like this. But, but ! You write 
that you sent me a letter from home: I have neither seen nor received 
it. And I do need it. Did you pay the postage? How did you address 
it? The only letter I have so far had from you was very incorrectly 
addressed. So don't forget things when you write, and note that the 
gentleman whose name you must put on is called Riotord (an imbecile, 
by the way). I am sending you the most correct address. According to 
the customs-house people the piano has been waiting in port for a 
week: they are asking a huge sum for the damned thing. Nature is 
kindly here but the people are rogues, for they never see foreigners and 
so they never know what to charge for anything. You can have oranges 
for nothing but they demand an enormous sum for a trouser-button. 
However, all that is a mere grain of sand compared with the poetry 
which everything here exhales and the colouring of this most marvel- 
lous scenery still untainted by the eye of man. Few are those who have 

166 



ever disturbed the eagles which daily soar over our heads. Write, for 
God's sake ! Always pay postage in advance and add the words "Palma 
de Mallorca". ! am sending a money-draft and a letter for my parents. 
Give my love to Johnny and say I'm only sorry lie hasn't been fully 
trained to take over some children's home in Nuremberg or Bamberg. 
Anyhow teU him to be a man and write. 

I think this is the third or fourth letter I have sent for my parents. 
Give my love to Albrecht, but don't discuss me. 

131. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Valldemosa. 22 January 1839 
My dear friend, 

I am sending you the Preludes. Copy them out, you and Wolff. I 
don't think there are any mistakes. You should give the copy to Probst 
and my manuscript to PleyeL When you get the money from Probst 
(I am sending a note and receipt for him) take it at once to Leo. I 
haven't time to write and thank him. With the money you receive 
from Pleyel, 1,500 francs, you should pay 425 francs rent up to New 
Year and then politely give notice of quitting. If it can be arranged that 
we take the room for March, well and good, but if not, we shall have to 
keep it for a further quarter. Give the remaining thousand to Nougues 
from me. Find out from Johnny where he lives but don't mention the 
money, otherwise he might go rushing off to Nougues himself, and I 
don't want anyone except ourselves to know about it. If my room were 
to be let, part of my furniture could go to Johnny and part to Grzy- 
mala. You might tell Pleyel that you will forward his letters to me. 
Before the New Year I sent you a draft for WesseL Tell Pleyel I am 
clear as far as Wessel is concerned. In a week or two you will receive 
the Ballade, Polonaises and Scherzo. Tell Pleyel to settle with Probst 
about the date of publication of the Preludes. I still have had no letter 
from home! You simply must pay postage in advance. Have you 
no idea what happened to my first letter? 

I embrace you. I am living in my cell and sometimes have Arabian 
dances and African sunshine. Then there is the Mediterranean. Love 
to the Albrechts: I will write to them. Don't mention that I am giving 
up my room only Grzymala must know. I'm not sure, but I think I 
shan't come back before May or even later. Hand over my letter and 
the Preludes to Pleyel yourself.

132. To CAMILLE PUYJ&L IN PARIS 

VaUdemosa near Palma. 22 January 1839 
Dear friend, 

I am sending you the Preludes. I finished them on your cottage 
piano which arrived in perfect condition in spite of the sea-crossing, 
the bad weather and the Palma customs. I have instructed Pontana to 
hand over my manuscript. I am asking 1,500 francs for the French and 
English rights* Probst, as you know, has bought the German rights for 
Breitkopf for 1,000. 1 am no longer under contract to Wessel in London 
so he can pay more. When you have time to think of it hand over the 
money to Fontana' I don't want to draw a bill here on your name as I 
know no banker at Palma. Since it was your idea, my very dear friend, 
to undertake the burden of being my publisher, I must notify you that 
there are other manuscripts awaiting your instructions: I. The Ballade 
which forms part of my German contract with Probst. For this 
Ballade I am asking 1,000 for the French and English rights. 2. Two 
Polonaises (you already know the one in A major) I ask 1,500 for all 
the countries in the world. 3. A third Scherzo same price as the Polo- 
naises for the whole of Europe. If you like, the whole lot will descend 
upon you, month by month, until the arrival of the composer himself 
who wiU tell you more than he can write. I have only heard news of 
you indirectly through Fontana, who wrote that you were better. The 
postal service here is marvellous ! It takes three months to get a letter 
from home. And how is your family? And Mme Pleyel? 1 M. and 
Mme Desnoyers? Give them all my best wishes for 1839. I am 
expecting a long, long letter from you and send you my love as 
always. 

Yours devotedly, 

F. F. Chopin 

Forgive my bad spelling. 1 notice I haven't thanked you for the piano, 
and have spoken of nothing but money matters I am decidedly a 
business man. 

On 13 February 183$ Chopin, George Sand and her children left Majorca 
in conditions which are revealed in extracts from a letter she wrote as soon as 
she reached the mainland: 



1 This was Miss Emma Osborn, an English girl with whom Pleyel lived after his separa- 
tion from his wife, the pianist Marie Moke. At Pleyel's request Miss Osborn took his name 
but they were never married, Emma Osborn preserved many letters and souvenirs of 
Chopin.

133. GEORGE SAND TO CARLOTTA MAMIAM IN PAWS 

Barcelona. 15 February 1839 
My dearest, 

Here I am at Barcelona. God grant I may get out of Spain soon and 
never set foot there again. It is a country which does not suit me in any 
way at all and I will tell you what I think of it when we are "safely 
outside", as La Fontaine says. 

The climate at Majorca was becoming more and more deadly to 
Chopin and I hastened to get away. Just to show you what the in- 
habitants are like I had three leagues of rough road to cover between 
my mountain retreat and Paima. We knew ten persons who have 
carriages, horses, mules, etc., but not one was willing to lend them. 
We had to make this journey in a hired cart without springs, and of 
course Chopin had a frightful attack of blood-spitting when we reached 
Palma. And the reason for this unfriendliness? It was because Chopin 
coughs, and whosoever coughs in Spain is declared consumptive; and 
he who is consumptive is held to be a plague-carrier, a leper. They 
haven't stones, sticks and policemen enough to drive him out, for 
according to their ideas consumption is catching and the sufferer should 
therefore be slaughtered if possible, just as the insane were strangled 
two hundred years ago. What I am telling you is the literal truth. We 
were treated like outcasts at Majorca because of Chopin's cough and 
also because we did not go to church. My children were stoned in the 
streets. ... I should have to write ten volumes to give you an idea of 
the cowardice, deceit, selfishness, stupidity and spite of this stupid, 
thieving and bigoted race. . . . 

Here we are at last at Barcelona, which seems a paradise by com- 
parison. We came by the steamer in the company of a hundred pigs 
whose stench did not help to cure Chopin. But the poor boy would have 
died of melancholy at Majorca and I had to get him away at all costs. 
Heavens, if you knew him as I do now, you would be still fonder of him, 
my dear friend. He is an angel of gentleness, patience and kindness. 
We were removed from the Majorcan boat to the French brig lying 
in harbour. The squadron commandant is most obliging and his ship is 
like a drawing-room for its elegance and neatness. The ship's doctor has 
examined Chopin and has reassured me about the unfortunate blood- 
spitting which was still going on but which finally ceased tonight at the 
inn. . . . We are going to spend a week here to give him some rest . 

On 1$ February 1839 Chopin and George Sand made an excursion to a 
sea-side place, Arenys de Mar, a few miles from Barcelona, where they spent 

169 



a couple of Jays. A later they left Barcelona for Marseilles u'herc they 
tlie next weeks. 

134. CHOHN TO JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[Marseilles. 7 March 1839] 
My clear Julian, 

I am sure you have heard from Grzymak about the state of my health 
and about my manuscripts. I sent you my Preludes from Palnia two 
months ago. I asked you (after you had copied them out for Probst) to 
pay Leo 1,000 out of the 1,500 which Pleyel would give you for the 
Preludes. I also wrote and asked you to pay Nougues and also a quarter's 
rent. In that same letter, if I am not mistaken, I asked you to give notice 
of quitting my room. If It is not let to someone for April, I shall have 
to keep It until the following quarter until July, I imagine. Of course 
you will have used the money from Wessel to pay for the first quarter 
of the New Year but if you haven't, you can use it to pay the follow- 
ing quarter. The second batch of manuscripts can have surely only just 
reached you, for they were delayed by the customs, the sea-crossing 
and then the customs again. 

When I sent the Preludes to Pleyel I told him that I will let him have 
the Ballade for 1,000 (Probst has the German rights) and for the two 
Polonaises I asked 1*500, Including the French, English and German 
rights since my contract with Probst ends with the Ballade. I don't 
think I am asking too much. Thus, when you have received the second 
set of manuscripts you should get 2,500 from Pleyel and 500 (or 600, 1 
can't quite remember) from Probst for the Ballade, making 3,000 
altogether. 

I have asked Gr2ymala to send me at least 500 at once but that 
must not stop you from sending me the rest as soon as possible. So much 
for my business affairs* And now, if my room has in fact been let from 
the beginning of next month (which I doubt) will you divide up my 
furniture among the three of you, Grzymala, Johnny and yourself? 
Johnny has most room although not most brains In his head, judging 
by the childish letter he wrote me, imagining I was going to become a 
monk! Let Johnny have the most indispensable household things. 
Don't trouble Grzymala too much take what you need yourself, 
because I don't know whether I shall be returning to Paris this summer. 
(Keep that to yourself) We shall discuss that later, and if, as I expect, I 
have to keep my apartment I shall ask you to spend a day or two there 
from time to time, even though you have a place of your own. You 
shall also have the task of paying the last quarter's rent. 

170 



You will find an answer to your sincere and genuine letter in the 
second Polonaise [of Op. 40, dedicated to Fontana]. It is not my fault 
if I am Hke a mushroom which seems edible but which poisons you if 
you pick it and taste it, taking it to be something else. I know I have 
never been of any use to anyone and indeed not much use to myself. 
I told you that in my desk, in the first drawer next to the door, there 
was a document which you or Grzymak or Johnny might unseal. I 
now ask you, please, to take it out and burn it without reading it. I adjure 
you by our friendship to do this the paper serves no purpose now. If 
Antoni [Wodzinski] goes without paying back my money it will be 
quite a Polish trick I mean the trick of a stupid Pole but don't tell 
him I said so. See Pleyel and tell him I haven't received a line from 
him. TeU him his piano is in safe hands. Does he agree with the arrange- 
ment for its sale which I wrote to him about? I received all those three 
letters from home, together with yours, just as I was going aboard the 
vessel. I am sending you another letter for my people and I thank you 
for the friendly help you have given to one who is as helpless as I am. 
Love to Johnny. Tell him that I didn't allow myself to be, or rather 
that they didn't have me, bled; that I have plasters on me and that I 
cough little, and only in the mornings; and that they no longer con- 
sider me a consumptive. I drink neither wine nor coffee only milk. 
I keep myself warmly wrapped up and look like a young lady. Send 
the money as quickly as you can get in touch with Grzymak. 

Your 
Fr. 

1 endose a few lines for Antoni. Shall write to Grzymak tomorrow. 

135. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PAMS 

[Marseilles. 12 March 1839] 

Thank you, my dear friend, for all the trouble you have taken. I did 
not expect such Jewish behaviour from Pleyel, but since it is so, please 
hand Mm the enclosed letter. Perhaps he will not make difficulties over 
the Ballade and Polonaises. If he does you can offer the Ballade to 
Schlesinger when you have received 500 for it from Probst. If we have 
to deal with Jews let it at least be with orthodox ones. Probst may 
cheat me even more, for he's a tricky kind of bird to catch. Schlesinger 
has swindled me all along; he has made a good deal out of me and 
won't say no to the chance of making more but go carefully with 
him, for this Jew would like to cut a figure in the world. So if Pleyd 
makes the slightest difficulty, go to Schlesinger and tell him he can have 
the Ballade for France and Germany at a price of 800 (he won't pay 

0* 171 



i,ooo), and the Polonaises for Germany, England and France for 1,500 
(but if he won't pay so much he can have them for 1,400 or 1,300 or 
even 1,200). I am sure Probst will have forewarned him about the 
Preludes, so if he mentions them and Pleyel you can say that they are 
something that was promised long ago to Pleyel who begged for them 
before I left and was desirous of publishing them which was in fact 
the case. You see, my dear friend, I could break with Schlesinger for 
PleycTs sake, but I cannot do it for Probst. What does it matter to me 
that Schlesinger makes Probst pay more for my manuscripts? If Probst 
pays a lot to Schlesinger it is a sore sign that he cheats me when he pays 
me less. Probst has no shop in Paris and all my things are printed at 
Schlesinger 5 s. The Jew has always paid up, while Probst has often kept 
me waiting. You will have to arrange with Schlesinger that you are to 
hand over the manuscripts on the actual receipt of the money: if he 
does not want to take them all at once let him have the Ballade 
separately and then the Polonaises, with an interval of two weeks at 
most. If Schlesinger refuses to listen to such a suggestion, then only are 
you to offer them to Probst. And since he adores me so much don't let 
Mm have them for less than Pleyel. So deliver my letter to Pleyel if he 
makes the slightest difficulty. If, which I doubt, you have left with him 
the manuscripts of the Ballade and Polonaises, get them back for 
Schlesinger or Probst. Scoundrels! My God! This Pleyel who idolises 
me so ! Perhaps he thinks I am not returning to Paris. Tm returning sure 
enough and he shall receive my best thanks when I see him. And Leo 
too ! I enclose a note for Schlesinger giving you authority to act for me. 
Antoni's family must have forgotten themselves terribly when such 
things as have happened could arise between him and me. You know 
what I mean: him and ME. [He refers to the broken engagement 
between himself and Maria.] He has gone off without paying the money 
he owed me. He's a fool and they are heartless imbeciles. My health is 
improving daily; all the same you can still pay the concierge those 
50 francs with my full approval, for the doctor will not allow me to 
stir from the south before summer. I received the copy of Dziady [a 
work by Mickiewicz] yesterday. As for the glove-maker and the little 
tailor, let them wait, the idiots ! What about my papers? Leave the 
letters in the desk and give Johnny the music or take it yourself. There 
are also letters in the drawer of the little table in the vestibule. It should 
be carefully locked. The letter to Schlesinger should be sealed with 
wax. Write often. Yours 

Love to Johnny.

Marseilles, 12 March 1839 

Jews will be Jews and HOBS wiE be Huns that's the truth, but what 
can one do? I am forced to deal with them. Thanks once more, my 
dear friend, for your kindness, but after the instructions I have given to 
Fontana today I doubt whether I shall have to trouble you again. 

My health is steadily improving the blisters, diet s pills and baths 
and also the tireless nursing of my angel are putting me on my feet 
again rather shaky feet. You ask me to say what I intend to do. 
Well, the doctor doesn't want to let me out of his sight before May or 
June, hence our intention of travelling to Nohant where the summer 
air will do me a lot of good, and if my finances allow it I shall spend 
next winter in Paris or in the south of France, if my health requires it. 
I have gone awfully thin and I look wretched, but I am now eating to 
gain strength. In addition to my eternal coughing you can imagine all 
the rage which those Spaniards put me into, as well as the other 
similarly pleasant experiences. I had to look on while she, continually 
harrassed, nursed me (the less said about those doctors the better), 
made my bed, tidied my room, prepared hot drinks. She deprived 
herself of everything for me, while all the time she was receiving no 
letters and the children needed her constant attention in these unusual 
circumstances. Add to this the fact that she was writing her books. . . . 
[The rest is lost.] 

Letters similar to the above followed each other in quick succession with 
abundant curses on publishers and multiple instructions to Fontana. 

137. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PABIS 

[Marseilles. End of March 1839] 
My dear friend, 

I feel very much better. I am beginning to play, eat, walk and talk 
like everybody else, and you can see that I have no difficulty in writing, 
since you are receiving a few lines from me. But once more to business. 
I should very much like my Preludes to be dedicated to Pleyel there 
is surely plenty of time as they are not yet printed. And the Ballade to 
[here he crosses out the words "my friend"] Mr Robert Schuhmann 
[sic], the Polonaises to you, as in fact is already done. Nothing to 
Kessler. 1 If Pleyel insists on having the Ballade, then dedicate the 
Preludes to Schuhmann. 

1 In the end die German edition of the Preludes was dedicated to J. C. Kessler and the 
French edition to Pleyel. 

173 



Gaszynski came to sec me yesterday from Aix. He Is the only person 
I have received, for my doors are closed to aH amateurs of music and 
literature. Inform Probst of the change of dedication when you have 
settled the matter with Pleyel. Out of the fresh funds give Grzymala 
500 and tell him to send me the remaining 2,500. Don't go to sleep over 
my affairs. Love me and write. Forgive me for loading you with 
errands but I sincerely believe you do them cheerfully as I beg you to. 

Yours, 
CL 

138. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Marseilles. 27 March [1839] 
My dear friend. 

My health is far better and I can thank you more energetically for 
sending the money. You know I am really amazed at your good will 
but, believe me, you have in me one who is deeply grateful in Ms 
heart, even if he does not always outwardly appear to be so. You are 
so kind that I am sure you will take in my furniture : please be also good 
enough to pay for the removal* I venture to ask this last favour, knowing 
that only a small sum is involved. As for my other earnings, may God 
protect me ! That idiot [Pleyel] has got me into a nice mess. But what 
can one do? It's no use running one's head against a brick wall. 

We shall meet again in the summer and I shall tell you how it all 
amuses me. My own one has just finished a most excellent article about 
Goethe, Byron and Mickiewicz, You must read it: it will rejoice your 
heart I can see you enjoying it. It is aH so true, so deeply penetrating, 
so wide-ranging, written from the heart without distortion or the 
desire merely to praise. Let me know who has translated it. If only 
Mickiewicz himself would lend a hand, she would be delighted to 
revise it and her article could be printed along with the translation [of 
Dziady} to which it would form a preface. Everyone would read It and 
lots of copies would be sold. She will be writing to you or Mickiewicz 
on the matter. 

What are you yourself doing? God grant you cheerful temper, 
health and strength those are the main things. What do you think of 
the Nourrit affair? 1 It gave us a great shock. We often think of you 
when we are out walking. You wouldn't believe how much we enjoy 
talking about you. Marseilles is an ugly place it is old, but not ancient, 
and bores us somewhat. Next month we are sure to move to Avignon 

1 Adolphe Nourrit, the French tenor, had just committed suicide at Naples by throwing 
himself from a window.

and from there to Nohant. There we shall embrace you, not by 
letter, but complete with your moustache, unless your moustache 
happens to have met with the same fate as my side-whiskers. Kiss the 
hands and feet of your lady-friend (not your own) for me. Without 
being dead to the most sublime feelings I may sign myself, for your 
sake,

Marseilles. 12 April 1839 
My dear friend, 

Mme Marliani has written to tell us you are still ill and that the 
blood-letting did you very little good. We thought here that you were 
perfectly recovered, or so it appeared from your letter yesterday. So 
what a disappointment today ! In the same letter MarHani writes that 
there is a rumour that my mother is anxious about me and is coming 
to Paris. Although I don't believe it, I am writing today to reassure my 
parents please be kind enough to have my letter taken to the post 
office. That will be my third letter from Marseilles. If you hear any 
more about this, send me a line. It would take something quite out of 
the ordinary to make my mother leave my father. Father is poorly and 
needs her more than anyone I just could not imagine such a separation. 
My angel is finishing her new novel Gabriel She's spending the whole 
of today writing in bed. You know, you would love her still more if 
you knew her as I do today. 

I can imagine how tiresome it must be for you, not being allowed 
to go out. Why can't I be both here and with you? How I would look 
after you! I have been taught what it means to take care of someone. 
And besides, my attentions would be all the more welcome to you 
since you would know from what affection they spring. I have never 
been able to be of much use to you, but I might manage now to look 
after you. It appears that our plan for Genoa is already altered. We shall 
surely meet and embrace at her country-place towards the middle of 
May. May Heaven restore you quickly to health! 

My respects to you know whom. . . . 

Your 
Fritz 

[George Sand's postscript:] My dear, try to get better. Let us hear 
from you. We are miserable, for Carlotta [Mme Marliani] wrote this 
morning that you are still ill. I am in the thick of it I haven't even 

175 



time to get up out of bed. 1 am giving birth to a new novel which looks 
like the surgical forceps. Kisses from me, and ail our love. 

140. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Marseilles. 25 April 1839 

My dear friend, 

I have received your letter with its details about the removal of my 
furniture. 1 can't thank von enough for your really friendly help. 1 
was very much interested in the details but 1 am vexed to hear that you 
are complaining and that Johnny is spitting blood. Yesterday I played 
the organ for Nourrit [see footnote, p. 141] so it shows that I am better. 
I sometimes play a little for myself, but I can neither sing nor dance yet. 
As for that rumour about my mother, it might be a pleasant one, but 
the mere fact that it came from Plater is enough to show it is a lie. The 
weather is really beginning to be hot now and I shall certainly leave 
Marseilles in May. But I shall spend some further time in the south 
before I see you. We shan't have any news of Antoni for some time to 
come. Why should he write? Perhaps to pay his debts but such is not 
the custom in Poland, That's why RatiborsH values you so highly 
because you haven't these Polish habits : when I say ''Polish" you know, 
and I understand, which ones are meant. So you are living at No. 26 
[rue de la Chaussee d'Antin]. Are you comfortable? Which floor, and 
how much do you pay? These things are beginning to interest me now 
that I am nearer Paris, for I shall have to be thinking about somewhere 
to live, but not until I arrive. Is Grzymala better? I wrote to him ktely. 
From Pleyel I have had only one letter the one he sent through you a 
month or more ago. Send your letters addressed in the same name, but 
to the rue and H6tel Beauveau. 

Perhaps you haven't understood what I meant by "playing for 
Nourrit", His body was brought here on its way to Paris; there was a 
requiem mass for Mm and the family asked me to pky, so I played 
during the Elevation. 

Did [Ckra] Wieck pky my Elude well? Why, instead of playing 
something better, did she have to choose precisely the study which is 
least interesting for those who are not aware that it is for the bkck 
keys [Op. 10, No. 5]? It would have been better to play nothing 
at all 

Well, I have no more to tell you and it only remains for me to wish 
you happiness. Take care of my manuscripts so that I don't by some 
chance find them printed before they have even been delivered. If the 
Preludes are in print it's a dirty trick of Probst's. But to hell with it all! 

176 



When I get back there'll be no more walking around arm-in-arm. 
Bloody Germans ! Jews, rogues, swine, sharks, etc. etc. I leave you to 
finish the list; you know them now as well as I do. 

Yours, 

Ch. 
Give my love to Johnny and Grzymala if you see them. 

141. GEORGE SAND TO CARLOTTA MAILIANI IN PARIS 

Marseilles. 28 April 1839 

. . . They gave Nourrit a very scanty funeral service here since the 
bishop made a fuss [on account of Nourrit J s suicide], I don't know 
whether the choristers did it on purpose, but I have never heard such 
out-of-tune singing. Chopin sacrificed himself by playing the organ at 
the Elevation and what an organ ! Anyhow our boy made the best of 
it by using the less discordant stops, and he played Schubert *s Die Sterne* 
not with the passionate and glowing tone that Nourrit used, but with a 
plaintive sound as soft as an echo from another world. Two or three at 
most among those present felt its meaning and had tears in their eyes 
the rest of the congregation, which had come in crowds and had pushed 
curiosity to the point of paying 50 centimes for their seats (an unheard- 
of price at Marseilles), were very disappointed, for they expected 
Chopin to kick up a devil of a row and to break at least two or three 
stops. . . . 

Good-bye, darling: I give you a tender Mss. Chopin would be at 
your feet if he were not in the arms of Morpheus. During these kst 
few days he has been overcome by a sleepiness which I think is good for 
him, but his active and restless mind rebels against it. ... This Chopin 
is an angel; his kindness, tenderness and patience sometimes worry me, 
for I get the idea that his whole being is too delicate, too exquisite and 
too perfect to exist long in our coarse and heavy earthly life. At Majorca, 
when sick unto death, he composed music full of the scent of Paradise; 
but I am so used to seeing him away in the skies that it does not seem to 
signify whether he is alive or dead. He does not really know on what 
planet he is living and has no precise notion of life as we others conceive 
it and live it. ... 

In spite of what Chopin had said about not going to Genoa (see letter 139) 
the excursion was in fact made on 4 May 1839* They returned on 20 May 
after a very bad passage, but they had spent a delightful week in Genoa and 
its neighbourhood.

142 CHOPIN TO WOJOECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Marseilles. 21 May 1839 
My dear friend. 

We are off to Nohant tomorrow rather exhausted the sea wore us 
out on our return from Genoa where we spent a couple of quiet weeks. 
We are having only a short rest at Marseilles but we shall have more 
time to recover at Nohant where we are eagerly expecting you I 
dream about your visit. You will come, won't you? even if only for 
twenty-four hours. I am sure you have completely forgotten your own 
illness. Please post my letter to my parents. My respects to your lady- 
fnend. Write us a Hue at Nohant. 

Yours, 
EEC. 

[George Sand's postscript:] How do you do, dear husband? Here we 
are back from our journey over hill and dale; but in a week's time w r e 
shall rest from all our sea-crossings. We have just been through a ter- 
rible storm. The boy showed himself a hero and I think he might be 
entitled to a medal. You will be a good fellow and come to Nohant, 
won't you? We are relying on you.

THE YEARS IN PARIS AND NOHANT THE BREAK WITH GEORGE SAND 



143. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Nohant. 2 June 1839 
My dear friend, 

Here we are at last after a week's travelling. We had an exceEent 
trip. The countryside is beautiful: nightingales, larks you are the only 
bird we lack. I hope it won't happen this year as it did two years ago. 
Come, if only for a few minutes. Choose a time when aU your family 
are well and are prepared to let you go, out of charity for your neigh- 
bours. Give us the chance to embrace each other and I will provide 
excellent milk and plenty of pills. My piano will be placed at your 
disposal: you will have everything you need. 

Yours, 
Fritz 

George Sand added a postscript in the same terms. The reason for these 
pressing invitations is given in her postscript to the next letter: Chopin liad now 
been cut off, exce pt by letter ; from Ms Polish friends for about nine months and 
he was becoming restless. 

144. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. 8 July 1839] 
My dear friend, 

Take the express-coach as far as Chateauroux: you will get there by 
noon the next day. From there you will have a two-and-a-half-hour 
ride in the stage-coach which goes to La Chitre. Alight in front of the 
garden the road runs past it. Dinner will be ready for you after we 

179 



ha\ T e each other warmly, etc., etc. I know how difficult it Is 

for you to leave Paris and I dared not insist, in of my desire to see 
you enjoy your company: but the Mistress of the House Is begin- 
ning to be depressed and she really is sorry there is no sign of you. 
I know it was just one of those vague promises and 1 am not at all 
surprised, but you would perhaps be doing a good deed if you could 
come see us. Mine d'Agoult's bed awaits you, if that is any attrac- 
tion, in addition to two hearts which keep on looking out for you 
and yearn for you like rain in the desert. My health is poor, and she is 
ttnweE. Perhaps your presence will revive her. The weather is lovely. 
So make up your mind one morning and the next day you will find 
yourself here among us. 

My most affectionate greetings. Best respects to your lady-friend. 

Yours, 
Fritz 

Get Johnny to give you two or three pairs of those shoes which I 
left in the large cupboard. Thanks very much, 

[George Sand's postscript:] What does all this mean? You fickle 
husband! We await you in vain. You trifle with our impatience and 
deceive us with false hopes. You really must come. I tell you, my dear 
friend, we need you. The boy's health is still only so-so. I feel that he 
needs a little less quiet, solitude and monotonous routine than life at 
Nohant offers. And who knows perhaps a little trip to Paris. I am 
prepared for any sacrifice rather than see him waste away in melancholy. 
Come and feel the pulse of his morale. Who can define the frontier 
between physical malady and dullness of spirits? He will never confess 
to me that he is bored. He has not been accustomed to such a strict 
mode of life, while I am gradually becoming a frightful matron and 
schoolmistress. I have to be. Come and see us. The fact is that the 
"Father** and the "Son" need the assistance of the "Holy Ghost'' if 
they are to remain on the sublime heights of Heaven. 

Yours ever, dear fellow, 
G. 

[Chopin's postscript;] She won't let me see what she has written: it's 
disgraceful. 

145. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Thursday [8 August 1839] 
My dear friend, 

Thank you for that letter addressed to Mr Chopine. It is headed: 
Wiatrowo near Wengrowiec! [i.e. Windy Nook near Magyarville] 

180 



and ends: "For your Honour, as being a great master of musik and 
kompositlon, I, Alexander Moszcynski, mayor of Brzesc. ..." In the 
middle lie writes: **As a music-lover now In Ms eightieth year 1 beg to 
send you two Mazurkas, a hundred years old, which I have jest 
remembered, as themes for your elucubrations. 3 " You can 
what respectable Mazurkas they are turn tiddy turn-turn, turn- 
turn, TUM-TUM. In his postscript he says :"My granddaughter 
Akxandrina (I give you my word: Alaxandrina !) played your *Li ci 
darem 9 [I.e. Chopin's Variations, Op. 2] at Gniezno at a refugees* 
benefit concert, to the great satisfaction [sic] of the public. I, my 
sons, grandsons and granddaughters, particularly Alaxandrina, play the 
piano. She can pky not at all badly and very fast. Wktrowo near 
Wengrowiec." 

Some honest old, old-Polish oHerman (one of the few left who . . . off 
the bridge). The best part of your letter is your address on the envelope 
which I had already forgotten. If I hadn't found it I don't think I could 
have answered you straight away. The worst part of the letter Is where 
you speak of Albrecht's death. You want to know when I am returning : 
not until the bad weather sets in, for I need all the fresh air I can get. 
So Johnny has gone! I wonder whether he asked you to forward any 
letters from my parents, addressed to him, that might arrive. Perhaps 
he forgot, but then perhaps he didn't. Anyhow, if a letter should 
arrive I wouldn't want to lose it. But I had a letter from home not long 
ago, so they won't be writing for a while and in the meantime Johnny 
may return in better health, poor fellow. 

I am writing here a Sonata in B flat minor which wiH contain my 
March which you already know. There is an Allegro, then a Scherzo In 
E flat minor, the March and a short Finale about three pages of my 
manuscript-paper. The left hand and the right hand gossip in unison 
after the March. I have a new Nocturne in G major which will form 
a pair with the one in G minor, If you remember: 




Oh, and I have four new Mazurkas: one in C minor [a mistake for E 
minor] written at Palma and three from here; in B major, A flat and 
C sharp minor. They seem pretty to me, as the youngest children 
usually do to parents who are growing old. When I have nothing 
particular to do I am correcting for myself, in the Paris edition of 



181 



Bach, not only the mistakes made by the engraver but those which are 
backed by the authority of people who are supposed to understand 
Bach not that ! have any pretensions to a deeper understanding, but 
1 am convinced that I sometimes hit on the right answer. Oh, you see 
now how I have gone and boasted! 

Weil now, if Grzymak comes (which the Mistress of the House has 
twice predicted), send me the Weber duets if you have them and if not, 
my latest Ballade* because I want to look at a certain point. Also your 
copy of my last Mazurkas [Op. 33] if you have one, for ! don't know 
whether I was courteous enough not to forget to give you one! TeE 
me also whether you delivered to Mile Eichtal, from me, a copy of the 
Waltz [in F, Op. 34]. If not, it doesn't matter. Pleyel wrote and told 
me you are very obliging and have corrected the Preludes. Do you 
happen to know how much Wessel has paid him for them? Write and 
tell me what he answered on a previous occasion it's as well to know 
for the future. Tell me also whether Probst has left Paris (he surely has) 
and the date of his return if you know it. My father has written to say 
that my old sonata [in C minor, Op. 4] has been published by Haslinger 
and that the German critics praise it. Including the ones in your hands 
I now have six manuscripts. I'll see the publishers damned before 
they get them for nothing. Pleyel has done me a great disservice 
by his self-sacrifice for my sake; I have turned the Jew Schlesinger 
against myself. But I hope that it will somehow all come right in 
the end. 

All my love. Write. 
Yours, 
Fr. 

Regarding what you told me about Kalkbrenner, I wrote to Pleyel 
asking him to tell me whether he had been paid for the piano at 
Palma that was all, you can believe me, nothing else. I wrote because 
the French consul at Majorca, whom I know very well, is being changed 
and if they [the purchasers] had not paid him it would be difficult for 
me to negotiate at such a distance. Luckily they have well and truly 
paid him. He wrote and told me only last week, before leaving for 
Belgium, I am not surprised at all the different stories that are going 
round about me. Believe me, I knew I was exposing myself to such 
things. Anyhow it will pass over; our tongues will rot but they won't 
touch our souls, . . . 

In September 183$ the important question of his return to Paris after a 
year's absence began to preoccupy Chopin and a steady stream of letters went 

182 



out to and Grzymala, the of whom had a suy 

at Reliant. 

146. To WGJQECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. 20 September 1839} 
My dear friend, 

Take the small apartment, but If we are too late then rent the krge 
on it doesn't matter which, provided I have one of the two. Regard- 
ing the one for her [George Sand], she thinks it's too dear and I will 
never convince her that it Is better to pay more rather than have a lot 
of other tenants in the house. Please follow her recommendations 
closely and consult with Bignat [Emmanuel Arago] so as not to have 
the sole responsibility. My warmest greetings: and you must return 

my affection. 

Yours, 

F.C 

Respects to your lady. 

George Sand's postscript (the words italicised are in Polish) :] 
Dear husband, I love you very much. Whiskery, Beaver, old potato- 
without-salt, Mea culpa, Stockholm, Straddle-legs. 

We can't get used to your not being here and we are eager to rejoin 
you. It all depends on what success you have in your expeditions and 
efforts to find us somewhere to live. I enclose a letter for Arago telling 
him to increase the sum I have stipulated if he Is forced to, but to keep 
the price as low as possible. Ooh! It hurts! All the rooms need not 
be large and fine. The children's rooms, for example, can be small, 
provided they have fireplaces: the rooms for the grown-ups must face 
south. That is most important for the boy [Chopin] and for my 
rheumatism too. As I never have to entertain more than twelve people 
at any one time I don't need a fine krge drawing-room. The main 
thing is that the lay-out of the rooms should be as required (you know 
what I mean) 1 and the whole place should be clean and fresh so that 
we can move in without any further expense apart from furnishings. 
Good night, Grzym. Love us as we do you. Write. Don't pay too 
much attention to your boy's nasal arguments. It is stupid of him to 
want to save on the rent. He must have somewhere to put his man- 
servant, and room to turn round in himself. If in your opinion the 
little apartment is not spacious enough, never mind what he says. He

gambling, women and smoking.

147. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Wednesday [25th September 1839] 
My dear friend, 

Thank you very much for your decent, friendly, Polish not English 
character. Choose a wallpaper like the one I used to have, dove-grey 
but glossy and shiny for both rooms, with a narrow dark-green strip 
as a border. Something else for the vestibule* but neat and respectable. 
However, if you come across prettier and more fashionable wallpapers 
which you yourself like and think that 1 would like too, well, choose 
them. I prefer something smooth, very quiet and neat rather than 
commonplace vulgar and petty-bourgeois. That's why I lie pearl- 
grey it is not glaring or common. Thank you for finding a room for 
my valet it is indispensable. Now about the furniture: it will be 
splendid if you wiU look after it. I assure you I was afraid to give you 
all this trouble, but since you are so very kind, collect the furniture 
and install it. I will ask Grzyimla to advance the money for the trans- 
port and will write to him about it. As for the bed and my desk, they 
will have to be sent to some cabinet-maker for cleaning and repair. 
You might take the papers out of the desk and lock them up some- 
where else I need not tell you what to do. Make whatever arrange- 
ments please you and seem most suitable. I shall agree with all you do: 
you have my entire confidence. So much for that, and now a second 
point: You must write to Wessel of course you've written about 
the Preludes, haven't you? well, you must write and tell him I have 
six new manuscripts, for each of which I am asking 300 francs. (How 
many pounds is that?) Write and wait for his answer. (If you think he 
won't pay it, write to me first.) Let me know whether Probst is in 
Paris, and engage a manservant for me if possible some honest steady 
Pole. Mention this also to Grzymala. Settle with the man that he shall 
get his own food and be paid not more than 80 [francs a month]. I shall 
be in Paris about the end of October, not earlier keep that to your- 
self. What else? The rubber mattress for my bed should be sent for 
repair if it does not cost much; if it does, don't bother. Have the chairs 
and everything well beaten. There's no need for me to tell you you 
know what's to be done. Give my love to Johnny. My dear friend, I 
often have strange feelings about him: may God grant him what he 
needs. But may he not let himself be taken in although on the other 

184 



hand Oh, well, damn all such nonsense ! That's the truest thing in the 

world, and as long as it is so I shall always love you as one honest friend 
and Johnny as another. I embrace you both. Write* and let it be soon. 
Your old friend with the longer-than-ever nose,,

148. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. i October 1839] 
My dear friend, 

Judging from your description and Grzymala's you have found me 
such an excellent apartment that we think you have "the lucky touch" 
and so we have advised the man (a very important person) the porter 
at George's house who will be on the look-out for a pkce for her to 
come and see you as soon as he finds anything suitable. You, with 
your elegant tactfulness (see how I flatter you !) will look over the places 
he finds and give your opinion. She would, as far as possible, like to 
have something detacheda, small detached residence for example, or 
else something in a courtyard looking on to a garden. . . . She requires: 
three bedrooms, two of which should be next to each other and the 
third separated by, for example, the drawing-room. Next to this 
third bedroom should be a well-lighted study for her. The two 
bedrooms may be small and the third one also need not be large. Also 
a suitable drawing-room and a dining-room, a fairly large kitchen, 
two servants* rooms and a cellar. Parquet floors, of course, fresh 
decorations and as far as possible no repairs needed. Note particularly 
that a small detached place would be best, or else a separate wing in a 
courtyard overlooking a garden. It should be quiet, silent, with no 
blacksmiths in the neighbourhood, no ladies of the streets, etc., etc. 
You know exactly what I mean. The stairs should be decent-looking. 
The whole place should have a good sunny aspect facing south (it is 
practically indispensable that it should have an open southern aspect). 
Let me repeat: it is absolutely necessary that the third bedroom [i.e. 
George Sand's own] with its adjoining study should be away from the 
two others [i.e. the children's] and, if possible, the study or the third 
bedroom should have a separate door leading outside. . . . Have a good 
look and let us keep the matter between ourselves. My love to you and 
Johnny, You will earn our sincere gratitude if you find something. 

F. Ch. 

If you find a pkce and have to sign a lease, let it be for three years 
at most, if we cannot get it for a shorter period. You know she is 
absolutely certain you will find something. 

185 



[This letter contains a plan, shewing the bedroom and study for 
George Sand with an independent entrance from the vestibule, and 
well away from the children's rooms.] 

149. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. 3 October 1839] 
My dear friend* 

In five, six* or seven days I shall be in Paris, so please make sure that 
even if everything is not ready I shall at least find the rooms papered 
and a bed avaikble. Take pity on me and see that this is done. I am 
advancing the date of my departure because George's play [Cosima] 
requires her presence in Paris keep that between ourselves. Today 
we resolved to set off on the day after tomorrow. You can count on a 
couple of days* delay; so today being Thursday, we shall meet again 
next Wednesday or Thursday. In addition to the various tasks which I 
entrusted to you, especially in my kst letter the problem of her 
apartment which you will be freed from when we arrive; but until 
we do return, please get on with it for God's sake well, besides aU 
those things, I forgot to ask you to order me a hat from my hatter 
Dupont, whose shop is in your street. He has my measurements and 
knows what sort of light hats I need. Tell him to make it in this year's 
fashion, but not exaggerated, for I have no idea what sort of things you 
men are wearing just now. There's something else: as you go past 
Dautrement's, my tailor on the boulevards, call in and order a pak of 
grey trousers to be made at once. You yourself choose a dark grey 
winter trousers, something decent, without stripes and close fitting. 
You're an Englishman and you know what I need. The tailor will be 
glad to know I'm returning. I need also a simple black velvet waistcoat 
with no more than some kind of tiny, discreet pattern something 
combining great elegance with simplicity. If he has no suitable velvet 
let him use black silk, but it must be handsome and yet simple. I am 
relying on you. The waistcoat must not be too open in front, of course, 
Hnd me a valet if you can: his wages should, if possible, be less than 
80 francs, because I've been getting involved in too much expense, 
but if you have already found one it doesn't matter. I would rather 
pay 60 francs. 

My dear friend, do pardon me for giving you all this trouble, but I 
simply have to. We shall meet again in a few days and I will embrace 
you for all you have done. Please, for God's sake, don't tell the Polish 
colony Tin returning so soon and not a word to any Jewish lady (I 
mean Mme Leo) for when I get back to Paris I shall probably want 

186 



to spend the first few days with no one but you, Grzymala and Johnny . 
Love to them both: I am writing to Grzymala. I am counting on 
finding a place ready for me. 

Yours 9 

Fritz 

Keep on writing to me, three times a day if you Eke, and whether 
or not you have any news. I will write again before we leave; I await 
your letter. Order the hat at once so that it may be ready in a day or 
two, and the trousers also, my dear Juliet. 

Fontana carried out his tasks manfully and found for George Sand a kind 
of double-mews flat at the back of 16 rue Pigalle, at the bottom of a garden 
away from the street. Chopin himself was to be lodged at 5 rue Tronchet 
(behind the Madeleine). They later found the distance between too 

great and Chopin moved discreetly into the second, smaller portion of the 
garden-dwelling at 16 rue Pigalle* 

150. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Monday [7 October 1839] 

You are invaluable! Take both the rue Pigalle dwellings without 
further inquiries. Hurry up ! Try to beat down the price if you can 
(point out that you are taking them both). If it is no good, take them 
for 2,500 but don't let them out of your grasp, for they seein to us the 
best and most perfect. She regards you as my best and most rational 
friend. And I added: "My most moody, huggable-and-lovable Anglo- 
Polish friend." 

Yours, 

F.Ch. 

We are leaving for certain in three days* time. Love to Grzymala 
and Johnny. 

151. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. 8 October 1839] 
My dear friend, 

The day after tomorrow, Thursday, we are leaving at five in the 
morning and on Friday at three or four (certainly by five) I shall be at 
5 rue Tronchet. Please notify the people there. I wrote to Johnny 
today telling him to engage the valet and to instruct him to be in 
attendance at rue Tronchet from midday. If you had time to look in 
about that time, we should be the first to embrace each other. You are 
a real good sort. Please accept once more the warmest thanks of my 

187 



companion and myself for discovering the place at me PigaHe. Now 
I must ask you (since 1 need trousers) to instruct the tailor to have the 
grey ones which yon ordered, and the waistcoat too if possible, 
definitely ready by Friday morning so that I can change as soon as I 
arrive. Tell him to bring them to me Tronchet and deliver them to 
Tineau, my valet, who is sure to be there already. (My valet's name is 
Tineau!!!) The same applies to the hat from Dupont's. In return for 
your doing all this I will alter the second part of the Polonaise for you 
as long as I live. 1 Perhaps you won't like yesterday's version of it 
cither although I racked my brains for about eighty seconds. My 
manuscripts are in order and carefully written out. There are six, 
including your Polonaises [Op. 40], but without taking account of a 
seventh, an Impromptu [in F sharp, Op. 36] which is perhaps a stupid 
thing I don't know, I've only just written it. But it will be just as 
well if it is not too much in the style of Orda, or Zimmermann, or 
Koiiski or Sowinski or swine-ski or any other beast-ski, for I reckon 
it might bring me in at least 800 francs we shall see. 

And do one other thing, my dear friend, since you are such a clever 
feUow; see to it that all bkck thoughts and exhausting coughs are kept 
from me in my new abode. Try to keep me well, and wipe out for me, 
if you can, many an episode of the past. It would be no bad thing if I 
could achieve a few years of great and perfect labour. Do this and I 
shall be in your debt just as much as if you were to grow younger 
yourself, or could even stop us from ever having been born. 

Your 

Old Friend 

152, To BBHTKQPF A.ND HARTEI IN LEIPZIG 

Paris. 14 December 1839 
Gentlemen, 

Having always been on the best of terms with you, I think I must 
give you a direct personal explanation of my position before breaking 
off relations. Mr Probst who has acted as our intermediary has just 
informed me that he wrote to you about my latest manuscripts and 
that, having had no reply, he believes himself authorised to refuse to 
pay the price of 500 francs per work. This price is one below which 
I should never consent to go. I have for disposal: a Grand Sonata, a 
Scherzo, a Ballade, two Polonaises, four Mazurkas, two Nocturnes 
and an Impromptu. 

1 Fontana had suggested an alteration in the D major section of the A major Polonaise, 
Op. 40, No. i, 

188 



Be so good. Gentlemen, as to let me know your attitude In this 
Blatter so that I can come to terms with you directly and without 
the services of an intermediary. 

Yours sincerely, 

F. Chopin 
5 rue Tronchet. 

A letter of 2$ January 1840 from the Countess d'Agoult to Liszt throws 

light on the above. She lias been told that "Chopin is said to ham to 
ask a friend (Probst, I suppose ;) for a loan of 150 francs. Moreover, he is 
said to have insisted on having the price of his works raised, whereupon the 
exasperated friend replied, 'Listen, I wished to spare jour feelings but you 
force me to speak. I have had a letter from Breitkopf telling me to buy nothing 
more from you except at a low price because nobody buys your works in 
Germany* " 

153. To BREITKOPF AND HARTEL, LEIPZIG 

Paris. 1 8 June 1840 
Gentlemen, 

As Mr Pacini is publishing a Waltz of mine [A flat, Op. 42] in the 
* 'Hundred and One" Album on the 30th of this month, I think I am 
doing the right thing in sending you a proof-sheet. I hope there will 
be no difficulty over publication the price being based on the rates 
last agreed by us. 

Yours faithfully* 

F. Chopin 

154. MARQUIS DE CUSTINE TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

[Saint-Gratien. 28 June 1840] 
Dear Chopin, 

Although you are accustomed to praise from me, praise which is the 
voice of truth, I cannot arise after a sleepless night without telling you 
of the passionate memories which will remain with me from last 
evening, I re-discovered you, complete, still more perfect and grown 
yet even more noble: time, aided by the power of genius, has made 
you all that you have it in you to become; this maturity in youth is 
sublime; it is the perfection of art: perhaps your long absence is the 
cause of the surprising effect you produced on me. I had not forgotten 
you, yet I blame myself for the kind of amazement that struck me on 
hearing you again. Can I have become ungrateful in my memories 
of you? There is nevertheless one quality which I thought I possessed, 

189 



one which you especially have developed in me, and that is the sense of 
which the pleasures of art fill me with. When once in his life 
a man of genius has given me aH the pleasure that a perfect work of 
art, of whatever kind, can procure, I should experience that same 
pleasure whenever 1 thought of him, even if he were to turn into an 
armless, stammering lunatic. Let that give you some idea of my 
gratitude towards you ! 

1 will add nothing more to this secret which I entrust to you: my 
heart was full and I had to speak, notwithstanding the contempt for 
mere words that you inspire in me words which alas ! are the instru- 
ment on which 1 must express myself. Have you never been tempted 
to smash your piano? I feel it must be so when you make me wish 
to cut out my tongue and throw my pen into the fire. A thousand 
friendly greetings. Until Thursday. 

A. de Custine 

Joseph Elmer had asked Chopin to try to havt his oratorio, The Passion 

of Our Lord, published in Paris. Chopin did his best, but without result. 
It should be noted that after the fatigues and expense of his visit to Majorca 
Chopin and George Sand remained quietly in Paris during the summer 0/1840. 

155. CHOPIN TO JOSEPH ELSNER IN WARSAW 

Paris. 30 July 1840 
Dear, dear Mr Eisner, 

I send you this note from Schlesinger. I will make no philosophical 
observations on its Jewishness but I must defend him a little, for it is 
true that large works such as your oratorio are costly to produce and 
do not sell, since apart from the Conservatoire no other institution 
performs such things. And the Conservatoire itself lives on old sym- 
phonies which the orchestra know by heart. The public has to think 
itself lucky if from time to time it is allowed to hear a bit of Handel 
or Bach. The taste for Handel only began to show itself two years ago, 
and even now the public can take only fragments never a complete 
work. For example, last winter they did a chorus from Judas Maccabeus 
once or twice, and one also (I can't remember which) from Bach. 
But since I have been here they have never done any great or lengthy 
work, apart from Beethoven's Mount of Olives which I heard once 
only. At their rehearsals they try out plenty of novelties, but the 
prevalent attitude is against the performance of great works other than 
the classics hence it will be long before we hear the works of Mendels- 
sohn, Schneider, Spohr, Neukomm or yourself; and if Cherubini were 

190 



not In command they would not play Ms works either. The Con- 
servatoire sets the fashion in serious music and so a publisher can count 
on no revenue except what the Conservatoire brings him. However, the 
Conservatoire has its own copyists. 

How 1 regret that I could not hear your oratorio in St Petersburg ! 
I am convinced that it surpasses everything of its kind. You will doubt- 
less have it printed in Germany, and I am sure that if it is given at 
one of those yearly musical festivals devoted to such compositions, 
which are held at Cologne, Mainz, Diisseldorf or Leipzig, I shall shortly 
be able to hear your masterpiece somewhere on the Rhine. Another 
country where they often give such oratorios and where they rightly 
hold these works in esteem and can easily assemble a thousand singers 
for their performance, is England. There Neufcomm or Mendelssohn 
are better known than Adam and Halevy. England will surely seize 
upon your work and we shall perhaps meet in Birmingham in that haH 
[the Town Hall] expressly designed for such things and where a few 
years ago Neukomm had an enormous organ installed; and I shall 
be able to sit beside you and admire and revel in something, the mere 
thought of which raises my spirits today. 

I hope to hear from you and in the meantime send you my warmest 
and most heartfelt greetings. 

Chopin 

My respects to your wife and Mme Nidecka. Orlowski is at 
Rouen, otherwise he would have added a few words. We have so 
often talked of you, precisely in connection with the Conservatoire. 
How often have we longed to hear your Offertory of St Joseph (if I ana 
not mistaken) performed by a body of expert string-players, in which 
the violins weave constantly in and out among the richest harmony. 
If ever you publish it please send me a copy: I will take it to Habeneck 
[conductor of the Conservatoire orchestra] and I am certain he will 
have it rehearsed, for it is short and useful for showing off the orchestra. 
Please do write, please, please. 

Although Chopin and George Sand remained settled in Paris during this 
summer, each of them made one or two short excursions. 

156. GEORGE SAND TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Cambrai. 13 August 1840 

Dear boy, 

I arrived here at noon, very tired, for the distance from Paris is 
forty-five leagues, not thirty-five. We shall have fine stories to tell of 

191 



the Cambrai bourgeoisie. They are a handsome stupid race of shop- 
keepers perfect specimens of the type. If the "Historical Procession" 

[a local pageant] does not console us we are ready to die of the polite 
boredom which surrounds us. We live like princes, but oh, what hosts, 
what conversations, what dinners ! When we are by ourselves it makes 
us laugh, but facing the enemy we cut pitiable figures. I no longer wish 
for you to come here: I am longing to get away, and now I begin to 
understand why my Chop, hates giving concerts, Pauline Viardot 
can't find a hall and may not be able to sing the day after tomorrow. 
We shall leave a day earlier. I wish I were well away from the ladies 
and gentlemen of Cambrai. 

Good night, Chip-Chip. Good night Solange and Bouli [Maurice 
Sand], I am ready to drop and must go to bed. Love your old mother 
as she does you. 

157. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDESYK IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 9 January 1841 
My dear Fryderyk, 

Your last letter reached us on Christmas Eve when we were gathered 
together for the customary supper-party, if you haven't forgotten, 
when we give your sister's children their Christmas presents. How 
delighted the darlings were to see so many toys for them. You would 
have loved watching them run from one thing to another, dancing 
up and down. But so much for that. I must only tell you that I had 
been rather worried for I couldn't imagine that you had forgotten 
6 December [the father's name-day] and I feared that poor health had 
prevented you from writing. . . . 

We are glad that you are being well looked after but we should 
very much like to know something of this intimate friendship. . . 

But the family were to learn few more details of Chopin 9 s relations with 
George Sand until three years later, when Louise and her husband came to 
see for themselves. 

On 26 April 1841 Chopin gave his first public recital for several years. 
He played before his own aristocratic public at PleyeVs rooms and had a 
resounding success. For the occasion Liszt, who happened to be in Paris, 
wrote, or rather had written by the Countess fAgoult, a long and flattering 
article, which was published in the Gazette Musicale. By this time 
George Sand and Marie d 9 Agoult had quarrelled irrevocably, and the article 
with its spiteful overtones must be read in connection with the following 
letters. 

192 



158. LISZT TO COUNTESS D'AGOULT IN PARIS 

Limerick, Ireland. 14 January 1841 

. . The Sand-Chopins are ridiculous. 1 am saving up a nice 
evening for them, but I don't agree that we should force them to an 
explanation. In such cases it is better to smile and deliver a more subtle 
blow. Don't worry, I shall look after that. . . . 

159. GEORGE SAND TO PAULINE VIARDOT IN LONDON 

Paris. 18 April [1841] 

... A great, astounding piece of news is that little Chip-Chip is 
going to give a Grrrrand Concert. His friends have plagued him so 
much that he has given way. However, he imagined that it would be 
so difficult to arrange that he would have to give it up. But things 
moved more quickly than he bargained for. Scarcely had he uttered 
the fetal Yes than everything was settled as if by a miracle. Three 
quarters of the tickets had gone before any announcement was made. 
Then he woke up as if from a dream; and there is no more amusing 
sight than our meticulous and irresolute Chip-Chip compelled to keep 
his promise. He hoped you would come and sing for Mm. When I 
received your letter destroying his hopes, he wanted to put off his 
concert. But it couldn't be done he had gone too far. He has thrown 
himself into the arms, I mean at the feet, of Mme [Cinri-] Damoreau. 
Mr Ernst will scrape his splendid violin, and so there you are. This 
Chopinesque nightmare will take place at PleyeFs rooms on the 26th. 
He will have nothing to do with posters or programmes and does not 
want a large audience. He wants to have the affair kept quiet. So many 
things alarm him that I suggest that he should play without candles or 
audience and on a dumb keyboard. . . . 

160. COUNTESS D'AGOULT TO HENRI LEHMANN IN PARIS 

Paris. 21 April 1841 

... A little spiteful clique is trying to resuscitate Chopin who is 
going to play at PleyeFs. Madame Sand hates me and we no longer 
meet. . . . 

161. MARQUIS DE CUSTINE TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Paris. Tuesday [27 April 1841] 

You have restored to me the memory of my happy days at Saint- 
Gratien and in Paris: I rediscovered you and with you the piano, 
without its tiresome features, without its meaningless notes, but with 

193 



the thoughts that you express in spite of the instrument itself. You do 
not pky on the piano but on the human soul. You delighted me as you 
did when 1 first knew you. I wish I were dying' you would restore me 
to life; for then you would come to me* I am still sure you would . . . ! 
Poland is only unhappy when taken as a whole; each one of her sons 
has his special lucky star which compensates him for the general mis- 
fortune, I am going far away and for a long time, and I should not be 
able to face the prospect of this renewed absence if I often had the 
hope of hearing you play as you did kst evening. Your charm and 
elegance attracted eery really elegant music-lover in Paris: you had 
a marvellously select audience, but when I myself hear you I always 
imagine that we are alone and perhaps even that I am in better company 
than merely yours ! or at least in company with all that is best in you. 
Forgive all this chatter; but these are things which I wanted to teU you, 
and in your presence I would not dare. You know that I am at your 
orders for anything. What you refuse to believe is that you have the 
same power over many others; I am angry on my own account but 
glad for your sake to observe how far you misjudged the public [i.e. 
underestimated public appreciation]. 

A. de Custine 
Tuesday morning. 

162. CHOPIN TO BRHTKOPF AND HARTBL IN LEIPZIG 

Paris. 4 May 1841 
Gentlemen, 

A few months ago I received from you a letter offering to publish 
my work as before [cp. letter 152] but in which you omitted to mention 
a Waltz [in A flat, Op, 42] published by Pacini in Paris which I thought 
it proper at the time to send to you. 

As I have now several compositions intended for publication 
(including an Allegro de Concert, a Fantasia etc.) I should like you to be 
good enough to discuss the sale of these new works and to send me a 
line concerning the Waltz, together with the fee for it, to be fixed 
according to the rate agreed for my last compositions. 

Yours sincerely, 
5 rue Tronchet. Chopin 

163. COUNTESS D'AGOULT TO LISZT 

Paris. Friday 7 May 1841 

. . . The Wasps [a satirical journal] says that at Mr Chopin's concert 
Mr L. [Liszt], who was not playing the piano but insisted on playing 

194 



part, rushed forward to support Chopin who was on the 
of collapse. The Intention and performance of the Chopin 
[which she had written for the Gazette Musical?] continue to be 

regarded as admirable. . . . 

164. COUNTESS D'AGOULT TO HEOTI LEHMANN IN PAHS 

Paris. 18 May 1841 

. . . Mme Sand, mortified by all these [Liszt's] successes has forced 
Chopin to give a concert at PleyePs rooms, in camera only friends 
admitted. . . . 

After his successful concert Chopin accompanied Mme Sand and lief 
children to Nohantfor the summer 0/1841. These regular summer vacations 
continued without interruption until November 1846. 

165. CHOPIN TO JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Early June 1841 
My dear friend, 

I am sending you 100 francs for various purchases. You should first 
of all take out the money for the Charivari [a humorous journal], then 
pay the rent (and that lamp !) and refund to the concierge any postage 
he has paid. Then there is the florist who has to be paid for six bouquets. 
Buy for me at Houbigant Chardin's in the Faubourg Saint-Honore 
some scented soap, 2 pairs of suede gloves (you will find an old pair in 
the cupboard to show them the size), a bottle of patchouli and a bottle 
of "Bouquet de Chantilly". In the Palais Royal, in the arcade on the 
theatre side, nearly in the middle, there is a large shop selling galanteria, 
as we call them: it has two windows showing various cases, trifles and 
knick-knacks, all brilliant, elegant and costly. You should inquire 
whether they have a little ivory hand for scratching one's head. You 
must have seen such an object sometime: it's a little hand, usually 
with clutching fingers, white, on the end of a black stem. I think I saw 
one there ask and they will tell you. Well, anyhow, look out for the 
thing and send it to me, but please note it must cost no more than 10, 
15, 20 or 30 francs. Ask Pleyel to give you a copy of my Preludes and 
get from Schlesinger my complete Studies. If my bust by Dantan is 
on sale at Suss's buy two and have them carefully packed for dispatch: 
if not, please go to Dantan who is in the Saint-Lazare district near where 
Alkan lives (give the latter my greetings if you see him) and ask whether 
the bust can be obtained, and where. At the same time remind him of 
the bronze copy he was going to have cast. 

H 195 



At the top of the cupboard you will find a flat tin bottle in a flannel 
cover for putting on one's stomach, filled with hot water, and also a 
new inflatable pillow which I bought for travelling. Add to this lot 
Kastner's Treatise on Counterpoint and send them when you have 
packed them up or rather there's a packaging-house on the other 
side of the street. Get them to fit the things into a suitable box, have 
them well packed and dispatch them by Lafittc and Cayard to the same 
address as my letters. Do please be quick about it. You can keep the 
rest of the money for other things that are to be sent. Don't pay 
Schlesinger, and don't delay the dispatch if he has not Kastner's book 
in stock. Anyhow do send Cherubim's Treatise I think on Counter- 
point (I don't know the exact title). If he won't let you have the 
Cherubim for nothing you will have to pay, for it is possible that 
Cherubini published it himself and that Schlesinger is selling on com- 
mission. 

I shall be sending you a letter for Troupenas in a few days* time. 
Good-bye for the present; the post is going. Forgive me, old man, 
but you will receive a letter on Sunday. Send the things on Monday. 

Ch. 

166. To JULIAN FONT ANA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Sunday [20 June 1841] 

I am sending you a Tarantella [Op. 43]. Be kind enough to copy it 
out, but first of all go to Schlesinger 's, or better still to Troupenas, and 
take a look at his edition of a collection of Rossini's songs which 
contains a TarenteUa (in A). I don't know whether it is written in 6/8 
time or 12/8. It can be written in both ways, but 1 should prefer it in 
the same way as Rossini. So if it is written in 12/8 or possibly common 
time with triplets, you should make two bars into one when you copy 
it out. You understand, don't you, dear fellow? Like this: 



And, moreover, please copy the whole thing out instead of putting 
signs for repeats. Be quick about it and hand it over to Leo together 
with my letter for Schubert [the German publisher]. You know he will 
be leaving Hamburg before the 8th of next month and I should not 
like to lose 500 francs. As far as Troupenas is concerned, you have 
plenty of time. If the time-signature in my manuscript is incorrect 
don't give him the piece but copy it out again, and then a third time 

196 



for WesseL You will be sick of this filthy copying but I hope 

I shan't write anything worse for a long time to come. Please a 
look at the last opus-number, i.e. the number of the last Mazurkas 
[Op. 41] or that Waltz [Op. 42] published by Patini and give the 
Tarantella the following number, I am not worried, for I know you are 
willing and able to help. I don't think I shall have to send you any 
further letter so packed with jobs to do. You would not have had all 
this trouble if I had been able to spend more time in my own place 
[5 rue Tronchet] before we left. Even now there is still something: 

Charles forgot the flannel-covered hot-water bottle. It looks like 
this [he gives a sketch]. If you fine! it in the cupboard, please send it. 
Buy me also a copy of Witwicki's poem ["A Pilgrim's Evenings 59 ] as 
I am without one. Go also to the Palais Royal, number 37 (I think), in 
the arcade on the theatre side, and buy me a plain smock at 14 francs a 
hunter's smock, buttoned in front like a shirt. If the number isn't 37 
it's 47 or 27 just an ordinary tailor's shop looking like this: [a sketch]. 
One of them sells these smocks: I bought one from him a week ago. 1 
It has pearl buttons, is neatly sewn, with two breast pockets, etc. [At 
this point Chopin crosses out the whole of this description and con- 
tinues:] Don't bother, my dear friend; I've changed my mind. If I 
need these things I will write. So get on with the Tarantella and hand 
it to Leo. Tell him to keep the money he gets for it until my return. 
I apologise once more for being such a nuisance. I received today one 
of the letters from home which you sent me. Tell the concierge to give 
you all letters that arrive for me. Don't forget me ! 

Yours,

[Nohant. 9 August 1841] 
My dear friend, 

Thanks for your kindness in performing all my errands. Today, the 
9th, I received the piano [sent by Pleyel], and those other things took 
only two days. Don't send my little bust to my family ; just leave it in 
the cupboard or they may become alarmed. Thank Johnny for his 
letter. I'll send him a few lines shortly. Tomorrow I shall certainly 
dismiss my old manservant who has gone all to pieces here. He is a 
decent fellow and knows his job, but he is slow and exasperates the 
people here. Yes, I shall dismiss him, telling him to wait for me in 
Paris. So if he turns up at the house don't be frightened it's the only

way to get rid of him; tell Mm to wait for me at home, and In a week or 
two you will have to write and tell Mm that I am returning later than 
I thought, or something elsc 9 and send Mm away with a blessing. 

By the way, the weather here Is only so-so. The man waited three 
days at Chateauroux for the piano; as soon as I received your letter 
yesterday I called him off. I don't know how the piano sounds for we 
have not yet unpacked It that great event will not take place until 
tomorrow. As for the claims against the transport firm, don't trouble 
any further It's not worth making a fuss. You did as best you could, 
A few moments of bad temper and a few days wasted In delay are not 
worth troubling about. Let us forget the whole thing now that It's over. 
So forget the tasks I gave you and your own problem too. Another 
time, please God, things will go better, I am writing these few lines 
late at night. Thanks once more for all your activities; they are stUl not 
at an end, for you will now have the Troupenas business hanging around 
your neck. I will write more fully about it later; now I wish you good 
night, and don't go and dream, as Johnny did, that I died. You should 
rather dream that I am being born, or something similar. I am In fact 
becoming as gentle as a new-born babe and if anyone wanted to take 
me around on leading-strings I should be very happy, provided 
please note that I had a well-padded cap on my nut, for I feel that I 
might stumble and fall at any moment. Unfortunately it's not leading- 
strings but crutches that await me if I keep on approaching old age at 
the present rate. I lately dreamed that I died in a hospital, and the Idea 
is so firmly planted in my mind that It seems It was only yesterday. If 
you outlive me you will learn whether one may believe In dreams : a 
few years ago I dreamed of something else, but it did not come true. 
And now I dream when wide-awake all sorts of nonsense. That's 
why I write such stuff to you. You agree, don't you? Send me soon a 
letter from home and love your old

Nohant. 18 August 1841 
My dear friend, 

Thank you for your kind letter. Open, as you judge necessary, all 
letters that arrive for me. Don't give the manuscript [of the Tarantella] 
to Troupenas until Schubert writes to give his date of publication. We 
shall surely have an answer soon through Leo. It's a pity that Tarantella 
went to Berlin, for, as you see from Schubert's letter, Liszt is mixed up 
in these money matters and that can cause me trouble, for he Is a 

198 



touchy Hungarian, ready to believe that, since I would not allow my 
manuscript to be handed over except for cash, I don't trust him, or 
something of the sort. I somehow feel there's going to be an unpleasant 
fuss. Don't mention it to Leo who is ill; go and see him if you get the 

chance and give him my compliments. Thank him (although 
is really no need to) and apologise for the trouble, for lie is anyhow 
courteous enough to undertake to dispatch my things. . . . One more 
job: copy out once more in your own time that wretched Tarantella 
to send to Wessel as soon as you know that date of publication. If I am 
wearing you out with this Tarantella, rest assured that it is the last time, 
I shall certainly be sending no further manuscripts from here. If there 
is no news from Schubert within a week, write and tell me, but don't 
worry Leo on my account. In that case you could hand the manuscript 
to Troupenas. But I will write to him about it. In the meantime 1 
embrace you warmly. 

Yours*

Write when you have a moment to spare. 

During this summer 0/1841 the calm surface of life at Nohant was ruffled 
by the behaviour of Mile de Rozieres, a piano-teacher and pupil of Chopin 
whom George Sand had engaged to teach her daughter Solattge. De Rozieres 
had become involved in an affair with Antoni WodziAski, Maria Wodzifa- 
skds brother, and was making an exhibition of herself . This was all very 
embarrassing for Chopin since it meant that de Rozieres would kam from 
WodziAski the full story of the engagement between himself and Maria and 
would doubtless pass it on to George Sand, with whom she was far too 
intimate for his liking. Matters were made worse when Fontana committed 
the indiscretion of giving to WodziAski, who was about to visit his family in 
Poland> a copy of the little bust of Chopin made by Dantan (see letter 16$). 

169. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Friday night [20 August 1841] 
My dear friend, 

Here then is the letter for Bonnot; read it over, seal and deliver it, 
and if as you walk along the streets (you already know which ones) 
where I might live you find something suitable for me, write and tell 
me. The condition about the stairs no longer applies. . . . Charles [his 
valet] must be back in Paris by this time. Don't say too much about me 
to Dessauer; don't even mention that I am looking for a place not 
even to Antoni, for he will tell Mile de Rozi&res and she will make God 

199 



knows what gossip and cackle about it, and the whole thing will come 
back to me here in a queer roundabout way . . . you know how they 
often make a mountain out of a molehill . . . you know how some 
story passes from mouth to mouth, grows enormous and becomes 
something quite different. I could tell you a lot, but I will only say that, 
starting from the most innocent things which 1 have written to you, 
fantastic stories have come back here, thanks to that person. 

I have not written to Johnny but tell him I will. What you write 
about Poland [i.e. the chance of a successful revolt] seems laughable. 
God grant it may come true, but I don't think so. As for that confounded 
Tarantella* you must have now given it to Troupenas (i.e. Mr Masset), 
so you can post it to Wcssel if you think that right. Instruct him to 
answer at once as soon as he receives it (and if Schubert still hasn't 
answered, send him a line to say that he must tell you immediately about 
the date of publication, then you can tell Wessel). You are having to 
write piles of letters but perhaps it amuses you. The weather here has 
been lovely these last few days, but my music is hideous. Mme Viardot 
was here for two weeks: we did all sorts of things other than music- 
making. Write and tell me anything you like but do write. I hope 
Johnny is well. But, but! Don't forget to write on Troupenas's copy 
[of the Tarantella]: "Hamburg, published by Schubert; London, pub- 
lished by Wessel". Tell Wessel to do likewise. In a day or two I shall 
send you a letter for Mechetti in Vienna: I promised him something. 
If you see Dessauer or Schlesinger, ask whether one must pay postage 
to Vienna. All my love: look after yourself.

Paris. 23 August 1841 

5 rue Tronchet 

[Written in fact from Nohant] 
Dear Mr Mechetti, 

I have at this moment a manuscript to place at your disposal. It is a 
kind of fantasia in the form of a Polonaise [Op. 44] and I shall call it a 
Polonaise. If the price of 25 louis for the German rights meets with 
your approval kindly let me know and indicate the arrangements for 
dispatch and payment together with the date of publication. If you are 
not interested, please write notwithstanding, so that I may dispose of 
my manuscript in another quarter. Kindest regards. 

Yours sincerely, 
Chopin 

200 



A thousand thousand fond greetings and respects to Mr and 

his family. 

The above letter was sent to Fontana in Pans at the as the 

following, written the next day; 

17L To JULIAN FONTANA IN PAWS 

Nohant. Tuesday [24 August 1841] 
My dear friend, 

I received today your letter about Troupenas. Thank you; 300 francs 
was the price. Thanks also for Albrecht's letter. You will have received 
my letter to Bonnot and will have found out whether postage to Vienna 
must be prepaid, won't yon? Or, if Dessauer has arrived, inquire from 
him how to send my letter to Mechetti It is a money-matter, so I should 
not like my letter to go astray somewhere in Austria you know how 
I enjoy writing. I am offering him a new manuscript (a sort of Polo- 
naise, but more of a fantasia). That's one thing: now for the second. 
Go to Roth with the enclosed letter, when you have read and sealed it. 
He lives in the rue Neuve des Mathurins, near you, in one of the new 
houses near the rue du Mont-Blanc you know where on the left 
after your place, that house with the splendid entrance where you go in 
slantwise, number 6 or 10. Well, the first vestibule after the main door, 
on the mezzanine floor, that's where Dr Roth lives. If he tells you he 
can get some Tokay, ask the price and write and tell me at once. I will 
send the money with instructions about dispatching the wine to 
Marseilles. You are efficient and decent: that's why I pile jobs on you. 
So far you have accomplished everything splendidly. But today I read 
in your letter one thing which, I can frankly say, displeased me (of 
course you couldn't be aware of it !) and that is that you gave my little 
bust to Antonl It is not because he has it, or because I needed it myself 
or attached any importance to it (in fact there's no need to order 
another one from Dantan), but because if Antoni takes it to Poznan 
with him there will be a fresh outburst of cackling and gossip, and I 
have had enough. That was the only reason why I did not trouble 
Antoni with any requests or little tasks could I indeed have found a 
better opportunity? But you see, Antoni didn't understand. And what 
if everything is told to his lady-friend [MUe de Rozires] ! Perhaps 
you understand! How strange it will seem to my parents that they 
should not be the first to receive this plaster cast. They will refuse to 
believe that I didn't give it to him myself. My name is inscribed in the 
records of the Wodzinski family as something other than a pianist. 

201 



There are certain persons who will look at the matter differently. You 
don't know them. Everything comes back to me here in a changed light. 
These are very delicate matters which mast be left undisturbed. Well, 
It's been done; but please, my dear friend, don*t mention to a soul what 
I have written : let It remain between ourselves. If I haven't crossed it 
out, it is because ! want you to understand. Don't blame yourself at all. 
Love me and write. If Antoni has not left yet, please leave matters as 
they are 9 or things might be made \vorse. He will teU MMe de Rozieres 
everything, for he is a decent fellow but so weak! And she has no 
discretion; she enjoys showing off her intimacy with him and poking 
her nose into other people's business. She exaggerates and makes a 
mountain out of a molehill not for the first time either. Between 
ourselves she is an intolerable old sow who by some strange chance has 
dug her way under my fence and grabbles with her snout looking for 
truffles among the roses. She is a creature to keep well away from, for 
whatever she touches brings forth unheard-of indiscretions, In fact, a 
regular old maid. We old bachelors are far better. 

Ask that good fellow Charles how long he was in my service and I 
shall willingly give him a reference. Greet him kindly from me. I will 
write to Johnny. Embrace him and give me your love. 

Yours, 
Ch. 

The part played by George Sand in all this is best revealed by her letters to 
Mile de Rozieres during the same period: 

Nohant. 20 June 184*1 

Let me tell you one of our secrets. A certain person here is irritated against you 
for reasons which I do not know. This attitude does not make sense and is 
almost like a disease. I really do not know how you have managed to wound 
him so deeply. He is full of spite towards younot that he says a single word 
which you might not hear. You know that he tas no real bitterness in his heart 
and, so far as you are concerned, he has no reason to have any. But my friend- 
ship for you and the way in which I have defended your rights to independence 
are crimes in his eyes. The same thing happens every time I speak up against his 
judgment and opinion on behalf of any individual; and the more I care for that 
person and the warmer my support, the greater is his mortification. If I had not 
for the last three years been a witness of these unbalanced veerings from sudden 
attraction to active dislike I should be baffled* but I am unfortunately too 
accustomed to them to doubt of their reality. So I took care not to speak to him 
of the chief topic of your letter or to read out any sentences referring to him. 
"We should have had a whole day of sulking, gloom, suffering and strange 
behaviour. I tried to bring Mm round by assuring him that Wz. [Antoni 
Wodzidski] would not come here. He went up in the air, saying that if I was so 



202 



sure It was apparently because I had told Wodziiiski the whole truth. To which I 
replied Yes -and I thought he would go crazy. He wanted to leave the house, 
saying that I was making him look like a ridiculous, jealous lunatic, I was 
causing trouble between Mm and his best friends^ that my gossiping with you 
was the cause of it all, etc. ... I can't ask you to come here into a wisps* next. 
You may well ask: Why is he annoyed, why is he set against you? Iff knew, I 
would know the source of this illness and I might cure it: but with such an im- 
possible constitution as his one can never be sure of anything. Two days ago he 
spent the whole day without saying a word to a soul. Had I said anything to 
upset him . . .? I shall never know. ... I shall continue to declare that 1 am 
writing to you and hope you will come. I don't want him to think tie is the 
master here. He would be all the more touchy in future, and even if he won this 
victory he would be furious at it, for he knows neither what he wants nor what 
he does not want, 

Nohant. 29 August 1841 

. . . You have never been anything but perfect for all of us and we have long 
known how to value you until a certain unexplained moment when, as die 
result of a mysterious piece of gossip or a still more mysterious whim, you be- 
came the subject of rather bitter argument on both sides, for I will neither put 
up with prejudice nor injustice. I am all the more astonished since Ms health is 
vastly improved and consequently his temper more even and amiable. He can 
be so pleasant when he wants to that most of my friends have come to adore 
him. But there are still one or two against whom he has unjustifiable prejudice. 
Will it all pass away with time? I keep on hoping so because his fundamental 
nature continually belies the rather crazy sufferings of his character. . . 

Nohant. 22 September 1841 

. . . No one here knew you were away [visiting Wodzdnski] I did not say a 
word. I think that if there has been, and still is, gossip, it comes from Mr 
Fontana who writes every week and whose letters (I don't know whether they 
contain news or tales) cause a decided change of temper. I only know this 
individual by sight but I beHeve him to be in a very bad way himself and always 
ready to make others pay for his own misfortunes. His character is perhaps more 
to be pitied than blamed but he does a lot of harm to the other one who has such 
a sensitive skin that a mere flea-bite causes a deep wound. 

172. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. Sunday 12 September 1841] 
My dear friend, 

I have received your letters and Dessauer's parcel. Haslinger is a fool: 
he wants to print or rather he has already printed and now wants to 
publish things which I gave him for nothing in Vienna twelve years 
ago [Sonata Op. 4 and lie "Swiss Boy" Variations]. How do you like 
that? I shall send no answer at all or else a stiffletter which I shall leave 
open for you to read if I do send it. As for Dessauer's illusions regarding 

H* 203 



Mechctti* that other Viennese publisher, 1 had a letter from Mile 
Miiller who tells me he would not pay Mendelssohn anything for a 
piece lie wrote for that same album for which I offered that Polonaise 
of mine [Op. 44]. 

Liszt's article [in the Gazette Mttsicale] about the concert for the 
Cologne Cathedral fund amused me very much complete with a list 
of the 15,000 people present* the president, vice-president and secretary 
of the Philharmonic Society and his grand coach (you know the sort 
of cabs they have there), and the river-port and the vessel ! One of these 
days he'U t e a member of parliament or perhaps even the King of 
Abyssinia r *ke Congo but as regards the themes from his com- 
positions, well, they will remain buried in the newspapers together with 
those two volumes of German poetry [written in Liszt's honour]. 

The medal with the Queen's portrait that Schlesinger says he has is, 
I swear, a guinea. Now for Antoni: I am convinced his illness is 
exaggerated. You wrote to me too late for anything to be done, for 
his tart [Mile de Rozi^res] had at once sent here to the Mistress of the 
House a sentimental desperate letter, full of confidences: that she was 
going to him; that she snapped her fingers at conventions, those 
precious conventions; that his family are brutes, savages, barbarians, 
with the exception of Nakwaska, in whom she had found a friend and 
who is lending her her governess's passport so that she may hasten to 
his rescue; that she has only time for a short letter (three full sheets!) 
since she does not know whether he is still alive; that she expected 
something of the kind after thek cruel adieus and the nights that he spent 
in tears- and so on and so forth. I would like to take a stick to the silly 
old fool! ! ! But what vexes me most is this: you know how fond I am 
of Antoni, and I am not only unable to help him but I appear to be 
lending a hand in all this ! I realised it too late and not knowing what 
trouble was in store or Her Ladyship's character, I introduced this slut 
to Mme Sand as a piano-teacher for her daughter. She has wormed 
her way in, and by pretending to be a victim of her love and to be fully 
informed of my past, thanks to members of the Polish colony whom she 
has met on various occasions, she has forced her way into Mme Sand's 
confidence and you wouldn't believe how cunningly, with what 
perfect skill she has managed to exploit my relations with Antoni. 
You can imagine how pleasant it is for me especially as Antoni (you 
must have noticed) loves her no more than he might love anyone who 
sticks like a leech and costs him nothing. With all his good nature 
Antoni has no strong feelings and is easily taken in, particularly by such 
a cunning schemer who, as you may imagine, is full of desire for him. 

204 



She covers herself by using Ms name, and proceeds from to 

me in (not that it matters) and s what is worse, Mme Sand. She to 

think that because I have been intimate with Antoni since childhood^ 
so [a whole sentence is here crossed out] . . . That's enough^ surely? 
Now to a more tasteful subject. 

I have had a bet and have lost a Strasbourg pate defoie. I am sending 
you 50 francs. Please go to Chevet's in the Palais Royal and buy one at 
30 francs. It must be large. He gets them from Strasbourg in round 
wooden boxes. Address it to me and dispatch as soon as possible by the 
stage-coach. If the 3G~franc ones are too smaU 9 pay 35 or 40; but it must 
be a splendid one. I am furious at having to spend so much on a pail 
especially as I need the money for other things. Post my letter to the 
German publisher. Love to Johnny. Give me a description of that first 
floor apartment together with the number and full details: What are 
the stairs Eke? Is the entrance near the stables? Is it tiring to climb up 
the stairs? Is the closet conveniently placed? Lofty ceilings? Any smoke? 
Ill-lighted rooms? I should prefer something in the rue du Mont- 
Blanc or the rue des Mathurins or on the boulevard near the Chaussee 
d'Antin. Keep enough out of these 50 francs to continue my subscrip- 
tion to the Charivari which I think expires shortly. Write soon. Shall we 
ever return to Poland? Have they all gone raving mad? I am not afraid 
for Mickiewicz; or SobansH they have steady heads and can stand a 
few more emigrations without losing their brains or energy. May God 
reward you for your kind friendship. Write and love your old friend 
as he does you, you old Englishman.

During the last week of September 1841 Chopin came to Paris for a few days. 
The next letter is one of the very few to George Sand which have survived, 
or at least have been revealed. It must not be assumed that all the others have 
been destroyed -from time to time tetters have been recovered, a fairly recent 
example being the famous "last letter' 9 written in July 1847 (see No. 277), 
Chopin probably kept every note or tetter that he ever received from George 
Sand. After his death his sister Louise took all these letters with her when she 
returned to Poland* She was stopped at the Austrian frontier-post and the 
letters were confiscated as suspect material In 1851 Alexandre Dumas the 
younger was delayed at this same frontier and had the luck to be allowed to 
read these letters. He at once informed George Sand of his discovery and at 
her urgent request he obtained permission for the documents to be returned 
to her.

My dear friend, 

I returned here yesterday, Thursday. I have composed a Prelude in 
C sharp minor [Op. 45] for Schlesinger: short, as he desired. Since this 
Prelude is to appear in the New Year at the same time as Mechetti's 
Beethoven Album, don't hand over my Polonaise [Op. 44] to Leo 
[who would send it to Mechetti] although you have already copied it 
out, for I shall write to Mechetti tomorrow to suggest that if he wants 
something short I will give him this new Prelude for his album instead 

206 



of that Mazurka he wanted and which Is already old. It Is well modu- 
lated and I have no hesitation in sending it. He can give me 300 for it 
(don't you agree?) and take the Mazurka into the bargain, provided 
he does not print it in the Album. If Troupenas (I mean Mr 
makes any difficulty, don't reduce the price by a penny. TeH him that 
it is possible he may not want to publish everything (anything he 
doesn't want I can sell dearer to someone else). TeH him that I am asking 
600, including the English rights for these manuscripts and that they 
are far more important than those previous ones. 

So much for me. Now, listen: in the drawer of my desk, second 
from the bottom on the right [here is a sketch of the drawers with one 
marked THIS ONE] you will find a sealed packet addressed to Mme Sand 
(in the place where the cash-box usually is). Wrap up this packet in 
oil-cloth and send it by stage-coach addressed to Mme Sand. Sew the 
address-label on with string so that it does not become detached. Mme 
Sand asks me to have this done and I know you will do it perfectly. I 
think there is another key on the top shelf of the wardrobe beside my 
shaving-brush. If it's not there, get a locksmith to open the drawer. 
Love to Johnny.

[Nohant. 6 October 1841] 
My dear friend, 

Thank you for sending the wallet. I am sending you the Prelude 
[Op. 45] written in large notes for Schlesinger and in smaller ones for 
Mechetti. You should cut my manuscript of the Polonaise [Op. 44] in 
the same way, number the pages, fold it like the Prelude, add my letter 
to Mechetti, seal in the envelope I am sending, and hand it over to Leo 
personally with a request to have it dispatched, for Mechetti is waiting 
for it. Post the letter for Haslinger yourself. If you don't see Schlesinger, 
leave the letter for him but not the manuscript until he tells you that he 
will accept the Prelude in settlement of my account. If he is not at aU 
interested in the English rights, tell him to write to me. And write your- 
self. Tell him I am not asking for immediate payment of the 100 francs. 

207 



Moreover, don't forget to add the opus-number to the Polonaise and 

the following number to the Prelude which you will send to Vienna. 
I don't know how one writes "Tchernischeff". Perhaps you can find a 
note from her or the governess or her daughter in the chest of drawers 
where the vase stands or on the little table near that bronze thing. If not, 
I think that (if you don't mind) you might go and see her at the Hotel 
de Londres, Place Vendonic you are known there as my friend if 
they are still in Paris* and ask her from me to have the young princess 
give you her name in writing' you can say why. Ask whether it is 
"Tscher" or "Tcher". Still better, inquire from Mile Krauze, the 
governess. Say you want to give the young princess a surprise and ask 
this Mile Krauze (she's very pretty) to write it down: whether the name 
is Elisabeth, and whether they write "Tschernischef " or with a double 
Tell her to mention it to the mother, but I would rather nothing were 
said to the daughter until I send the thing to her. If you would prefer 
not to do this, don't be afraid to say so. Write and say you would rather 
not and I shall find out some other way. But don't let Schlesinger print 
the title-page yet; tell him I don't know the spelling. All the same, I 
hope you will find somewhere a note from them with their name on 
it. As regards the removal of my furniture I am glad you have found 
yourself an apartment. You can have the sofa from the sitting-room, 
and send the rest to PeUetan, 16 rue Pigalle. You'll have to remove the 
bed from my bedroom, for it is settled that I am to live in one of the 
dwellings at 16 rue Pigalle. In fact there won't be much left for you. I 
will write later with full details. I must stop now as the post is going 
and I want to be certain that my letter will reach Vienna this week. 
All right: in an hour's time I shall write you another detailed letter 
about my afiairs, 

Yours, 
Ch.

[Nohant. 9 October 1841] 
My dear friend, 

You have surely received my letters and my compositions [Opp. 44 
and 45]. You have read the letters for Germany, sealed them and done 
everything I asked, haven't you? Now as regards Wessd, he is a fool 
and a swindler. Send him any answer you like, but tell him I have no 
intention of surrendering my rights in the matter of the Tarantella since 
he did not send it back in time. Tell him that if he has lost money 
over my compositions it is certainly on account of the ridiculous 

208 



titles 1 he has given them, in spite of my prohibition my 
rows with Mr Stapleton. You can tell him also if I listened to the 
voice of my conscience I wouldn't send him another after 

titles, TeE him off as best you can. 

As for the removal, Mr PeHetan at rue Pigalle has today been officially 
informed of it by Mme Sand. She thanks you for the polite note you 
sent with the wallet. Instruct them to have my letters delivered to 16 
rue Pigalle impress that very strongly upon the concierge. 

Mme Sand's son will be in Paris about the i6th and will bring the 
manuscript of my concerto [Allegro de Concert, Op. 46] and the Noc- 
turnes [Op. 48]. Write. We have rain and mud here. Love to Johnny. 
As for Antoni, I think I told you that he was not so terribly ill and that 
other factors were involved. We shall doubtless see him soon, before 
he has seen his own people. Love me as always and send rue a few lines. 

Yours, 

Fritz 
Saturday morning. 



178. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PAHS 

[Nohant. 18 October 1841] 
My dear friend, 

You have done everything well. What a world ! Masset is a fool, so 
is PeUetan. Masset knew about the Waltz [Op. 42] published by Pacini, 
and that I had promised it to the Gazette Muskale. I refrained from 
approaching Pacini before I mentioned it to him. If he is unwilling to 
pay 600 each, including the English rights, for these works (the price 
of my ordinary manuscripts was, to him, 300) then 3 x 5 = 15. 
But it is impossible for me to hand over so much work for fifteen 
hundred francs, especially as I told him (when I first discussed business 
with him) that the day might come when I might write works which I 
could not let him have at that price [300 francs]. For example, he 
couldn't possibly expect me to sell him twelve Studies or a Piano- 
Method for 300 francs. The same applies to the Allegro Maestoso 
[Allegro de Concert, Op. 46] which I am sending today he can't have 
it for 300 not less than 600. The same for the Fantasia [Op. 49] : at 
least 500. However, I will let him have the Nocturnes [Op. 48], the 
Ballade [Op. 47] and the Polonaise [Op. 44] for 300 each, since that 
was the sum he paid for similar pieces which he has published previ- 

1 Among the English titles which Chopin complained of were: "The Sighs" (Nocturnes, 
Op. 37 see Letter 321); "The Infernal Banquet" (Scherzo, Op. 20); "Souvenir of Anda- 
lusia** (Bolero, Op. 19); "Murmurs of the Seine" (Nocturnes, Op. 9). 

2O9 



ously. In short, 2,000 francs for the French rights of these five works of 
mine* If he Is not interested in them it will suit me (entre nous)> for 
ScMesinger will readily buy them. But I would not like Masset to con- 
sider me as a man who does not fulfil his undertaMngs. There was be- 
tween us only a gentlemen's agreement; so he cannot complain of my 
terms, which are very moderate, considering that it is a long time since 
I published anything. All I want to do is to escape decently from an 
awkward situation. I realise that I am not giving away my things for 
nothing. But tell him that if I wanted to exploit or cheat him I could 
write fifteen pieces of rubbish per year, for which he would pay me 
300 each, and I should thus enjoy a larger revenue. But would that be 
honest? Dear Julian, point out that I rarely compose and that I publish 
little: he must not think that I am putting my price up. When you see 
my manuscripts with their tiny notes (like fly-marks) you yourself will 
agree that I have the right to ask 600, when he paid me 300 for the 
Tarantella (I got 500 for the Bolero). For God's sake take care of my 
manuscript and don't squeeze or dirty it or tear it (things you can't 
help doing) but I must write about it for I love my "written sorrows" 
[there is a Polish pun here]. Get on with the copying out. The MS you 
have will remain in Paris, Tomorrow you will receive the Nocturnes 
and towards the end of the week the Ballade and Fantasia: I cannot 
give them enough polish. If you are bored with all this copying do it for 
the absolution of your great sins; for I should not Hke to trust this 
spiderVwcb of mine to some heavy-handed copyist. Once more I 
recommend it to your care: I should go mad if I had to write these 
eighteen pages out again. Above all don't crumple the pages! ! I am 
sending you a letter for Breitkopf. Do try to find me another valet like 
the one you have, I am certain to be back in Paris at the beginning of 
November. Another letter tomorrow. Write. 

Yours, 
Ch. 

Monday morning. 

On reading through your letter I see that Masset inquires about the 
French rights only: try to keep off this subject and press for 3,000 for 
the two countries [France and England] (but 2,000 for France only, if 
he insists on an answer from you) because the two-countries arrange- 
ment is easier for him and more convenient for me. If he won't accept, 
it will perhaps be because he is looking for an excuse to break with me. 
So let us wait for the answer from London. Write and let me know what 
you sincerely think. Always be very civil with him, my dear friend, 
civil and cold but not towards me.

179. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. 20 October 1841] 
I think it's Wednesday. 
My dear friend, 

Thank you for your kind note it's a pity we can't get things settled 
I am surprised that Masset imagines I will take less than 300 for a 
manuscript. And besides, since I will have nothing to do with London 
[Wessel], why 300 more for France and England? Swindlers! Jews! 
but let us say no more. I haven't yet considered approaching Schles- 
inger but since I shall certainly be in Paris about the 2nd or 3rd of 
November it will perhaps be better to hold back negotiations. I await 
your letter with full details, and I admit that it will perhaps be better 
that I should break away from these people and keep myself free. 

Once more I ask you to take care of my Allegro \de Concert], Don't 
show it to Wolff for he always grabs something and prints it before 
time, and don't trust his friend Meissonnier [a publisher] or anything 
connected with him remember Pociejow's [a cheap bazaar in War- 
saw]. Even if he did come into the business he would make matters 
worse instead of better. That is an axiom which you know as well as I 
do, so there's no need to write it but there is no point in crossing it 
out now. I won't be long in sending the other things. Today I finished 
the Fantask [Op. 49] the weather is lovely but I am sad at heart not 
that it matters. If it were otherwise, my existence would perhaps be of 
no use to anyone. Let us save ourselves up for life after death N.B. not 
in Leroux's conception according to him the younger a man commits 
suicide the wiser he is. Don't deduce any wrong ideas from that I'm 
just going to dinner. 

Your old

Write. Love to Johnny. 

180. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Wednesday [27 October 1841] 
My dear friend, 

We shall certainly arrive on Monday the 2nd [actually ist] at two in 
the afternoon, or perhaps five or six, allowing for unforeseen circum- 
stances. You offered me your help in arranging my things at rue 
Pigalle. I can't accept it, thank you. It would be asking too much of 
your kindness. But what I will ask is that you should be at rue Pigalle 
from two o'dock on Monday. Look in beforehand to see Pelletan 
[the owner of the house] and how things have been arranged. The man 

211 



Moreau and his wife, Mme Sand's servants, are there. She dismissed 
them from here and sent them to Paris, with permission to live in her 
house at rue PigaUe until they found another situation or a place to 
live in. If they are still there, you must see Pelletan (Mme Sand has 
written to him about this) and get them out before Monday; in fact, 
before Sunday, If Pelletan himself is very busy (he is bringing out a 
new paper, Le Dix-Neuvieme Sieck) come to an understanding with 
Mm and see that the windows are opened and the rooms aired (if it's 
not raining) particularly Mme Sand's quarters. Get them to light 

fires and stoves a few days in advance However, don't pot yourself 

out W e shall manage somehow my old proverb. Besides, time flies* 
all things pass away, death pursues us and my manuscripts are at your 
heels. Don't hurry with them, dear Julian, for I would rather that the 
Leipzig publisher should wait than that they [George Sand and her 
children] should find cold, dust, unaired rooms and dampness when 
they arrive at rue Pigalle. 

Don't worry about my rooms or where I shall sleep or anything. The 
day after I arrive I shall look after all that myself and I shan't give you 
any further trouble. I shall pay my debt to you some day when you need 
similar proofs of friendship. Your old bald pate shall join with my poor 
shrivelled nose and we shall sing: "Long live the Krakowskie Przed- 
miecie" to Blogoslawski's music with Krzysztofowicz as tenor and the 
late Lenz as accompanist. 

Your old 
Ch. 

Write today I mean Friday or not at all. 

Dear boy, go to my hatter Dupont, 8 rue du Mont-Blanc, and in- 
struct him to make me a hat for Monday. I always buy my hats there. 
They know me and don't need my measurements but the hat must be 
ready for Monday. Order the concierge at rue Pigalle to send no more 
letters here. 

181. To JULIAN FONTANA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. i November 1841] 
My dear friend, 

Thanks for Masset's letter. You have surely told him (but if you 
haven't, do so) that you wrote to me and that I am very sorry but I 
simply cannot accept. He must not take it badly if I have to make 
arrangements with someone else. As for the Prelude [Op. 45] for 
Schlesinger's Album, I spoke to Mme Masset the last time I saw her 
but don't bring up that business again. I am sending you the two 

212 



Nocturnes [Op. 48] and the rest on Wednesday. My departure Is 
delayed and I shall not reach Paris until some time between the 6th 
and 8th. Please get on with your copying, for winter is on the way. 
You will receive the rest in a few days* time. 

Your old

Do write, dear friend. Love to Johnny. 
Perhaps there are still a few sharps and flats missing. 

182. To BREITXOPF AND HARTEL, LEIPZIG 

Paris. 12 November 1841 
Gentlemen, 
I am sending you my four manuscripts : 

All de Concert Op. 46

2 Nocturnes Op. 48 
Fantasia Op. 49 

Please let me know as soon as you receive them, 

Yours most sincerely,

183. To BREITKOPF AND HAHTEL, LEIPZIG 

Paris. 3 December 1841 
Gentlemen, 

I have just received your letter with the draft payable on 13 Decem- 
ber, and I beg you to accept my thanks for your punctuality. Regarding 
the sequence of opus-numbers on the manuscripts, they are quite 
correct. [Breitkopf had wondered about Nos. 44 and 45.] Mechetti in 
Vienna has a Prelude [Op. 45] for his Beethoven Album and a Polonaise 
[Op. 44]. I have instructed Schlesinger to agree with you on a day for 
publication he has been engraving, and I imagine that you too will 
want to get on promptly with the business. 

\ am not sending the address of a London publisher since I am com- 
pelled to give up Wessel and have not yet made arrangements with 
anyone else but that should not stop you from proceeding. I would 
also request you to put on the title-page of my Nocturnes not Mile 
Emilia but Mile Laura Duperr. 

Yours most sincerely, 

F. Chopin

Oi 2 December 1841 Chopin played before Louis-Philippe's 

Court at the Tmkrks. Nothing more is knoum of this except that 

Chopin received a gift of Sevres porcelain. George Sand the 

In a to her half-brother: 

184. GEORGE SAND TO HIRPQLYTE CHATIION AT MONTGIVRAY 

Paris. 4 December 1841 

* . . Chip-Chip played at Court the day before yesterday. He was in 
a white tie and is not too pleased, Solange [her daughter] was kept in 
at school on Sunday for refusing to work and protests that she is the 
victim of injustice. My little Berrichon man-servant is kind and good. 
Our household is very economical and peaceful now that we are close 
neighbours with Chopin and he is much better for it too. A few fine 
ladies protested that the rue Pigalle was too far from their elegant 
districts. He answered: "Ladies, I give much better lessons in my own 
room and on my own piano for twenty francs than I do for thirty at 
my pupils* homes, and besides, you have to send your carriages to 
fetch me. So take your choice.** Several of them have chosen to come 
to him; several others pay thirty francs 1 and send their carriages to fetch 
him and bring him home. The dear boy is not sufficiently interested in 
money for him to have thought of this himself. It was I who suggested 
it and I have had a lot of trouble to make him agree. But I am very glad 
I did it, for with his poor health he must earn money at a high rate so 
as to be able to work less. Anyhow he is quite well now and so am I. 

185. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDESYK IN PAEIS 

Warsaw. 30 December 1841 

I received, my dear Fryderyk, your letter of 4 December exactly a 
week after my name-day. It gave me genuine pleasure and I thank 
you for your good wishes whose sincerity I cannot doubt, knowing 
your nature. May Heaven reward you, watch over you and keep you 

in the esteem of the right people. You inform us, my good lad, that 

you were at the Court soiree but that you were not in a good mood; I 
confess we were alarmed, fearing that you were unwell, although you 
assure us that your health is good. . . . 

I do not know whether Thalberg has already reached Paris; you will 
doubtless see him. I think that I pointed out in one of my letters that 
he showed us great consideration during his stay here; you will perhaps 
overcome your dislike of him I can assure you that he spoke greatly 

1 The equivalent today of at least seven or eight guineas. 

214 



to your credit. One thing that interests me is to know you 

have seen Liszt since Ms article [see page 192] and whether you are as 
close friends as you once were: it would be a pity if your 
had cooled off. By the way, speaking of him, I have been asked whether 
I knew that it was rumoured that he was to come here with Mme Sand 
all I could answer was that you had not mentioned it in your letter. 
If he does come here, I hope he will call on us and I shall give him the 
pleasure of playing on the instrument which gave such a melodious 
voice to your inspirations that happy time is past. Isabella takes great 
care of this instrument and would not part with it for anything. [It 
was destroyed in 1863.] 

. . One thing more: how do you come to be changing your man- 
servant? You were so pleased with Louis. I hope to God you have found 
a good substitute, for you need a man who can look after everything 
and be economical. I like to imagine that you remember to "save up 
for a rainy day" you see I haven't forgotten my old song. How are 
you in your new quarters? What sort of winter are you having . . .? 
I pass the pen to one of your sisters. 

[Louise's contribution (the greater part of her letter is concerned with 
domestic news from Warsaw) :] 

[Alexandra Mleczkowa and her mother] . . . told me they had heard 
that you are in high favour with the Queen and the Court and that 
you received a handsome porcelain service: they gave the other persons 
money, but dared not offer it to you, knowing that you would not 
accept it. But they say that, instead of taking the money, you asked that, 
if they wished to please you, they should send it here to your father. 

I burst out laughing in their faces if people must teE stories, they 
should at least be reasonable ones and sensible. Anyhow it's just as well 
that the public should believe that you can express a wish there [at 
Court] with the certainty that it will be granted. . . . 

Chopin s next concert took place on 21 February 1842* again at Pleyefs 
rooms, and met with the same brilliant success as the one he gave in 1841. 
It was to be his last public appearance until 1848. Pauline Viardot sang and 
Auguste Franchomme played 'cello solos: the audience was one of the most 
distinguished ever seen in Paris. 

On 29 November 1841 there had arrived in Paris the brothers Karl and 
Joseph Filtsch. The boy Karl, a prodigy if ever there was one 9 came to seek 
lessons from Chopin 9 who was amazed and delighted as soon as he heard 
him. The following letters from the two brothers to their parents in Hungary 
are now published for the first time: 

215 



186. JOSEPH FILTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 1 6 February 1842 

... It is amusing to see Count Apponyi [the Hungarian minister] 
cast reproachful looks around him and impose the most absolute silence 
on this circle of great people, dukes, princes and men of genius assembled 
round the litde fellow [Karl] at the piano, the Count himself sitting on 
his left. This house is most pleasant for us and we have become prime 
favourites. The other evening we had there Princes Kurakin, RadziwOl, 
Rassumoffsky, Tschemischeff. By the way we read that Rubinstein 
[Anton, then aged 12] is a sensation at Vienna but he did not have quite 
so great a success here. When I asked Chopin the reason, he replied: 
"Well, you see, the Parisian public is overwhelmed to an incredible 
degree by a crowd of virtuosi of all kinds and all ages, and people are 
no longer satisfied by relative perfection, since we have too much of 
that. What is needed for success is something perfect and then one is 
extremely sought after and appreciated." Chopin, who knows all 
these artists, great and small, is just towards them. But for intelligence 
and interpretative talent he puts our little Karl above them all. Hence 
Karl applies himself with all possible zeal and never misses a lesson. 

187. JOSEPH FILTSCH TO ms PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 8 March 1842 

. . Yesterday we heard Henri Herz. His execution is elegant, agree- 
able and coquettish, but without nobility. What a difference between 
him and Chopin, whose fingers sing and bring tears to your eyes, mak- 
ing anyone who is sensitive tremble with emotion. His delicate and 
slender hands cover wide stretches and skips with a fabulous lightness, 
and his finger agility is so marvellous that I am ready to believe the 
amusing story that he has been seen to put his foot around his neck! 
Moreover, it is only thanks to this flexibility that he can play black 
notes with his thumb or whole series of notes with two fingers only, 
passing the longer finger over the shorter and sliding from one note to 
another. His pianissimo is so delicate that he can produce the greatest 
effects of crescendo without requiring the strength of the muscular 
virtuosi of the modern school, and he produces marvels of nuance by 
the use of the pedal, both pedals together and by his unique legato. To 
his pupils he says: "Let your left hand be your conductor and keep 
strict time/* And so his right hand, now hesitant, now impatient, is 
nevertheless constrained to follow this great rule and never weakens 
the rhythm of the left hand. 

216 



Chopin pkys very rarely in public and gives few concerts, but when 
he does allow himself to be persuaded to play he is greeted with 
delirious rapture. As virtuosi, Liszt and Thalberg count for more, but 
Chopin enjoys quite as high a reputation: this is proved by the fact 
that he never gives a concert without making nine or ten thousand 
francs, the tickets costing 20 francs each. 

A Ballade in A flat and two Nocturnes [Op. 48] have just appeared 
and Karl is studying them with intense concentration. The other day I 
heard Chopin improvise at George Sand's house. It is marvellous to 
hear Chopin compose in this way: his inspiration is so immediate and 
complete that he plays without hesitation as if it had to be thus. But 
when it comes to writing it down and recapturing the original thought 
in all its details, he spends days of nervous strain and almost frightening 
desperation. He alters and re-touches the same phrases incessantly and 
walks up and down like a madman. What a strange unfathomable 
being! What an eloquent poet, noble in his every expression! What a 
tireless and patient master when his pupil interests him ! 

The fact that Karl is Chopin's favourite pupil is very important for 
his career. Besides, George Sand, with whom he lives, takes a keen 
interest in Karl, and the influence of this intelligent, kind and still 
charming woman is very great. The Master calls Karl "my little gamin 
who knows everything, copies everything and plays everything**. 
He turned to the ladies whom he had brought to his house (including 
the first ladies of the land, for Chopin never puts himself out except 
to go and play at the Tuileries) and, placing his hand on the boy's 
shoulder, said: "That, ladies, is what is called talent." Karl played die 
Thirteenth Nocturne [C minor, Op. 48] and Chopin came up to me 
and whispered, "No one in the world will ever play it like him . . . 
except myseE** Karl was asked: "Why don't you play the Nocturne 
in the same way as Chopin or your brother?" He replied, "I cannot pky 
with someone else's feelings." Even Chopin was stupefied by this bold 
and original answer which pleased him greatly, like nearly everything 
else the boy does. 

188. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 21 March 1842 
My dear Fryderyk, 

Your letter of 25 February gave us a double pleasure, firstly by 
calming our anxiety after these months of silence on your part. We 
should have been in a still more painful situation if Mme Wasilewska had 
not reassured us, thanks to letters from her son, who was very flattered 

217 



by the kind welcome you gave him. The second pleasure we received 
from your letter was to learn that you gave a musical evening which, 
judging from the newspaper cuttings you sent us, gave great satisfaction 
to your audience, I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart, 
firstly because your success proves how far you have maintained your 
position among performers, and secondly because of the money you 
have made. It will doubtless enable you to spend a few months in the 
country during the summer at a time when the number of your lessons 
is usually reduced, and when you can recover from your labours. . . . 
Liszt has not been here yet: they say he has left Berlin for Russia via 
Konigsberg and that we shall have the pleasure of hearing him on his 
return. I confess I didn't expect to hear what you tell me about him, 
and the reference to him and Thalberg in the article about your concert 
will not help much to bring you together again. In such circumstances 
what are you to do? You should act with your usual prudence and 
delicacy, without giving way. You can behave with dignity and let 
all the blame fall on him. So much for that, I would like to assure you 
that it would give me great joy if you did not leave me so long without 
news. I am just on seventy-two, so while I still have a little time left do 
let me have the pleasure of reading a few letters from you. Tell me 
about yourself and what you are doing they are the only things that 
can interest me. Summer will soon be here: what are you thinking of 
doing? Will you stay in Paris or go somewhere? Anyhow write, at as 
great a length as you have time to, but don't take up too much of your 
valuable time. Remember we don't forget you: your dear sweet 
mother is adding a few words, in spite of her weak sight which is 
rapidly declining. I take you to my heart. 

Ch. 

[Justyna Chopin's contribution:] 
My dear Freddy, 
At last after three months we have received from you the letter we 

were longing for You were much in my thoughts, dear child, on 

your birthday and name-day [i and 5 March] and I sent you my heart- 
felt wishes for your good fortune. God bless you and keep you in His 
care. My dear boy, I have a request to make, or rather a little matter to 
discuss, for a mother ought not to have to beg from her child: and a 
good and sincere child, if he can do so without interfering with his own 
needs (God forbid that he should have to borrow for it!), ought to 
answer frankly Yes or No. I hope you will behave in that way towards 
me if not, I would never mention the matter again. This is what it 
is: I have a debt of 3,000 dotys; your father does not know about it; 

218 



if he did, he would be terribly worried. Obviously the money te 

repaid, so if in the course of the year you can send it* not ail at 
but bit by bit, let me know through Barcinski. You will say to your- 
self: Now I see why Mamma urges me to save up ! But believe me, 1 
don't say it for my own ends bat for your good. I embrace you warmly. 

Your truly loving Mother 

At this time Jan Matuszynski, who had been living all Chopin 

had been associated with George Sand y was nearing his death from con- 
sumption. The sight of his friend's sufferings was most painful and depressing 
to Chopin. At length on 20 April 1842 Matuszynski died. George Sand gave 
an account of his end to Pauline Viardot: "A Polish friend* a doctor and 
former schoolfellow of Chopin, died in our arms after a slow and cruel death-- 
agony which caused Chopin almost equal suffering. He was strong, brave and 
devoted more so tfian one might have expected from such a frail being. But 
when it was over he was in a state of collapse. He is beginning to revive some- 
what and I hope that Nohant will restore him, as far as possible, to health."

Nohant. 9 May 1842 
Darling, 

Quick! To work! Your master, the great Chopin, has forgotten 
something which he is very anxious to do to buy a present for 
Framboise, my faithful servant, whom he adores, and quite rightly too. 

He therefore asks you to send at once five yards of lace, two inches 
wide at least, costing about 10 francs a yard; also a shawl of any material 
you like, at about 40 francs. [Here follows a description of the shawl 
required.] Such is the splendid present which your honoured master 
asks you to buy, with an eagerness worthy of the impetuosity he shows 
in all his gifts and of the impatience he brings to the smallest matters. 

190. CHOPIN TO WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Nohant. Tuesday [31 May 1842] 
My dear friend, 

I hope this letter finds you in better spirits than my previous one. 
My health here is so-so. Lovely weather. Tomorrow or the day after 
we expect our good friend Delacroix. He will have your room. Forgive 
me for asking you again to send off my letter to the Viennese publisher 
[Mechetti]. But I think that postage has to be prepaid on letters to 
Austria. They will tell you at the post office in the Place de la Bourse. 

219 



I am asking you to do me this favour as the packet contains my pain- 
fully written manuscripts [of Three Mazurkas* Op. 50] and I don't wish 
to expose them to any risks. This is the last time I shall trouble you 
with such a task I know you don't like it. May aU go well with you. 
Keep well and don't worry. 

Your old 
CL 

191. EUGENE DELACROIX TO ms J. B. PIERRET IN PARIS 

Nohant. 7 June 1842 

. . . This is a delightful place and my hosts do everything in their 
power to make life agreeable. When we are not together for dinner, 
lunch, billiards or walks, one can read in one's room or sprawl on one's 
sofa. Every now and then there blow T s in through your window, 
opening on to the garden, a breath of the music of Chopin who is at 
work in his room, and it mingles with the song of the nightingales and 

the scent of the roses. You see that so far I am not much to be pitied 

22 June 1842 

It is like living in a convent: one day just like another. Nothing 
occurs to alter the regular course of the day. We expected Balzac, but 
he hasn't come and I can't say I'm sorry. He never stops talking and 
would have spoiled the carefree and easy atmosphere which I enjoy 
floating in. ... I have endless conversations with Chopin, of whom I 
am very fond and who is a man of rare distinction. He is the truest 
artist I have ever met, one of the few whom one can admire and 
value. . . . 

Chopin and George Sand had decided that their joint quarters in the 
buildings at the back of 16 rue Pigalte were too cramped: the rooms were, in 
fact, tiny. It may also have been embarrassing for them both to have exactly 
the same address. So at the end of July they came to Paris on a house-hunting 
expedition and were rewarded by jinding excellent accommodation, George 
Sand at No. 5 and Chopin at No, 9 Place d'OrUans, a handsome block of 
buildings grouped round a large open courtyard, with a carriage-entrance in 
the rue Saint-Lazare. The leases were signed on 5 August 1842. It was during 
this trip to Paris that Delacroix made his drawing of Chopin as Dante, on 
which he based his head of Dante in his paintings for the cupola of the Chamber 
of Peers at the Luxembourg Palace. On his sketch Delacroix has written: 
"Dear Chopin ". In the meantime young Karl Filtsch was announcing to his 
parents: "Liszt is being so kind as to give me lessons until Chopin returns." 
This was a dangerous situation which could easily lead to trouble! 

220 



192. JOSEPH PUTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 19 August 1842 

. . . Karl's health is good; he is no longer thin $ which Is a supreme 
consolation, and he gives great pleasure to his teacher per the 

great Liszt a conquest which I am happy to be able to claim for 
myself without any assistance apart from the genius of our Karl, who 
works miracles by the originality of his talent as well as by the amiability 
and graceful innocence of his manners: two qualities whose irresistible 
union captivates everyone and brings Mm as much friendship as 
reputation. Liszt has expressed this not only privately but publicly, 
adding these words: "I have not the honour of being his teacher 
Chopin may claim that but his master's absence gives me a chance to 
hope that I may aspire to this honour later." Liszt is so affectionate with 
Karl that he calls him by no other name than a son~in-law'*. I must tell 
you that he has two charming daughters, prodigiously beautiful, who 
live with his mother, Mme Liszt. . . . [At a grand soiree] everyone pro- 
claimed Karl as Liszt's successor, whereupon Liszt, alluding to his 
"son-in-law" joke, retorted that he had much more selfish views about 
the heir presumptive to the throne of pianism. Everyone laughed, and 
I laughed inwardly, far more than my outward expression betrayed. 
After all, I must add that Liszt gives his lessons free. He lays down this 
unshakeable condition, saying it is his patriotic duty, a service he owes 
to his pupil's remarkable talent and finally he has adopted this method 
of increasing and enhancing his own reputation, . , . I racked my 
brains to know what to do when Chopin on his return would find 
Liszt giving Karl lessons ! To understand my embarrassment you must 
know that Liszt and Chopin have quarrelled over a love-affair for the 
same person [Kitsch is quite wrong here!] and it would be useless to 
expect a friendly settlement [of Karl's lessons] for one has to know 
these extraordinary people in order to realise how complicated the 
matter was. We could not have avoided offending one or the other. In 
any case it was bound to happen with Liszt because, great executant 
though he is, he cannot equal Chopin as a teacher. I do not mean that 
Liszt is not an excellent teacher: he is the best possible until one has 
had the good fortune of knowing Chopin, who is, in the matter of 
method, far ahead of all other artists. However, I was in danger of 
offending Liszt since he enhanced the value of his lessons by a generosity 
as rare as it was flattering, whereas the other [Chopin] strictly claims 
his 20 francs. 1 In a word, it was a most embarrassing situation and I was 

1 In fairness to Chopin it must be made dear that he understood that all Karl's fees were 
being paid by his patroness, the wealthy Countess Banfiy. 

221 



at my wits' end to find a satisfactory solution when Liszt, with his 
artistic instability, suddenly resolved to leave Paris and go to Germany. 
He did not even notify us of Ms intention at the last lesson. Fortunately 

on that same day we were at Mme Liszt's and she informed us of her 
soil's abrupt, but far from extraordinary, departure. 

193. NICHOLAS CHOPIN TO FRYDEIYK IN PAHIS 

Warsaw. 16 October 1842 
My dear Fryderyk, 

If I have been a long time in writing to you it is not because of my 
indifference or any illness but because we have been waiting for your 
sister [Louise] to return. I wanted her to have a chance of writing to 
you; knowing she had seen the Wodzinski family, I thought she might 
have some news for you. We were glad to learn from your last letter 
that the country air has fortified your health, that you hope to get 
through the winter satisfactorily and that you have changed your 
apartment, your other one being too cold. But won't you be by your- 
self if other persons don't change too? You say nothing of this. [He goes 
on to speak of Antoni Wodzinski.] 

So you found yourself at a dinner-party with Liszt? I know how 
circumspect you are and you are quite right not to break with him, in 
spite of all his boasting; you were once friends and it is a fine thing to 
be his rival in tact. I am not surprised that you did not answer the 
invitation of a certain committee [for the Beethoven memorial at Bonn, 
Liszt also being involved]. You would have been considered as trying 
to push your way in after other people I need not point out examples 
of that kind of thing. . . . 

As for ourselves, I can say that, if it were not for my cough which is 
daily becoming more unbearable, I should be reasonably well. Your 
dear sweet mother is quite well this autumn. I don't go out much, 
except into our little garden, where we have had various kinds of 
fruits, including a few bunches of grapes which I looked after and which 
ripened perfectly. It brings back to my mind the fine days of the grape- 
gathering [in his native France], You must have certainly enjoyed this 
fine weather. Now that you are back home from the country don't 
forget to write to us. ... 

Louise s and Isabella's long contributions to this letter contain little that 
concerns Fryderyk directly. Louise mentions that Antoni Wodzinski has 
married a Polish girl and thus Mile de Rozieres has been wasting her time 
with her idealistic and pathetic letters to him (see letter 172). This thoroughly 

222 



unsatisfactory marriage is regarded by Louise as a of tlic 

WoJzinskis for their behaviour in 1836-7 was engaged to 

Maria. 

194. JOSEPH PUTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 9 November 1842 

. , . Two days ago we were at an evening party at George Sand's. 
Karl and Pauline Viardot were the performers. The latter is the sister 
of the great MaHbran, but she is herself one of the first singers in the 
world for musical talent and intelligence; this surpasses even what she 
does as a pianist. Chopin was in excellent spirits, beaming with joy at 
the success of his little pupil, who was kissed by Sand, Viardot and 
everyone. 

195. GEORGE SAND TO CHARLES DWERNET 

Paris. 12 November 1842 

. . . We have also taken up billiards: I have a nice little table which I 
hire for 20 francs a month. It stands in the drawing-room, and thanks 
to our friendly intercourse we achieve something of our Nohant life 
in this gloomy Paris. What gives a country air to our existence is also 
the fact that I live in the same Square as the Marliani family. Chopin is 
in the next building, so that without leaving this spacious Cour 
d'Orleans, which is well-lighted and has well-sanded paths, we can run 
along to each other's houses in the evening like regular country neigh- 
bours. We have had the idea of organising a single kitchen and having 
our meals together at Mme Marlianf s [at number 7]. It's more economi- 
cal and better fun than each one keeping to himself. It is a kind of 
socialist community which amuses us and guarantees us more indi- 
vidual liberty. . . . 

The letters of the Filtsch brothers correct, after ninety years, the totally 
unreliable and exaggerated "memories" of Wilhelm von Lenz in his book 
The Great Piano Virtuosi of Our Time published in 1872 and in his 
articles in the Berliner Musikzeitung: 

196. KARL FILTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 30 [actually 29] November 1842 

... Mr Kalkbrenner has invited us to dinner next Sunday. Yesterday, 
as I was having my lesson with Chopin, several ladies and gentlemen 

223 



came to hear me play Chopin's concerto. I played the solo part and 
Chopin the orchestral part. I had the pleasure of meeting Baroness 
Rothschild and there were also present Count Apponyi, Meyerbeer, 
the ambassadors of Saxony and Hanover and others. Chopin, who 
never goes into society, is so kind that he takes us everywhere to 
introduce us to famous people. We dined yesterday with George Sand 
and she gave me Chopin's bust and several other souvenirs which filled 
me with joy, 

[Joseph FUtsch continues:] I wrote to you about a concerto by 
Chopin that is the one Karl was playing with Chopin last Friday 
[25 November] when a visitor was announced. It was the Hanoverian 
ambassador. "Oh ! come in," said Chopin, and Baron Stockhausen flung 
himself into Chopin's arms and gave his hand to Karl, whom he had 
met at Count Apponyi's. He had become an admirer of Karl's and asked 
Chopin to let the lesson proceed. He enjoyed the concerto so much 
that when we were aH at Count Apponyi's that same evening he 
pressed us to give the Count an opportunity of hearing it. Chopin 
came in shortly afterwards and had to promise that the concerto would 
be played at his house on Monday during Karl's lesson. And so the 
Count and Countess, their son and daughter-in-law, their daughter, 
the ambassadors of Saxony and Hanover, Baroness Rothschild, the 
great Meyerbeer, etc, came to hear the concerto. Karl played alternately 
Eke an angel and Hke a little devil. Everyone was delighted : dear Chopin 
touched and flattered, myself happy, and Karl dignified and serene. 
The most striking moment was when Meyerbeer took him in his 
arms: this was more impressive than aH the embraces of ladies, 
ambassadors, etc., who gazed wide-eyed at each other and flung 
themselves on Karl. Mr Rothschild adored Mm and tries to win him 
away from our ambassador, I need hardly say that the Rothschild 
ladies have invited us. ... Anyhow it was a great day and you may 
judge how Karl is progressing and what a lofty position Chopin 
occupies. We dined that same evening with Chopin at George Sand's 
house. He later took us to an evening party at which only Poles were 
present: people who used to fill the highest places in the kingdom 
and who, after their unhappy revolution, have taken refuge in Paris, 
where they have met with a cordial reception. I need scarcely say that 
Karl made as great a sensation in the evening as he had in the afternoon. 
Chopin brought us home in his carriage, and we went to bed full of 
gratitude for the outcome of this successful day. The next day Chopin 
sent Karl a large engraving of himself [probably the Vigneron portrait 
of 1833]- 

224 



197, JOSEPH FILTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 30 November 1842 

. . . Never have I seen Chopin so moved as at the last lesson. Karl 
played Chopin's Grand Concerto in E minor* a piece which calls for 
both perfect technique and perfect interpretation. He concluded the 
first movement, played the Andante and then attacked the Finale with 
an execution so perfect, so intellectual, that I was amazed at the Master's 
silence and felt really vexed. I was ready to accuse him of mere 
capriciousness 9 when I realised my mistake he was actually weeping 
and could not speak. He took my hand and uttered a single word: 
"Unbelievable/* When he had recovered his composure he turned to 
Karl and said, "Very good, my boy. Some things are exceEent, 
others are not so good,** etc. (I repeat his exact words so that you may 
see what an excellent teacher Chopin is. . . .) 

198. CHOHN TO MME BELLEVILLE-OURY IN LONDON 

[Paris. 10 December 1842] 
Madame, 

I am most grateful to you for your charming letter, and you would 
have received an answer together with a manuscript for Mr Beale [of 
Cramer and Beale] if I had not promised my new compositions to Mr 
Wessei As for the little Waltz [in F minor, Op. 70, No. 2] which I have 
had the pleasure of writing for you, please, I beg you, keep it for 
yourself: I should not like it to be made public. What I should like, 
however, would be to hear you play it, Madame, and to be present at 
one of your elegant assemblies where you interpret so marvellously the 
Masters we all recognise, all the great composers like Mozart, Beet- 
hoven and Hummel. HummeFs Adagio, which I heard you play at 
Erard's in Paris some years ago, still rings in my ears, and I can assure 
you that, in spite of all the grand concerts here, few piano performances 
can make me forget the pleasure of having heard you that evening. 
With my best respects and friendly greetings to Mr Oury, 

Yours truly, 
F. Chopin 

199. To BREITKOKF AND HARTEL, LEIPZIG 

Paris. 15 December 1842 
Gentlemen, 

I should like to offer you a Scherzo [Op. 54] for 600 francs, a Ballade 
[Op. 52] for 600 francs and a Polonaise [Op, 53] for 500 francs. In 

225 



addition I have written an Impromptu [Op. 51] of a few pages which I 
do not even put forward to you I wished to oblige an old acquaintance 
who for the last two years has teen urging me to give something to 
Mr Hofmeister. I only mention it so that you may understand my 
intentions in the matter. 

If my Scherzo, Ballade and Polonaise are acceptable, please let me 
know by next post and suggest a time for their despatch. 

Yours sincerely, 
F. Chopin 
Place d*Orl&ns, 
Rue Saint-Lazare. 

200. JOSEPH FILTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 30 December 1842 

. . . Today we are dining with George Sand and then we shall go 
with Chopin to visit Mme de Courbonne. George Sand loves Karl 
devotedly and so I encourage as much as I can this maternal feeling 
which cannot do any harm. She is very pleasant to me too and observes 
a certain reserve in consideration of my age and my position with 
regard to Karl. Her real name is Baroness Dudevant, and in spite of her 
35-37 years she is still interesting and preserves as best she may the 
remains of her former beauty. With all her intelligence she seems to 
me very touchy and extremely capricious, not easy to live with and of 
a teasing disposition (qualities which the Filtsch brothers have 
naturally not had to experience). But since I have been playing chess 
fairly often with Chopin I have been close to this genius too often 
not to become aware of the other side of the coin. Anyhow she has a 
very pretty house. From the entrance one proceeds straight to her 
large drawing-room with its billiard-table. On the mantelpiece stand 
the things a smoker requires and she is the first to light up her cigar. 
It is here that she prefers to meet her literary friends, among others 
Heinrich Heine, who is a most eager listener when Chopin allows 
himself to be led to the piano in a little side-salon. After letting his 
hands wander dreamily over the keys for a few moments he suddenly 
wakes up, and then his playing is stupefying and unbelievably moving 
in the almost complete darkness his varied inspirations now lull us, 
now electrify us, or throw us into the darkest recesses of our own 
thoughts. 

Sometimes Chopin does not appear at aU and then George Sand 
becomes anxious and asks the servant what he is doing, whether he is 
working or sleeping, whether he is in a good or bad mood. Sometimes 

226 



Chopin Is persuaded to amaze us by his talent for mimicry and imita- 
tions a talent which he possesses in the highest degree* At times in a 
fit of gaiety he takes off ridiculous personages, even to the of 

disappearing into the little salon and coming back a moment later so 
amazingly transformed that his features have become unrecog- 
nisable, . . . 

201. JOSEPH PUTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. [20] January 1843 

. . . The soiree at the Rothschilds this evening was brilliant in every 
respect: Lablache, Grisi, Mario, Pauline Viardot, Chopin and Karl 
were the artists and the boy had a fabulous success. He again played 
Chopin's concerto on two pianos with Chopin and was literally 
smothered with caresses by several ladies among the assembly of about 
five hundred persons. 

It will be remembered that at the beginning of his career Chopin had had 
to contend with the malignant attach of the German critic Ludwig Rellstab 
(see p. 120). By 1843 the tables were completely turned. Chopin was now 
famous and Rellstab, before visiting Paris, felt it wise to call upon the diplo- 
matic skill of Liszt in order to avoid any unpleasantness. 

202. LISZT TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Poznan. 26 February 1843 

There is no need for a go-between where you and Rellstab are 
concerned, my dear old friend. Rellstab is too distinguished a man and 
you for your part are too well-bred for both of you not to get on well 
together, and from the very outset however hard it may usually be 
for artists and critics to agree. But since Rellstab is kind enough to 
accept these few lines from me I entrust him with the special task of 
remembering me to you; and I should like to take this opportunity of 
repeating, although at the risk of seeming monotonous, that my 
affection and respect for you will remain unchanged and that, as your 
friend, I am always at your service. 

F. Liszt 

By Hand (Mr Rellstab) 

203. JOSEPH FILTSCH TO HIS PARENTS IN HUNGARY 

Paris. 26 April 1843 

. . . Karl's concert [at Erard's on 24 April] was a brilliant success. 
Everyone was there and the net receipts were 2,000. Thanks to Chopin's 

i 227 



intervention the journalist Patty from London and ReUstab from 
Berlin were there and both praised him to the skies in their notices. 
[Karl pkyed Chopin's Nocturne in C minor and some Studies.] The 
day after tomorrow we dine with Chopin at the Duchess of Osmond's. 

204. GEORGE SAND TO SON MAURICE IN PARIS 

Nohant. 6 June 1843 

. . . While awaiting your arrival, Chopin and I go for long outings 
he riding on his donkey, I on my own Iegs 3 for I feel the need to walk 
and breathe. Yesterday we went to Montgivray where we found the 
whole family assembled, except for poor Hippolyte [her half-brother]. 
Everyone was merry in spite of (one might almost say because of) his 
absence. . . . 

Old Gatieau [Chopin] is well. I must mention one of his scruples; it 
will make you laugh. He wouldn't make use of your little French 
velvet saddle for his donkey. It was no good my telling him you 
couldn't use it again. He insists on buying it. I hope you will send him 
packing but you won't be able to stop him from giving you a present 
in exchange. . . . 

205. GEORGE SAND TO THE ACTOR PIERRE BOCAGE IN PARIS 

[Nohant. Summer 1843] 

... As for the jealousy of a certain young man [Chopin] over a 
certain old woman, it is calming down it had to, for lack of sus- 
tenance. But I cannot say this malady is completely cured or that one 
does not need to spare it by concealing the most innocent things. The 
old woman had made the mistake of supposing that sincerity and 
honesty of purpose were the best remedies. I have advised her to say 
nothing of the letter from a certain old fellow [viz. Bocage, himself a 
former lover] for whom she can easily preserve in silence an eternal 
and loyal friendship. 

206. GEORGE SAND TO CARLOTTA MARLIANI IN PARIS 

Nohant. Saturday 12 August 1843 
Dear good friend, 

Chopin has suddenly made up his mind to go to Paris for two or 
three days to see his publisher and discuss business. He will bring back 
Soknge [her daughter who was at a boarding-school] whom I expected 
Mme Viardot might have brought back with her, but it appears that 
the latter *s arrival in Paris will be delayed for a few days. Chopin is 

228 



leaving on Sunday and will reach the Square d' Orleans on Monday 
morning between nine and ten or eleven. Would you be 
to ask Enrico [Marliard's brother-in-law] to notify the porter at No. 5 
so that Chopin will find his room open, aired and with hot water for 
washing. If the porter at No* 9 [Chopin's place] is still the same one 
(God grant he is!) Chopin will doubtless need him for errands and 
Enrico would do well to notify him too. I am glad that Chopin will 
give me an account of your health when he has seen you with his own 
eyes. ... If you are free and undisturbed it would be a good idea to 
come and see us, with Chopin as your escort. 

207. CHOPIN TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Monday [14 August 1843] 

Well, I arrived at eleven and went straight to Mme Marliani's where 
we are both writing to you. You will see Solange at midnight on 
Thursday. There were no seats in the coach for Friday or Saturday 
nothing before Wednesday, and that would have been too late for us all. 
I wish I were back, as you may well imagine, and I am glad that cir- 
cumstances have obliged me to return on Thursday: see you on 
Thursday then; tomorrow I shall write again if I may. 

Your very humble servant, 

Ch. 

Bouli, I send you all my love. (I have to choose words I know how 
to spell.) 

208. To AUGUSTE LEO IN PARIS 

Nohant. 2 October [1843] 
Dear Mr Leo, 

I have just returned from a few days' excursion along the banks of 
the Creuse very picturesque but rather tiring and I found your letter 
awaiting me. I was very glad to hear that the Moscheles family were 
with you I thought I might take advantage of their visit but when I 
read on and found that they are only staying until the 5th my joy 
turned to sorrow. You know how I love and admire Moscheles, and 
you will understand better than anyone my regret at not being able to 
come to Paris immediately. I should have to leave tomorrow at the 
latest in order to get there in time. I hope Mme Leo has benefited from 
the sea-side, your charming family too and that you had as fine a 
September as we have had here. 

Mme Viardot, who has just spent a few weeks with Mme Sand, had 
hardly a couple of singable days the weather was so tempting that we 

229 



were constantly out of doors. Autumn is usually the best season In 
Berry, and so I shall be staying on for some time. I am addressing my 
letter to you at the rue Louis-le-Grand, not knowing your correct 
number in the rue Saint-Honore. I am sure you will receive it 
since I received yours* notwithstanding the fantastic address you put 
on it. 

My best respects to your wife and to the Moscheles family. 

Yours most sincerely, 

F. Chopin 
Chateau de Nohant, 
near La Chatre, Indre. 

209. TO W0JOECH GUZYMALA IN PARIS 

[Nohant. Beginning of October 1843] 
My dear friend, 

I notified you that I shall be asking you to send one letter to my 
family and a second one to Leipzig with manuscripts [Opp. 52, 53, 54]. 
You are the only one whom I can trust them to. 1 Be so kind as to throw 
them into the box as you pass the post office in the Place de la Bourse. 
My manuscripts are not worth much, but it would cause me an awful 
lot of work if they got lost. The health of the Mistress of the House is 
not too good. I drag along as best I can, but I don't know when we shall 
meet. The weather is still fine here: the children are enjoying their 
frolics and we are planning to come back late in the season, particularly 
as life in town is so expensive. 

You will have finished with your hotel, or practically so [?]. Not a 
day passes without my thinking of you and everything on which your 
happiness depends I hope I shall find you in good health, cheerful 
and, as far as possible, happy. A few days ago they made a local 
excursion to visit the banks of the Creuse: the young man [Maurice] 
sketched scenes. This outing made in the company of friendly neigh- 
bours was a great success, but after our return she became unwell and 
hasn't been able to work. This vexes her, and so things are not too 
cheerful. 

Your old 
Ch. 
Compliments and respects to your lady. 

1 Since the departure of Fontana for America in November 1841. From this moment 
(with Op, 49) the supply of Fontana's copies of Chopin's manuscripts ceases. These copies, 
almost undistinguishable from genuine autographs, are to be found in famous libraries, 
where they are reverently regarded as original manuscripts.

210. GEORGE SAND TO CARIOTTA MARLIANI IN PARIS 

[Nohant. End of October 1843] 
My dear good friend. 

Here comes my little Chopin. I entrust him to you, so take care of 
him In spite of himself. His daily routine goes to pieces when 1 am not 
there. He has a man-servant who is all right but is stupid. I am not 
worried about his dinners because he will be invited right and left, and 
besides at that hour of the day it will be just as well if he has to bestir 
himself. But in the morning, in the rash of his lessons [which began at 
eight o'clock] I am afraid he will forget to swallow a cup of drinking 
chocolate or clear broth. When I am there I pour it down his throat. 
It would be kind of Enrico and Marie to remember this. His Polish 
servant can quite easily cook him a simple stew or a chop. But he won't 
ask him, and may even forbid him to do so. You must lecture Chopin 
and threaten to set Enrico over him as a policeman. 

Chopin is quite well now: all he needs is to eat and sleep like a 
normal person. I am obliged to stay here another two weeks . . but 
I rely on you to let me know if Chopin should be in the slightest degree 
unwell, for I would abandon everything to go and look after him. . . . 

211. GEORGE SAND TO MILE BE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

[Nohant. Beginning of November 1843] 

I am staying a few days longer at Nohant, my dearest friend, for jobs 
about the house and other business which is not yet settled. I have 
compelled Chopin to go and start Ms lessons and to avoid being in the 
country, which might become harmful to him when the bad weather 
sets in, for it is devilish cold in our rooms at Nohant. Maurice too has 
to take up his painting-studies in Paris. I should have sent Solange back 
to school, but Chopin begged me to keep her so that he need not 
worry about my being all alone. She is quite happy about it, as you can 
well imagine. Keep an eye on my little Chopin and force Mm to take 
care of Mmself. You can easily visit these two boys without causing 
comment: no one in the house will raise any objection, so go and look 
in on some pretext or other to see what the aforesaid Chopin is doing 
whether he gets any lunch, whether he forgets about himself and you 
should denounce him to me if he behaves like a silly fool with regard 
to Ms health. . . . Don't tell Mm I am making you Ms watch-dog! 

G.S. 

I am going to instruct Ms Polish servant to notify you, unknown to 
Us master, if he is unwell. You should find out what is the matter and 

231 



send at once for Mr Molin, the homoeopath who gives him better 
treatment than anyone. 

212. CHOPIN TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Friday [3 November 1843] 

Here is Maurice's note. We received your good news and we are 
glad that you are satisfied. Everything you do must be great and beautiful, 
and if we don't write and inquire what you are doing it is not because 
we are not interested. Maurice sent you his box yesterday. Write, do 
write ! Another letter tomorrow. Remember your old fellows [himself 
and Maurice]. 

Ch. 

Love to Solange. Both Maurice and I are well. 

213. GEORGE SAND TO HER SON MAURICE IN PARIS 

Nohant. 26 November 1843 

. . . No, Maurice, my poor boy. I shan't stay here any longer never 
mind about the countryside looking lovely. I am more concerned with 
you and Chopin than anything else, and I could not bear for one second 
the worry of knowing that you might both be ill at the same time. . . . 

214. CHOPIN TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

[Paris. Sunday 26 November 1843] 

So you have finished your tour of inspection and the business of 
the outhouses has tired you. For God's sake, husband your strength 
for the journey and bring us your lovely Nohant weather, for we are 
having rain here. Nevertheless I hired a carrkge yesterday, after waiting 
until three o'clock for it to clear up, and I went to see Rothschild and 
Stockhausen; I am none the worse for it. 

Today, Sunday, I'm having a rest and I shall not go out from choice, 
not from necessity. Be assured that we are both well; that illness is far 
away and that the future holds nothing but happiness that I have 
never had such hopes as for this coming week and that everything will 
turn out as you wish. You say that your palate is still smarting please, 
please don't take that drug, Mme Marliani gave us a good dinner 
yesterday, then some went off to a party, others to their drawing- 
pencils and others to bed. I slept in my bed as you did in your arm-chair, 
as tired as though I had actually done something. I think my drug has 
a too sedative effect. I shall ask Molin for something else. Till tomorrow : 
we shall keep on writing until Wednesday. Remember your old chaps, 

232 



your faithful old fellows who can quite rightly think only of you at 
Nohant. Maurice has gone out. Four more days. 

Chopin 

215. To BREITKOPF AND HARTEH, LEIPZIG 

Paris. [19 December 1843] 
Dear Mr Mattel, 

I am sending you your Mst 1 with my signature and since we are 
discussing business, would it suit you if I sent by Mr Maho my two 
Nocturnes [Op. 55] and three Mazurkas [Op. 56] at the price of 600 
francs each? Please inform Mr Maho who will pass on your answer 
to me. I am very sorry I so rarely had the pleasure of seeing you during 
your Paris visit. I hope to make up for it when you next return. I shall 
write again soon. My best respects to your family. 

Yours sincerely, 

F. Chopin 
Tuesday morning. 

On 3 May 1844 Nicholas Chopin died in Warsaw at the age of seventy- 
three. The news reached Fryderyk a week later. 

216. GEORGE SAND TO AUGUSTE FEANCHOMME IN PARIS 

[Paris. 12 May 1844] 
Dear Mr Franchomme, 

Our poor Chopin has just learnt of his father's death. He wishes to 
remain indoors and alone today, but for my part \ beg you to come 
and see him tomorrow, for you are one of the two or three people who 
can do him good. I myself suffer too much from his grief: I have not 
the strength to console him. 

Yours most sincerely, 

George Sand 
Sunday morning. 

217. GEORGE SAND TO CHOPIN'S MOTHER IN WARSAW 

Paris. 29 May 1844 
Dear Madame, 

I do not think I can offer any other consolation to the excellent 
mother of my dear Fryderyk than to assure her of her admirable son's 
courage and resignation. You will realise how deep is his grief and how 
his spirit is overwhelmed; but thank God he is not ill, and in a few hours 

1 This list, dated 16 December 1843, is a general receipt and acknowledgment of the sale 
of most of his works from Op. 12 to Op. 54. 

233 



we shall be leaving for the country, where he will rest after this terrible 
crisis. 

He thinks only of you, his sisters and aH his family, whom he so 
warmly cherishes, and whose sorrow distresses and occupies his mind 
as much as does his own grief. For your part at least, please do not 
worry about the outward circumstances of his life. 1 cannot hope to 
remove his deep, lasting and well-justified sorrow, but I can at least 
care for his health and surround him with as much affection and 
watchfulness as you yourself could show. This loving duty is one which 
I have been happy to take upon myself, and I promise that I shall never 
fail in it, and I hope that you, Madame, have confidence in my attach- 
ment to him. 

I will not say that your bereavement affects me as much as it would 
have done had I known the admirable man whom you mourn. My 
sympathy, sincere as it is, cannot lessen that terrible blow; but I know 
that by telling you that I will devote my life to his son 9 whom I regard 
as one of my own, I shall in some measure calm your fears in that 
respect. It is for this reason that I have taken the Eberty of writing to 
express my attachment to you as the adored mother of my dearest 
friend. 

George Sand 

218. CHOPIN'S MOTHER TO GEORGE SAND IN PARIS 

Warsaw. 13 June 1844 

I thank you, Madame, for the touching words you wrote to me : they 
brought some solace to a poor creature racked by grief and anxiety. In 
my bereavement I have no consolation but my tears and the undimmed 
memory of my noble husband's exemplary life. As for my anxiety 
regarding Fryderyk, it was infinite. After the first shock my thoughts 
flew to the dear boy who, alone in a distant land, with his frail health 
and highly sensitive nature, could not fail to be struck down by such 
shattering news. 

Having my other children around me, I suffered from being unable 
at that terrible moment to take my beloved son. in my arms and help 
him to overcome his grief: I was miserable on his account and could 
find no peace of mind, 

You understand how I must feel, Madame, and it needed a mother's 
heart to realise this and to understand how to pour true consolation into 
mine. And so Fryderyk's mother thanks you sincerely and entrusts 
her dear boy to your maternal care. Be, Madame, his guardian angel as 
you have been an angel of consolation to me, and accept our respectful 

234 



gratitude which you may be sure equals your invaluable devotion and 
care. 

Justyna Chopin 

At the same time Chopin s sister Isabella wrote a consoling in the 

strain, asking her brother to thank George Sand for her kindness. 

Isabella s husband, Antoni BarciAski, also wrote a very long letter, a 

picture of Nicholas Chopin s virtues and describing his last days. From this 

document only a few passages need be given: 

"His age and the exhaustion following a long life of hard work was the sole 
cause of our father's last illness. And indeed during this decline, which did not 
manifest itself by any physical suffering, he uttered no complaint. He was 
invariably calm: he talked to us even with a cheerfulness which he did not seek 
to hide. Surrounded by his family, he felt happy and would say: 'I thank 
Almighty God for having given me such good, loving and virtuous children!* 
He spoke of you, and during his last moments on earth he urged us to en- 
courage you, in his name, to bear with resignation the blow which was about to 
fall on us all. ... 

"On the last night, from Thursday to Friday, Isabella and I watched by Ms 
bedside. Towards morning he felt his end approaching and in deep emotion 
pressed me to his heart saying, 'Antoni, dear Antoni, don*t leave me today/ 
I stayed with him, and with blessings on us and you, for his gaze wandered to 
your portrait and bust, he gave up his soul to God. . . . 

"Since I wish to tell you everything, I must now mention Belza [a science 
master}, that intimate friend who has so long lived with us, sharing our troubles 
and joys. A very learned and honest fellow, he has for years been trying to 
organise in Warsaw an establishment where the dead should be kept for a few 
days before burial. He knows all about such things and used to teH our father 
when the latter was still in health of certain fortuitous cases of apparent death. 
And our father used to encourage him in bis project. That is why, his quick 
memory having recalled such circumstances in the last days of his life, our father 
asked us to have his body opened after his death so that he might avoid the 
terrible fate of those who awake in the grave. . . .- 1 Do not imagine anything 
awful, and do not attribute this attitude of father's to any physical sufferings or 
torments you would be doing him wrong. A man so righteous as he, a man so 
full of virtue and justice, who lived only for his loved ones and devoted his whole 
life to their good, was not afraid of death. . . ." 

During this summer Chopin's eldest sister Louise and her husband, 
Kalasanty Jendrzejewicz, formed the plan of visiting Fryderyk. It was nine 
years since any member of his family had seen him. 

1 There can be little doubt that the scrap of paper containing the words (in French), 
"As this cough will choke me, I adjure you to have my body opened lest I be buried alive", 
was written by Nicholas Chopin in 1844 and not by Fryderyk in 1849. Nicholas Chopin, 
in his last moments, could only use his native tongue. In its details, the handwriting 
corresponds with that of earlier letters of his.

219. GEORGE SAND TO LOUISE JENBRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

[Nohant. July 1844] 
Dear Madame, 

I am eagerly and impatiently awaiting your arrival here. I think that 
Fritz will reach Paris before you, but if you should not find Mm there 
I am arranging for a friend [MUe de Rozieres] to hand you the keys of 
my apartment, which I beg you to make free use of. I shall be very 
upset if you do not accept. You wiH find our dear boy very frail and 
greatly altered since you last saw him ! But do not be alarmed about his 
health. It has remained pretty much the same during the last six years 
when I have seen him every day. A rather violent fit of coughing 
every morning, two or three worse spells lasting not more than two or 
three days each winter, and a few attacks of neuralgia from time to 
time such is his regular state of health. For the rest, his chest is sound 
and his delicate constitution reveals no actual lesion. I still hope that, 
given time, his constitution will be strengthened, but I am at least 
sure that with a regular life and proper care it will last as long as anyone 
else's. The joy of seeing you, although mingled with deep and painful 
emotions, will shatter his spirit somewhat on the first day, but it will 
do him much good, and I am so happy on his account that I bless the 
resolve which you have made. I need scarcely urge you to reinforce his 
courage, which the long separation from his loved ones has placed 
under a continual strain. You wiU succeed in softening the bitterness 
of your mutual sorrows by letting him see your hopes of future happi- 
ness and the spirit of resignation which fills his beloved mother. For a 
long time past his only thoughts have been for the happiness of those 
te loves, a happiness which replaces that which he cannot share with 
them. I have for my part done everything in my power to render this 
cruel absence bearable to him, and although I may not have made him 
forget it, I have at least the consolation of having given and inspired as 
much affection as possible after you, the members of his family. 

Come then, and believe me when I say that I already love you as a 
sister. I shall welcome your husband too, like a friend of long standing. 
I would only urge you to see that little Chopin for that is what we 
call your brother, the great Chopin has a good rest before he is allowed 
to set off for our Berry province. It is a journey of eighty leagues and 
is rather tiring for him. 

Au revoir, my dear friends. Be assured that your visit will make me 
very happy and that I shall keep you until your last free day. Hoping 
to see you soon. With warmest regards. 

George Sand

220. CHOPIN TO MILE DE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

[Paris, last week of July 1844] 

Forgive me for asking you a favour. My sister Louise may be coming 
to Paris in ten, fifteen or twenty days* time. Would you please be kind 
enough to hand this letter for ray brother-in-law to the concierge at 
No. 9 [Place d' Orleans] with instructions to take great care of it and to 
deEver it to the person who calls for it. I also entrust to you a letter 
for my mother. Thanks in advance for all your kindness. 

Chopin 

221. TO WOJCEECH GRZYMAtA IN PAMS 

[Nohant. 26 July 1844] 
My dear friend, 

I am already back at Nohant. On the way I thought of nothing but 
our last conversation. You still have someone to love you, and I pray 
God may improve the state of your finances. The Mistress of the House 
was as much concerned about your latest business affairs as about your 
falling downstairs. I am writing because I forgot to ask you about the 
firework display. Could you not obtain for my sister some little 
window-seat at the Tuileries, with the help of that footman of Louis- 
Philippe whom you know? Sometimes you can easily arrange such 
things; so, if you have a free moment, help my dear sister to see all 
these celebrations. Send me a few lines about your personal affairs. 
Don't write at length, only say whether you are better* Give my 
compliments to the people at Enghien, and if you see my sister said her 
to me here. 

I embrace you cordially, 
Your old Ch. 

[George Sand's postscript:] Well, well, poor old fellow; so you've 
gone and damaged your backside, your head and what else? Please 
don't try such funny tricks again, I beg you. I am praying to God that 
you may quickly forget this unfortunate pastime and that the bad luck 
won't affect your purse as well. You are always running into every kind 
of trouble. Luckily there is a kind God who takes care of good hearts 
and silly heads. My little Chopin has returned in good health, but he 
kments over your cracked bottom. Let us soon hear that it is all over, 
that you have no more bad luck in business and that you love us as we 
do you. My compliments to your guardian angel. The children send 
you kisses, and so do I if you will allow me. 

George

After a week in Paris, Louise and her husband came to Nohant at the 

beginning of August and spent the rest of the month there. 

222. To MILE BE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

Nohant. Sunday [u August 1844] 

Here I come, entrusting you with another letter for my family. You 
have allowed me to take this liberty and so I will not beg your pardon. 
At the same time please accept all my gratitude for your invaluable 
kindness in helping Louise in Paris. We were going to write, but our 
first days here were just like those first ones in Paris happiness enough 
to send one crazy and to make me wonder whether you will under- 
stand my French today. Anyhow, I hope you will understand one 

thing all my friendship for you. 

Chopin 

[George Sand's postscript;] Darling, write soon; in the meantime I 
send you my love. I am in the thick of my novel I shall soon have 
finished it and then I shall send you my loving greetings. Solange gives 

you a kiss. 

Yours ever devotedly, 

G.S. 

[Louise's postscript:] Notwithstanding our happiness we often think 
of you, dear MUe de Rozieres. My husband, with all conceivable 
modesty, is still very quiet but I don't know whether it will last. He is 
busy drawing, and that seals his lips. He sends you his regards and asks 
to be remembered to our Mr Midzifiski. I too send you my warmest 
affection: don't forget me.

223. To WOJCEECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

[Paris. End of August 1844] 

I arrived here late in the evening the day before yesterday I am 
spending all my time running round with my sister, and every morning 
is frittered away. When am I to see you? Today I am taking them to see 
Rachel [the celebrated actress] ; I shall be in your neighbourhood so 
perhaps I shall drop in tonight or tomorrow morning. They will be 
here until Monday, and on Tuesday [3 September] I shall return to 
Nohant and they will leave for home. Mme Sand sends her kindest 

regards.

224. To LOUISE JENDRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

Nohant. 18 September 1844 
My dearest, 

I am sending you the little songs you heard one evening. Solange 9 
who sends her love, reminded me twice about them, and copied out the 
words from memory for yon, while I wrote out the music. I hope you 
both arrived safely and received my letters in Vienna and Cracow. I 
sent to Vienna my own song "Handsome Lad" which I had promised 
you, and to Cracow a few lines for you to give to Mme Fryderyk 
Skarbek. If you received neither of these, which is possible, knowing 
how slow the Austrian post is, instruct them to forward the Cracow 
letter to you, for I should prefer you to deliver it yourself to Mme 
Skarbek. Never mind about the one sent to Vienna I can write out 
the songs again. I addressed it to Professor J. K. Jendrzejewicz, poste 
restante. What I am concerned about is the Cracow letter. I dreamt 
about you both last night. Let us hope that the journey did not affect 
your health. Send me a line. I have been idling around for the last few 
days. Maurice is not back yet but is expected the day after tomorrow. 
You will remember that I predicted when we left here that I should be 
returning by myself in the stage-coach, and that the whole of our 
journey by coach was designed to conform to certain conventions. 1 
Today we are planning to go to Ars after lunch. The Mistress of the 
House has an aunt staying here with her ward. As I wrote to you in 
Vienna, she occupies your room. Often when I go in I look to see 
whether nothing of yours remains, but all I see is the place near the sofa 
where we used to drink our chocokte and those drawings which 
Kalasanty copied. There are more reminders of you in my own room: 
on the table is your embroidery for that slipper, wrapped in tissue- 
paper, and on the piano is that little pencil which was in your case and 
which I find very useful. All my love to you and Kalasanty. Tell him 
that Hippolyte [Chatiron] sends him his respects. Love to the children. 

Your old 
Ch. 

[George Sand's postscript:] My dearest Louise, since you left we have 
done nothing but speak of you. Fryderyk has suffered at parting from 
you, as you may well imagine, but he has stood up well physically to

the strain. All in all, your good and blessed resolve to come and see 
him has borne fruit. It has taken all the bitterness from Ms mind and has 
given him courage and strength. One cannot enjoy such happiness for 
a month without preserving some trace of it, without finding many 
wounds healed and without receiving a fresh store of hope and faith in 
God. I can tell you that you are the best doctor he has ever had, for one 
only needs to speak of you to restore his will to live . [Her pen runs 
away with her and she continues in this strain, the novelist coming out 
in such phrases as: "Take in your arms the sacred objects of your 
tenderness" meaning the children.] 

225. To AUGUSTE FRANCHOMME IN PARIS 

Nohant. 20 September 1844 
My dear friend, 

If I have not written the reason is that I expected to see you in Paris 
this week. My departure is postponed, so I am sending you a letter for 
Schlesinger to tell him to pay you the money for my last manuscripts 
[Opp. 55 and 56], i.e. 600 francs (out of which you should keep 100 for 
me). I hope he won't make difficulties if he does, ask him for an 
immediate answer (be civil !), send it to me, and I shall at once write to 
Mr Leo [his banker] and ask him to repay you before the end of the 
month the 500 which you were kind enough to lend me. 

What news can I give? I often think of the last evening we spent 
together with my dear sister. How glad she was to hear you ! She men- 
tioned it in a letter from Strasbourg and begged me to remember her 
to you and your wife. I hope you are all well and will stay like that 
until I see you. 
Write, and keep me in your affection. 

Your old 

Chopin 

My regards to Madame love to the children. Best wishes from Mme 
Sand. I am doing a little work [Sonata in B minor], I enclose a receipt 
for Schlesinger, to be given only when you get the money. Once more, 
please don't worry if he is awkward about it. 

Love

[Paris. 23 September 1844] 

How are you? I've just arrived. I delivered your parcel to Mr Joly: 
he was charming. Saw Mile de Rozi&res who kept me to lunch. Saw 

240 



Franchommc and my publisher. Saw Delacroix who is in- 

doors. We had two and a half hours 9 chat about music, 
especially you, 1 have reserved my seat for Thursday and be 
you on Friday. Am going to the post now, then to Grzymala's, 
to Leo's. Tomorrow I shall try over some sonatas with Franchomme, 
1 enclose a leaf from your little garden. Grzymala has just arrived; he 
sends his regards and is adding a few words. That's all from me, except 
that 1 am well and remain the most fossilised of all your fossils. I shan't 
forget your errands. Grzym and I are going to see Princess Czaitoryska. 
Give my love to the dear children. 

Chopin 

227. To MILE DE ROZDERES IN PAKIS 

Nohant. 31 October 1844 

If you have not heard from me for a long time it is because I thought 
I should be seeing you soon. Our plans being changed, I am sending 
you a line before I leave for Paris, to ask you to be good enough to look 
after this letter for my mother. I hope you are fully recovered and are 
not like Dona Sol [Solange] who has been unwell these last few days* 
She will soon write. 

Please be so kind as to notify the porter at No. 9 that I shall be in 
Paris in a day or two, and order from Perricher a pair of plain muslin 
curtains for the sitting-room if the others are too worn. Would you 
please see to this? All my thanks in advance. I shall see you soon, I hope. 
My sister sends you affectionate greetings. Practise a little Bach for me. 

228. To LOUISE JENDRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

Nohant. 31 October 1844 

[This letter accompanied No. 227. The portion addressed to his mother 
is lost.] 
For Louise. 
My dearest, 

Well, you must all be together again. I received both your letters 
from Vienna and Cracow. Mile [Friederike] Miiller wrote and told me 
how happy she had been to meet you. She is charming, isn't she? So is 
Mrne Szaszek. If Mile Miiller comes to Paris, she will have to wait 
some time for me. I shall certainly be staying here a week or two 
longer. The leaves have not all fallen but they are yellow; for the last 
week the weather has been fine. The Mistress of the House is profiting 
by it to make various plantations and rearrangements in the front 
courtyard where, you will remember, there was dancing. There will 

241 



be a large lawn and groups of flowers. She is also thinking of making 
a door from the room with the billiard-table, i.e. a door opposite the 
one leading to the dining-room, which will open into the conservatory 
(orangerie, as we say) that is to be added. 

I was glad to get your letter from Cracow. The news about Scipio 
amused me; but you don't say whether you received in my letter to 
Cracow the short note for Mme Skarbek. Don't forget to let me know. 
I am sure your children are well again. Tell me about Dominic's doctor 
and whether Titus's wife's hand is better. Solange is rather unwell 
today. She is here in my room and sends you her regards. Her brother 
will be going next month to spend a few weeks with his father 
[Casimir Dudevant, George Sand's husband] and he will be taking his 
uncle Hippolyte with him to avoid being bored. (Politeness is not one 
of Maurice's characteristics, so don't be surprised if he hasn't asked me 
to thank your husband for that cigar-cutter he gave him.) 

The manuscript [of George Sand's novel, Le Meunier fAugibauh] 
which I brought to Paris has not been printed yet and there may be a 
lawsuit. If it comes to that, it will all be to her advantage and will cause 
only a momentary embarrassment. . . . 

Since I expect to be in Paris a few days before the Mistress of the 
House, don't trouble about bolsters, pillows or such things. We shall 
as usual have to clean and arrange everything ready for the winter. 
Remind me of your house-number. Love to your husband and the 
children. 

Your old brother 

The Mistress of the House sends her greetings. You know how fond 
they are of you for they have written and said so. The bear [?] has 
gone up in esteem here. 

229. FELIX MENDELSSOHN TO CHOPIN IN PAWS 

Berlin. 3 November 1844 
My dear Chopin, 

This letter comes to you to ask a favour. Would you out of friend- 
ship write a few bars of music, sign your name at the bottom to show 
you wrote them for my wife (Ccile M.-B.), and send them to me? 
It was at Frankfort that we kst met you and I was then engaged: since 
that time, whenever I wish to give my wife a great pleasure I have to 
pky to her, and her favourite works are those you have written. So 
there you have another reason (although I have plenty of valid ones 
since I have known you) for my wanting always to be well informed 
about what you are writing, and for my taking a greater interest in 

242 



you and your works than, you do perhaps yourself. That is the 
reason why I hope you will grant the favour I ask. Forgive me if I 
thereby add to the tiresome requests which you must be 
with. 

Always yours devotedly, 

Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy 

230. CHOPIN TO MILE DE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

[Nohant. 13 November 1844] 

As you wished me to notify you of my arrival I hasten to inform you 
that I shall have the pleasure of greeting you in Paris on Sunday (at 
12.30 I think). I shall come from Bourges in the coach belonging to 
Laffitte and Co., rue Saint-Honore. I don't know exactly at what time 
these coaches arrive, but it is always in the day-time. Be so kind as to 
have my fires lit, and ask them to request Mme Durand to make an 
exception in my favour on Sunday, and come and see me after one 
o'clock. I thank you in advance for all this; this time I can say "An 
revoir". 

Au revoir. I shall see you soon. Au revoir.

Thursday morning. 
All are well here and it's fine. 
[Chopin actually arrived in Paris two weeks later.] 

231. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

[Paris. 2 December 1844] Monday. Three o'clock 
How are you all? I have just received your excellent letter. It is 
snowing so heavily that I am very glad you are not on the road, and I 
blame myself for putting into your head the idea of coming by coach 
in such weather. The Sologne area must already be in a bad state for it 
has been snowing since yesterday morning. I think you were quite 
right to wait a few days, and it will give me more time to have your 
rooms heated. The main thing is not to set off in such weather, with the 
prospect of hardship. Jan [his Polish servant] has put your flowers in the 
kitchen. Your little garden is covered with snowballs, sugar cones, 
swansdown, cream-cheese, and is as white as Solange's hands or 
Maurice's teeth. The chimney-sweeps have just been, for I dared not 
light big fires before they came. 

The dress you ordered is of black Uvantine of the finest quality. I 
chose it myself as you ordered. The dressmaker has taken it away with 
your instructions. She considers the material very beautiful, simple but 

243 



very suitable. I think you will be pleased with it. The woman seemed 
to me very intelligent, I chose the material from a selection often; it 
costs 9 francs a yard, so you see it is of the finest quality and will turn 
out splendidly, I think. The dressmaker has thought of everything and 
she is resolved to please you. There are lots of letters for you. I am send- 
ing one which seems to be from. Garcia's mother. There is one from 
the colonies and another from Prussia, addressed to s *Mme Dudevant, 
nee Francueil" which I would send if they were not so large. You can 
have them if you like. There are piles of newspapers (the Atelier, the 
Bien Public and the Diable), and a few books and visiting-cards, including 
one of Mr Martin's. Yesterday I dined at Franchomme's: I only left the 
house at four o'clock because of the bad weather. In the evening I went 
to see Mme Marliani I shall be dining there today with Leroux, she 
says, if his brother's lawsuit, which comes up today, finishes early. I 
found the Marlianis in quite good health, apart from colds. Yesterday 
being Sunday, I saw neither Grzymala nor PleydL I intend to go and 
see them today if the snow stops a little. Look after yourself; don't tire 
yourself out with all your luggage. I will write again tomorrow if I may. 
Your older-than-ever, very, extremely, incredibly old 

Ch. 

So there you are ! 

Love to the children. 

Franchomme spent the morning with me. He is very kind and sends 
his compliments. I am forwarding a letter which has just arrived and 
seems to be from Dektouche. 

232, To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

[Paris, 5 December 1844] Thursday. Three o'clock 
Keep well and mind you avoid all hardship ! I have just received your 
most excellent letter and I can imagine you very upset and worried by 
all this delay. But out of consideration for your friends you must be 
patient, for we should all be really distressed to hear you were travelling 
in such weather, and when you are not in perfect health. I should like 
to see you obtain seats in the coach as late as possible, when the weather 
may not be so cold. Here it's incredible; everyone declares that winter 
is coming on far too suddenly. By "everyone" I mean Mr Durand and 
Franchomme, whom I saw this morning and at whose house I dined 
yesterday, by the fireside in my heavy frock-coat. I sat next to his big 
lad he was rosy-cheeked, fresh and warm, with bare knees; I was 
yellow, shrivelled and cold, with three layers of flannel underwear 
beneath my trousers. I've promised him some chocokte in your name. 

244 



Your name and "chocolate" are synonyms for him now. He used to 
say your hair was so black but now 1 think it has turned chocolate- 
colour in his memory. He is a real laugh and I am especially fond of him. 

I went to bed at half past ten; but I did not sleep so soundly as on 
the night after my train-journey. How vexed 1 am that your gardening 
jobs are finished! I should have liked you to have something to do 
outside in your clogs, for in spite of the cold and slippery conditions it 
is fine. The sky is cloudless and only darkens to send down a little 
snow. I have written to Grzymala. He wrote to me but we have not 
yet met: I called, but he was out. 

As usual I shall go and post this letter at the Place de k Bourse, and 
before going to see MUe de Rozi&res, who is expecting me to dinner. I 
shall call on Mme Marliani whom I haven't seen for two days. I haven't 
been to see Mine Doribeaux either, for I have no presentable clothes 
that stops me from wasting my time on visits. My lessons have not yet 
got properly started. Firstly, because I have only just received a piano s 
and secondly, because people don't yet know I have returned* It was 
only today that I had my first inquiries from prospective pupils. It wiE 
all come back gradually, so I am not worried. 

What does worry me is to know that you are sometimes made im- 
patient; and I humbly beg you to try to show some indulgence to the 
coach-drivers who bring you no answers to your letters from Chiteau- 
roux and other such annoyances. Another letter tomorrow. I am 
forwarding one to you to wake you up still more. I imagine it is morn- 
ing and that you are in your dressing-gown with your darlings around 
you. Please give them kisses from me, and accept for yourself my 
devoted regards. As for my spelling-mistakes, well, I'm too lazy to 

look in Boiste's dictionary. ~ r , j

Jan is busy cleaning my sitting-room. He is doing the mirrors and 
is taking his time. 

233. To MAURICE SCHLESINGER IN PARIS 

[Paris. December 1844] Wednesday morning 
Dear friend, 

My Sonata [in B minor, Op. 58] and the Variations [ie. "Berceuse", 
Op. 57] are ready for you. I am asking 1,200 francs for these two works. 
I should have called to see you, but I fed good for nothing. 

Yours ever, 
My respects to your wife. Chopin 

245 



The winter of 1844-5 was severe and prolonged. The deterioration in 
Chopin s health was very marked at this time. 

234. To STEFAN WITWICKI AT FRHWAIDAU 

Paris, Easter Sunday [23 March 1845] 
My dear, dear friend, 

I missed you very much this last summer. I could have wept and 
lamented with you. I often thought of writing to you at Graefenberg 
but I got no further than the intention as soon as I picked up my pen 
it became impossible for me to write anything. And now the chaos in 
my life, rather than laziness, is the cause of Mme Sand's letter to you 
being delayed by a week. [He was forwarding her letter.] 

What can I tell you? That tomorrow, Monday, there will be a great 
Easter-feast at the Czartoryskis* ; that Mickiewicz is not going to give 
Ms lectures this year [at the College de France] ; that he is losing many of 
his followers; that it is said that they have written an apologetic letter 
to His Majesty [the Tsar]. What is deplorable is that two of them 
(PiMchowsld seems to be one) have signed a document before a public 
notary in which they acknowledge themselves to be the mere chattels 
of Towianski, 1 his slaves in fact. Observe that they don't pledge their 
children as well, only themselves and for life. Can you conceive of 
greater madness? Mickiewicz is no longer on his former terms with 
Towianski: the latter maintains that they have gone beyond aU limits. 
In short, there is discord they will surely come to a bad end, and it 
won't be long either. Apart from that everything is as usual. 

I am sorry you can't be at the Conservatoire with Delacroix and us 
this evening to hear Haydn's Creation. It will be only the second concert 
we have been to this year. Two days ago, at the first one, they did 
Mozart's Requiem. Today Grotkowski is coming to sing my settings of 
your poems, and a few which are new to him although old ones for 
you. 

My dear old Louise tried to find you in Vienna as she was returning 
to Poland they always ask after you. Mamma has got through this 
winter moderately well. She is weary and has aged. We may still meet 
somewhere. I need not remind you of her saintly character you know 
how she is goodness itself; and you can imagine what a blessing her 
letters are for me. I saw Zaleski once he was kind enough to visit me. 
I should be glad to see more of him he looked quite well. Grzymala 
is younger than ever he dances like a twenty-year-old. We have never 
had such cold weather. Today is the first day that there is no snow in 

1 Andrzej Towianski, the "prophet" of a new religious cult among the Polish 

246 



the courtyard garden. Spring Is forgetting us. But you well. 

Let us hope that this year will bring you health and happiness* Love me 
as I <lo you although I am not worth as much. 

Your old 
CL 

[In her letter George Sand says:] We are both to blame for not 
writing I most of all. He writes so few letters, and besides he is to be 
excused on account of his great weakness and illness. So you must 
forgive him with aH his attacks of coughing and his lessons it is 
difficult for him to find a moment for rest and quiet. That will show 
you how delicate his health continues to be. The severe frosts we are 
having here are very detrimental to him. I myself am almost constantly 
unwell and I am writing to you today with a cME and temperature 

235. EUGENE DELACROIX TO CHOPIN IN PAKIS 

[April 1845] 
Dear friend, 

I forgot yesterday to ask you as a favour to be kind enough to write 
a short note yourself to Mr Brown the bootmaker, requesting him to 
come and see me in the morning about nine o'clock (54 rue Notrc- 
Dame-de-Lorette). Perhaps he wiU deign, on your recommendation, 
to make boots for me. I have written to him myself without result, and 
I have resolved to ask you this service before you leave [for Nohantj. 
How sad to think we spend our lives without seeing each other! I 
love you truly and sincerely, and I respect you as one of those who are 
a credit to our wretched species. 

Yours most warmly, my dear friend, 

Eugene Delacroix 
Thursday. 

236. CHOPIN TO AUGUSTS LEO IN PARIS 

Nohant. 8 July 1845 
Dear friend, 

Thank you for your news, and believe me when I say how much I 
appreciate your kind words. I always think especially of you when my 
mind is on beautiful music, so you can imagine how often that is, now 
that we have Mme Viardot with us. 

You mention Mr Stern [a German publisher]. I shall soon be able to 
send him a set of Three Mazurkas [Op. 59] or Two Nocturnes [Op. 62] 
(but I must notify Mr Hartel who is always extremely courteous to me) 
if, that is, the price of 600 francs for Germany and all other countries 

247 



except France and England does not secin to Mr Stern to be too 
high. 

How are you standing this heat? It suits me marvellously, and the 
country is so lovely that I should pity you for being shut up in town, 
if the town were not Paris, 

Please give my compliments to Mme Leo, and believe me 
always 

Yours devotedly, 
F. Chopin 

Don't forget to remember me to Mr and Mrs Valentin. Kind regards 
from Mme Sand. 

237. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

[Nohant. 16 to 20 July 1845] 
My dear ones, 

We have already been here over a month. Mme Viardot came with 
us and stayed three weeks. We are all in excellent health however, 
there was a fever in the district this winter. Fran^oise's husband (Louise 
doubtless remembers him) was ill nearly all the winter, but he has now 
recovered. The weather is all right, but when we arrived here there were 
tremendous storms. The Indre overflowed to such an extent that, at 
Montgivray, Chatiron (the Mistress's brother) had his whole garden 
flooded and water in the house. Viardot, who came to fetch his wife, 
could not take her away, for the roads to Chateauroux were under water: 
one could not even reach that spot we often walked to, where there is a 
lovely view. It did not last long. Great damage was caused in the 
meadows, but it's already over and forgotten. I am not cut out for 
country Hfe, but I benefit from the fresh air. I play little, for the piano 
is out of tune, and I compose still less that's why you have received 
nothing from me for so long. 

I suppose you are all in the country and that Bartolosko-Antolosko 
[Antoni Barciiiski, his brother-in-law] has forgotten about his illness. 
Also that Louise is following Dr MarjoHn's advice and avoids fatigue. 
Tell her that the manuscript of the novel [La Mare au Diable] which she 
heard read out here has been given to me as an autograph for her. Tell 
her that I saw Gutmann just before he left and told him to bring you 
my love I liked him much better as he was leaving: he is really a 
decent fellow. 

Isabella should have some relaxation after her anxieties over her 
husband's health: let her trounce Kalasanty [Louise's husband] for he is 
the strongest and can put up with all those jobs which have to be done. 

248 



I feel strange here this year: in the morning I often look the room 
next to niine* but there is no one there. It is sometimes occupied by a 
visitor who is here for a few days. Besides, I no longer have drinking- 
chocolate in the morning, and I have had the piano moved 
the wall, where there was a sofa and a little table at which Louise 
to embroider my slippers while the Mistress of the Hoose was 
in some other work. In the middle stands the desk on which I am 
writing. On the left He some of my music-sheets a copy of Thiers's 
book and some poems [of Zaleski]: on the right, Cherabini [Treatise 
of Counterpoint], and in front of me that repeater-watch you sent me, 
in its case (four o'clock). Roses and pinks, pens and a piece of sealing- 
wax which Kalasanty left behind. I keep on going into your room and 
into the one next door where the Mistress is working but at this 
moment I am far away as usual in some strange region of space. Of 
course they are only those imaginary spaces but I am not ashamed: 
after all, haven't we a proverb at home which says, "He went to the 
coronation in his imagination"? and I am such a real blind Mazovian 
that without further ado I have written three new Mazurkas which are 
to appear in Berlin. An acquaintance of mine, a decent fellow and 
skilled musician named Stern, whose father is starting a music business, 
has asked for them. I have also received an invitation from the commit- 
tee which is putting up a monument to Beethoven (at Bonn on the 
Rhine), asking me to go to the unveiling. You can imagine whether I 
shall go. But if you were to be anywhere in the neighbourhood I should 
perhaps bestir myself. However that will have to be for next year, for 
I don't know whether I told you that this autumn you will be seeing 
Mme Obreskoff as she passes through Warsaw. She is very fond of 
music and is extremely kind to me; and when she returns she plans to 
bring in her carriage my darling Mamma then you must all come next 
spring, daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren, to fetch her. This kdy 
is indeed most kind to me and so completely sincere. Of course I must 
have written and told you long ago of her readiness to oblige me but 
I must admit that her fond schemes rather amused me. However, if you 
see her, be as nice as possible, for I have received continual proofs of 
her kindness and I am very fond of her. She has an extraordinary love 
of music. Her daughter, Princess Souzzo, is my pupil. In short, she is a 
most worthy lady, although she may perhaps appear a little too 
vivacious. 

Mme Viardot also told me she would visit you as she passes through 
your town. She sang me a Spanish song she has composed one she 
wrote in Vienna last year; she promised she would sing it to you. I am 

249 



very fond of it and I doubt whether one could hear or think of anything 
better of its kind. This song wiH bring you and me together. I have 
always listened to it with rapturous pleasure. 

My Sonata [Op. 58] and "Berceuse" have already appeared. Speaking 
of the "Berceuse 9 * brings to my mind the sort of person Louise wished 
to have [for her children]. However difficult it may be to find one, it 
is not impossible: I have already inquired a few times and perhaps we 
shall find someone. 

What shall I tell you of Paris? Mme Hoffman was very ill before I 
left they feared for her life. I expect she is better, for Albert did not 
mention her when he wrote. He only wrote and told me what the 
papers said, without giving any names, about Victor Hugo, to whom 
something similar happened two weeks ago. Mr Biard (a historical 
painter of small reputation), who is himself ugly, had a pretty wife, 
whom Hugo seduced. Biard caught his wife with the poet in such a 
situation that Hugo had to show his badge as a Peer of France to the 
man who was going to arrest him, in order to be left temporarily in 
peace. Biard wanted to start a lawsuit against his wife, but it all ended 
by their separating discreetly. Hugo has suddenly gone off on his 
travels. Mme Hugo, to appear magnanimous, has taken Biard's wife 
under her protection while Juliette [Drouet] (the actress who was 
famous more than ten years ago at the Porte-Saint-Martin Theatre 
and whom Hugo has long kept as his woman, in spite of Mme Hugo, 
his children and his poems on family morality) has gone off with him. 
The Parisian gossips are delighted to have something to talk aboot. It 
really is an amusing story add to that the fact that Hugo is in his 
forties and always pretends, whenever he gets the chance, to be so very 
serious and superior to everybody. ... I hope I am giving you plenty 
of news. 

Tell Barcinski that the electric telegraph between Baltimore and 
Washington is giving wonderful results. It often happens that orders 
from Baltimore sent at i p.m. are executed, and the goods and parcels 
ready for despatch from Washington, by 3 o'clock. Small parcels 
ordered at 4.30 are sent by the 5 o'clock train from Washington and 
reach Baltimore at 7.30 seventy-five English miles: twenty-five 
French miles. What do you think of that for speed? 

It's a year since I saw the Jendrzejewicz family time has sped as if 
along the electric telegraph line. If my letter is all odds and ends it is 
because I add a sentence every day. Yesterday Solange interrupted me 
to play a duet with her. Today it was to go and see a tree felled one 
of those near the lodge where Chaigne lived in the garden next to the 

250 



road where Louise and her husband alighted from the stage-coach. 
The tree was dead and had to be felled. 

I have received letters from Franchomme in Paris and from MHe de 
Rozieres who is keeping an eye on my apartment. Franchomme writes 
that Habeneck [conductor of the Conservatoire orchestra] is to 

Bonn for the Beethoven festival; that Liszt has written a cantata which 
will be sung under Ms baton. Spohr is conducting at a grand concert 
which is to take place in the evening. The festival will last 
days 

This is the fourth time I am sitting down to this letter, and I hope I 
shall finish it at last. Since I started this page the weather has had time 
to change and it's raining today. Let us hope that it will be fine in 
Paris for this month's festivities. This year it will be different from what 
the Jendrzejewiczes saw there will be iUuminations. Those who 
speculate on the demand for popular entertainment have this year 
had a new idea for the river Seine. There are boats gaily dressed and 
Venetian gondolas which sail up and down in the evening. The habitue's 
of the boulevards have taken to the novelty and it appears (I haven't 
yet seen it myself) that great crowds go on the water. However, this 
year the Champs-Elysees wiU not be so brightly illuminated. Instead, 
the whole splendour of the lanterns will be reserved for the quais. 
There will also be fireworks, aquatic sports, lots of boat-races, etc., 
etc. There will be no lack of new ideas, and great care will have to be 
taken if there are to be as few accidents as possible I say **as few", for 
it is impossible to prevent some cases of drowning or suffocation owing 
to the throng of sightseers on the banks. Kalasanty and Louise surely 
remember what crowds there were on certain days: but people are 
such fools that the bigger the crowd, the more fun they get. 

We are having a great storm outside and in the kitchen too. I can 
see what's going on outside, but I should have no idea of what is 
happening hi the kitchen if Suzanne had not come to complain of 
Jan. He has been calling her all sorts of names in French for having 
taken his knife from the table. Louise and Kalasanty know what his 
French is Hke, so they can imagine what sort of charming expressions 
he comes out with: "ugly as a sow", "face like a backside", and even 
prettier phrases. I wonder whether they remember that when one asks 
him if there is any wood, he answers: "It's gone out." Is Suzanne there? 
he answers: "There isn't." But the two of them are often at logger- 
heads, and since Mme Sand's maid is very clever, quick and indispen- 
sable it may be that I shall have to get rid of my man for the sake of 
peace. I shall hate doing it, for I have nothing to gain from fresh faces. 

251 



Unfortunately the children don't like him either, because he is steady 
and reliable in his work. 

It's dinner-time. I would have written more, but I definitely want to 
send this letter off today. Mile de Rxmeres will take charge of it and 
post it herself, I am writing to tell her that if there are any letters from 
you she should forward them. I am not worried about letters, knowing 
that this is the time when you are all scattered, or if not, well, busy with 
all sorts of plans. But I really must beg you to persuade Mamma to 
have some sort of a holiday in the country, and BarcinsH to have a 
thorough rest. I am sure God will keep all Louise's children in good 
health. Kalasanty should teach them better than he did Maurice when 
he was here all he can stammer out is a few badly pronounced Polish 
words. Isabella, being the most energetic, must make the greatest 
efforts, so that poor little Louise does not wear herself out. Isabella and 
I are fair, so we are greatly concerned for ladies who are dark. Give my 
love to all my friends, beginning with your neighbours and ending 
with those in the suburbs that is, if you are still in Warsaw. 1 mean 
Mr Fryderyk Skarbek, Eisner, Nowakowski, Belza, Titus and all the 
ladies. I had a pleasant dream yesterday about Mme Lutynska, I often 
think of her because last year I was told so many nice things about 

her. 

I embrace my darling Mamma and all of you. 
Ch. 

[After further greetings] . . . The Mistress of the House is working 
1 won't interrupt her for a few words to Louise, but I know in advance 
that she sends her warm regards. Oh, she has just finished her writing 
and is going to send a few lines to Louise. Adieu, my dear ones. Next 
month I shall send birthday wishes to Louise. Speaking about Hugo: 
here is a little story for Kalasanty about a lady who, talking of horse- 
racing, said she would like to see the six petites chaises (steeplechase ! 
tell Barcinski to pronounce it in English) meaning a race with jumps. 
I don't know whether we have such an expression it's a race to a 
finishing-point, straight over ditches, fences and all kinds of similar 
obstacles. 

Well, the same sort of person, speaking of someone in a situation 
like Hugo's, said that he had been caught flagrant dam k lit for en 
flagrant dilit. 

If Kalasanty knew the story already he must forgive me I meant 
well and take the case of the lady who, hearing of the "Stabat de 
Pergolese" [Pergolesi's Stabat Mater], wanted to know "what is ce tabac 
du Pere Goleze?" But that's an older one still. A newer one is about the 

252 



lady who asked her landlord to paint her nombril [navel] of her 

lambris [dado], because it was dirty. Anyhow let Mm remember 

Godefroi de Bouillon is so called because he was "le Ie 

de son temps.*** 

[George Sand's postscript:] My dear heart's-sister. Our boy is quite 
well. The heat which usually exhausts him is doing him good this 
year. If you were here he would forget he had ever been ill. Oh, why 
are we so far apart in reality when we are so close to each other in our 
thoughts? I have given Fryderyk a large autograph of you [La 
au Diable] as a souvenir of the happiest days of our life. . . . 

238. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

[Nohant. I to 5 August 1845] 

[At the top of the letter:] It's so stupid never to finish a letter on the 
same day as one begins it. I have taken five days over this one. 
My dear ones, 

They sent me yesterday from Paris the letter in which you tell me 
that Mamma and Isabella's family have gone for their holidays. Ten 
days ago I sent through Mile de Rozieres in Paris a letter addressed to 
Mamma at Nowy Swiat [the main street of Warsaw]. I suppose that 
Suzanne knows what to do when my letter arrives. If not, I ought to 
tell you that it was larger than this, which I shall keep short, having 
exhausted my news in the first one. You will find in it a few words for 
Louise from the Mistress of the House. With this letter I am forwarding 
to Paris the one Louise wrote to Mile de Rozieres. She will certainly 
reply, for she loves writing, although often about nothing in particular 
but it is a pleasant foible, and I am sorry I am not similarly afflicted. 
I am glad that one half of the family is in the country and that Henryk 
[Louise's son] too is in the fresh air; but it's a pity that you could not 
arrange to go at the same time. I feel sure that one of the reasons is your 
trip here last year, and I cannot reproach myself enough for it. But you 
as well as I have pleasant memories of your visit; so let us be glad you 
came and let us hope to see each other again, even before the railway is 
completed. Kalasanty will once again have to scratch himself after 
being bitten by the harvest-bugs; they are not so numerous this year, 
so we must suppose that they fed too much on Kalasanty and have died 
as a result. 

It is hot where you are, and here too it was exceptionally hot a few 
days ago, but now we often have rain and they are waiting for a change 
in the weather before beginning the harvest which will be abundant but 
late this year. Last Sunday was St Anne's day she is the patron saint of 

253 



the village. Since the front courtyard has been altered and is full of 
flowers and massed shrubs, all the dancing took place on the lawn in 
front of the church. You wiU remember the country fete at Sarzay, so I 
need not remind you of the bagpipes or booths or the Yarioes types of 
dancers. , . . 

What other news have I for you? Mme Viardot has gone to the 
Rhineland, where Meyerbeer invited her in the name of the King of 
Prussia, together with Liszt and Vieuxtemps, etc. The royal pair will 
also receive the Queen of England who has already set off for Germany 
with her husband, Prince Albert. In Coblenz Mendelssohn too is busy 
with the musical preparations for his king, since Queen Victoria is to 
be received at Stolzenfels. Liszt is having himself acclaimed at Bonn, 
where they are erecting a memorial to Beethoven and where they also 
expect crowned heads. In Bonn they are selling "genuine Beethoven 
cigars' '-Beethoven, who certainly smoked nothing but Viennese 
pipes; and they have already sold so much old furniture, old desks and 
bookcases "belonging to Beethoven" that the poor composer of the 
Pastoral Symphony must have had a vast furniture business. It reminds 
one of the concierge at Ferney who kept on selling "Voltaire's walking- 
stick". 

. . . HasBnger in Vienna has published my Sonata [Op. 4] dedicated 
to Eisner, or at least he sent me a printed proof a few years ago in 
Paris [see No. 172]; but I did not send it back corrected. I merely told 
him that it needed considerable alterations, so he has perhaps deferred 
printing it which would suit me very well. Oh, how time flies! I 
don't know how it is, but I can't do anything decent. I am not lazy 
I don't gad about from place to place as I did when you were here I 
spend whole days and evenings in my own room. But I simply must 
finish certain manuscripts [Opp. 60, 61, 62] before I leave here, for 1 
cannot compose in winter. Since your departure I have written only 
that Sonata [Op. 58], and now, apart from those new Mazurkas [Op. 
59], I have nothing ready for the printer as I ought to have. 

We can hear the stage-coaches passing. They go past the bottom of 
the garden. Why doesn't one stop and let you alight . . .? [More family 
gossip.] 

I have just returned from a drive with Solange who took me for a 
nice airing in the cabriolet with Jacques. Jacques is the name of a huge 
thoroughbred dog which was given to the Mistress in place of old 
Simon, who has grown very old this year and has lost the use of one 
leg. He is the inseparable companion of fat Coco, although he is a fine 
specimen of his breed. When it rains he jumps into the carriage and lies 

254 



down in such a way that his head gets wet on one and his tail on 
the other, in spite of his most amusing twistings and turnings to 
out of the rain: but he is too big to find a completely comfortable 
position. . . . 

As usual, Jan has been ringing the dinner bell for a quarter of an hour. 
The Mistress has promised to pour a bucket of water over his head if he 
rings so long. I must go and shave 9 for I have a heavy beard so now 
once more I put aside this letter. 

Well, I've shaved, but I don't look any fatter in the face, although 
they tell me I have put on weight; but I am far from resembling the 
late Okolow. Give my regards to his sister-in-law (I mean, if I am not 
mistaken, the one I often used to play duets with in Miodowa Street 
where I frequently saw Mine Czajkowska), Tel me what my god- 
children are doing and give my love to the Pruszaks. . . . [Other 
greetings.] 

I shall write again soon and send you my love. I would like to write 
so much, but I should hardly know where to begin if I tried to have a 
long chat with you, just as we used to talk and drink our chocolate in 
the room next to mine. My warmest regards to you all. My good friend 
Franchomme has written and asks to be remembered to you. . . . 

[George Sand's postscript:] How do you do, my dear? We love you, 
embrace you and ask God to bless you always. 

[Chopin continues :] She didn't want this letter to go without a line 
from her. They are such dears (I write in the plural because they all are), 

239. To FELIX MENDELSSOHN IN BERLIN 

Paris [really Nohant]. 8 October 1845 

Just try hard to imagine, my dear friend, that I am writing by return 
of post in reply to the letter [see No. 229] which brought me your good 
news. Since the delay is not due to any wrong feeling on my part 
I hope you will welcome these lines as if they were reaching you at the 
proper time. If the little sheet of music is not too dog-eared and does not 
arrive too late, please present it from me to Mrs Mendelssohn. Allow 
me also to remind you that, if you have worthier and more intimate 
friends and admirers, you have none who is more sincerely attached 
to you. 

Yours always most sincerely, 
Chopin 

On the same day he wrote to Franchomme, sending the MSS of Op. 59 
for Wessel and Schksinger. The latter was to pay 300 francs for them. Soon 

255 



afterwards he returned to Paris, but George Sand instead of coming directly to 
Paris went to visit some relations at the Chateau de Chenonceattx, near Tours, 

240. GEORGE SAND TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Nohant. Saturday evening. Midnight [29-Novetnber 1845] 
We are leaving early tomorrow morning. We have hired a carriage- 
horse and are taking my brother [her half-brother, Hippolyte Chatiron] 
with us. As I shall hardly be able to write to you while travelling, I 
want you at least to receive a line from me in Paris. I am grieved to 
think of you on the road, and having a bad night. In Paris you must 
allow yourself time for three good nights, and don't over-tire yourself. 
Love me, my dear angel, my dear joy. I love you. 

241. CHOPIN TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Paris. Friday 12 December [-26 December 1845] 
My dear ones, 

I received your last letter in which you write that you are all well 
with the exception of Bardnski who is, however, much better, and that 
Mamma is standing the winter fairly well. It is not yet very cold here, 
but it's dark and damp. Mme Sand returned last Tuesday [9 December] 
with her son and daughter. I have been here two weeks today. Usually, 
as you will remember, I return alone, and all the more so this year 
since I had to dismiss Jan and find another servant. For a year now he 
has been saying every month that he wanted to go, weeping and pro- 
testing that he is very fond of me. I would never have dismissed him, 
but he exasperated the others the children [Maurice and Solange] 
made fun of him too much, so I couldn't keep him any longer merely 
for my own sake. Up till the last minute he thought they would dismiss 
Suzanne instead. Nevertheless he spoke every day of leaving. It has 
been a great business for me, for I need someone very honest and decent, 
but my friend Albrecht has found me a Frenchman, Pierre, who is 
reliable, intelligent and, I hope, faithful. He was with the parents of my 
E flat Waltz (I mean the Horsfords) for seven years. He is clean, rather 
slow but so far he does not exasperate me. 

It may interest Louise, who knows Nohant, to learn that Luce, 
Fran9oise's girl, is now in Paris with her mistress, in addition to Suzanne, 
or rather with Solange. Regarding all those things which Louise 
inquired about in her letter, there is not a word of truth in what she 
heard not the slightest resemblance to the facts. Leroux is in excellent 
health, but his children have had the measles. Maurice was supposed to 
be going to see his father [Dudevant] a few days ago but the weather 

256 



has prevented him. His father has spent the entire summer on his 
estate in Gascony. Never give credence to evil rumours there are 
of people in this world who cannot bear to sec others happy. 

Before 1 arrived here, but after I had left Nohant, Mine Sand visited 
her cousins the de Vffieneuves at Chenonceaux near Tours, Chenoa- 
ceaux is a castle famous throughout France. It was built in the of 
Francis I by a famous "tiraitant** (a banker of those days), Thomas 
Boyer, who spent years on its construction. It is built in the middle of 
the river Cher and stands on arcades in which are enormous kitchens. 
Francis I confiscated it from the banker and occupied it himself 
there are many relics of Ms time. Later Catherine de Medicis lived there 
regularly. (In Les Huguenots at the Opera here, the scenery in the second 
act represents this castle I have an idea Louise saw it.) Moreover, the 
wife of our Valois [Henry III, King of Poland and later of France] 
spent her widowhood there. All the rooms are kept up with their period 
furniture God knows what their upkeep must cost. In Louis XV's 
time, or during the Regency, the place came to Mr Dupin (de Francueil) 
from the Vendome family: Rousseau [Jean-Jacques] was his secretary. 
This Mr Dupin was Mme Sand's grandfather his portrait is over the 
fireplace in the large downstairs room at Nohant, next to the dining- 
room. Mme Dupin, his first wife, was famous for her intelligence and 
beauty and in her time all the most celebrated people of the kst 
century came there: Voltaire, Mably, etc. There are many manuscripts 
of Montesquieu as well. Rousseau mentions Mr Dupin in Ms Con- 
fessions. At Chenonceaux there are boxes full of his correspondence 
with her, most interesting, but it will probably never be published. 
Mme Sand discovered a few manuscripts of Mme Dupin, apparently 
very interesting and above all beautifully written. It was there too, in 
the castle theatre, that Rousseau's opera, Le Devin du Village, was first 
performed. Mr Francueil is said to have written the overture. You 
know, of course, that Rousseau wrote both libretto and music; it had a 
great success seventy years ago. Some things from this opera caught on 
and are quite well known in France. 

So much for Chenonceaux, now for Paris. The Gavards and the 
Franchommes send their regards to Louise and Kalasanty. Mr Gavard 
is sending Louise his edition of Massillon's works. I dined with both 
families before Mme Sand arrived and we talked much of you. My 
"mill" [his lessons] is already getting started. Today I gave only one 
lesson (to Mme Rothschild) and called off two : I had other work to do. 
My new Mazurkas [Op. 59] have been published by Stern in Berlin, 
so I don't know whether they will reach you, since in Warsaw you 

257 



usually receive your music from Leipzig. They are not dedicated to 
anyone. Now I should like to finish the 'Cello sonata [Op. 65], the 
* 'Barcarolle" and something else which I haven't found a title for 
[Polonaise-Fantaisie, Op. 61], but I doubt whether I shall have time, 
now that the rush is beginning. 

There are many inquiries as to whether I shall give a concert I 
doubt it. Liszt has arrived from the provinces, where he has been giving 
concerts; I found his visiting-card today. Meyerbeer is back as weH. I 
was to have gone to a soiree at Leo's this evening to meet him, but we 
are going to the Opera instead, to see a new ballet (new to Mme Sand) 
called Le Diable a Quatre, with Polish national costumes. 

I am writing to you on Saturday morning after the ballet. This ballet 
at the Opera is just the same as when you were here. That is all we have 
seen so far: we have not been to the Italian opera where they are giving 
Verdi, nor have we seen Mme Dorval in the new play Marie-Jeanne 
which is said to offer her one of her best parts. 

Today is 17 December. I interrupted my letter and have not been 
able to settle down to it before now. The weather today is very dark and 
horrible. Today sees the first performance at the Grand Opera of Balfe's 
new opera. He wrote Les Quatre Fils Aymon (I think we saw it together 
at the Opera-Comique). Today's work is called L'Etoile de Seville the 
story of Le Cid, not Corneille's, but following Calderon's version. The 
libretto is by Mr Hippolyte Lucas (a mediocre writer, a journalist). 
Little is expected of it. Balfe is an Englishman who has been in Italy 
and is now passing through France. Tomorrow the Italian opera is 
doing Gemma di Vergy. 

But yesterday evening we all went (including Luce) to the Porte- 
Saint-Martin theatre where they are giving a new play by Mr Dennery 
(not very good), in which Mme Dorval acts marvellously. It is called 
Marie-Jeanne. It's about a working-class girl who marries an artisan. 
Owing to his evil mode of life he leaves her and her little boy in poverty 
and she, to save her child from dying of hunger (for she has nothing to 
give him), takes the infant in despair to the Home for Waifs and Strays. 
The scene is marvellously acted. Everyone sobs and cries, and all over 
the theatre you can hear people blowing their noses. Since her earliest 
days Mme Dorval has not had such a part I mean since she played in 
Ten Years of a Gambler's Life. 

Sunday, 21 December. Since I wrote the above lines I have been to 
see Balfe's opera: completely disappointing. The singing, of course, is 
as good as can be, so much so that I regretted to see such resources 
wasted, while Meyerbeer (who sat quietly in his box and followed the 

258 



libretto) has two operas completely ready for performance: Le Prophete 
and L'Africaine. Both are in five acts, but he refuses to let the Opera 
have them unless he gets fresh singers. However, Mme Stolz, who has 
influence over the director, will not allow anyone better than herself to 
have a part. The scenery [in Balfe's opera] is handsome and the cos- 
tumes very lavish. . . . 

24 December. I ask you, how can one keep one's head on one's 
shoulders here just before the New Year? The door-bell never stops 
ringing. Today they are all down with colds I have rny intolerable 
cough nothing surprising in that but the Mistress has such a cold and 
her throat is so sore that she can't leave her room, and that exasperates 
her terribly. The better one's health usually is, the less patience one has 
in illness. There is no cure for It and one can't reason about it. The 
whole of Paris is coughing this week. Last night there was a terrific 
storm with thunder and lightning, hail and snow. The Seine is enorm- 
ous. It's not particularly cold but the dampness is awful. Klengel from 
Dresden [see letter 24] is here with Mme Niesiolowska. He has been to 
see me; I promised to call on her. Perhaps one ought not to speak too 
openly about them. Liszt has also called. He had a lot to say about Mme 
Kalergis, but I gather from his answers to my questions that the rumours 
were greatly exaggerated. The brother of Titus's wife has been here: 
he is better and has gone off to Italy. He told me all about Titus and I 
became very much attached to him. Give my love to Titus. You must 
have seen Gutmann by this time [see letter 237]. Laski, whom I met at 
the Opera, will be able to tell you he saw me in good health. The New 
Year is not promising very well owing to the bad weather: the trades- 
men complain that shoppers are fewer than usual. I myself have not yet 
been into town for my shopping. I must find something for my god- 
daughter: in the meantime my godson will get nothing this year but 
why is he so far away? I should like to leave him a substantial inherit- 
ance, but somehow that sort of thing is not in my nature. I will think 
about it sometime when I'm in bed and can't sleep. 

I have tried over my 'cello sonata with Franchomme it goes very 
well. I don't know whether I shall have time to print it this year. 
Mme Fryderyk [SkarbekJ's uncle visited me recently. He is a worthy 
and lovable man who seems younger and plays the fiddle, so he says, 
as he did in the old days. He is vigorous, pleasant and witty: he stands 
up straight, doesn't wear a wig and keeps his fine grey hair in fact he 
is so handsome that younger men of today might seem old men in 
comparison with him. I haven't heard from Mery [Witwicki] for a long 
time and I don't know what has happened to him. 

K 259 



The dear creature [George Sand] is unwell. Today is Christmas Eve, 
the feast of Our Lady. They take no notice of it here. As usual they have 
their dinner at six, seven or eight and it is only in a few foreign house- 
holds that they keep up the old customs. For example, Mme Stock- 
hausen did not dine yesterday with the Perthuises (the lady to whom I 
dedicated my B minor Sonata) as she was busy with the arrangements 
for today's children's party* All the Protestant households keep Christ- 
mas Eve, but the ordinary Parisian feels no difference between today 
and yesterday. We are having a gloomy Christmas here because they 
[the Sands] are ill and won't see a doctor, They aH have bad colds and 
are staying in bed. Everyone curses Paris for its climate, forgetting that 
the country is even worse in winter, and that winter is winter, no 
matter where you are. One must put up with a few hard months. I 
often wonder how these impatient folk would manage to live beneath 
a still more unfavourable sky. I have already outlived so many younger 
and more vigorous people that I imagine I am immortal. Vernet's 
daughter, the wife of Delaroche who painted the hemicycle at the Palais 
[Ecole] des Beaux-Arts, died a few weeks ago. All Paris laments her loss. 
She was a person of sensitive understanding, quite young and pretty, 
although very slim. She received in her house the most distinguished 
people here. Everyone adored her: she had a happy home, wealth and 
respect. Her father was chief mourner and wept and roared like a bull; 
at one moment they thought her mother would go out of her mind. 

26 December. Yesterday and today Mme Sand has been in bed with a 
sore throat. She is a little better and will doubtless be all right in a day 
or two; but in the meantime I haven't time to write any more. Solange 
too has a cold I am the one with most strength. 

All my love. You must not worry about me. God is merciful to me. My 
love and best wishes for the New Year to you and all my acquaintances. 

F. Ch. 

My love to Louise. I enclose a note from Mile de Rozires. I have 
not had time to read over what I have written. 

242, FREDERICK KALKBKENNER TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Paris. 25 December 1845 
Dear Chopin, 

I should like to ask you a great favour : my son Arthur makes so bold 
as to want to play your fine Sonata in B minor, and ardently wishes for 
advice from you, so that he may come as close as possible to your 
intentions. You know how I love your talent and I need not say how 
grateful I shall be for the kindness I am asking you to bestow on my 

260 



imp of a son. He is yours to command every day between two and 
four, and all Sunday morning. A thousand pardons for this indiscreet 
request, but you have accustomed me to your kindness and I now take 
it for granted. 

My compHments to all the family. 
Fred. Kalkbrenner 

243. JUSTYNA CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

[Warsaw. End of December 1845] 
Dear Fryderyk, 

You gave us great joy by sending us news of your health. Mr 
Gutmann told us you were looking well when he saw you in Septem- 
ber God grant it was true. Considering my age, my health is good, 
Heaven be thanked. I rarely go out; I protect myself from all changes 
of weather and anything that might make my rheumatism worse. I 
even seldom go to see Louise, so as not to cause suffering as great as my 
own, or even greater, to those around me. Thank you, my dear son, 
for all the gifts which I receive from you on every occasion: they are 
agreeable and dear to me, but I never go out, I see few people, and 
you are wasting your money on me, dear boy. I recently had a great 
joy, thanks to you. Mme ObreskofT came here with her husband on her 
way, as she told me, to see her daughter in Athens. . . . [She goes on to 
speak of the little scheme for coming back with the Obreskoffs to Paris 
see No. 237.] I should have to stay with you the whole winter, and 
you, poor boy, what would you do with me? I should only be a source 
of worry to you. I know your good nature: you would always be 
uneasy about me, you would feel I was bored, not comfortable, and 
so on. No, my dear, I won't do it, especially as you have people with 
you who take the greatest care of you, for which I am most grateful. 
God may yet grant that I shall see you: I do not lose hope, for I trust 
in His mercy. May Providence in this New Year pour blessings on 
your head such is the heartfelt prayer of your 

Mother 

Suzanne and Mme Lutynska send their best wishes. My respects to 
Mme Sand. 

244. GEORGE SAND TO LOUISE JENDRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

[Paris. March 1846] 
My dear good Louise, 

I always wish to repeat how much I love you, even if Chopin gives 
me only a minute before he seals his letter and takes it to the post. So I 

261 



send you my love in haste, but it comes from the bottom of my heart. 
You may well believe how we pray for your happiness and for the 
health of your good mother and darling children. Fryderyk is fairly 
well although we are having a month of March which is very cold and 
miserable in comparison with February which was a veritable mistake 
of Nature the weather was so bright and warm. Now we have 
continual snow-showers, clouds and all the moods of a changing and 
uncertain sky. Nevertheless our dear Fryderyk is not ill and he is still, 
in my opinion, working too hard at his lessons. On the other hand, 
inactivity does not suit his restless and eager temperament. I shall soon 
be carrying him off from his pupils who idolise him and shall take him 
to Nohant, where he will have to eat and sleep a great deal, and com- 
pose a little. My children are very well. I have a third, a young rela- 
tion, 1 who was in unfortunate circumstances and to whom I have 
given a home. She is pretty and as good as gold. Her company is an 
advantage to Solange and to us all. ... 

245. GEORGE SAND TO LOUISE JENDHZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

[Paris. Late Spring 1846] 
Dear and beloved Louise, 

It is so kind of you to give me your affection, and I reciprocate it with 
all my heart. I am fonder of my room in Paris since you occupied it, 
and I refuse to give up the dream of seeing you in it again. Our dear 
boy has been quite exhausted by the hard winter which lasted so long, 
but since the weather has been fine he looks much rejuvenated and 
quite restored to life. Two weeks of fine warm weather have done him 
more good than all their remedies. His health is bound up with the state 
of the atmosphere and so I am seriously thinking, if I can earn enough 
money this summer to travel with my family, of carrying him off for 
the three severest months of next winter and taking him to the south of 
France. If one could protect him from the cold for a whole year, with 
summer following he would have eighteen months' respite to get rid 
of his cough. I shall have to torment him about it because, in spite of 
what he says, he loves Paris. But, so as not to deprive him too much 
and not keep him too long from his pupils, I could let him spend 
September, October and November here, and still give him until the 
end of May before returning to Nohant. Such are my plans for next 
year. Do you agree to them? Another very necessary remedy is that you 

1 Augustine Brault, who later in the year became the innocent cause of many of the 
family quarrels which ended in the breaking up of the friendship of George Sand and 
Chopin. 

262 



should write to him regularly and that he should never have any 
anxiety on your account, for his heart is always with you and he 
continually worries and yearns to be with his dear iamily. He loves you 
as much as you can love him, and I know what that means, 

Dear Louise, give my love to your dear mother and children and to 
your rascal of a husband, and believe me when I say that I am yours for 
ever in heart, soul and mind. 

as. 

George Sand had at this time a scheme for installing a form of central 
heating at Nohant, chiefly for Chopin's benefit. She wrote to a firm in Paris 
to obtain an estimate and Maurice made a careful plan of the whole house, 
shouting the complete lay-out of the rooms. There is thus absolutely no reason 
to suppose that she was "planning to get rid oj Chopin \ as has so often been 
stated. On 22 April 1846 she wrote to a friend in Paris: 

"We are leaving for Nohant on 5 or 6 May at the latest I am sending the 
plan of Nohant which Maurice has made, Chopin has been ill, but not danger- 
ously, thank God. However, he still needs a lot of care." 

246, GEORGE SAND TO HER SON MAURICE AT GUILLERY 

Paris, i May 1846 

. . . Yesterday Chopin gave us a party in his rooms, with music, 
flowers and a grand spread. There were Prince and Princess Czartoryski, 
Princess Sapieha, Delacroix, Louis Blanc, who made superb proposals 
to Titine [Augustine Brault, her niece; see letter 244] and speeches 
which Bignat [Emmanuel Arago] made fun o There were also 
d'Arpentigny, Duvernet and his wife, and finally Pauline Viardot and 
her husband. . . . 

247. CHOPIN TO MIXE DE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

Nohant. Whitsun. [31 May 1846] 

Thanks a thousand times for your kind letter. I am sending you mine 
for my mother. It is hot here. The ice-cream machine is going to be 
welcome. 1 Thank you once more for it* We are all well. Maurice is 
expected soon. 

All my most gallant respects.

score of Mozart's Requiem which I left at 5 or 9 [Place d'Orleans] with 
the Stabat Mater [of Pergolesi]. 

She [George Sand] sends her tender regards and says she will write. 

With the letter to Warsaw, mentioned above, went the following note 
from George Sand to Louise: 

248. GEORGE SAND TO LOUISE JENDRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

^ 1 . , _ . [Nohant. End of May 1846] 

Dear kind Louise, L J J 

We are waiting and hoping for Laura [Czosnowska] to come and 
spend a few days with us. I am glad of it for Fryderyk's sake he is so 
fond of her and she will tell us all about you. The weather is glorious, 
the countryside is splendid and our dear boy is, I hope, going to keep as 
well as my children, thanks to a quiet life and lovely sunshine. We 
think of you at every step we take along the garden paths and lanes 
where you once set foot. We love you as you do us. Give aU my 
respects and tender greetings to your mother. I am ever with you in 
heart and soul. 

249. CHOPIN TO AUGUSTE FRANCHOMME IN PARIS 

^ r - j Nohant. 8 July 1846 

Dearest friend, J 7 

If I have not written sooner it is not because I did not think of it but 
because I wanted to send you at the same time my poor manuscripts 
[Opp. 60, 61, 62] which are not yet finished. Meanwhile here is a letter 
from Mr Brandus [Schlesinger's successor]. Be so good as to ask him, 
when you deliver it, to give a brief answer which you will perhaps 
kindly send me. If anything unforeseen occurs I shall have to approach 
Meissonnier who is offering the same price. 

Dear friend, I am doing my best to work but I am stuck and if it 
goes on. like that, my new productions will neither give the impression 
of warbling birds [PNocturne in B major, Op. 62] nor even of broken 

china. I must accept my lot. Write. . . , , 

1 ' My love as always. 

F. Ch. 

All my respects to Mme Franchomme and warm greetings from my 
sister Louise. Kisses to your dear children. Mme Sand asks to be re- 
membered to your wife. 

George Sand's letters (unpublished) to some of her other friends give glimpses 
of life at Nohant during this last summer that Chopin was to spend there: 

264 



"At Nohant we are busy from noon until six o'clock long summer days 
during which we are shut up at our work like hermits. We shall think out a way 
of arranging our work so as not to stifle our dear Chopin. The rest of us make 
light of everything but not of him." And on 21 August 1846: "Eugene Dela- 
croix is with us and will be leaving in a few days. Chopin is still composing 
masterpieces although he claims that nothing he does is worth anything. . . . 
I am not working myself: a secret anxiety gnaws at my heart." On 19 August 
Delacroix wrote: "Chopin has played Beethoven to me divinely: that is far 
better than a lot of talk about aesthetics." 



250. TO AUGUSTE FlANCHOMME IN PAMS 

Nohant. 30 August [1846] 
Dear friend, 

Here are my three manuscripts for Brandus [Opp. <5o, 61, 62], two 
and. three for Maho who will pay you the money from Hartel (1,500 
francs). Deliver the manuscripts only at the moment of payment. Send 
me a 5OO-franc note in your next letter and keep the rest for me. I am 
giving you a great deal of trouble: I wished to avoid doing so by going 
to Paris myself this month but but but. Ask Maho not to change 
over the manuscripts intended for Hartel; since I shall not be correcting 
the Leipzig proofs, it is important that my copy should be distinct, 
[The fair copies went to Hartel whilst the original working manuscripts 
remained with Brandus in Paris.] And tell Brandus to send me two 
proof-sheets to keep. 

And now how are you? And your wife and the dear children? I 
know you are in the country (if Saint-Germain can be called the 
country) it must be doing you a lot of good, with this continual fine 
weather we are having. There I go, crossing things out I should never 
finish if I let myself go on chatting with you and I have no time to 
re-write my letter, for Eugene Delacroix, who has kindly undertaken 
to deliver my message to you, is just about to leave. He is the most 
admirable artist imaginable I have had delightful times with him. 
He adores Mozart knows all his operas by heart. Really my letter is 
nothing but blots and crossings-out today. Forgive me. Au revoir, 
dear friend. 

I love you always and think of you daily. 
F. Ch. 

AU my respects to your wife: kisses to the dear children. 

At the same time Chopin sent his copies of Opp. 60-62 to the banker Leo, 
for dispatch to Wessel in London, the price being 30, which Leo received 
and placed to his credit.

251. EUGENE DELACROIX TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. 12 September [1846] 

. . . Chopin will doubtless have heard from Mr Franchomme, who 
was preparing to write to him. I handed over to him personally, on the 
day following my arrival, the precious parcel [see letter 250] for which I 
was responsible and for whose safety I feared highway robbery more 
than for my own money-bags. . . . 

I need not teH the dear great Chopin that I have not found in Paris 
any pleasure to equal that which he so kindly gave me. That is a form 
of spiritual nourishment which is most rare in these days, and indeed 
in all ages. So I send him my affectionate regards and ask to be re- 
membered to him. . . . 

252. GEORGE SAND TO CHARLES PONCEY 

Nohant 24 September 1846 

. . . Solange is better and we are thinking of undertaking some con- 
siderable journey. I should very much like to spend part of the winter 
in Italy but it takes money for that [see also letter 245]. . . . 

253. CHOPIN TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Nohant. Sunday u October 1846 
Ch. de Nohant, at the little table near the piano. 

I have begun this letter ten times and am at last sending it off today. 
I enclose a note for Louise from the Mistress of the House. 
My dear ones, 

You must all be back from your holidays. Mamma will have re- 
turned from staying with Miss Josephine [Dziewanowska], Louise 
from the Ciechomskis, and the Barcinskis from their spa all with a 
store of health for the winter. God bless you all ! The summer here was 
so lovely that they can't remember one like it for a long time; and 
although the harvest this year will not be very good, and in many 
districts people are anxious about the winter, there are no complaints 
here, for the grape-harvest is extraordinarily good. In Burgundy it is 
even better than in 1811, as regards the quality of the grapes, not the 
quantity. Yesterday the Mistress made jam from the so-called Alex- 
andria grapes. These are very large grapes resembling muscat; but they 
do not ripen completely in this climate and are therefore excellent for 
jam-making. The other fruit trees have not done much. On the other 
hand there is still plenty of foliage and lots of flowers. We have a new 
gardener. Old Pierre, whom Louise and her husband saw here, has 

266 



been dismissed, notwithstanding his forty years* service (he was here in 
the grandmother's time), together with honest Fran^oise, Luce's 
mother: two of the servants with the longest service. I hope to God the 
new servants will get on well with the young man [Maurice] and the 
cousin [Augustine]. Solange, who was very unwell, is quite her old 
self, and who knows but what I shall be writing to tell you in a few 
months' time that she is to marry that handsome young fellow 
[Fernand de Preaulx] whom I told you about in my last letter. [This 
letter is lost.] 

They spent the whole summer here in various outings and excursions 
to the district known as the Vallee Noire. I did not join in, for such 
things tire me more than they are worth. When I am exhausted I am 
anything but cheerful, and I become a wet blanket to everyone: 
consequently the young people have less pleasure in my company. 
I didn't go to Paris either, as I had expected, but I had an excellent 
opportunity [Delacroix's visit] to send off my musical manuscripts. 
I took advantage of it and did not need to stir from here. But in a month 
I expect to be back at the Square and to find Nowakowski I heard 
from Mile de Rozieres that he had left his card at my place. I should 
Hke to see him. But they don't want to invite him here. He will bring 
back many memories, and besides, I shall be able to have a chat in our 
own language, for I no longer have Jan, and since Laura left I haven't 
spoken a word of Polish. I wrote and told you about Laura's visit. They 
may have been quite nice to her while she was here, but when she had 
gone they showed they didn't care much for her. The cousin did not 
like her, and so, of course, neither did the son. Consequently they 
made jokes and passed from jokes to coarseness; and since that offended 
me we have stopped mentioning her. One has to be as sweet a soul as 
Louise to leave pleasant memories with everyone here. The Mistress 
often said to me in Louise's presence: "Your sister is worth a hundred 
of you." To which I replied: "I am perfectly well aware of it." 

Today we have glorious sunshine and they have gone out for a walk. 
I did not care to, and I am using the time to sit down and have a chat 
with you. The little dog Marquis (you remember) is staying with me 
and is lying on my sofa. He is an extraordinary creature: he has a soft 
fluffy white coat which Mme Sand herself brushes every day, and he is 
as intelligent as can be. I can't begin to tell you all his original tricks. 
For example, he will neither eat nor drink from a gilt vessel: he pushes 
it away with his nose and upsets it if he can. 

In La Presse I noticed among other things the name of my godfather 
[Fryderyk Skarbek] in connection with a congress of specialists in 

i 267 



prison-reform which is being held at Frankfort. If he were to come on 
to Paris I should be delighted to see him, and I shall write and tell Mile 
de Rozieres that if she were to find any card of his with my concierge 
she should let me know immediately . Among other news you must have 
already heard about Mr Levemer's new planet [Neptune]. Leverrier, 
who works at the Paris Observatory, noticed certain irregularities in 
the planet Uranus and attributed them to another planet, so far un- 
discovered, whose distance, orbit and mass and everything he described, 
just as Mr Galle in Berlin, and now the people in London [John 
Couch Adams], have been able to observe. What a triumph for 
science that mathematics could lead to such a discovery ! At the last 
meeting of the Academy of Science Mr Arago proposed that the new 
planet should be named Leverrier. Mr Galle wrote from Berlin to state 
that the right of naming it belonged to Mr Leverrier, but that he 
suggested "Janus": Leverrier preferred "Neptune". But in spite of the 
opposition of a certain section of the Academy of Science, many were 
for giving the planet the name of its discoverer who by the power of 
mathematics had achieved something hitherto unknown in the field of 
astronomy. Since there are comets called "Vico" or "Hind'*, and since 
Uranus was also called "Herschel", why shouldn't there be a planet 
called "Leverrier"? The King at once made him an Officer of the 
Legion of Honour. . . . 

But speaking of discoveries, I must mention one which has more to 
do with my special field. In London a Mr Faber (a teacher of mathe- 
matics), who is interested in mechanics, has exhibited a very entertaining 
automaton named "Euphonia", which pronounces quite clearly not 
merely a word or two but long phrases, and what is more, sings a 
Haydn aria and "God Save the Queen". If they could get hold of a 
large number of these robots the opera-managers could do without 
singers for the chorus, who cost a lot and give a great deal of trouble. 
How strange to think such results can be produced by levers, bellows, 
valves, chains, pipes, springs, etc. . . . ! I wrote to you some time ago 
about Vaucanson's mechanical duck which digested what it ate: 
Vaucanson has also constructed a robot which plays the flute. But until 
now there has never been a machine that sang "God save the Queen , 
words and all. This "Euphonia" has been exhibited at the Egyptian 
Hall [in Piccadilly] for these last two months as Barcinski knows, it's 
a place where they have various curiosity-shows. 

A great rivalry is brewing up in the Italian opera in London for next 
season. Mr Salamanca, a Spanish banker and member of the Madrid 
parliament, has taken a lease of the theatre called Covent Garden, one 

268 



of the largest London theatres, but one which has never been very suc- 
cessful, on account of its situation, a long way from the fashionable 
world. Mr Lumley, permanent director of the Royal Italian Opera, 
which the whole of fashionable London prefers as being the theatre, 
did not make any special haste to engage his usual singers for next 
year, being calmly confident of the superiority of his silk-panelled 
theatre. Mr Salamanca got in before him, and has signed on Grisi, 
Mario and Persiani in fact all except Lablache and at higher salaries. 
So there will be two operas. Mr Lumley, in addition to Lablache, is 
said to have engaged MUe Lind and Mr Pischek (Berlioz says he is the 
best Don Giovanni). Since fashionable custom is more important in 
London than any conceivable miracles of art, next season promises to 
be interesting. They say that the old Opera (i.e. Mr Lumley) will hold 
out because aH the chances are that the Queen wffl patronise it as usual. 

The Paris Opera has not yet given a Rossini opera. Habeneck, the 
conductor, had a serious attack of apoplexy which forced him to give 
up conducting for a few months. But he is better now and Mr Pillet 
(the director) has partly been waiting for him. The Italian opera-season 
has already begun in Paris. A singer new to Paris, Colette, a baritone, 
has appeared in [Rossini's] Semiramide and is well spoken of. He is 
young, handsome as well as talented, and already plenty of stories about 
his love-affairs are going round. His father tried to get him to go into 
the Church, but he became an actor at Naples, abandoning the idea of 
Rome. He was for a few years in Lisbon where, as the saying is, he 
turned all heads. If, as we heard some time ago, two ladies fought a 
duel over him, and if he sings well into the bargain, he will get on here. 
I doubt, however, whether any duds will be fought over him in Paris; 
but he will make money, and more than in Portugal. He also sang with 
success in Madrid where great celebrations are now being prepared for 
the wedding of the Queen with her cousin, and that of the Infanta, her 
sister, with the Due de Montpensier, youngest son of Louis-Philippe 

It is thundery today and rather hot. The gardener is transplanting 
flowers. New land has been bought for the Jardin des Plantes at a price 
of 9,000 francs and more. It is adjacent land and includes grounds which 
once belonged to Buffon [the naturalist]. All the same, the Jardin will 
never enjoy such a situation as the one in Warsaw, on a slope overlook- 
ing the Vistula. The giraffe, which I believe Louise and Kalasanty saw, 
has died. I wish I never had any sadder news than that to report to you. 
This year I have had rather more letters announcing weddings than 
funerals. I have actually had only one invitation to a funeral that of 
the Comte de Sabran whom I was very fond of. I would like to fill my 

269 



letter with the best news possible, but I know only this 'that I love you 
always and for ever. I play a little and write a little. Sometimes I am 
satisfied with my 'cello sonata, sometimes not. I throw it aside and then 
take it up again. I have three new Mazurkas [Op. 63]. I don't think they 
have the old [words illegible] but it is too early to judge properly. 
When one is doing something it seems all right, otherwise one would 
not write anything. It is only later that one reflects carefully, and either 
keeps a thing or rejects it. Time is the best form of censorship and 
patience the finest teacher. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon, but I am not anxious, and 
I know that with a numerous family like yours it is difficult for you to 
settle down to write to everyone, especially as in our case no writing 
can suffice. I don't even know how many years it would take us to say 
everything and get it all off our chest, as the saying goes. So don't be 
surprised or grieved if there is no letter from me. The reasons that 
prevent you from writing apply equally to me there is no other cause: 
a certain regret is inseparable from the joy of writing to you it is the 
result of my conviction that between us words no longer count: even 
facts have scarcely any importance. My greatest happiness is to know 
that you are all well and cheerful. Always look on the bright side: you 
all have delightful children (I use the plural "you" because I know how 
the Barcinskis feel about my nephews) and I need not speak of their 
Grandmamma. If you have health, everything else wiU be all right. I 
don't feel too bad myself, for the weather is lovely. The winter does not 
look like being too severe and if I take care of myself I shall get through 
it as well as I did last year God grant it may be no worse! But how 
many people found it worse ! Actually, many were much better off than 
I, but I am not thinking of them. 

I have written to ask Mile de Rozieres to get my furniture-man to 
lay the carpets and hang the window- and door-curtains. I shall soon 
have to be thinking about my "mill", that is, my lessons. I shall prob- 
ably set out with Arago, leaving the Mistress here for some time as 
her son and daughter are in no hurry to return to town. There was a 
suggestion that this year we should go to Italy for the winter, but the 
young people prefer to stay in the country. Nevertheless, in spring, if 
Solange gets married, or Maurice either (both things are on the carpet), 
opinions will probably be changed. Keep this to yourselves. Something 
of the sort will happen before the end of the year. The young man is 
twenty-four and the daughter eighteen. But let it remain between 
ourselves for the time being. It's five o'clock and already so dark that 
I can hardly see. I must stop now. In a month I shall send you more 

270 



news from Paris. In the meantime I am looking forward to talking to 
Nowakowski about you. Give my love to Titus if you see him and to 
Karol, your tenant; and to my godfather [Skarbek] when he returns. 
If he goes to Brussels next year for the conference (already announced) 
like the one held this year in Frankfort, I have great hopes of seeing him, 
for the railway has long been in operation. Tell me about Joseph's 
family and about all my good acquaintances. 

All my love to you and Mamma. 
Ch. 

I apologise for all these useless sheets of paper which will convey very 
little to you, but if I don't send them off promptly now it will mean 
beginning another letter tomorrow and the thing will never end. I am 
sending this letter through Mile de Rozieres who will as usual slip in 
a note for Louise. My love to all. 

[George Sand's postscript:] 
Dear good friend, 

I love you: such is my eternal refrain the only one I know so far 
as you are concerned. Love me in return and be happy ! Bring your 
children up to be like you and they will be perfect. Always remember 
Fritz you can never think more often of him than he does of you. He is 
well. He has again got through the summer without a single day in bed. 
My daughter has been ill with a complaint usual in adolescent girls 
but she has now recovered and is quite her old vigorous self. My son 
sends his respects. We all love you, but I adore you. Say "How do you 
do" to Kalasanty for me. 

In the first days of November 1846 Chopin returned to Paris by himself, 
little imagining that he would never see Nohant again. But so it was to be: 
an epoch in his life had ended. 

254. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Wednesday, 3 o'clock. [25 November 1846] 
I take it that you have got over your migraine and are feeling better 
than ever. I am glad that aU your family have returned and I hope you 
are having fine weather. Here it is dark and damp, and everybody has 
a cold. Grzymala is better. He had about an hour's sleep for the first 
time in seventeen days. I have seen Delacroix who sent you his warm 
greetings. He is unwell but still goes on with his work at the Luxem- 
bourg. I went to see Mme Marliani last evening* She was just going 

271 



out with Mme Sheppard, Mr Aubertln (who had the nerve to read your 
Mare au Diable at a college lecture as a model of good style), and Cap- 
tain d' Arpentigny. They were going to hear a new prophet whom the 
captain is patronising. (He is not an apostle.) His new religion is called 
"Fusionism". It was revealed to the prophet in the woods at Meudon, 
where he saw God, The supreme happiness which he promises for some 
eternity or other is that there shall be no more sex* Mme Marliani does 
not care for the idea, but the captain is all in favour and declares the 
Baroness is a libertine every time she makes fun of his "Fusionism". 
Tomorrow I will send the fur and the other things you asked for. 
Your piano is to cost 900 francs. I have not seen Arago but I suppose 
he is well, for he was out when Pierre took him your note. Please thank 
Marquis [the little dog; see letter 253] for missing me and for sniffing 
at my door. Keep well and happy, and write if you need anything. 

Your devoted 
Ch. 

Love to the dear children. 

I have just received your letter which is six hours late. A most kind 
and excellent letter. In that case I shan't send your things off tomorrow. 
I shall wait. Won't you send me your cape, to have it altered here? 
Have you dressmakers who can do it? Well, I will await your orders. 
I am glad the sweets are appreciated. I have not sent your cigar-lighter, 
I don't know whether there is enough tinder in it. I shall take this letter 
to the head post office before going to see Grzymala. 

255. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Saturday, half past two. [12 December 1846] 
How nice it is to think that your drawing-room is warm, that your 
Nohant snow is delightful and that the young people are having a 
grand time ! Have you a sufficient supply of country-dance tunes to 
keep the orchestra going? Borie 1 has been to see me and I will send him 
the length of dress-material you mention. Grzymala has almost re- 
covered; but now Pleyel is down with a fever again. He can see no 
visitors. I am glad you are not experiencing our bad weather. Keep 
happy and well and the children too. 

Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 

Love to the dear children. 
I am well.

Paris. Tuesday, half past two. [15 December 1846] 
Mile de Rozieres found the dress-material you mentioned (it was in 
the cardboard box with Mile Augustine's cloak) and I sent it at once to 
Borie last evening. According to what Pierre said, he won't be leaving 
today. We are having here a little gleam of sunshine with Russian 
snow. I am pleased for your sake that the weather is like this. I can see 
you going out for long walks. Did the pantomime you had yesterday 
make Dib [a little dog] jump? Keep well the children too. 

Yours devotedly,

Love to the dear children. 
I am well but I dare not leave my fireside for a moment. 

257. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Wednesday, half past three. [30 December 1846] 
Your letter which I received yesterday made me very happy. This one 
should reach you on New Year's day, with my usual gift of sweets, 
the stracchino and cold-cream from Mme Bonnechose. 

I dined yesterday with Mme Marliani and afterwards took her to 
the Odeon to see Agnes [de Meranie]. Delacroix sent me good box- 
seats and I took the opportunity of inviting Mme Marliani. To tell the 
truth, I did not enjoy it much and I prefer Lucrece [another tragedy by 
Ponsard], but I am no judge of such things. Arago has been to see me; 
he is thinner and hoarse, but kind and charming as ever. The weather 
is cold, but pleasant for those who can go out walking. I hope your 
migraine is over and that you can walk about the garden as usual. Be 
happy, and may you all be happy in the coming year. When you have 
a moment, write and tell me you are well. 

Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 

I am well. Grzymala continues to be better. I shall go with him today 
to the Hotel Lambert, 1 wearing every greatcoat I can get on. 

During this autumn and winter at Nohant George Sand and her children 
had taken up amateur theatricals. As the scheme developed, more and more 
time and money were spent on it. George Sand wrote, and acted in, various

Czartoryski. Every New Year a charity-sale was held there for the benefit of the Polish 
refugees. 

273 



melodramas; Maurice occupied himself with the scenery and costumes, and 
later a large downstairs room was turned into a regular theatre with footlights ; 
curtain, wings, etc. 

258. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Tuesday, three o'clock. [12 January 1847] 
Your letter amused me very much. I meet with plenty of "bad days", 
but as regards Bonjours I have only come across that Mr Casimir 
Bonjour who is an eternal candidate for the Academic [Fran^aise]. 
The gentleman who claims to be my friend reminds me of that 
music4over at Chateauroux who told Mr de Preaulx that he knew 
me very well. If it goes on like that I shall end by thinking I am a 
celebrity. 

So now you are giving every moment to dramatic writing ! I am sure 
your prologue is a masterpiece and that you will enjoy the rehearsals. 
But don't forget your thick fur coat or your Muse [?]. The cold 
weather has returned. I have seen the Veyrets who send their compli- 
ments. I shan't forget your flowers and the gardener's list. Look after 
yourself and have a good time. Keep well all of you. 

Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 
Love to your dear children. 

259. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Sunday, half past one. [17 January 1847] 
I received the kind letter you sent on Thursday. So you too are 
writing plays in the Porte-Saint-Martin style! [i,e. melodramas]. The 
"Cavern of Crime". How enormously interesting ! Your Funambuhs 
theatre having been by turns both the Comedie frartfaise and even the 
Opera, doing Don Giovanni, has now changed into the most romantic 
theatre imaginable. I can well imagine the excitement of Marquis and 
Dib. Lucky spectators, simple-minded and untaught! I am sure that 
the portraits [of her ancestors] in the drawing-room stare down at you 
and wonder what is going on. Enjoy yourselves as much as possible. 
Here, as I told you in my last letter, there is nothing but illness every- 
where. Keep well and happy ! 

Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 

Love to your dear children. 
I am as well as can be expected.

260. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Paris. Thursday evening. [4 February 1847] 

I am as sick as a dog that is why I did not come to see you. I know 
that you are constantly on the lie Saint-Louis just now, in connection 
with the ball [at the Hotel Lambert]. Tomorrow morning before ten 
I will send you the remainder of the tickets I could not dispose of. I 
will go to the ball if I can. They are arriving from Nohant on Saturday 
evening, probably for dinner. So if I don't see you tomorrow we shall 
meet the day after. Please ask your good maidservant to send me my 
dressing-gown if she has mended it. 

Yours ever most cordially, 
Ch. 

261. To JOSEPH NOWAKOWSKI IN PARIS 

Paris. Wednesday evening. [10 February 1847] 
What has become of you? I haven't seen you since Friday [the day 
of the ball]. Do come and see me at No. 9 between twelve and one. 
You know it is difficult for me to leave the house, and if you have no 
great pleasure in seeing me, I have pleasure in seeing you if only be- 
cause you are exactly the same as you were at home [in Poland] ages 
ag _just the same queer character, like no one else under the sun. You 
will be going away and we shan't see each other not even if you were 
to pay for it. And afterwards you will regret you did not allow me to 
take a good look at that moustache of yours. 

Ch. 

262. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Paris. Wednesday [17 February 1847] 
My dearest friend, 

I beg you not to fail to come along this evening about eight. There 
wiE only be Arago and Delacroix, apart from the family. I shall pky a 
duet with Franchomme. You simply must come, my dear friend, if 
only for a moment. Today is Ash Wednesday. Come then, as a penance 
for having spent such a miserable carnival-time. 

Your old 
Ch. 

As Chopin had hinted to his family in October 1846 [see letter 253], a 
suitor had presented himself for the hand of Solange Sand; Fernand de 
Prlaulx, a young country gentleman of good family. However, when the 

275 



family came to Paris in February 1847 for the formalities of the engagement, 
Solange suddenly changed her mind and refused to sign the marriage-contract. 
A sculptor, Auguste Clesinger, had appeared on the scene he had already 
corresponded with her mother and on being introduced to the Sands he had 
successfully set about the conquest of Solange. In the circumstances there was 
nothing for George Sand to do but return to Nohant, taking her daughter with 
her. The drama of the break between Chopin and George Sand really begins 
at this point. 

263. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Paris. Begun a week before Easter [28 March], 
finished on 19 April [1847] 
My dearest ones, 

If one does not answer at once one cannot afterwards bring oneself 
to it, and instead of pushing you towards the paper conscience repels 
you from it. Mme Sand has been here two months but she is going back 
to Nohant immediately after Easter. Solange is not to be married yet. 
When they met here for the signing of the contract she would not go 
on with it. I regret it, and am sorry for the young man he is a worthy 
fellow and is very much in love; but it is better that it happened before 
the wedding rather than after. It is supposed only to be postponed, but 
I know what is brewing. 

You ask me what I shall do with myself this summer. The usual thing : 
I shall go to Nohant as soon as the warm weather begins, and in the 
meantime I shall stay here and give a lot of not-too-tiring lessons at 
home. If Titus sets off on his travels as he intended, I should like to spend 
some time with him here. As for you, the Barcinskis, you haven't yet 
decided on a trip; but if you do go I could meet you somewhere, since 
in summer I have at my disposal both the time and a little money 
earned during the winter that is, if my health allows. This year my 
"crises** (I must not write it in the way Albert's nurse said it when he 
was ill: "My master's cerises. 39 ) Well, as I was saying, my "crises" 
[attacks] have not been so frequent, in spite of the severe cold. I have 
not yet seen Mme Ryszczewska. Mme Delfina Potocka (you know how 
fond of her I am) was to have come here with her, but she left for Nice 
a few days ago. Before she left I gave a performance of my 'cello sonata 
with Franchomme. I had that evening, besides her, the Prince and 
Princess of Wiirttemberg and Mme Sand a pleasant warm atmosphere. 

Franchomme has just this minute brought me my box-ticket for to- 
morrow's Conservatoire concert. He sends his compliments to Louise 
and Kalasanty. Poor fellow, his three children all have the measles. 

276 



That's one misfortune that cannot happen to me. Nowakowski has 
perhaps reached home. (Franchomme saw him frequently when he was 
here, but he considered him a fool, ever since the day when, having 
come to see me, he refused to accompany me to a soiree at Legouve's 
where he would not only have found himself among a host of dis- 
tinguished men of learning, but could have seen and heard, for example, 
Lablache.) He's a good fellow, but such a dolt! God bless him! . . . 
I helped him as much as possible while he was here, but I often knocked 
at the door of his soul without finding anyone at home. Durand has 
made him a wig, but it covers a great void he knows and understands 
that himself for, after all, how and where was he educated? I expected 
too much from him, for I couldn't separate him from my memories 
of you. He delivered to me Kolberg's collection of Polish folk-songs 
the intentions are good but Kolberg's shoulders are not broad enough to 
carry the burden. Often when I see such things I think it would be 
better to do nothing, for all that laborious effort only spoils the field and 
renders more difficult the work of some genius who might one day 
unravel and reveal the truth. But until that day comes all those beauties 
[of folk-music] will remain decked out with false noses, rouged cheeks, 
with mutilated legs and on crutches fit merely to excite the mirth of 
those who examine them only casually. 

It's a week since I wrote the above trivial and pointless things. Today 
I am once more alone in Paris. Mme Sand, Solange, the cousin 
[Augustine] and Luce left yesterday. Three more days have passed, and 
yesterday I had a letter from the country to say they are all well and 
cheerful, apart from the rain they are having, as we are here. The 
yearly exhibition of painting and sculpture opened a few weeks ago. 
There is nothing very outstanding among the established artists, but 
some genuine new talents have come forward, notably a sculptor. This 
is only the second year that he has been showing his name is Clesinger. 
And there is a painter, Couture, whose enormous painting depicting 
a Roman banquet at the period of decadence attracts general attention. 
Make a note of the sculptor's name I shall often be mentioning him 
for he has been introduced to Mme Sand. Before she left [for Nohant] 
he made busts of her and Solange: everyone finds them admirable and 
they will probably be exhibited next year. 

Today, 16 April, I am sitting down to this letter for the fourth time. 
I don't know whether I shall finish it as I have to go to [Ary] SchefFer 
to pose for my portrait, and then I have to give five lessons. I have 
mentioned the exhibition; now for music: 

Well, David's Christophe Colomb is almost as successful as his sym- 

277 



phony, Le Desert. It has been given three times but I have not yet 
heard it, having no particular urge to go. One of those young fellows 
who like to make clever remarks said, "The audience shouted its I 
[encore!] and then terl [a third time!]" "terre" being "Land ho!" 
It appears that the fourth movement with its Indian songs is very 
charming. Yesterday Vieuxtemps gave a second concert. I couldn't go 
but Franchomme told me today that he played incredibly, and that his 
new concerto is very fine. Vieuxtemps came to see me two days ago 
with his wife, and heard me pky for the first time. I should have gone to 
his concert, but after dinner at Leo's yesterday they placed me at a 
table to look at the album of a painter who has travelled all over 
America for sixteen years, and I couldn't tear myself away wonderful 
things, but too many to examine at one time. Tomorrow we are 
promised a Spanish company (at the Italian Opera). The Spanish troupe 
has arrived and they are to perform at Court today. The Spanish 
Queen-Mother (Maria Cristina) is here at present. Today Mile Rachel 
is playing in [Racine's] Athalie at Court she is said to be marvellous: 
I haven't seen it yet. They do Athalie with Gossec's choruses. Gossec 
was a well-known and respected French composer at the end of the last 
century. In later times they usually added at the end of his Athalie 
choruses (which are rather dull) a very fine chorus from Haydn's 
Creation. When Gossec, already a very old man it was thirty-five 
years ago! heard it, he said with the utmost simplicity: "I have no 
recollection of writing that." There was no difficulty in believing him! 

I am sending Louise a note from Mile de Rozieres, but none from 
Mme Sand for they were in a hurry to get away. Today I had further 
news from Nohant: they are well, and are again arranging the house 
differently they like changing and re-arranging. Luce, who left with 
them, was also dismissed as soon as they arrived. So it means that of all 
the old servants whom Louise and her husband saw there is not a single 
one left. The old gardener who was there for forty years, then Fran- 
$oise with eighteen years' service, and now Luce who was born there 
and was carried to her christening in the same cradle as Solange all 
are gone, soon after the arrival of that cousin who has her eye on 
Maurice while he makes what use of her he can. This is between our- 
selves. 

Eleven o'clock. Mile de Rozires has arrived and is warming herself 
in front of the fire. She is surprised that my letter has not gone. She 
complains that her note will be out-of-date, and she wants to write a 
fresh one. 

Another interruption, and another day gone by. As I said, I was at 

278 



Scheffer's yesterday and went on from there to see Delacroix; but to 
compensate for that I had fewer lessons. I couldn't be bothered to dress 
for dinner so I spent the evening at home, playing and singing to myself 
songs of the Vistula. Today I was up at seven : my pupil Gutmann came 
to remind me of his recital which is today. Durand [the hairdresser] 
came, and then my supply of chocolate arrived. My chocolate comes 
from Bordeaux where it is specially prepared for me, without 
flavouring, by a private firm the cousin of one of my devoted pupils 
who feeds me on this chocolate. This morning we had a slight frost but 
fortunately it is nothing much and will certainly do no damage to the 
harvests which are expected this year. As you know, corn is exception- 
ally dear here, and there is a great deal of hardship in spite of all the 
charity. Mme Sand does much to help in her village and in the neigh- 
bourhood, as you may have noticed; that is one of a dozen reasons why 
she left Paris so soon this winter, apart from the postponement of her 
daughter's marriage. The latest work of hers to appear in book form is 
Lucrezia Floriani, 1 but for the last four months her new novel with the 
(temporary) title ofPicdnino (meaning "little fellow") has been appear- 
ing in La Presse. The plot is laid in Sicily. There are plenty of fine things 
in it and I do not doubt that Louise will like it better than Lucrezia 
which aroused less enthusiasm here than her other books have done. 
Piccinino is the nickname given to one of those Sicilian bandits on 
account of his small stature. There are fine character sketches of men and 
women, plenty of nature descriptions and poetry, and I remember how 
I enjoyed hearing it read to me. She is now beginning to write some- 
thing else, but while in Paris she had not a moment's peace of mind. 
Another three days have gone today is the i8th. Yesterday I had to 
give seven lessons to various pupils, some of whom are going away on 
holiday. In the evening, instead of getting dressed and driving to the 
Faubourg Saint-Germain, I went with Alkan to see Arnal at the 
Vaudeville in a new play by Mr Duvert called Ce que Femme veuL 
Arnal, as amusing as ever, tells the audience how he wanted to have a 

p when he was in the train, but could not get out before reaching 

Orleans. He doesn't utter a single improper word but everyone under- 
stands and it's a scream. He says the train stopped once and he wanted 
to get out, but he was told they were only " stopping to take in water for 
the engine" and "that was not at all what he wanted" and so on. 

1 The novel Lucrezia Floriani, in which George Sand and Chopin are unmistakably 
portrayed, was written in 1846. As usual, the story was read out to Chopin as it progressed, 
but whether he recognised himself in the character of Prince Karol cannot be determined : 
at all events he gave no outward sign. His eyes were opened later, but the publication of 
the novel had no direct bearing on the break-up of his liaison with George Sand. 

279 



Today Is the ipth. Yesterday a letter from Nohant interrupted me. 
Well, Mme Sand writes that she will be here at the end of next month, 
and that I should wait for them here. Doubtless it is all connected with 
Solange's marriage (but not to the young man I wrote to you about). 
May God grant them what is best. According to their last letter they 
were all in good spirits, so I hope all will turn out well. If anyone 
deserves to be happy, it is Mme Sand. . . . 

I send you my love. Nowakowski has surely reached home by now. 
Embrace Titus and send me news of him, also of the people in Dresden. 
Laura has left dear girl, she wrote to me from Dresden. Mery 
[Witwicki] has written from Rome: he is going to Hyeres where 
Zofia Rozengart is ; she is well and happy they wrote to me. My love 

to Mamma and to you all.

264. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Saturday [10 April 1847] 

Thank you for your good news. I have passed it on to Maurice who 
will write. He is well, so am I. Everything here is just as you left it. No 
violets, jonquils or narcissi in the little garden. They have removed 
your flowers and taken down your curtains, that is all. Keep well and 
cheerful; look after yourself and send me a few lines when you have 

time, just to say how you are. 

Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 
My regards to the young people. 

Meanwhile there were rapid developments in the situation at Nohant. On 
16 April George Sand wrote to Maurice in Paris telling him that CUsinger 
had appeared at Nohant, had proposed to Solange and had keen accepted. 
"Not a word of all that to Chopin: it is no concern of his, and once the 
Rubicon has been passed if's and hut's can only do harm! 9 On 20 April 
Maurice left, apparently for Holland. 

265. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Wednesday [21 April 1847] 

Maurice left yesterday in fine weather: he is very well. Your letter 
arrived after his departure. I am still hoping for a letter from you giving 
me the date of your intended arrival so that I can have fires lighted in 

280 



your rooms. And so have nice weather, brilliant ideas and aU the 
happiness in the world. 

Yours devotedly, 

CL 
My regards to the young people. 

266. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Thursday 29 [April 1847] 

The amount of work you do is amazing, but I am not surprised. May 
God grant you His help. You are well and you will stay well. Your 
curtains are still here. The 3oth [the day for her return] is tomorrow. 
But I do not expect you, not having received any definite news. It is 
fine and the leaves show signs of sprouting. You will have good travel- 
ling conditions and will not have to lose any sleep. Do, please, send me 
a line the day before you leave, for we must light the fires in your 
rooms. Look after yourself, be happy and don't worry. 

Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 
My regards to the young people. 

Unknown to Chopin there was almost a state of panic at Nohant: George 
Sand could not possibly return to Paris at this moment. Solange, fearing she 
was pregnant by CUsinger, had done some foolish things (plunging into an 
icy stream because her monthly period was late) which could not fail to arouse 
local comment. Maurice was away and had to be recalled. On 7 May George 
Sand wrote to him: 

"Come along Maurice, hurry. You will receive this last summons on the I2th 
or 1 3th. You must start at once, with or without papa [Casimir Dudevattt], and 
bring his consent and instructions regarding the drawing up of the marriage 
settlement. Come; our position is impossible; hurry up. Buy a special marriage 
licence and have it sent on. . . ." At the same time Cl&inger himself wrote: 
"Your dear sculptor asks you and Mr Dudevant to come quickly to Nohant. 
Solange is ill with anxiety and the strain of waiting. She also has her feminine 
reasons, and it all irritates me and makes me ill too. I hope that Mr Dudevant 
will not make any difficulty about coming. Take the steam-vessel, go at once to 
the coach dep6t and you can reach Nohant as I did in twenty-nine hours.*' 

267. GEORGE SAND TO MLLE DE ROZIERES IN PAWS 

Nohant. 8 May 1847 
Dear friend, 

I am very frightened. Is it true then that Chopin has been very ill? 
Princess Czartoryska wrote and told me yesterday that he is out of 

281 



danger; but how does it come that you don't write? I am ill with 
anxiety and I feel quite giddy as I write* I cannot leave my family at such 
a time, when I liave not even Maurice with me to save appearances and 
preserve his sister from all malevolent suppositions. I am in great 
distress, I assure you. Write to me, 1 implore you. Tell Chopin what 
you think best about us. However, I dare not write for fear of upsetting 
him too much; I fear that he will hate the idea of Solange's marriage, and 
that every time I mention it he will suffer an unpleasant shock. But I 
could not keep it from him, and I had to act as I have done. I cannot 
make Chopin the head of my family and its counsellor my children 
would not accept such a situation and my personal dignity would be 
lost. 
Goodnight, darling. Do write. 

George 

268. EUGENE DELACROIX TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

[Paris. 12 May 1847] 

. . . You will have heard from Mme Marliani about Chopin's health. 
He had a most violent attack of asthma; but he has now recovered. 
What is one to think of a civilisation which appears to have invented 
towns for the express purpose of bringing mankind together, yet allows 
me, at this dear friend's very door, to discover only after a week and 
by pure chance that he had been in such danger! The weather is no 
longer cold, and everything will be all right. 

269. GEORGE SAND TO WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Nohant. 12 May 1847 

Thank you, dear friend, for your kind letter. In a vague and in- 
definite way I knew he was ill, twenty-four hours before I received the 
good Princess's letter. Convey my thanks to that angel also. What I 
went through during those twenty-four hours is impossible for me to 
describe. No matter what might have happened, I could not have 
moved from here. 

Anyhow, once again, for the time being, he is saved; but what a 
gloomy future I see for myself in that quarter! I still don't know 
whether my daughter will be married here within a week, or in Paris 
within two weeks. In any case I shall be in Paris for a few days at the 
end of the month, and if Chopin can be moved I will bring him back 
here. I tell you, my friend, I am as satisfied as it is possible to be with my 
daughter's marriage, since she is in raptures of love and joy, and 

282 



Clesinger seems to deserve her, to love her passionately and to be able to 
give her the life she wants. All the same, such a decision is hard to take. 

I think that Chopin, standing apart from all this, must have suffered 
from not knowing the persons and factors involved, and from 
not being able to advise. But his advice in the real business of life 
cannot possibly be considered. He has never looked straight at realities, 
never understood human nature on any point; his soul is pure poetry 
and music, and he cannot tolerate anything that is different from him- 
self. Moreover, his interference in family affairs would mean for me the 
loss of all dignity and love, both towards and from my children. 

Talk to him and try to make him understand in a general sort of way 
that he must refrain from concerning himself with them. If I tell him 
that Clesinger (whom he does not like) deserves our affection, he wiU 
only hate him the more and will turn Solange against himself. It is all 
very difficult and delicate, and I see no means of calming and restoring 
a sick mind which is exasperated by the very efforts that one makes to 
cure it. For a long time now the disease which gnaws at the body and 
soul of this poor creature has been the death of me, and I see him fading 
away without ever having been able to do him any good, since it is his 
anxious, jealous and touching affection for me which is the main cause 
of his misery. For the last seven years I have lived like a virgin with 
him and other men. I have grown old before my time, but even so it 
cost me no effort or sacrifice, for I was so weary of passions and hopeless 
distEusionments. If ever a woman on this earth should have inspired 
him with absolute confidence I was that woman and he has never 
understood it. I am well aware that plenty of people accuse me, some 
of having exhausted him by the violence of my physical passion, others 
of having driven him to despair by my wild outbursts. I think you know 
the real state of affairs. He complains that I have killed him by refusing 
my consent, while I was absolutely certain that I should kill him if I 
acted otherwise. You see how I am placed in this fatal friendship, in 
which I have consented to be his slave, whenever I could do so without 
showing him an impossible and wicked preference over my children, 
and when it has been such a delicate and serious matter to preserve the 
respect it was my duty to inspire in my children and my friends. In 
that connection I have achieved miracles of patience such as I should 
not have thought myself capable of I who was no saint like the Prin- 
cess [Czartoryska], It has become a martyrdom to me: but Heaven is 
implacable towards me, as if I had some great crimes to expiate, since 
in the midst of all these efforts and sacrifices he whom I love with 
absolutely chaste and maternal feeling is dying, the victim of the crazy 

283 



love he bears me. May God in His mercy at least grant that my children 
may be happy, by which I mean kind, generous and of calm con- 
science. . . . 

Speak to our friend Anna [Czartoryska] about me and teU her my 
real feelings and then burn my letter. I am sending you one for our 
good friend Gutmann whose address I do not know. Don't deliver it 
to him in Chopin's presence Chopin does not know that I have been 
informed of his illness and he would want to keep it from me. His 
noble and generous heart has still a thousand delicate and sensitive feel- 
ings which exist side by side with the cruel misconceptions that are 
killing him. Oh, if Anna could one day speak to him and reach down to 
the bottom of his heart to cure him! But he seals himself off from his 
best friends. 

Adieu, dear friend. All my love. Depend upon it, I shall still remain 
brave, persevering and devoted notwithstanding my sufferings; nor 
shall I utter a word of complaint. Solange sends her love. 

George 

270. GEORGE SAND TO ADOLF GUTMANN IN PARIS 

Nohant. 12 May 1847 

Thank you, dear kind Mr Gutmann, thank you from the bottom of 
my heart for the real care you are lavishing on him. I know full well 
you are not doing it for me but for him and for yourself all the same 
I feel I must express my gratitude. How painful it is to me that this 
should have happened just at this moment. I have indeed too many 
miseries to bear at once. . . . 

He does not know I have been told of his illness: he obviously wants 
it all to be kept from me, especially as he knows what cares assail me at 
this time. He wrote to me yesterday as if nothing was the matter, and I 
answered as if I knew nothing. So don't tell him that I have written to 
you and that I suffered agonies for twenty-four hours. Grzymala speaks 
so highly of you, and praises the devotion and care with which all his 
friends, particularly yourself, have taken my place at his side. ... I 
hope to see you soon, dear boy: accept my maternal blessing. 

George 
[She sent a similar letter to Mile de Rozieres.] 

271. CHOPIN TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. Saturday [15 May 1847] 

How shall I say what pleasure your kind letter, just received, gave 
me, and how interested I was in the splendid details of all your present 

284 



concerns! None of your friends, as you well know, has sincerer wishes 
than I for your child's happiness. Please do tell her what I say. I am 
already much better. May God continue to maintain your strength and 
activity. Be happy and free from care. 

Yours most devotedly, 
Ck 

272. TO SOLANGE DUDEVANT AT NOHANT 

[Paris. May 1847] 

I have already requested your mother the other day to convey my 
sincerest good wishes for your future and now I cannot help expres- 
sing all the pleasure that came to me from your charming little letter 
in which you seem to be so happy. Well, now you have reached the 
summit of bliss and that is where I hope I shall always see you. From 
the bottom of my heart I wish you unshakeable prosperity, and I hope 
to see you soon. QJ^ 

The ill-fated marriage of Solange and Clesinger took place in indecent 
haste at Nohant on 20 May 1 847. The whole affair had elements of farce: in her 
wedding-announcements Solange was presented as Solange Sand her 
mother's pen-name without any mention of her father; and George Sand 
sprained her ankle and had to be carried to the church in a chair. Chopin 
of course was not there. 

273. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Paris. 8 June [1847] 

First of all, my best wishes as usual to darling Mamma for her name- 
day. 
My dearest ones, 

I received your kind letter and am delighted to hear you are all well 
again. On 2 May I had a serious attack of asthma and had to stay in- 
doors a few weeks but it did not do me a great deal of harm, for now 
that the fine weather has come I am once more perfectly well they 
say it wiU have given me a certificate for a long period of good health. 
Let's say no more about it. That, however, was the cause of my not 
writing for so long. 

Regarding Solange's marriage it took place in the country during 
my illness I can honestly say I am not vexed that it did, for I don't 
know what sort of face I could have put on. He, the young man, comes 
from the-devil-knows-what family. He was introduced to them here, 
and no one dreamt it would end like this, not until just before they left 

285 



for the country. From the outset I did not like hearing the mother praise 
him to the skies. Nor did I like seeing them go nearly every day to pose 
for their busts at his studio, or every day receive flowers and various 
other gifts puppy-dogs, etc. (That is why I wrote in my last letter 
that you would certainly be hearing more of him.) The mother is a 
dear, but she has not a pennyworth of practical common sense she 
invited him to Nohant: he was only waiting to be asked. He went, and 
he is so smart that they had no time to look round before it was all 
over. Solange liked all these presents for he is supposed to be a second 
Michelangelo, rides a horse perfectly (nothing surprising in that he 
was in the cavalry) . Maurice, too, was on his side simply because he could 
not stand de Preaulx who is courteous and well-bred. The other one 
understood the position at once and set out to flatter him. Add to all this 
the secrecy with which the mother surrounded the whole affair as a 
result they knew nothing about him, except such information as he 
chose to give; whereas all their friends here, such as Marliani, Dela- 
croix, Arago and myself, had deplorable accounts of him that he was 
heavily in debt, was brutal and struck his mistress who was pregnant 
and whom he abandoned to get married, etc. etc., and that he drinks 
(we all saw that, but it was put down to his genius). In brief, all the artists 
in Paris who, taking him as a man, regard him as a disreputable nobody, 
cannot get over Mme Sand's choosing him as a son-in-law. So far they 
are all pleased with themselves: he as you may well imagine is so 
affable. She is happy at being a married woman she has her cashmere 
shawls and goes riding; but I don't give them a year together after the 
first child and the mother will have to pay their debts. They were 
rather ashamed to write to me about it when they were at Nohant and 
I have some very curious letters in that connection. The son is the one 
who has come off best not only has he a brother-in-law who is a 
fool in certain respects and whom he can make use of, but what is more, 
his father, the worthy Mr Dudevant, hasn't given Solange a farthing 
dowry, so that he will get all the more. Moreover that cousin [Augus- 
tine] whom he once looked like marrying is now going to marry 
[Theodore] Rousseau, the famous landscape-painter, a respectable 
fellow who used to live in the same house as Cl&inger. In my view that 
is the wisest thing they could do, for it will be a great relief to Mme 
Sand and her son, both of whom had got themselves rather too much 
involved. She has had to maintain both the girl and all her family before 
she gets married, and he has been chafing under a promise of marriage 
for which he has not the slightest desire. The girl is pretty and so he 
thought he loved her: but when it came to a decision the young man has 

286 



always drawn back. So now they are all in Paris to bring the business 
to an end. Two days ago the banns were put up at the church of Notre- 
Dame-de-Lorette and at the mayor's office. As soon as it is over they 
will be leaving for Nohant I don't know whether I shall go with them 
frankly I would rather not, for apart from the Mistress and her son 
and daughter, I shall have to get used to new faces, and I've had enough 
of that. Not a single one of all those whom Louise knew at Nohant is 
to be seen. I may say between ourselves that all Mme Sand's real old 
friends cannot get over this extraordinary marriage [of Solange] not 
one of them was at the wedding. Solange is as charming as ever to me 
and he puts himself out to be as civil as possible. I am the same as usual 
but I am deeply sorry about it all. 

This marriage has also made a bad impression in Parisian society, for 
one of his statues, which was in the Exhibition, represents a woman in a 
most indecent pose so bad that in order to justify the figure's attitude 
he had to coil a snake around her legs. The way she writhes is frightful. 
It is nothing more or less than a statue ordered by Mosselman (the 
brother of Mme Lehon whom I once wrote to you about she is the 
wife of a former Belgian ambassador) and is a portrait of his mistress 
his and others', for she is a well-known Parisian "kept woman". 
Hence people are surprised that a young lady like Solange should go 
and lose her head over an artist who exhibits such voluptuous, not to 
say shameless, works. But in art there is nothing really shameless and in 
fact the abdomen, which is pressed forward, and the breasts are ad- 
mirably modelled. I promise you that at the next exhibition the public 
wiU be able to contemplate Solange's little bottom in white marble 
he is quite capable of doing it. Mme Sand wrote to me from Nohant: 
"He is bold, well-read, active and ambitious" as if those were great 
merits ! It was a moment of mad infatuation which did not last a 
month and there was no one there to pour cold water on it. I received 
her first letter mentioning the marriage on the ist of May, and by the 
2ist the wedding was over. It is a pity, if one looks at the affair from 
a common-sense viewpoint; but perhaps it is a good thing if one con- 
siders that Mme Sand always acts in an exceptional way and that, 
generally speaking, what she does turns out well for her even in 
matters where at first glance that would seem to be impossible. As I 
tell her, she has her own star which guides her; and I often console 
myself with that thought when I am depressed. Her trouble with her 
husband turned out to her advantage. She was able to keep her children 
with her she loves them above everything and to bring them up in 
health and happiness. Notwithstanding her enormous labours she is in 

287 



good health herself she preserves her eyesight in spite of having 
written so many books (over ninety). She is universally admired she 
is not badly off she is charitable, and instead of having a big wedding- 
party for her daughter she gave 1,000 francs to the "poor of the parish" 
as we say. There is only one thing she sometimes does not speak the 
truth; but a novelist is allowed some freedom on that score. For 
example: She asked me one day whether I knew about Mery [Wit- 
wicki, who died in 1847] the question struck me and I wondered why 
she asked it. She avoided giving me a direct answer, preferring that I 
should learn accidentally of his death from someone other than herself. 
Which is what happened yesterday: the daughter-in-law of our former 
landlord [in Warsaw] , who in a few days* time will be bringing Mamma 
a snuff-box from me as a birthday present, mentioned it to me by chance, 
thinking that I had long known of it. That makes the third friend I have 
lost this year: A&toni [Wodonski], Isidore Sobanski, whom I was very 
fond of, and now this good friend who wrote to me not long ago from 
Rome. 

I am sending Louise a note from Mme Sand and Mile de Rozieres. 
To give myself a chance to recover somewhat before Mme Sand arrived 
I went to stay with Albrecht in the country, at Ville d' Avray near Paris ; 
not far from Versailles. My goddaughter is now a big girl like Louise 
[his sister's child] and very pretty. If any of you thought of travelling 
this year I might come as far as the Rhine. It's a pity that Titus is tied 
to his factory : give him my love. Maryna and Olesia are very charming. 
God grant them good fortune. 

Today is the pth. I could not send this letter off yesterday as I still 
had a few lessons to dispose of and they held me up. You would not 
believe how charming my kind pupils are yesterday Mile Rothschild 
sent me a drinking-glass, very pretty, with a silver-gilt saucer and spoon 
a crystal glass with a silver-gilt stem cut-glass and in a charming 
case. I have not yet received the things you have worked for me but I 
thank you most warmly in advance and beg you not to wear out your 
eyes on such handwork. Keep well, and remember I love you always. 
I give you my word that I am completely recovered now and, as far 
as possible, calm in my mind, although I admit that this marriage of 
Solange, whom I have usually seen every day for ten years, often 
intervening between her and her mother, has made a rather painful 
impression on me. I am, sorry for de Preauk; but he behaved like a 
gentleman and took it all very well. They cannot say a word against 
him only that "it was broken off". 

As regards my music, my 'cello sonata, the one Nowakowski heard, 



is being published immediately, as are my new Mazurkas [Op. 63]. 
Franchomme, who visits me every day, sends his respects to Louise, 
as does my good friend [Charles] Gavard whom I saw yesterday. I 
sat again yesterday for Scheffer the portrait is coming on. Winter- 
halter, too, has made a small pencil drawing for my old friend Planat 
de la Faye (I wrote to you about him once). It's a very good likeness. 
You have heard of Winterhalter, of course. He is a kind decent fellow 
and very talented. [Henri] Lehmann too you must have heard of 
him has done a small portrait of me for Leo. But all these portraits 
are not to be compared for likeness with the one drawn by Mme Sand 1 
and which Louise possesses. Mme Sand wrote a new story while I was 
away. She has just finished it. It is called Celio Floriani [published as 
Le Chateau des Dlsertes\ I don't know it, but she told me it is short and 
deals with dramatic art. I don't yet know which paper it will appear in. 
Laura wrote to me some time ago from Dresden but I have not replied 
a habit of mine. She is a kind creature nothing seems to surprise her. 

Since Louise asks for more details about Mme Sand's son-in-law, here 
are some: His father is a sculptor at Besan^on, well known in the town 
but nowhere else. His labours have brought him a certain amount of 
money which is now invested in property in the town. He has a huge 
family. The son was taken up as a boy and protected by the Cardinal 
de Rohan. He was supposed to be going into the Church, but he gave 
it up after six months and took to drawing and sculpture. At this point 
his life story becomes obscure various shady affairs so much so that 
he was driven from one place to another, ending with a trip to Italy 
then he had to clear out of Florence on account of his debts. His father 
refused to have anything to do with him so he joined the cavalry, but 
he did not stay there long. Two years ago he made a small statue of a 
faun which was much talked of. This year he made that statue of a 
woman and a few excellent busts. He did a portrait bust of Aguado's 
[a Spanish banker] children and married Solange. He has no friends or 
connections. His father was not at the wedding he merely wrote a 
letter. Mme Sand has never seen him; she has only heard of him from 
the son. As for the mother, all they say is that she sits around all day in 
her chemise no one has ever seen her. He brought a younger brother 
of nineteen with him to the wedding, but he got rather drunk at one of 
the dinner-parties and had a row with Maurice. Clesinger had to get 
rid of him. This lad only ran errands for him. He himself is thirty- 
three whilst Soknge is eighteen. It seems too great a difference to me: 
de Preaulx was twenty-five. 

1 See Frontispiece.

Clesinger was first introduced to us a year ago by Mr d'Arpentigny, 
an ex-captain, a witty and entertaining Frenchman who, as soon as he 
learnt that Solange was going to marry someone he had introduced, wrote 
to the mother (I know about this) putting it to her that he had intro- 
duced someone with talent, but that he could give no guarantees of any 
personal qualities. He said that of course he felt it to be his duty to make 
that clear to the mother, since it was he who had been responsible for 
the introduction but Mme Sand took no account of it. She sent a polite 
reply, and since then he has not set foot in the house. He told Mme 
Marliani that he can't be expected to visit a house where they have 
accepted as their son-in-law a person about whom he had, with the 
best intentions and in the sincerest and profoundest conviction, written 
in such bad terms. All that is in keeping with the usual practice of good 
society. But since the family generally doesn't care a straw for society, 
they don't worry about such things; and perhaps it's just as well. 

If you are having fine weather we have had cold for these last few 
days. There are very many colds about. They say the doctors have 
introduced the fashion of going for a drive along the Champs-Elysees 
after dinner, that is, about eight, so that people may catch colds. One 
does in fact see lines of fine carriages in the Champs-Elysees of an 
evening, filled with ladies in evening dress, whereas last year they went 
out between four and six. . . . 

Give my regards to my godson and Eisner and everyone. Nowakow- 
ski too; thank him from me for bringing all those things I sent. . . . 
Pleyel has had a bad attack of fever. He has now bought an estate near 
Montmorency and will spend the summer there. He comes every day 
by train to his factory in Paris and stays from twelve till five then he 
goes back to enjoy the fresh air. Today at four o'clock I have some 
friends from Tours to see me the Forests. I have promised to play for 
them my sonata, with Franchomme. He has arranged my sonata with 
the March [Op. 35] for orchestra. Yesterday he brought me a Nocturne 
which he has adapted to the words O Salutaris: it goes well as a song. 
The door is continually opening and shutting with a flow of visitors 
whom I cannot get rid of. People must have long thought me a very 
uncivil person; but perhaps it has not yet come to that. All my love. 
I shall be writing again soon. You must write back. All my best wishes 
to dear Mamma. 

Your ever devoted 

Ch. 

[Other family greetings] 
[George Sand's note for Louise:] I have neither paper, pen nor time to 

290 



write. I don't know which way to turn; I have so much to do, for I am 
marrying off my adopted daughter [Augustine] next week and have 
scarcely got the business and worries of the kst wedding off my hands. 
But I love you and want to thank you for all the kind, tender and excel- 
lent things you say. My dear friend, I hope all will be well : I do my best. 
Chopin is quite well. He has heard the painful news of Witwicki's 
death, which I already knew. Adieu, beloved Louise. My love to you 
and yours. Solange sends her kisses too. 

274. To BREITKOPF AND HARTEL AT LEIPZIG 

Paris. 30 June 1847 

I, the undersigned, Fr. Chopin, resident in Paris, 34 rue Saint-Lazare 
[the main entrance to the Pkce d'Orleans] declare that I have sold to 
Messrs Breitkopf and Hartel of Leipzig the following works composed 
by me: 

Op. 63 Three Mazurkas for Piano 

Op. 64 Three Waltzes for Piano 

Op. 65 Sonata for Piano and Violoncello 

I confirm the sale of this property for all countries (except France and 
England) without limits of time, and acknowledge receipt of the 
agreed fees, for which a separate receipt has been given. 

F. Chopin 
[These were the last works published by Chopin himself.] 

Chopin did not return to Nohant he could not face the prospect of being 
there with Solange, Clesinger and the rest. It was not long before violent 
quarrels broke out between Solange, her husband and Maurice Sand, with 
George Sand vainly trying to keep the peace. She sums up the situation in a 
letter to Mile de Rozieres in which she gives her side of the story: 

"There has nearly been murder here. My son-in-law took a hammer and 
would have perhaps killed Maurice if I had not thrown myself between them, 
punching the former in the face and receiving from him a blow in the chest. If 
the cur& who was there, and some friends and a servant, had not intervened by 
main force, Maurice, armed with a pistol, would have shot him there and then. 
And there stood Solange, stirring the flames with icy ferocity, after having 
caused these dreadful rages by her tales, lies and incredibly filthy stories [that 
Augustine had been Maurice's mistress, etc.]. . . . This pair of devils left yester- 
day. ... I never want to see them again, they will never set foot in this house. 
... I had to give Chopin some partial account of it all; I was afraid he might 
arrive in the midst of a catastrophe and die of grief and shock. Don't tell him the 
worst of what has happened: we must hide it from him if possible. . . . They 
[the Cl&ingers] will probably, in their crazy and impudent way, force me to 
defend Maurice, Augustine and myself against the atrocious slanders they are 

L 291 



spreading. I will ask you to do one thing, my dear: be firm and take possession 
of the keys of my apartment as soon as Chopin is out (if he has not already left), 
and don't let Clesinger or his wife, or anyone they may send, set foot in it " 

275. SOLANGB ClisiNGER TO CHOHN IN PARIS 

La Chatre. Sunday evening. [18 July 1847] 

I am ill [she was pregnant] and the journey by stage-coach from 
Blois will wear me out. Will you lend me your carriage to return to 
Paris? Please reply at once. Before I can leave I shall await your reply at 
La Chatre. I am in a very embarrassing position here. I left Nohant for 
ever after my mother had made the most frightful scenes. Please do 
wait for me before you leave Paris. I simply must see you at once. 

They positively refused to let me have your carriage; so if you wish 
me to have the use of it, send me a note giving permission and I will 
send it to Nohant so as to obtain the carriage. 

Adieu. I hope to see you soon. 

Solange 
Address your letter to Mr Simonet, La CMtre. 

276. CHOPIN TO SOLANGE CL&INGER AT LA CB!TRE 

Paris. Wednesday [21 July 1847] 

I am most grieved to hear you are unwell. I hasten to put my carriage 
at your disposal. I have written to that effect to your mother. Look after 
yourself. Your old friend, 

Ch. 

This gesture by Chopin could not fail to be regarded by George Sand as a 
slap in the face. Her letter in reply to his note is lost, but it is known to have 
been very strong in tone and to have demanded that he should at once break 
with Solange and her husband. George Sand was well aware of the slanders 
which Solange was by this time pouring into Chopin s ears including the 
deadly suggestion that the mother had wished to keep Chopin away from 
Nohant while she was having an affair with the journalist Victor Borie, 
who was among the guests that summer. Chopin s reply is given in this next 
letter the last he ever wrote to George Sand: 

277. To GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. 24 July [1847] 

I am not called upon to discuss Mr Clesinger with you. The very 
name of Mr Clesinger did not become familiar in my mind until you 
gave him your daughter. 

292 



As for her I cannot remain indifferent to her. You will remember 
that I used to intercede with you for both your children, without 
preference. I did this whenever I had the chance, being certain that it 
is your destiny to love them always for those are the only affections 
which are not subject to change. Ill fortune may cast a shadow over 
them, but cannot alter their nature. 

This misfortune must be very powerful today if it can forbid your 
heart to listen to any mention of your daughter, at the beginning of 
her real life as a woman, at the very moment when her physical con- 
dition calls more than ever for a mother's care. When faced with such 
grave realities involving your most sacred affections, I must pass over 
in silence that which concerns me personally. Time will do its work. 
I shall wait still the same as ever. Y ours most devotedly, 

Ch. 

My regards to Maurice. 

278. GEORGE SAND TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Nohant. Wednesday [28 July 1847] 

I had called for posthorses yesterday and I was going to set off in a 
cab, in this awful weather and very ill myself. I intended to spend a 
single day in Paris in order to have news of you. Your silence had made 
me so anxious about your health that I was prepared to go so far. In 
the meanwhile you were taking your own time to reflect, and your 
reply is very calm. 

Very well, my friend, follow now the dictates of your heart and 
assume that it is the voice of your conscience. I understand perfectly. 
As for my daughter, her illness gives no more cause for anxiety than 
last year. Neither my zeal, my attentions, my orders nor even my 
prayers have ever been able to persuade her to behave otherwise than as 
a person who enjoys making herself ill. 

It would ill become her to say that she needs her mother's love a 
mother whom she hates and sknders, whose most innocent actions and 
whose home she blackens by the most frightful calumnies. You choose 
to listen to it all and maybe believe what she says. I do not propose to 
wage a war of that kind. I prefer to see you pass over to the enemy rather 
than defend myself from a foe bred of my flesh and reared on my milk. 

Look after her then, since it is she to whom you think you must 
devote yourself. I shall not hold it against you, but you will understand 
that I am going to maintain my right to play the part of the outraged 
mother, and henceforth nothing will induce me to allow the authority 

293 



and dignity of my role to be slighted. I have had enough of being a dupe 
and a victim. I forgive you, and from now on I shall not utter one word 
of reproach, for you have made a sincere confession. It surprises me 
somewhat, but if, having made it, you feel freer and easier in your 
mind, I shall not suffer from this strange volte-face. 

Adieu, my friend. May you soon recover from all your ills: I hope 
you will now (I have my reasons for thinking so) ; and I shall thank God 
for this queer end to nine years of exclusive friendship. Let me hear 
now and then how you are. 

There is no point in ever discussing the other matters. 

It must be constantly borne in mind that every comment made henceforth 
by Chopin touching his relations with George Sand and her family is coloured 
by the steady and pernicious influence ofSolange and her husband. He knew 
only what they chose to tell him, and he appears to have put up no resistance 
to their unscrupulous exploitation of his kindness and generosity. In his 
agitation and distress he was eager to leave the Place d* Orleans where George 
Sand still had her apartment at No. 5. 

279. CHOHN TO SOLANGE CL^SINGER AT BESANQON 

Paris. Saturday [18 September 1847] 

My sincere thanks for your good news. The little bag has already 
reached me and I have told Mile de Rozieres you will write. 

I went into Laffitte and Co.'s coach-yard by one door just as you were 
leaving by the other quite easily explained: my cab had a 7 in its 
number. [A reference to his superstition about the number 7.] And so 
I did not answer your letter at once yesterday, the I7th; I wanted my 
letter to catch you at Besan^on. 

So you are going to tour the lovely Franche-Comte district! Please 
don't forget to write to me on your travels so that I shall know where to 
send my reply. My Swede [a masseur] has left me and I cannot follow 
him to Stockholm [to continue the treatment]. Still no news [from 
Nohant]. You must keep as well as you are at this moment. 

Let me shake you warmly by the hand and send all my wishes of 
happiness to you and your husband. ch. 

280. BARONESS BILLING DE COURBONNE TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Paris. Tuesday 21 September 1847 

I am requested by Mme Emile de Girardin to persuade you to go 
tomorrow evening at half past eight at the latest to see the medium who 

294 



can be sent into a trance by music: she lives on the ground-floor at 80 
rue de Chaillot, off the Champs-Elysees. You will be very comfortable 
in a good arm-chair, with my daughter and Mile de la Rue beside you. 
It will not tire you and I am assured that you will enjoy it. I am sorry, 
adorable sylph, that I can't go myself, but I have had to give up every- 
thingexcept my love for you, which will last until my dying day. 

Camille de Courbonne 
Don't be afraid of a crowd: there will be few people there. 

281. SOLANGE ClESINGER TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

Besan^on. 30 September 1847 

It is a long time since you heard from me, dear Chopin, but the fact 
is that for a long time now we have had almost nothing in our heads 
apart from filthy money matters. At one time we thought we were 
ruined. We could not raise a loan by any means whatever, and we 
needed 8,000 francs to redeem notes-of-hand which fall due in Paris 
tomorrow. In the circumstances we saw no hope of getting the money 
in time, even by drawing on father's credit. He made a gallant attempt 
to help us, although he could have done more if he had wanted to. 

At the last minute, thanks to a providential piece of luck, I found in 
iny travelling-case the papers from Cave [a notary] and we obtained 
9,000 from the Luxembourg. You will agree that my patron saint seems 
to have had a hand in it and to have herself placed in my wallet those 
papers which I thought were useless and left behind in Paris. It looks as 
if the whole damned Paris property [given by George Sand as a dowry] 
might have been sequestrated. What a position to be in after four 
months of marriage, and with names like ours ! By the way, Mr 
Bouzemond will repay you 500 himself. You know only too well what 
a precious favour you did us I will not try to remind you of it. But 
for you we should have been in a deplorable situation that day. It was 
my first experience of life at close hand and I admit that it terrified 
me. Now I am much more experienced in such matters and they don't 
give me such a shock. One gets used to everything, even worries. Note 
that one is always punished in the same manner as one has sinned. 
Look at me, with my taste for luxury: I should have found a coach- 
and-six scarcely good enough to carry me; I counted on living in 
imaginary realms with dreams of poetry among clouds and flowers. 
Now look at me more prosaic and commonplace than the most 
humdrum of mortals. I am sure I shall become a miser I, who would 
have thrown away millions, A single week has aged me more than 

295 



eighteen years, and I think there are few women who, having been 
brought up like a princess, as I was, would have borne with such severe 
trials as calmly as I have. 

On the one hand, money worries; on the other, a mother who 
abandons me before I have time to know what life is; a father more 
severe than affectionate, a father without tenderness such things do 
not happen every day to girls of nineteen. . . . [And the letter goes on 
in this strain of self-pity, with the repeated accusation: "My mother, the 
first , the best friend that Providence gave me, abandons me now to 
all the saints in Heaven!"] 

282. CHOPIN TO SOLANGE CLESINGER AT BESANON 

Paris. Saturday 2 October [1847] 

I was just writing to you to thank you for the visit of Mr Bouze- 
mond's clerk [to pay the 500 francs] when your letter arrived. It has 
done me more good than Molin's bottle [of homoeopathic medicine] 
and I feel quite ready to allow myself to be taken by Mr de Rothschild 
to spend a few days at his place at Ferrires. Poor Enrico [Marliani's 
brother-in-law] died in hospital a few days ago, after Mme Marliani 
had let her apartment and had gone to live in furnished rooms. She is 
beginning to miss dear old Enrico very much. She came to see me 
yesterday and to tell me how astonished she was at having no reply 
from Nohant to her last letter. (She seems to have asked a few questions 
of her own.) No one has any news neither Grzymala nor Delacroix 
(he is very sorry he missed you) nor Mile de Rozieres. I shall tell her 
you will be writing. She hopes to start her trips to ChaiUot soon. 
I have already begun my lessons there is one just waiting for me to 
finish this letter. I wish I could have filled it with all sorts of good news 
but I have none to give; and as I lay down my pen I wish you both 
all possible happiness and thank you from the bottom of my heart 
for your kind words. 

My old friendship is yours always, always. 

Ch. 

Please greet your husband from me and correct my French, as you 
used to. 

283. SOLANGE CLESINGER TO CHOPIN IN PABIS 

La CMtre. 9 November 1847 

Here we are, safely arrived at La CMtre. We stayed the first night at 
Marionnet's and next morning Duvernet came to fetch us on his return 

296 



from the fair at Le Pont. We are now at his house. Yesterday, Sylvain. 
took the news of my arrival to Nohant. My mother at once sent him 
back to ask whether I would go and see her. I went, with Mr and Mrs 
Duvernet. I found her greatly altered, like ice, even really hard. She 
began by saying that if I separated from my husband I could return to 
Nohant. As for him, she no longer knew him. How do you like that 
for a beginning? You will understand that I could find no tender words 
to say to her after that. 

She began to talk business and I saw she was as much in difficulties 
as we were. Maurice came up to me with his selfish, cynical expression. 
He played with Bebe [a little dog] and pretended to be cordial to me. 
Anyhow I left Nohant more upset than if I had seen no one. 

Lambert [a painter] is installed in the store-room, in that studio 
intended for my husband. My bedroom has been completely cleared. 
The bed-curtains, etc., have been removed and the room divided into 
two: one part is the auditorium and the other the stage, and they act 
plays in it. Leontine, Henry and Duvernet have seen a show there. 
My dressing-room is now a wardrobe-room and my boudoir is used 
as a green-room for the actors. Who would have believed such a thing? 
A mother who goes and installs a stage in her darling daughter's bridal- 
chamber ! Mother will not be going to Paris this winter. She offered me 
the use of her apartment but I declined it that would be the second 
time she has given me her furniture. This morning she sent Simonet to 
fetch me to discuss business-matters, as if there should be a question of 
business-matters between us now. 

Good-bye, dear Chopin. I must go: Duvernet is waiting for me. I 
am leaving for Guillery [her father Dudevant's place] tomorrow. 

Solange 

The episode of Solange 9 s marriage had caused a coolness between George 
Sand and other friends besides Chopin. She did not answer Pauline Viardofs 
letters for several months, and then at last wrote to break the ice. Pauline replied 
that she was not really offended: she had understood her friend 9 s position. 

284. PAULINE VIARDOT TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Dresden. 19 November [1847] 

. . . There is in your letter another passage which I simply cannot pass 
over in silence the one in which you say that Chopin belongs to 
Solange's clique, which makes her out a victim and runs you down. 
That is absolutely false. I swear it is, at least so far as he is concerned. On 
the contrary, this dear and excellent friend is filled with, and afflicted by, 

297 



a single thought the harm that this wretched affair must have done, 
and is still doing, to you. I have not found him changed in the slightest 
degree he is still as kind, as devoted as ever adoring you as he always 
has, rejoicing with your joy, grieving only over your griefs. In Heaven's 
name, darling, never believe those officious friends who come and tell 
tales. . . . 

Louis Viardot added a page to his wife's letter, supporting the views she had 
expressed: 

"To be quite frank I may sum up what he said to us as follows: Solange's 
marriage is a great misfortune for herself, her family and her friends. The 
daughter and mother were both deceived and realised their mistake too late. 
But since they both shared in the mistake, why should only one bear the blame? 
The daughter wanted, insisted on, an ill-sorted match; but the mother who 
consented, has she no share in the fault? With her great gifts and experience, 
should she not have enlightened a girl who was urged on more by mortification 1 
than by love? If she deluded herself one should not be pitiless towards a mistake 
in which one has a share. And I (he added), pitying both from the bottom of my 
heart, endeavour to give some consolation to the only one of the two that I am 
allowed to see. 2 That is all, dear Mme Sand, not a word more without re- 
proaches or bitterness, but with deep sadness. I fear the breath of evil lips has 
come between you." 



285. CHOPIN TO SOLANGE CLESINGER AT GUILLERY 

Paris. Wednesday 24 [November 1847] 

I have been beginning to write to you every morning for the last two 
weeks. How distressed I am at the result of your two visits to Nohant! 
However, you have taken the first step you have shown feeling, and a 
certain move must have been made towards bringing you and your 
mother together since you are invited to write. Time will do the rest 
besides, you know that one must not take too literally everything that 
is said; and if they have ceased to recognise a stranger like me it cannot 
be the same for your husband who has become one of the family. I saw 
Mile de Rozieres yesterday and she told me Mme Bascans had heard 
from you, but not from Nohant. Mme Bascans is in bed with a feverish 
cold. All Paris is ill: the weather here is terrible and you are lucky to be 
where it is fine. Keep well and cheerful. I will try to send you better 
news of our climate, but for that to happen, this horrible year must 

1 Chopin seems to know that Solange had really wanted to marry Victor de Laprade 
(a poet) but his family would not hear of the match. 

2 Chopin obviously said nothing of the vile slanders which Solange uttered about her 
mother after the wedding and which were the true cause of George Sand's hardness. 

298 



come to an end a year which has now taken away all Grzymala's 
fortune. He has just lost everything in an unlucky business specula- 
tion. 

Delacroix came to see me and asked me to say how sorry he was he 
had missed you. Bignat [Arago] has not been here. Mme Marliani is 
getting a legal separation. There's some news for you ! Moreover, there 
is in Le Siede an article by your mother on Louis Blanc's Histoire de Dix 
Ans. That is all I have to tell. I feel suffocated, my head is aching, and I 
beg your pardon for all my crossings-out and my bad French. 

Let me shake you warmly by the hand: your husband too. 

Yours devotedly, 
Chopia 

Give me a sign of life. I will write a better and longer letter next time. 

286. TO SOLANGE ClisiNGER AT GuiLLERY 

Paris. Tuesday 14 December [1847] 

As soon as the post arrived I went to see your husband and deliver his 
letter he was on guard-duty [with the National Guard] at the Tuileries 
and I could only reach him very kte in the evening, at seven o'clock, 
and have dinner with him. He told me he had written that same day and 
that he will very shortly be going to Guillery. That will do you both 
good. You are lucky not to have the influenza. All Paris is coughing. 
I feel suffocated and am expecting the cholera Louise writes to say 
that it is at the gates of Warsaw but no one is afraid. Mme Bascans is 
better: you will apparently have heard from her already. Mile de 
Rozieres will be writing. Falempin [George Sand's agent] sent someone 
to her to collect the keys of the apartment at the Square [d J Orleans]. I 
have great hopes that your writing to Nohant will bring peace to you 
all. With God's help everything will be settled. Mme Marechale 
[George Sand's aunt] sent to ask me for news of Nohant. I sent the 
answer that they were all well, and that I would go and see her myself 
one day at the Elys6e. Frankly it is hard for me to make up my mind to 
go and give the old lady bad news. Besides, I hardly ever go out 
scarcely even to see Grzymala: he himself does not go out at all. The 
Princess [Anna Czartoryska] is still confined to her couch, as she was 
two years ago. The sale [for Polish im\gris\ will be held shortly, but it 
does not promise to be anything extraordinary. There is no question of 
a ball. Delacroix has been: no sign of Arago. Mme Marliani, who has 
changed her address once again and is now living in the rue Godot, told 
me she had ktely received some very consoling news from Nohant 

L* 299 



they are on her side [in the matter of her separation]. She is to be pitied. 
Enrico is completely forgotten. But what stupid news ! I have no cheer- 
ful things in my head to announce to you nothing but your husband's 
forthcoming visit to Guillery and a nice letter from Nohant. God be 
with you. 

Yours devotedly, 
Ck 



287. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Paris. Christmas 1847 

[Begun on 26 December 1847, finished on 6 January 1848] 
One of my old letters, which I began but did not burn. 

My dearest ones, 

I did not answer your letter at once for I am frightfully busy. 
Besides, Mile de Rozieres probably replied to Louise at once and told 
her that I am well but up to the neck in work. Thank you very much 
for the little bust of my godson. He has a remarkably intelligent ex- 
pression, but whoever made the bust must be a commonplace sort of 
fellow and in spite of himself he has left his own stamp on the work. I 
sent to you by Court Chamberlain "Walewski a small Lady's Companion 
for Louise from my kind Scottish lady [Jane Stirling] and now I am 
sending some New Year engravings by ordinary post. Gavard gave me 
some of his sketches for Louise I have had half of them for some time 
but I didn't send them as I have been waiting for a suitable opportunity. 
I shall bring them myself one of these days. Louise may send him a note 
of thanks if she likes. In addition to these there are The Bosphoms and a 
History of Paris for Louise; Ireland, Rome and France for Isabella; Paul et 
Virginia for little Louise. For Kalasanty, Les Gentilshommes and Les 
Madeleines^ and for Barcinski, Les Professeurs cartoons to make them 
laugh. 

I spent Christmas Eve, two days ago, in the most prosaic manner, but 
my thoughts were with you. I send my best New Year greetings as 
usual. . . . 

Solange is with her father in Gascony. She saw her mother as she was 
on her way there. She went to Nohant with the Duvernets but her 
mother received her coldly and told her that if she separates from her 
husband she can go back to Nohant. She saw her bridal-chamber 
turned into a theatre, her boudoir into an actors' wardrobe-room, and 
she writes to me that her mother spoke of nothing but money matters. 
Her brother played with a dog and all he found to say to her was: 

300 



"Would you like something to eat?" She saw no sign of the cousin or 
the other guests. In short, her two visits were completely wasted I 
say "two", because the next day, before leaving, she went back to 
Nohant and was received even more coldly. However, her mother has 
told her to write to her, and I suppose she has done so. Her mother is 
now more furious with her son-in-law than with her daughter, whereas 
in her famous letter to me [now lost] she wrote that her son-in-law was 
not a bad fellow, and that it was her daughter who made him like that. 
One might imagine she wanted to get rid of both her daughter and my- 
self at one stroke because we were in the way. 1 She will keep up corres- 
pondence with her daughter, and thus her maternal heart, which simply 
cannot do without news of its child, will be soothed and her conscience 
will be stifled. She will imagine she is being just and fair, and will 
proclaim me an enemy merely because I took the side of her son-in- 
law. She can't stand him, simply because he has married her daughter 2 
a marriage which I did my best to prevent. She is a strange creature 
notwithstanding all her intelligence ! She was seized by a kind of mad- 
ness: she is making a mess of her own life and of her daughter's. Her 
son too will come to a bad end I prophesy it and will sign my name to 
the prophecy. To excuse her behaviour she tried to find some blame to 
lay on those who wish her well, who believed in her, who have never 
done her a low-down trick, but whom she cannot bear to see near her, 
for they are the mirror of her conscience. That is why she has not written 
me another word, why she will not come to Paris for the winter, and 
why she never mentioned me to her daughter. I have no regrets for 
having helped her to bear the eight most crucial years of her life, when 
her daughter was growing up and her son was tied to his mother. I 
do not regret all that I put up with; but what does hurt me is to see the 
daughter, that carefully sheltered young plant, preserved by her 
mother's hand from so many blasts, only to be crushed with an impru- 
dence and frivolousness that might be forgiven in a woman of twenty 
but not in one of forty. One need not fully record all that has been 
said and done. Mme Sand can have nothing but good memories 
of me in her heart, if ever she looks back on the past. In the meantime 
she is going through the most fantastic paroxysm of maternalism, play- 
ing the part of a far better and more just mother than she actually is it 
is a fever for which there is no cure in cases where the imagination is so 

1 The slanderous stories told by Solange about her mother and Victor Borie had clearly 
had their effect on Chopin. It will be noticed that fie repeats word for word what Solange 
had told him in letter 283. 

8 The suggestion had also been made to Chopin that George Sand had invited Cle*singer 
to Nohant for herself, and that she had been frustrated by his marrying Solange.

dominant and the victim is let loose on shifting and uncertain ground. 
Well, they say "even a cypress-tree may have its caprices*' [Polish pun: 
cyprysy kaprysy] . 

Meanwhile the winter here is not too severe. There is a lot of in- 
fluenza about, but I have quite enough with my regular cough and I do 
not fear the influenza as you do the cholera. From time to time I sniff 
at my homoeopathic bottles, I give a lot of lessons at home and keep 
going as best I can. I have been trying to write to you every day, and 
I am finishing this letter, begun last year, on 6 January 1848. . . . 

A new novel by Mme Sand is appearing in Les Debats. It is a kind of 
rustic Berrichon tale like La Mare au Diable. The beginning is charming 
it is called Franfois k Champi. "Champf ' is the name given by country 
folk to illegitimate children who are handed over to poor women to 
rear: the hospitals pay them for it. There is talk also of her "Memoires" ; 
but in a letter to Mme MarHani Mme Sand said that they will consist 
rather of current reflections on art, literature, etc., and not be memoirs 
in the ordinary sense of the word. Quite right too ! it is too early for 
memoirs, for dear Mme Sand has still strange paths to tread during her 
lifetime and many ugly things are still in store for her. 

Mme Obreskoff has arrived [from Russia and Poland] and whenever 
we meet she has so much to tell me about Mamma. I have promised to 
go and dine with her once a week. 

288. TO SOLANGE ClESINGER AT GuiIXERY 

[Paris. 31 December 1847] 

My sincere thanks for your kind wishes. I need not tell you how I 
wish you all happiness in the year which is just beginning. I at once took 
your letter to your husband he said he would be leaving tomorrow to 
come and join you. He was hard at work on his sculptures for the 
Exhibition that's what prevented him from leaving Paris sooner. 
Mr de Larac has received notice that they are giving up the apartment 
at No. 5, and Maurice's quarters too. It makes me think that my com- 
patriot (if indeed he is such) was right. Well, if everyone is satisfied, 
so much the better. I have faith, and I believe that all will be well. It 
will take time, but soon instead of nine lines [from Nohant] you will 
receive ninety, and the grandmother will share the happiness of the 
young mother. You will both adore the little angel whose arrival will 
restore your hearts to their normal state. Such is the programme for 
1848. 

A new novel called Francois le Champi will begin to appear in a day 
or two in Les Debats. Hetzel [the publisher] has a vague announcement 

302 



in the smaller papers about some kind of "Memoires". MarHani has 
heard something about it and she told me the book will deal with 
the arts and literary topics. A certain financier, Mr Latouche (I 
think), will advance the money to Hetzel who will merely be the 
publisher. 

I gave your regards to Mile de Rozieres; she will be writing if she 
has not done so already. I still have my cough and can spare no time for 
anything but my lessons. It is cold too cold for me to go out. Take 
care of yourselves and come back soon and in good health. The New 
Year is beginning rather noisily the National Guards have given 
their usual serenade in the Square. I bought a few things for my god- 
daughter at the Hotel Lambert up to yesterday the sale had brought in 
nearly 20,000 francs. There were some splendid things. Your husband 
sent in a little water-colour which was very welcome. Delacroix 
painted a small portrait of Christ which is greatly admired. Gudin, 
Lehmann and others also gave drawings. It is getting too dark for me 
to see. It's snowing and the sky is very dull. Madame Adelaide [the 
King's sister] has died. There will be two months* full mourning. I can 
hardly breathe, but I wish you all possible happiness. 

Yours devotedly, 
Chopin 

289. GEORGE SAND TO HER SON MAURICE IN PARIS 

Nohant. 7 February 1848 

. . . You must make up your mind to pay the Rozieres woman a 
little visit if you don't find the linen and silverware. I don't quite know 
how much silver we have altogether or whether any was left there 
[at No. 5]. In any case it could not have been much, so you need only 
ask whether there was any. As for the linen, there certainly was, and I 
enclose a list. . . . This linen must be found; we are short here, and if 
by any chance Rozieres or Chopin has had it sent to Solange I shall 
know what to do. I shall deduct it from the sum I am giving her 
towards furnishing her house. There were also certainly kitchen things, 
saucepans, etc. Mile de Rozi&res will tell you what she has done with 
them. If you don't want to go yourself send Lambrouche [Lambert, 
the painter] who will not mention that you are in Paris and won't allow 
himself to be put off. The papers say Chopin is giving a concert "before 
he leaves". Do you know where he is going? To Warsaw, or merely to 
N6rac [where Solange and her father were!]? You will find out at 
the Square. . * .

290. CHOPIN TO LOUISE AND KALASANTY JENDRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

Paris. Thursday 10 February 1848 
[He gives further details of the books he had sent; see letter 287.] 

... I am as well as I am allowed to be. Pleyel, Perthuis, Leo and 
Albrecht have persuaded me to give a concert. All the seats were sold 
out a week ago. I shall give it at PleyeFs hall on the i6th of this month. 
There are only 300 tickets at 20 francs each. I shall have the cream of 
Parisian society. The King has commanded that ten tickets should be 
taken for him, the Queen ten, the Duchess of Orleans ten and the Due 
de Montpensier ten, although the Court is in mourning and none of 
them will be present. A list has been opened for a second concert which 
I am sure I shall not give I am sick of this one already. Mme Sand is 
still fixed in the country with Borie, her son, Lambert and Augustine, 
who now looks like being handed over in marriage to a drawing- 
master, a friend of Borie's from the small town of Tulle. She has not 
written another word to me or I to her. They have instructed their 
landlord to let the apartment. Solange is with her father Dudevant in 
Gascony I get letters from her. Her husband is here; he is finishing 
his sculptures for the Exhibition in March. Solange has been ill at her 
father's. They have no money, so Solange is better off where she is, 
spending the winter in a warm climate. But the poor girl is bored. A nice 
honeymoon she has had ! Meanwhile the mother is writing a very fine 
serial story in Les Dtbats. She plays the actress at Nohant in her 
daughter's bridal-chamber; she tries to forget and deadens her feelings 
as best she can. She will not wake up until her heart begins to hurt- 
that heart which is at present dominated by the head. I have said my 
"Amen" to it all. May God be with her if she does not know how to 
distinguish genuine affection from flattery. Of course it may only be I 
who think the other people flatterers, and perhaps her real happiness 
lies where I cannot see it. For a long time her friends and neighbours 
have been unable to make out what was going on there during these last 
three months, but they may have already got accustomed to it. Besides, 
no one will ever be able to follow such a mind in its capricious twists 
and turns. Eight years of some kind of order in her life was too much. 
By God's grace they were the years when her children were growing 
up; and if it had not been for me they would have gone to their father 
ages ago and would not have stayed with her. Maurice will clear off to 
his father at the first good opportunity. But perhaps these are the con- 
ditions necessary for her existence, for her talent as a writer, for her 
happiness. I hope you will not worry over all this it happened a long 
time ago. Time is a great healer but I have not got over it yet. That is 



304 



why I have not written to you as soon as I begin a letter I burn it. 
What was the point of writing so much? better say nothing, or only 
just this: She and I have not seen each other for a long time. There 
have been no scenes or rows; but I could not go to Nohant on con- 
dition that I would not mention her daughter. When the daughter was 
on her way to her father's pkce she saw her mother, who received her 
coldly and refused to see her son-in-law. However, she corresponds 
with the daughter, stiffly indeed, but she does write; and I rejoice to 
hear of it, for it shows there is still some bond between mother and 
daughter. 

I am sending this letter [i.e. not burning it], just to let you know that 
I am well and to clear up the matter of the books, I enclose a letter from 
de Rozieres. 

291. TO HIS MOTHER AND THE BARCH&SEIS IN WARSAW 

Paris. Friday u February 1848 

To all my dear ones. 
My darlings, 

It is a long time since I wrote to you. You know how it is the 
longer one puts off writing, the more news accumulates it grows and 
grows, and with such a mass of material one ends by writing nothing. 
Well, I am sending a few lines today to tell you I am well and that I 
received your letter. I have had the influenza like everyone else here 
and if my letter is brief the reason is that my mind is full of my concert 
which is to take place on the i6th of this month. My friends came one 
morning and said I must give a concert; and that I should have nothing 
to worry about, merely sit down and play. For a week now all the 
tickets have been sold although they cost 20 francs. The public are 
putting down their names for a second concert (which I have no inten- 
tion of giving). The Court has ordered forty tickets and the papers had 
merely to mention that I might give a concert for people to start writing 
to my publisher from Brest and Nantes to reserve seats. This eager rush 
surprises me and I must begin practising today, if only for conscience' 
sake, for I feel that I play worse than ever. I shall play (as a novelty) a 
Mozart trio with Franchomme and Alard. There will be no posters or 
complimentary tickets. The hall is comfortably arranged and can seat 
300. Pleyel always pokes fun at my silliness, and to encourage me to 
give a concert he will have the staircase decorated with flowers. I shall 
feel quite at home and my eyes will alight on practically none but 
familiar faces. I already have here the piano on which I shall play. 
Yesterday I signed for and had packed a very fine Pleyel piano for Mme 

305 



Adam Potocka (n&e Branicka) to be sent to Cracow. The blanket 
you made for me has at last arrived I don't know who brought it. 
Everyone who has seen it admires it. Thank you, my dears. You may be 
having cold weather but here the frosts have gone, although at one 
moment the Seine was frozen over. [He ends with general details about 
his Polish friends.] 

292. GEORGE SAND TO HER SON MAURICE IN PARIS 

Nohant. 12 February 1848 

I am glad to hear Solange is well. Avoid any kind of meeting, ex- 
planation or exchange of words with Clesinger. Don't go back to 
Rozieres, and if you have any things to give back to Chopin, leave 
them with the concierge it will be better not to write anything. If 
you happen to meet him, say "How do you do?" as if nothing were 
wrong. "You are well? Splendid, so much the better.'* That is all, and 
go your way. Unless of course he avoids you in that case, do the same. 
If he asks about me, tell him I have been ill as the result of my worries. 
Don't mince words, and speak quite sharply, so as not to encourage 
him to speak of Solange. If he should speak of her (but I don't think 
he will) you can say it is not for you to go into explanations with him. 

293. GEORGE SAND TO HER SON MAURICE IN PARIS 

Nohant. 16 February 1848 

Mine Marliani is making a great outcry because you have not been 
to see her. You know how greedy she is for details, and how inquisitive. 
Tell her all she wants to know. Solange, Clesinger and Chopin are 
blowing their trumpets against us so blow the truth through Mme 
Marliani's trumpet. . . . 

Chopin s last public recital in Paris took place on 16 February 1848 at 
Pleyel's rooms. It was surround by every circumstance of elegance and 
distinction, and marked not only the end of his career in Paris but also the 
close of an epoch in French artistic life. A week later the February revolution 
drove Louis-Philippe from the throne; the old days were over and the stage 
was soon to be set for the brash vulgarities of the Second Empire. 

294. CHOPIN TO SOLANGE CLESINGER AT GUILLERY 

Paris. Thursday 17 February [1848] 

Since you wrote I have been in bed several days with a frightful 
attack of influenza and I have given a concert at Pleyel's. In the interval 
I have drafted thirty replies to your letter I had even finished a letter 

306 



when last week your husband came to see me and tell me how you 
were. So I had to begin all over again in order to tell you that I found 
your husband very well and pleased with his sculptures; and to tell 
you also how sorry I was to hear of your unfortunate jaundice. Your 
husband will soon be back with you: that will complete your cure. 
He will give you more news of Paris than I could ever write. Leroux is 
here I met him at Mme Marliani's. He asked to be allowed to come 
and see me. He was very civil and did not mention the country 
[Nohant], M. de Bonnechose is here Grzymala is ill in bed. All Paris 
is ill, so you are right to stay at Guillery. Send me a pencilled note when 
you have a moment to spare I won't be so long in answering, now 
that my influenza and my concert are over. Maurice is in Paris, but he 
does not live here. He came to visit de Larac [at the Place d* Orleans] 
without coming upstairs to see me. Poor lad, he did no good by giving 
the people in the house something to talk about. Mile de Rozieres will 
have written. I must send off this "epistle" it is time for my lessons. 
Need I say how miserable I am at not being able to write regularly and 
easily? 

Yours most devotedly, 
Ch. 

295. MARQUIS DE CUSTINE TO CHOPIN IN PARIS 

[Paris. After 16 February 1848] 

You have gained in suffering and poetry; the melancholy of your 
compositions penetrates still deeper into one's heart; one is alone with 
you in the midst of a crowd; it is not a piano that speaks but a soul, 
and what a soul! Preserve your life for your friends; it is a consolation 
that one may sometimes listen to you. In the dark days which 
threaten, Art, as you understand it, is the only thing that can unite 
mankind divided by the harsh realities of life. One may love and 
understand one's neighbour through Chopin. You have transformed a 
public into a circle of friends: and lastly, you are equal to the demands 
of your own genius that is all that need be said. Think of me: I think 
only of you. 

Always unchanged, 

A. de Custine 

296, CHOPIN TO SOLANGE CI^SINGER AT GUIIXERY 

Paris. Friday 3 March [1848] 

I cannot help writing at once to say how delighted I am to know that 
you are a mother and are well. [Solange's child was born on 28 Feb- 

307 



ruary.] As you may imagine, the arrival of your little girl brought me 
greater joy than the arrival of the Republic. Thank God your sufferings 
are over. A new world is beginning for you. Be happy and take care of 
yourself. I really needed your good news. I was in bed during the 
disturbances an awful attack of neuralgia all last week. Paris is quiet, 
with the quiet of fear. Everyone has rallied to the cause of order. Every- 
one has joined the National Guard. The shops are open no customers. 
Foreigners, passports in hand, are waiting for the damage to the rail- 
ways to be repaired. Clubs are beginning to be formed. But I should 
never stop if I tried to tell you what is going on here. Thanks again for 

your kind letter. 

Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 

Just fancy! Malkfille is Governor of Versailles ! That Louis Blanc 
should be at the Luxembourg as president of the Labour Commission 
(employment being the real burning question of the moment) that 
is quite natural. Barbes is in charge of the Luxembourg Palace itself. 

Forgive my blots and crossings-out. Mile de Rozieres will write. 

As soon as the revolution broke out George Sand came to Paris and took 
a very active part in politics, writing proclamations, communiques, etc. , for 
the Provisional Government. It was now that she and Chopin met for the last 
time. 

297. To SOLANGE CLESINGER AT GUIIXERY 

Paris. Sunday 5 March [1848] 

I went to see Mme Marliani yesterday, and as I was coming out I 
ran into your mother at the vestibule door. She was coming in with 
Lambert. I said good-day to her and my next words were to ask whether 
she had heard from you lately. "A week ago," she replied. "No news 
yesterday or the day before?" "No" "Then allow me to inform you 
that you are a grandmother. Solange has a little girl, and I am very 
glad to be the first to give you the news." I raised my hat and went 
downstairs. Combes, from Abyssinia (he had arrived from Morocco 
and had fallen straight into the revolution), was with me, and 
as I had forgotten to say that you were well a very important point, 
especially for a mother (you will easily understand that now, mother 
Solange) I asked Combes to go back upstairs and say that you and the 
child were both doing well. I couldn't climb those stairs again myself. 
I was waiting below for the Abyssinian when your mother came down 
with him and showed great interest in asking me about your health. 

308 



I replied that you yourself had written me a pencilled note the day after 
your child was born. I said you had suffered a great deal but the sight of 
your baby-girl had made you forget it all. She asked whether your 
husband was with you, and I replied that the address on your letter 
seemed to be in his handwriting. She asked how I was I said I was well, 
and then I called for the concierge to open the door. I raised my hat and 
walked back home to the Square d'Orleans, accompanied by the 
Abyssinian. According to what Bocage [an actor friend] told Grzy- 
mala, your mother has been here a few days. She is staying with 
Maurice at 8 rue de Conde, near the Luxembourg. She dines at 
Pinson's the restaurant we once went to with Dektouche. She 
receives her friends there and told Combes to come and see her there, 
saying that she would soon be leaving for Nohant. I presume there is a 
letter from you awaiting her at Nohant. She seemed to be in good health 
I think she is happy about the triumph of republican ideas; and the 
news I gave her yesterday will have added to her joy. 

Take care, take care, all three of you. 

Yours devotedly, 
Ch. 

The calm continues. Mallefille has left Versailles he had only three 
days as "Governor". 

George Sand's version of this incident will be found on p. 365. Edmond 
Combes, "the Abyssinian", sums up in a sentence the effect which this tragic 
last meeting had on Chopin: "/ brought him home very sad, very depressed." 

298. JUSTYNA CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

[Warsaw. 5 March 1848] 
Dear Fryderyk, 

You gave us a real Carnival treat by writing to us, for a few lines 
direct from you calm our fears far more than any Indirect news such 
as often reaches us. It is all the more so when the influenza is raging 
where you are, and you can imagine our anxiety. The Courier reported 
that you had given a concert and would be going away at once. Of 
course we wondered: "Where to?" Some said, "To Holland"; others, 
"To Germany"; and again others, "To Petersburg". While we, who 
who were longing to see you, thought you might be coming here. The 
family at once started arguing about where you should stay. The 
Bardnskis were ready to give up their apartment; Louise too. It was 
really rather like a childish game of soap-bubbles. 

So you gave a concert. We shan't hear much about it, for your true 

309 



friend [Witwicki] is no longer alive. The last time you played [in 1842] 
he gave us such an exact description, down to the tiniest details, that 
I felt I was seeing and hearing everything. He wrote to me at that time 
these are his very words: "You must tell him, Madame, to thank God 
for His goodness in granting him his talent and the affection of his 
neighbours, for everyone loves him." 

It is indeed the sacred truth that without His most holy protection the 
greatest talent means nothing. Put your hope in Him, and with humble 
trust thank Him for everything and He will sustain you in all mis- 
fortunes. Today is your name-day: I send my best wishes. God bless 
you in this life and in the life to come. 

Your loving 

Mother 

299. CHOPIN TO SOLANGE CiisiNGER AT GUILLERY 

Paris. Saturday II March [1848] 

You must be brave and cairn. [Her child had died.] Take care of your- 
self for those who remain, I have just seen your husband: he is well and 
brave, and fuH of hope. Yesterday and the day before I found him 
working at his bust of "Liberty". It is finished now and every Thore 
[an art-critic] in Paris considers it superb. It will be taken tomorrow 
to the Hotel de Ville. Marrast is mayor of Paris Mr Bascans will be 
able to help and your husband knows Mr Caussidiere who controls 
the police and will have the bust escorted by the National Guard. He 
asked me to tell you he is far too busy to write. He will write tomorrow 
after the bust has left: it will be taken away at seven o'clock. So don't 
worry about his health. You see he is doing what he can that he is 
brave. Take care over your convalescence, so that you may both be 
able to bear your separation. Calm, then ; for pity's sake be calm ! Thanks 
to your father's care and also to Luce's (I always relied on her to be your 
good and devoted servant) your health will return and new happiness 
will begin for you. 

I hear your mother has left Paris. I have not seen her since the time 
when I was leaving Mme Marliani's. She will have received your letters 
at Nohant. She is much to be pitied, for it is a great blow to her, I 
am sure, and I have no doubt she will do what she can for you. So be 
brave and calm. I will spare you the conventional expressions of sorrow 
they seem very inadequate in the presence of great suffering. 

Yours devotedly, 
CL 

I will write often. Don't worry on your husband's account. 

310 



As he had promised, Chopin kept up his correspondence with the Clesingers 
and did everything in his power to help them. Solange continued to lament the 
misfortunes she had brought on herself and to blame her mother for everything. 

300. To JULIAN FONTANA IN NEW YORK 

Paris. 4 April 1848 
My dear friend, 

Welcome this dear friend Herbault as if he were my father or elder 
brother, and hence a better man than I. He was the first acquaintance I 
made in Paris when I arrived from Poland. I conjure you by the memory 
of our schooldays to be as cordial as possible towards him, for he de- 
serves it. He is in every way a worthy, enlightened and good fellow, and 
he will love you in spite of your bald head. What a sulky beast you are, 
not to have written me a single kind word. Never mind. You have a 
tender spot in your heart for me, as I have for you. And now perhaps 
you have still more feeling for me, since we are now a couple of Polish 
orphans: Wodzinski, Witwicki, the Platers and Sobanski all gone. 

You are still my good old Julian I need say no more. 

I embrace you cordially, my dear friend. 
Ch. 

If you want to do the right thing, stay quietly where you are and 
don't come back until something really starts moving in Poland. Our 
forces are assembling in the Poznan district. Czartoryski [Prince Adam] 
was the first to arrive, but God knows what course events must take 
before Poland may arise again. The papers here publish nothing but 
lies. No republic has been set up in Cracow, nor has the Austrian 
Emperor declared himself King of Poland. There was no question of 
his being invited to do so (as the papers stated here) in that address 
which they presented to Stadion [the Austrian governor-general] and 
which the Lwow papers published. Nor has the King of Prussia any 
intention of abandoning the Poznan province. He made a fool of 
himself about it in Berlin, but the Poznan Germans have nevertheless 
submitted an address in which they state that since this land was won 
by the shedding of their fathers' blood and they cannot even speak the 
Polish language, they hereby declare that they will submit to no other 
rule than that of Prussia. 

You can see that all this breathes war, but no one knows where it will 
break out. If it does begin, the whole of Germany will be involved. 
The Italians have started already Milan has kicked out the Austrians, 
but they still hold on to the provinces and will fight back. France will 
certainly help for she must take the opportunity to clear out a lot of 



scum from her territory. The Russians are sure to have trouble on. their 
own hands if they make the slightest move towards Prussia. The 
Galician peasants have shown the way to those of Volhynia and 
Podolia, and the whole business will not be settled without frightful 
happenings. But at the end of it all is Poland, holy, great in a word, 
Poland. 

So in spite of our impatience let us wait until the cards have been 
well shuffled. We must not squander the strength which we shall so 
sorely need at the right moment. That moment draws near, but it is 
not for today. Perhaps within a month, perhaps within a year. Everyone 
is convinced our affairs will be in full shape before the autumn. 

Your old friend, 

Chopin was now absorbed by the preparations for his visit to London. His 
departure was more necessary than ever, for the February revolution had 
brought artistic life to a standstill: painters and musicians were suffering 
great hardship. This situation was to last until the blood-letting of June 1848, 
after which the bourgeoisie regained the upper hand and life slowly returned 
to normal. 

301. To DOCTOR MOLIN, A HOMOEOPATH, IN PARIS 

Paris. Tuesday morning. [18 April 1848] 
Dear Doctor, 

All is ready for my departure tomorrow evening. I do not want to 
leave Paris without seeing you and taking your prescriptions with me. 
So I would ask you to spare me a minute on your rounds today. 

Yours devotedly, 
Chopin 

Please refresh my memory with regard to your fees. My note-book is 
in a worse state than I am myself if that is possible. 

Chopin brought with him to London a large number of letters of introduc- 
tion. Most of these were naturally delivered to their addressees, but one, to a 
Mr Hall, editor of the Art Union Monthly, was kept by him. In it Charles 
Gavard wrote: 

"Chopin is very modest and is afraid that certain persons might try to exploit 
his name at least so it seems to me. I would ask you to take care of him in that 
respectno one can advise him better than you, and if it is felt that some 
newspapers should write about him, let it be a paper like yours."

TRAVELS IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND THE LAST YEAR IN PARIS 



302. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

London. Good Friday [21 April 18 

I crossed the Channel without being very sick; but I did not travel 
by the fast boat, nor with the new acquaintances I made on the train, 
for one had to take a launch in order to board the vessel at sea. I pre- 
ferred to come by the ordinary route, and I arrived here at six o'clock 
as I had to rest a few hours at Folkstolne. 

My good Mrs Erskine and her sister have thought of everything 
even of my [special] drinking-chocolate, and not merely of rooms for 
me. But I shall change my rooms, for better ones became available 
yesterday in their street. I am at 10 Bentinck Street, Cavendish Square, 
but I shall move in a day or two, so send your letters to their address: 
44 Welbeck Street. They asked all about you. You can't imagine how 
kind they are I have only just noticed that this paper I am writing on 
has my monogram [Three Cs interlinked], and I have met with many 
similar delicate attentions. I am leaving town today as it is Good Friday 
and there is nothing to do here. I am going to see some people belonging 
to the former King [Louis-Philippe] 's entourage, who live outside 
London. Did you get back home safely [from the station]? Did you 
witness any street-fighting on the way? Did the army succeed in 
restoring order? 

Do please write, and may God be with you. 

Your old 
Ch. 

He was only a few hours at Bentinck Street, being away for the week-end 
and moving out on the Monday morning.

Miss Jane Stirling and her married sister, Mrs Katherine Erskine, fgure 
largely in Chopin's correspondence during his visit to England and Scotland. 
Many sentimental legends have arisen concerning Chopin s relations with 
them, particularly with Jane Stirling who was in fact six years older than he. 
Chopin s situation at this time was a difficult one: alone in a foreign country , 
unable to look after himself, hampered by unfamiliarity with the language, 
and already within little more than a year of his death from consumption, he 
was greatly dependent upon the kindness of these two ladies, and his gratitude 
to them was immense and sincere. 

But it went no further than that: he was perfectly aware of the gulf that 
separated him from his eager and over-fussy friends. There were times when 
they could not resist the temptations inseparable from their association with 
a "celebrity", and Chopin gradually (and rather unfairly) began to feel 
that he had allowed himself to be trapped. Indeed a point was reached at 
which he could say: "They have got their grip on me and I cannot tear 
them off! 9 Further comment is unnecessary and the letters must be left to speak 
for themselves. 

303. To AUGUSTS FRANCHOMME IN PARIS 

London. 48 Dover Street, i May 1848 
My dearest friend, 

Here I am just settling down. At last I have a room a nice large 
one in which. I can breathe and play, and here comes the sun to see me 
today for the first time. I feel less suffocated this morning, but all last 
week I was good for nothing. How are you? And your wife and dear 
children? At last you are beginning to have some peace, aren't you? 

I have done nothing so far I have a few tiresome visits I have not 
yet delivered my letters [of introduction], I am wasting my time on 
trifles so there you are ! I love you that is all for now. 

Yours ever, 

Ch. 

My respects to Madame Franchomme. 
Write and I will write back. 

304. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

London. 48 Dover Street. Thursday 4 [May 1848] 
My dearest friend, 

I have just returned from the Italian Opera [in the Haymarket]. 
Jenny Lind sang for the first time this year, and the Queen appeared in 
public for the first time since the Chartist demonstrations. Both made a 

314 



great impression but what impressed me even more was Wellington, 
sitting beneath the royal box like an old monarchical watch-dog in his 
kennel, beneath his royal mistress. I have met Jenny Lind she was so 
charming as to send me her visiting-card with a most excellent stall- 
ticket. (Stalls cost two and a half guineas.) I had a splendid seat and 
heard very weU. She impresses me as a remarkable Swedish type, 
surrounded not by an ordinary halo but by a kind of Northern Lights. 
She produces an extraordinary effect in [Bellini's] La Sonnambula. She 
sings with amazing purity and certainty, and her piano is so steady 
as smooth and even as a thread of hair. 

305. To ADOLF GUTMANN IN PARIS 

London. 48 Dover Street. Saturday 6 May 1848 
My dear friend, 

I have at last managed to get a foothold in this abyss called London. 
I have only just begun to breathe more freely these last few days, now 
that the sun has begun to shine. I have called on Mr [Count Alfred] 
d'Orsay who received me very civilly in spite of the delay in delivering 
my letter. Please thank the Princess [Czartoryska] for me. I have not yet 
been able to call on all the people for whom I have letters as most of 
them have not yet arrived [for the season]. Erard hastened to offer his 
services and he has placed one of his pianos at my disposal. I have a 
Broadwood and a Pleyel three pianos in all, but what's the use of 
them, since I have no time to play? I have countless calls to make and 
receive my days pass like lightning. I haven't had a free moment yet 
to write to Pleyel. Tell me about yourself. What are your plans? How 
are your people? Things are bad at home [in Poland]. I am terribly 
worried about it all All the same I shall have to play here. I have had 
an offer to play at the Philharmonic, but I would rather not. Anyhow, 
when I have played before the Queen I shall have to give a musical 
matinee for a limited audience at some private house. That is at least 
what I should like to do. At the moment all these things are plans 
plans and nothing more ! Write a long letter and tell me what you are 
doing. 

Yours always, my dear Gutmann, 
Ch. 

I heard Mile Lind yesterday in La Sonnambula. Very fine. I have made 
her acquaintance. Mme Viardot has been to see me. She too will be 
singing in Sonnambula. All the Parisian pianists are in London. [Emile] 
Prudent did not have much success with his concerto at the Philhar- 
monic. They only do classical things. Thalberg has been engaged for 

315 



twelve concerts at the theatre where Lind is appearing. [Charles] 
Halle will play some Mendelssohn. 

306. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

London. Saturday 13 [May 1848] 

The reason why you have not heard from me is not that I am lazy, 
but that I have to waste my time on trifles, I cannot get up before eight. 
My Italian [valet], who thinks only of himself and his accounts, wastes 
the first part of the morning for me, and after ten begin all sorts of 
tribulations which don't bring in any money. About one o'clock I have 
a few lessons. I cannot walk or go about much, and so I do little on my 
own behalf, but I see that things get done almost automatically; and if 
the season lasted six months I might make some money. So far I don't 
know how it will be. 

It is only the day after tomorrow that the Duchess of Sutherland is to 
present me to the Queen. The Queen will be at her house on the 
occasion of a christening. If the Queen and Prince Albert are pleased 
with me they already know about me all will be well: I shall be 
starting from the top. I have had an offer to play at the Philharmonic 
but I don't want to it means playing with orchestra. I went to see what 
it was like. Prudent played his concerto and had a fiasco. They want 
Mozart, Beethoven or Mendelssohn; and although the directors and 
others say that my concertos have already been played there, and with 
success, I prefer not to accept nothing could come of it. Their 
orchestra, like their roast beef or turtle soup, is strong and efficient, but 
that is all. What I have said is not really a valid excuse: there is only 
one impossible circumstance they never have more than one re- 
hearsal, since everyone's time is so valuable just now, and that rehearsal 
is a public one. 

I have not yet been able to deliver all my letters you have to catch 
people at home between one and two. Some very nice articles have been 
written about me in the papers. Yesterday at Covent Garden Mme 
Viardot sang my Mazurkas 1 and they were encored. She came to see 
me with her husband when they arrived. I went to return her visit but 
she was out. She was much more affable than in Paris and sang my 
Mazurkas without my asking her. She has appeared in Sonnamhula at 
the same theatre (Covent Garden) as Grisi, Persiani, Alboni, Mario, 
etc. This theatre is the rival of the Theatre Royal [in the Haymarket] 

1 She had arranged about half a dozen Mazurkas as songs. The most popular and effective 
was her arrangement of the Mazurka in D, Op. 33, No. 2. 

316 



where Liiid and Lablache are. Mile LInd also made her first appearance 
in Sonnambula* I am sending you a slip of paper I wrote about her two 
weeks ago [i.e. letter 304]. Mme Viardot had less success: the Queen 
was not there and Viardot was ill at ease as she had to sing with Flavio 
instead of Mario. She came to see me here when I happened to be out, 
but I shall see them on Sunday. Yesterday I dined with Jenny Lind and 
afterwards she sang Swedish songs to me until midnight. This music 
has a distinctive character, just as ours has. We have something Slavonic ; 
they have something Scandinavian quite different from each other, 
and yet we are closer to them than an Italian is to a Spaniard. 

Since I have been here I have heard the grimmest news of what is 
happening in the Grand duchy of Poznan: I learnt of it from Stanislas 
Kozmian and Szulczewski, for whom Zaleski gave me a note of 
introduction. Oh, how awful! It makes my heart sink I am in 
despair. 

I have three pianos. In addition to my Pleyel I have a Broadwood and 
an Erard, but I have so far only been able to play on my own. At last 
I have good lodgings ; but no sooner have I settled down than my land- 
lord now wants to make me pay twice as much, or else accept another 
room. (I arn already paying twenty-six guineas a month.) It is true that 
I have a large splendid drawing-room and can give my lessons here. 
So far I have only five pupils. 1 1 don't yet know what I shall do. I shall 
probably stay here because the other room is neither so large nor so 
suitable. And once you have announced your address it is better not to 
change. The landlord's pretext for the change is that we have nothing 
in writing and so he may raise the rent. 

My heart aches when I think of Solange. They are all to be pitied; 
for things cannot always be perfect for us. I am surprised to hear 
of B. [? Borie] crying I only hope the mother and the little ones 
don't cry. 

I have not yet written to Pleyel and I don't know when I shall. 

All my love. 
Your 
Ch. 

The English papers write nasty things about Mme Sand: as, for ex- 
ample, that Ledru-Rollin [a leading politician] could be seen in some 
park (probably the Luxembourg) lying on the grass, with Mme Sand 
standing beside him the two of them conversing like that.

307. To MILE DE ROZIEHES IN PARIS 

London. 48 Dover Street, Piccadilly, i June 1848 

I am writing these few lines to ask how you are and what pleasant 
things you are doing. I am not yet used to this London air, and this life 
of visits, dinners and soirees is very hard on me. I have been spitting 
blood these last few days, and I have had nothing but ices and lemonade, 
which have done me good, as well as the three days' rest which I 
allowed myself. I am now acquainted somewhat with London society 
a host of Ladies whom I have been introduced to and whose names 
go in one ear and out the other as soon as they are mentioned. Well, I 
have played at the Duchess of Sutherland's in the presence of the Queen, 
Prince Albert, the Prince of Prussia, Wellington and all the cream of 
the Garter, on the occasion of a christening (a select gathering of eighty 
persons). They also had that evening Lablache, Mario and Tamburini. 
Her Majesty spoke a few very gracious words to me. I doubt, however, 
whether I shall be playing at Court, as a period of Court-mourning, 
lasting until the 22nd or 24th, has just begun for one of Her Majesty's 
aunts [Princess Sophia]. 

I give a few lessons at home. I have a few engagements to play at 
fashionable drawing-rooms this brings in a few guineas which dis- 
appear in spite of all my economy. My lodgings alone now cost me 
ten guineas a week (for once I was settled and had sent out my cards, 
the rent was raised). It is true that I am in one of the finest districts in 
London I have a large drawing-room with three pianos a Pleyel, a 
Broadwood and an Erard. I have a fine staircase Mme de Manzourow, 
who is here for a day or two, thinks that it is not dear. But I am aware 
of the expense, all the more since my Italian valet (the most typical 
Italian imaginable) sneers at my attempts at economy. He refuses to 
accompany me in the evening if I take a cab rather than a privately 
hired carriage. I have to put up with it all as I can't find anyone better. 
I think, however, that I shall have to do something about it. I shall not be 
playing at the Philharmonic, notwithstanding those gentlemen's oblig- 
ing offers. I don't want to have the trouble for nothing playing after 
a single rehearsal and consequently with poor ensemble; and keeping out 
all those who would like to play there. (Hall6 is just the man they need, 
and I have promised to tell him as soon as I have come to a decision, so 
that he can make his moves.) I avoid also all big public concerts. I think 
I shall give a concert in some fashionable drawing-room, limited to 
150 to 200 people. I have met Mile Lind she is charming, and a singer 
of genius. I have seen Mme Viardot again very charming here in 
London. She was so gracious as to sing my Mazurkas at a concert held 



in her theatre [Covent Garden] without my asking. So far she has 
only sung in Sonnambula they are now going to put on the Barber 
and I Capuleti [ed I Monteahi]. 

EC 
Tell Franchomme I will write. Give Mm my warmest greetings. 

308. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

London. 48 Dover Street. Friday 2 June [1848] 
My dear friend, 

The weather has been horrible this last week and that does me no 
good at all. Besides, I have had to stay out late every evening at fashion- 
able soirees. I have not the strength for such a life. It would not be so 
bad if I were making money by it, but I have so far had only two 
paid engagements at twenty guineas. I give a few lessons at home at a 
guinea a time, but I have no scheme yet for a proper concert. I have 
played before the Queen, Prince Albert, the Prince of Prussia and the 
most elegant social circle at the Duchess of Sutherland's. They say it 
went very well, but now there is Court-mourning until the 23rd for 
some royal aunt. There will be nothing at Court, so I doubt whether I 
shall be invited. I don't want to pky at the Philharmonic it would not 
bring in a penny merely colossal fatigue. They have one rehearsal 
a public one and you have to play Mendelssohn if you wish to have a 
great success. High society usually gives only balls or vocal concerts. 
The Queen has so far not given any concert; nor has the Duke of 
Devonshire he only gave a ball. I give Sutherland's daughter one 
lesson a week. The Duchess of Somerset is also very charming to me: 
she invites me to her evening parties where the son of Don Carlos [the 
Spanish pretender] spends most of his time. Her Grace (who comes 
immediately after the Queen at the Coronation!!!) receives the 
Westminsters and everybody. But the Duke is close-fisted, so they don't 
pay. That is why I shan't go there today, in spite of the Spanish prince, 
as I have a dinner at eight at Lady Gainsborough's she is very charm- 
ing to me. She gave a matinee and introduced me to the leading society 
ladies. If I could run around for whole days from one end of London to 
the other; if only I had not been spitting blood these last few days; if 
I were younger and if I were not, as I am, up to the neck in social 
obligations then I might start my life all over again. Add to that a 
good valet who would look after my expenditure and would not waste 
my substance. As a result of my outlay on lodgings and carriages I 
have not yet been able to save a penny. And then my valet wastes my 
time as well My good Scottish ladies show me great friendship here. I 

319 



always dine with them when I am not invited out. But they are used to 
roaming around and being shaken up in a carriage while rushing all 
over London with visiting-cards. They would like me to visit all their 
acquaintances although I am more dead than alive. When I have been 
jolted up and down in a carriage for three or four hours I feel as though 
I had travelled from Paris to Boulogne. And the distances here ! 

There was a very successful Polish ball here. I did not go, although I 
had a ticket; I simply had not the strength, and beforehand I had a 
dinner at Lady Kinlogh's, where there was a great gathering of Lord 
Chancellors and God-knows-what, with order-ribbons under their 
waistcoats. I am always introduced, but I have no idea to whom, and I 
am quite lost in London. What with twenty years in Poland and seven- 
teen in Paris, it's not surprising that I am getting on slowly here, 
particularly as I don't speak the language. They don't chatter while I 
am playing and they apparently all speak well of my music, but my 
little colleagues are usually treated with such scant respect that I appear 
to be a kind of amateur, and I shall soon be regarded as a kind of noble- 
man, for I have clean shoes and I don't carry around visiting-cards 
inscribed: "Private lessons given. Evening engagements accepted." 

Old Mme Rothschild asked me how much I cost ["Combien cofttez- 
vous?"], as some lady who had heard me was making inquiries. Since 
Sutherland gave me twenty guineas, the fee fixed for me by Broad- 
wood on whose piano I play, I answered, "Twenty guineas". She, so 
obviously trying to be kind and helpful, replied that of course \ play 
very beautifully, but that she advised me to take less, as one had to 
show greater "moderayshon" this season. 

I gather from this that they are not so open-handed and money is 
tight everywhere. To please the middle class you need something 
sensational, some technical display which is out of my sphere. The upper 
classes who travel abroad are proud, but educated and fair when they 
deign to take notice of anything. But their attention is frittered away 
so much on a thousand different trifles, they are so hemmed in by 
tiresome conventions, that it's all the same to them whether the music is 
good or bad, for they are compelled to listen to it from morning till 
night. There is music at every flower-show, music at every dinner, every 
sale is accompanied by music. The street-singers, Czechs and my 
pianist-colleagues are as numerous as dogs and all mixed up together. 
I am writing all this as if you didn't know London! 

I would like to give a concert at some private residence. If I succeed 
I shall have about 150 guineas. That would be a rarity here, for the 
Opera brings in just over 1,000, but before the curtain goes up the 

320 



expenses already amount to more than 900. 1 don't know whether either 
of the Operas makes anything. Yesterday I saw Mile Lind again, in 
Lucia di Lammrmoor. Very good: she arouses the greatest enthusiasm. 

But what is Gutmann doing, poor fellow? How could he go and play 
the fool with his hands ! Tell him to have some respect for himself and 
not overstrain his hand prematurely. 

Viardot has no great success here since she is with Grisi and Alboni 
who are very popular. Her husband came to see me two days ago. He 
did not mention George [Sand] but only said he had had some news. I see 
that he too has cooled off somewhat [in his regard for George Sand]. Poor 
Solange I If her husband comes here what will she do? I am inclined to 
believe that the mother is on rather good terms with her son-in-law 
it would be just like the two of them. He will first of all say one thing 
and then another. But the mother was once on far too intimate a footing 
with him not to forgive him, now that she has seen him again and has 
begun to use her influence on his behalf especially as he is as thick as 
thieves with Thore who owns the paper she contributes to, and who, I 
suppose, told that Rousseau fellow about Augustine. What's become 
of that doll of a girl? 

My God! What sort of ambassador will Arago make? He doesn't 
know a word of German! It would have been better to send him to 
Bavaria, being a friend of Lola Montez. In fact Liszt would make a 
better diplomat. I also met Guizot at a dinner last week: it was pitiful 
to see him. Although he was decked out with his Order of the Golden 
Fleece it was obvious that he suffers morally, even if he still has hopes. 

I have made a mistake: I picked up two sheets of paper together. 
Things are quiet here. No one is much frightened of Irish or Chartist 
troubles; these things don't appear so enormous as from a distance, and 
people are more concerned with the state of affairs in Paris, Italy and 
Poland. As regards Poland, The Times publishes such fantastic nonsense 
that even the English are struck by its hostility. Chojecki [a politician] 
must be off his nut to go and get mixed up with the Czechs. Let them 
roll in their own filth, provided the imbeciles can easily have the muck 
washed off them in time. If they try to start any more trouble they will 
have a heavy account to settle with the Lord God. 

All my love. 
Your old 
Ch. 

Chopin's fast public recital was given at the house of Mrs Sartoris [Fanny 
Kemble], 99 Eaton Place, on the afternoon of 23 June 1848. He was 

321 



unwell and played in a subdued manner, although with his usual charm 
and polish. A plaque to commemorate the event was placed on the house 
in 1949. 

309. To MILE DE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

London. 48 Dover Street, Piccadilly. 30 June 1848 

How are you in the midst of all these misfortunes [three days of 
riots in Paris]? I hope our district was spared and that our friends at 
least are not victims. Do let me hear from you. Solange is living near 
the city-gate has she not suffered from being too close to the danger 
zone? I have written to Gutmann. Poor Gutmann is in the National 
Guard he might easily stop a bullet and Grzymala and Delacroix 
and Alkan and Pleyel, who owns all those houses in the rue Roche- 
chouart neighbourhood! What horrors! May God grant that order 
has now been restored for a long time to come. Is Solange definitely 
leaving Paris? I am sending her a few lines. 

I gave a matinee here (very elegant), Mrs Sartoris (Miss Kemble) lent 
me her house; and Mario sang three groups while I played four that 
was all. They found this arrangement both novel and charming. I had a 
select audience of 150 at one guinea, as I did not want to crowd the 
rooms. All the tickets were sold the day before. 

Lord Falmouth has offered me his house for a second matinee but . . . 
but. ... It is difficult to do things well here there are so many rules to 
be observed. Mario is the fashionable society vocalist par excellence 
there is no lady in quite the same position. Mile Lind (she was at 
my concert) does not even sing at the concerts held at her theatre 
[in the Haymarket]. The singers we know perform far too much 
everywhere. 

In Viardot's programmes at present (for example, yesterday at the 
Palace) there is no longer the item: "Mazurkas of Chopin" but merely 
"Mazurkas arranged by Mme Viardot" it appears that it looks better. 
It is all the same to me; but there is a pettiness behind it. She wants to 
have success and is afraid of a certain newspaper which perhaps does not 
like me. It once wrote that she had sung music "by a certain Mr Chopin" 
whom no one knows, and that she ought to sing something else. Don't 
mention it to [name illegible] for it might come back here and be taken 
as another example of my ingratitude. I am having one of my black 
days bored and weary. Tomorrow I shall dismiss my lazy grumbling 
Italian. I shall be getting another man on Sunday [his excellent kst 
valet, Daniel]. I hope things will not be too bad for you in Paris. 
What about Franchomme that worthy friend? Give him my love. 

322 



I will write to Grzymala too. Do please send me a few lines. God keep 

^ * Yours devotedly, 

Ch. 

I haven't a moment to write to my family!! If you see Grzymala 
tell him I have begun a letter to him every day and never finished it. 
I am in a horrible niood. I love him and would so much like to write 
to him. 

[The "few lines" to Solange mentioned above contain exactly the same 
facts.] 

310. JANE WELSH CARLYLE TO JANE STIRLING IN LONDON 

[London. July 1848] 

[The original English text of this letter appears to be lost] 
Dear Miss Stirling, 

Mr Frederic Chopin does not speak English and does not understand 
spoken English, How infinitely I regret it! But can he not read it? 
Hoping that he can, I send you some verses in his honour and glory 
written by Captain Anthony Sterling, John's brother, who went with 
me the other day to Mr Chopin's concert. I do not think these verses 
belong to the species of crazy prose which makes up Anthony's poetical 
effusions and they are perhaps worthy of being shown to Mr Chopin, 
with my unspoken blessing. May he at least grasp their significance. 
Perhaps you yourself who write such charming verses might translate 
the poem into French for him to understand. 

I prefer his music to all others for it is not a specimen of art offered 
to the general admiration which is the effect that most music has 
upon me. It is rather the reflection of part of his soul, and a fragment of 
his life lavished on those who have ears to hear and a heart to under- 
stand. I think that each of his compositions must have taken away from 
the number of days allotted to him. Oh, how I wish he understood 
English! How I wish I could open my heart to him! 

Chopin's second recital was given on the afternoon of 7 July 1848 at the 
house of Lord Falmouth, 2 St James 9 s Square. This house was destroyed 
during the Second World War. 

311. CHOMN TO WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

London. 8-17 July [1848] 

Forgive me for sending this old beginning of a letter, but I am 
finishing it today. 

M 323 



My dearest friend, 

God kept you safe during these last few days [of riots in Paris] which 
were in fact the real beginning (probably deliberate) of the stubborn 
hostility of both sides. So far the whole business was unreal it existed 
only in people's heads, in their imaginations and in books. It was all 
in the name of education, justice and solidarity. But now all this dirt 
will call up vengeance, as in the case of martyrs. And vengeance never 
ends. A civil war for principles, followed by the inevitable collapse of 
civilisation as we conceive it today. In a few hundred years your great- 
great-great-grandsons will arrive from a free Poland to a France 
reborn, or something else on the same site. 

Yesterday (7 July) I gave a second matinee at Lord Falmouth's 
residence. Among other things Viardot sang my Mazurkas. It went 
very well, but I don't know whether I shall make 100 guineas out of it. 
I shall only find out on Monday. The season here is now over. I don't 
know what my plans are or how they will turn out. I have not much 
saved up in my pocket and I don't know what I shall do. I may go to 
Scotland. My Scots ladies are dear and kind, but they sometimes bore 
me to distraction. I have got rid of that idiotic Italian. I am still keeping 
my rooms as I have three pianos and need a large salon. I have a better 
man-servant [Daniel]. My health is passable at times, but often in the 
morning I think I am going to cough myself to death. I am miserable 
at heart but I try to deaden my feelings. I even avoid being alone, so 
as not to be left to my own thoughts, for one can't be long ill here and 
I don't want to risk developing some fever. 1 

What is happening to Solange? Rozieres sent me a kind letter. She's 
a good sort. Tell me about the mother [George Sand]. Is Clesinger 
going to Russia? "With the cholera raging there . . . ! Idiot ! Tell me about 
them. Is the Princess [Czartoryska] safe? Has Cichowsld had good 
news? Gutmann has written to me dear fellow. It's lucky he did not 
catch a bullet. They are not afraid of any disturbances here, and if your 
papers say they are there's no truth in it. Everyone who owns the 
smallest property is signing on as a special constable. And there are 
plenty of Chartists among them who are all against the idea of violence. 

I have just this minute received a letter from Rozieres. She says she 
has seen you and that you have gone to visit Dubos who was wounded. 
Please tell him I hope he will recover. I am now going along to thank 
Mme Viardot. I confess I did not want to ask her to sing for me, but her

brother [Manuel Garcia] just happened to come in as Broadwood was 
putting Lord Falmouth's offer of his salon to me, and he at once went to 
see his sister who promised she would sing with pleasure. She sang 
among other things some of my Mazurkas. Tell Rozieres that Mme V. 
was charming it will all come back here she will pass the word 
around. I know that Mme Sand has written to Mme V. and has inquired 
most sympathetically about me! ! ! How she must be playing the part of 
the honest and upright mother over there ! 

15 July. I cannot finish this letter my nerves are all to pieces: I am 
depressed by a stupid feeling of melancholy, and with all my resignation 
I am worried and don't know what to do with myself. 

From the money I have made I may have only 200 guineas (5,000 
francs) left after deducting the cost of my lodgings and carriages. In 
Italy one could live a year on that, but not six months here. The season 
is now practically over. I did not play at the Palace, although I played 
before the Queen at the Duchess of Sutherland's. The Duchess has left 
London. So it's possible that some royal music-director put a spoke in 
my wheel for not having paid him a courtesy visit or perhaps because 
I refused to play at the Philharmonic. If the season lasted six months I 
could gradually build up my reputation here, and in my own way; but 
as things are the time is too short. There is such a confusion here in 
everything. 

I go to some party every evening. At one of Lady Combermere's 
last week I met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, an old Grand 
duchess of Weimar and a Prince of Hesse -all very amiable. I am 
already known in the right way in certain circles, but it takes time, and 
the season is already over. Some of the papers have had stuff about me 
said to be quite good. They say that sort of thing is very important 
here. But what are not so plentiful as they are supposed to be are 
guineas. They are awful liars here: as soon as they don't want anything 
they clear off to the country. One of my lady-pupils has already left 
for the country, leaving nine lessons unpaid. Others, who are down for 
two lessons a week, usually miss a week, thus pretending to have more 
lessons than they really do. It does not surprise me, for they try to do too 
much to do a little bit of everything. One lady came here from Liver- 
pool to have lessons for a single week! I gave her five lessons they 
don't play on Sundays and sent her away happy! Lady Peel, for ex- 
ample, would like me to give lessons to her daughter who is very 
talented, but since she already had a music-master who gave two 
lessons a week at half a guinea a time, she asked me to give only one 
lesson a week so that her purse should not suffer. And simply to be 

325 



able to say that she has lessons from me. She will probably leave after 
two weeks. . . . 

Monday, 17 July. My Scots ladies are kind I gave them, your letter 
but they bore me so much that I don't know which way to turn. 
They absolutely insist on my going to stay with their family in Scotland : 
that might be nice, but today I have no desire for anything. Whatever 
is NOT boring here is NOT English. 

What is happening to Solange? And her mother? And de Rozieres? 
By the way, that letter you sent me with yours was from an imbecile 
named Wiemann whom I helped to leave Paris [to join the Polish rebels] 
and who now writes for money to enable him to return to Paris. 
Idiot ! I fed him for nearly a year, but he insisted on going : he left with 
the first or second contingent and is now hard up again. What a mess 
our people are in ! May God defend and keep them ! 

All my love. 

Yours most devotedly, 
Ch. 

312. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

[London. End of July 1848] 
My dear friend, 

Thank you for all your kind words and for the letter from home 
which you forwarded to me. They are all well, thank God; but they 
are worrying needlessly about me. I can feel neither grief nor joy 
my emotions are completely exhausted I am just vegetating and 
waiting for it all to end quickly. Next week I am going to Scotland to 
stay with a certain Lord Torphichen, my Scottish ladies' brother-in- 
law. They are already up there with him, near Edinburgh. He wrote 
to invite me, as did Lady Murray, an important, well-known kdy who 
is very fond of music. I pass over a host of other verbal invitations, 
with addresses given, for I can't go dragging myself from one place 
to another I've had more than enough of such a life and I don't see 
what good would come of it. I shall stay in Scotland until 29 August. 
On the 29th I have accepted an engagement to play at Manchester where 
there is to be a grand concert. I am to play two groups of solos, for 
which I shall receive ^60. Alboni is coming but that has nothing to 
do with me all I do is sit down and play. I shall be staying for a few 
days at the place where Neukomm was with acquaintances who are 
rich local manufacturers. What I shall do after that, I don't know. I 
only wish I knew that illness will not tie me down here this 
winter! 

326 



Chopin's diary shows that he left Euston Station, London, by the p a.m. 
train on Saturday $ August 1848. 

313. To AUGUSTE FRANCHOMME IN PARIS 

Edinburgh. 6 August 

Calder House, n August [1848] 
Dearest friend, 

I do not know what to say I think it is best for me not to try to 
console you on the loss of your father. I know your grief time itself 
can do little to soften such a sorrow. 

I left London a couple of days ago. I did the journey to Edinburgh 
(407 miles) in twelve hours. Having had a day's rest in Edinburgh, I 
am now at Calder House, twelve miles from Edinburgh, the seat of 
Lord Torphichen, Mrs Erskine's brother-in-law, where I expect to stay 
until the end of the month to recover from my London exploits. 

I gave two matinees, which appear to have given pleasure but which 
were a nuisance, none the less. Without them, however, I don't know 
how I should have been able to spend three months in this dear London 
with a spacious lodging absolutely necessary, and a carriage and 
man-servant. 

My health is not really bad, but I am losing strength, and I am not yet 
used to the air here. Miss Stirling was to have written to you from 
London, and she asks me to beg your pardon. The fact is that these 
ladies had many preparations to make before they left for Scotland. 
They plan to stay here a few months. There is a pupil of yours in 
Edinburgh, a Mr [Louis] Drechsler I think. He came to see me in 
London he seemed a good fellow and is very fond of you. He plays 
[the 'cello] with a local grande dame, Lady Murray, one of my sixty- 
year-old pupils. I have promised to visit her at her fine castle but I 
don't know how I shall manage it, having promised to be at Manchester 
on 28 August to play at a concert for a fee of 60. 

Neukomm is there, and provided he does not go and give his organ- 
improvisations on the same day I reckon to earn my 60. After that I 
don't know what I shall do I should like to be paid an annuity for 
having composed nothing not even a tune in the style of [George] 
Osborne or Sowinski (excellent friends, both of them one an Irish- 
man, the other a compatriot of mine). . . . 

The park here is very fine my host excellent I am as well as I 
may be not a decent musical idea I am out of my rut I am like, 
shall I say, a donkey at a fancy-dress ball a violin E-string on a double- 
bass amazed, bewildered, as drowsy as if I were listening to Baudiot 

327 



[a rival 'cellist to Franchomme] playing (before 24 February) [beginning 
of the 1848 revolution] or the scraping of Mr Cap (after the June riots). 
I hope they will keep well I cannot write to you without mentioning 
them. 

But another serious question arises: I hope that no harm has come to 
your friends in all this terrible business. How are Mme Franchomme 
and your little children? Send me a few lines and address them: London, 
care of Mr Broadwood, 33 Great Pulteney Street, Golden Square. I 
have perfect quiet here (as regards material things), and pretty Scotch 
airs I would like to compose just a little, if only to please the good 
ladies, Mrs Erskine and Miss Stirling. 

I have a Broadwood in my room and Miss Stirling's Pleyel in the 
drawing-room; plenty of paper and pens. I hope you will compose 
something too and may God grant that I may once more hear it again 
soon. 

Some London friends advise me to spend the winter here, but I shall 
obey the voice of my inner je-ne~sais-quoi or rather I shall follow the 
advice of the first person that comes along that is often just as good as 
considering carefully. 

Adieu, dear, dear friend. 

Yours ever, 

Ch. 

My sincerest good wishes to Mme Franchomme for her children. I 
hope Rene enjoys playing his 'cello, that Cecile is working hard and 
that their little sister still reads her books. Please remember me to Mme 
Lasserve [a Creole visitor], and correct my French grammar and spelling. 

The people here are ugly, but they seem to be kind-hearted. To make 
up for it there are delightful cattle that look fierce ! perfect milk, butter, 
eggs, and what they produce: cheese and chickens. 

314. To CAMILIE PLEYEL IN PARIS 

Mid-Calder. 15 August 1848 
Dear friend, 

Before I left for Scotland, where I look forward to spending, if I can, 
a few quiet weeks, I sent you a short note from London, when forward- 
ing the .80 I received from Lady Trotter for your piano. Mr Man- 
kowski, who was kind enough to undertake to convey this sum to you, 
is a very agreeable young nobleman & friend of Kozmian who adores 
music, I hope he succeeded in meeting you. I should so much like to 
hear about you from him and to learn how you are. 

For myself, I am unable to breathe in this beautiful Scotland a bit 

328 



of a change for me ! The house I am staying at is surrounded by a 
splendid park and century-old trees. (Hampton Court, where art 
thou?) 1 It is an old manor where John Knox, the Scottish reformer, 
celebrated communion for the first time. There are walls eight feet 
thick endless corridors, full of ancestral portraits, each one blacker 
and more Scottish-looking than the next. Nothing is lacking there is 
even a certain "red cap" phantom which shows itself. After all that has 
happened on the Continent I suppose the ghost is busy changing his 
head-gear, so as not to be mistaken for one of your French evil spkits 
he has not been seen for some time. If only your red-caps could change 
their way of thinking ! I hope they do not haunt your country-place 
[Montmorency] and that the countryside is beautiful. I hope too that 
you are able to get a little rest there after your days in Paris. 

God send you good fortune. Count me always among your friends. 
I love you always, always. 

Yours most sincerely devoted, 

F. Chopin 

My present address is: 
Lord Torphichen, 
Calder House, 
Mid-Calder, Scotland 
and after the 25th of the month: 
care of Broadwood, 33 Great Pulteney Street, Golden Square. 

315. To JULIAN FONTANA IN LONDON 

[Fontana was returning to America after a brief period in Europe.] 

Calder House, Mid-Calder, Scotland. 
(12 miles from Edinburgh, if that gives you any satisfaction) 

1 8 August 1848 
My dear friend, 

If I felt better I would travel to London tomorrow in order to give 
you a last embrace. Perhaps we shall not meet face to face so soon. We 
are a couple of old cembalos 2 on which time and circumstances have 
played out their miserable trills. Yes, old cembalos^ even if you protest 
against being associated with me in such a way. That means no dis- 
paragement of your beauty or respectability: the sound-board is perfect, 
only the strings have snapped and a few pegs have jumped out. But the 
only real trouble is this: we are the creation of some famous maker, in 

1 He had been to Hampton Court with Pleyel in July 1837. 

* The Polish word he uses could also mean "simpleton", "imbecile". 

329 



his way a kind of Stradivarius, who is no longer there to mend us. In 
clumsy hands we cannot give forth new sounds and we stifle within 
ourselves those things which no one will ever draw from us, and all 
for lack of a repairer. 

I can scarcely breathe: I am just about ready to give up the ghost. 
And you, I am sure, are growing bald: you will hang over my tomb- 
stone like one of those willows at home do you remember? which 
show their bald pates. I don't know how it is, but thoughts of our late 
friend Johnny and Antoni, and Witwicki and Sobanski, keep coming 
into my head. All those with whom I was in most intimate harmony 
have died and left me. Even Ennike our best tuner has gone and 
drowned himself; and so I have not in the whole world a piano tuned 
to suit me. Moos has died, and no one can make me such comfortable 
shoes. It only needs four or five more to go to St Peter's gates, and then 
my life would be more comfortable if I too were ''gathered to my 
fathers". My good mother and sisters are still alive, thank God, but now 
the cholera is upon them! Titus too is a good fellow! As you see, you 
count among my oldest memories, as I do among yours. You are 
apparently younger than I (what does it matter which of us is two 
hours older than the other !). I assure you I would willingly accept being 
even very much younger than you if I could embrace you as you pass 
through London. It's hard to understand why the yellow fever hasn't 
carried you off and the jaundice me; for we have both been exposed to 
these yellow perils. I am writing this nonsense because nothing sensible 
comes into my head. I am vegetating and patiently waiting for the 
winter. I dream now of home, then of Rome; now of happiness, then 
of misery. No one plays now to my taste, and I have become so easy 
to please that I could cheerfully listen to an oratorio by Sowinski with- 
out dropping down dead. It reminds me of Norblin, the painter, who 
said that a certain artist in Rome saw another's picture, and the effect 
was so disagreeable that ... he died ! 

All that is left to me is a long nose and a fourth finger out of practice. 
It will be disgraceful if you don't send me a line in answer to the present 
epistle. You have chosen bad weather for your journey however, I 
pray that the God of our Fathers will guide you. I wish you all happi- 
ness. I feel you have done right to settle at New York rather than 
Havana. If you see your famous philosopher, Emerson, remember me 
to him. Give my regards to Herbault. Give yourself a kiss from me, and 
don't puU a long face. 

Your old

316. TO HIS FAMILY IN WARSAW 

Calder House. 
[Begun on 10 August, sent on 19 August 1848] 

[On pale blue sheets of paper, with steel engravings of Edinburgh 
the Scott Memorial, etc.] 

My dearest ones, 

Thank you for your welcome letter which reached me over a week 
ago in London. I spent three months in London and was in fairly good 
health. I gave two matinee-concerts, one at Mrs Sartoris's and the other 
at Lord Falmouth's both with great success and without noisy pub- 
licity. Mrs Sartoris, nie Fanny Kemble, is young, and is the daughter of 
the famous English actor. She herself is a well-known English singer, 
who was on the stage only two years before marrying Mr Sartoris, a 
wealthy man of fashion. She has been taken up by the whole of London 
society and is received everywhere, while everyone comes to her house 
[99 Eaton Place]. I already knew her in Paris. Lord Falmouth is a great 
music-lover, wealthy, a bachelor and nobleman, who offered me the 
use of his mansion in St James's Square for my concert. He was most 
amiable to see him in the street you wouldn't say he had threepence; 
and at home he has a crowd of lackeys better dressed than himself. I 
knew his niece in Paris, but I only saw her at a concert in London. 

At one of my concerts Mario sang three groups of songs for me and 
I played four groups. At the second Mme Viardot sang three groups 
and I played four. They liked that very much, for they had never 
heard of such short and compact concerts here. They are only used to 
long affairs with twenty different items and huge posters. I am sending 
you a few lines from the Athenaeum, a paper which enjoys a high repu- 
tation among artists. I haven't got the others besides, what do you 
care about the others, or whether somebody says that it went well? 
Get Barcinski to translate it for you. I limited the numbers of the 
audience to 200 at Lord Falmouth's and 150 at Mrs Sartoris's. They 
brought in about 300 guineas at a guinea a ticket, after deducting 
various expenses. London is frightfully expensive during the season 
my lodgings alone, without service, etc. (it is true I had an enormous 
lofty drawing-room which could take three pianos: one sent by 
Pleyel, a second lent by Erard and a third put in by Broadwood), 
well, as I was saying, my lodging alone, because of its large fine stair- 
case and handsome entrance, and because Dover Street is next to 
Piccadilly, cost eighty pounds. Now add my carriage and man-servant 
all horribly expensive and you will realise that if I had not had a 

M* 331 



few lessons at home each day, at a guinea a time, I don't know what I 
should have done. 

I wrote and told you that the Duchess of Sutherland had the Queen to 
dinner on one occasion, and in the evening gave a party consisting of 
only eighty members of London high society. In addition to the Prince 
of Prussia (who was about to leave) and the royal family, there were 
only such people as old Wellington, and others like him although it 
is difficult to be like him. The Duchess presented me to the Queen. 
Her Majesty was gracious and spoke with me twice. Prince Albert 
moved closer to the piano. Everyone said that these are rare favours. 
Among the Italians who sang that evening were Mario, Lablache and 
Tamburini no women. I should like to describe to you the Duchess's 
palace, but it is beyond me. All those who know say that the Queen 
of England herself has not such a residence. All the royal palaces and 
castles are ancient and splendid, but have not the taste and elegance of 
Stafford House (as the Duke of Sutherland's palace is called) which is 
situated near St James's Palace, just like the Blacha [a small Warsaw 
palace near the royal castle]. For example, the staircases are famous for 
their magnificent effect: they do not lead either from the vestibule or 
from an ante-room, but arise in the middle of the apartments as in some 
huge salon with splendid paintings, statues, galleries, carpets, all most 
beautifully laid out and with the most wonderful effects of perspective. 
And you should have seen the Queen standing on the stairs in the most 
dazzling light, covered with all her diamonds and orders and the 
noblemen, wearing the Garter, descending the stairs with the greatest 
elegance, conversing in groups, halting on the various landings from 
every point of which there is something fresh to be admired. It really 
makes one sorry that some Paolo Veronese could not have seen some- 
thing like it he would have left us one more masterpiece. 

After this soiree at the Duchess of Sutherland's I was told I would be 
playing at the Palace; but I don't know why I was not asked. It is true 
I made no effort to be asked, and there is such a host of things going on 
here that one must make a special effort to achieve anything. Not only 
did I not try, but I did not call on the Court music-director, or rather 
the person who organises the Queen's concerts and conducts the Phfl- 
harrnonic Society orchestra (the leading concerts here, which corres- 
pond to those of the Paris Conservatoire). The Philharmonic Society 
invited me to play a great favour, or rather a distinction, for everyone 
who comes here applies for it. Neither Kalkbrenner nor Halle have 
played this year, in spite of all their efforts but I declined, and that made 
a bad impression on certain musicians, particularly on the conductors. 

332 



I declined firstly because I was not very well that was the reason I 
gave but the real reason was that it did not suit me to play merely one 
of my concertos with orchestra. Besides, these gentlemen have only one 
rehearsal, and that a public one to which people are admitted with free 
tickets. How could one try over and repeat passages? We should have 
played badly (although they claim to know my concertos and Mme 
Dulcken, a famous you know what that means ! local pianist played 
one there last year). So I had my thanks conveyed to the Philharmonic 
Society and turned the offer down. One paper took it badly but it 
doesn't do any harm. After my matinees many papers gave me good 
notices with the exception of The Times, whose critic is a certain 
Davison (a creature of the late Mendelssohn) who does not know me 
and fancies I am an antagonist of Mendelssohn (so they tell me). It 
doesn't matter. But you will observe that people always have some 
motive in this world other than the desire to tell the truth. 

But to return to London society. Well, my fee for an evening engage- 
ment in London was ^20, but I had only three such engagements. 
The second was at the Marquis of Douglas's (son of the Duchess of 
Hamilton whom I used to know in Paris). The young marchioness is a 
Princess of Baden. She presented me to the Duchess of Cambridge, the 
Queen's aunt (every time I met her we had a long conversation) ; and 
to the Grand duchess of Weimar, an old lady (the dowager). . . . 

My third appearance, or rather the first in order of date, was at 
Lady Gainsborough's, a former maid of honour to the Queen, who 
also assembled at her house a select aristocratic company. As you know, 
they live on great names and grand titles here. Lady Dover, the Duchess 
of Sutherland's niece, was there too ; the Duchess of Argyll and Lady 
Stanley (her daughter was my pupil in Paris she is now a lady-in- 
waiting to the Queen). But what is the use of mentioning all these 
various names? I have met many distinguished personalities: Lady 
Ailesbury, Lady Peel, Lady Gordon, Lady Parke; and among the men 
of letters: Carlyle, old Rogers, the famous poet and respected friend 
of Byron; Dickens; Hogarth, who was Walter Scott's beloved friend, 
etc., etc. He wrote a very nice article about me in the Delinius [Daily 
News] in connection with my second recital. Among other distin- 
guished names there is the Duchess of Somerset the Duke is the senior 
English duke and on great occasions, at the coronation for example, 
his wife comes immediately after the Queen. 

Among the curiosities: Lady Byron. She and I get along very well: 
we converse like a "goose and a sucking-pig" [a Polish saying], she in 
English, I in French. I can well believe she bored Byron. Her daughter, 

333 



Lady Lovelace (considered a beauty) is also an interesting person. But 
whom did I have the pleasure of meeting here! None other than Lady 
Shelburne, the former Mile de Flahaut, my pupil [to whom he had 
dedicated the Bolero]. She is today the daughter-in-law of Lord 
Landsdowne (pronounce: Landsdaun) [sic], president of the council of 
ministers, who is himself very fond of music and every season gives a 
grand vocal concert at his own house. Lady Combermere is also one 
of those who have been charming to me. Before leaving London I 
went to one of her receptions. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, 
Wellington, and the Duke, or rather Count, de Montemolin, son of 
Don Carlos, the Spanish pretender, were there. . . . 

It is difficult to mention everybody, but I must not forget Mrs 
Grote, whom I met in Paris at Mme Marliani's. She is a highly educated 
person who has rushed to patronise Jenny Lind. It was she who intro- 
duced me to J. Lind: she once invited only the two of us, and we 
remained at the piano from nine o'clock until one in the morning. The 
Queen, who had returned to town after the hostile demonstrations 
organised by the opposition, was going to attend the Grand Opera for 
the first time, to show herself in public, and the performance selected 
for this occasion was also the first appearance of Mile Lind who had 
just arrived. So there was a tremendous rush for tickets stalls were 
selling at three guineas the day before the performance. Having just 
arrived, I knew nothing of all this, but that same day someone told me 
that if I knew Mrs Grote she would be able to help me, for she not only 
has a box but knows everybody. I called on her and she at once invited 
me to her box. I was very glad, for I had seen neither the Queen nor 
Jenny Lind, nor the handsome theatre (Keen's theatre), [i.e. Her 
Majesty's, Haymarket], But Mrs Grote's box was on the first floor, and 
I cannot breathe if I have to climb stairs; so when I got home I found 
that Lumley, the manager, had sent a ticket for one of the best stalls, 
with the compliments of Mile Lind and Mrs Grote. The performance 
was most brilliant. The Queen was more loudly applauded than Jenny 
Lind. They sang "God save the Queen", with Wellington and all the 
aristocratic society and everybody standing. It is most impressive to 
see this esteem and genuine respect for the throne and law and order. 
They were so enthusiastic that they could not settle down. 

Mile Lind came to my concert ! ! ! That seems very important to some 
silly people, for she can't show herself anywhere without their all 
turning their lorgnettes on her. But for the fact that she never sings 
anywhere except in opera, not even in high society, she would have 
sung for me, as Mrs Grote told me. But I never dreamt of asking her, 

334 



although she Is a good sort and we get on well together. One might say 
she has a "Scandinavian note" completely different from the southern 
one, as exemplified by Mme Viardot. She is not pretty, but charming 
in her own way. I don't always like her on the stage, but in Sonnambula, 
from the middle of the second act, she is completely beautiful in 
absolutely every respect, both as an actress and singer. I never saw La 
Malibran, but I doubt whether she would have interpreted that role 
more sensitively. In other parts she is not so good, but she sang me some 
Swedish songs most delightfully, just as Mme Viardot sings her 
Spanish ones. She is said to be going to marry Mrs Grote's brother, but 
I know for certain she is not. (They even say she is secretly married, but 
I know she has a fiance waiting for her in Sweden.) 

Mrs Grote is a very kind person, although a great radical and quite 
a character. She receives a crowd of interesting people dukes, lords, 
scholars in short, all the fashionable celebrities. She speaks in a deep 
voice and does not wrap up the truth in cotton-wool. Someone was 
asked his opinion of her: "How do you find Mrs Grote?" and replied: 
"I find her grotesque." All the same she is kind-hearted and has proved 
it to me: she invited me to her country-place with Mile Lind and Mrs 
Sartoris, but I could not go. Another person I have grown very fond 
of is Mrs Sartoris (Fanny Kemble). She has known me for a long time 
now, and at her parties, where she receives all London society, she has 
never asked me to play if she saw that I was not in the mood. She sings 
very nicely herself and has a first-class brain. She has two children, as 
beautiful as angels. She was once pretty herself but has now grown 
stouter, and only her head has remained like a cameo. I feel quite at 
home with her; she is perfectly natural she knows of all my little pri- 
vate faults from our common friends Dessauer and Liszt, for example. 
I have often chatted with her and it seemed as though I were talking to 
someone who knew you, although in fact she only knows the rooms 
we occupied at the Thuns' house in Tetschen [in 1835]. She too has spent 
some pleasant times there. She says they very frequently mention us. 
So much for London. 

I won't give you a list of my other acquaintances; but I found here 
among others some people I used to know and who have been very 
kind to me. For example: [Sir Henry] Bulwer, who used to be 
ambassador at Madrid; Lord Dudley Stuart; Gumming Bruce, Lady 
Elgin's father; Monckton Milnes, etc. Broadwood, who is a real 
London Pleyel, has been my best and truest friend. He is, as you know, 
a very rich and well-educated man whose father transferred to him his 
property and factory and then, retired to the country. He has splendid 

335 



connections it was he who received M. Guizot and his whole family 
in his house. (He is universally beloved.) It was through him that I met 
Lord Falmouth. This will give you some idea of his English courtesy: 
One morning he came to see me I was worn out and told him I had 
slept badly. In the evening when I came back from the Duchess of 
Somerset's what do I find but a new spring mattress and pillows on my 
bed ! After a lot of questioning, my good Daniel (the name of my present 
servant) told me that Mr Broadwood had sent them, and had asked him 
to say nothing. And now, when I left London ten days ago, I found on 
the platform for Edinburgh a gentleman who introduced himself from 
Broadwood and gave me two tickets instead of one for seats in my com- 
partment the second one for the seat opposite, so that no one might be 
in my way. Besides that he arranged for a certain Mr Wood (an 
acquaintance of Broadwood's) to be in the same carriage. He knew me 
(having seen me in 1836 at the Lipifiskis' in Frankfort !). He has music- 
shops in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Broadwood was also kind enough to 
have my Daniel (who is better behaved than many gentlemen, and 
better looking than many Englishmen) seated in the same compart- 
ment, and so I covered the 407 English miles from London to Edin- 
burgh via Bkmingham and Carlisle in twelve hours by express-train 
(that is, a train with very few stops). 

In Edinburgh they had reserved me a room at the best hotel (Douglas's 
Hotel) and I stayed there a day and a half to rest. I made a tour of this 
most handsome town and am sending you some horrible views on this 
writing-paper (I could not find any prettier ones). People who always 
have beautiful things under their very noses always admire something 
less beautiful if it is NOT under their nose familiarity breeds contempt, 
I found in Edinburgh charming friends of my friends, who let me have 
the use of their carriage to visit the town. (Everyone is making for 
Scotland just now for the opening of the shooting season.) When I 
had rested in Edinburgh and had heard, as I walked past a music-shop, , 
some blind man playing one of my Mazurkas, I got into the carriage 
which Lord Torphichen had sent for me. The carriage was driven in 
the English style, with the driver mounted on the horse, and it brought 
me the twelve miles from Edinburgh. Lord Torphichen is an old, 
seventy-year-old Scot, and brother-in-law to Mrs Erskine and Miss 
Stirling, my kind Scots ladies. I have known them a long time in Paris 
and they take such care of me. In London I was always at their house 
and I could not refuse their invitation to come here, especially as there 
is nothing for me to do in London and I need a rest; and as Lord 
Torphichen gave me a cordial invitation. The place is called Calder 

336 



House (they pronounce it: Kolderhaus). It is an old manor-house 
surrounded by a vast park with hundred-year-old trees. One sees 
nothing but lawns, trees, mountains and sky. The walls are eight feet 
thick; galleries everywhere and dark corridors with countless old 
portraits of ancestors, of all different colours and with various costumes 
some in kilts, some in armour, and ladies in farthingales everything 
to feed the imagination. The room I occupy has the most splendid view 
imaginable although this part of Scotland is not the most beautiful. 
The chief beauty-spots are towards Stirling, in the north beyond 
Glasgow. I have promised to go in a few weeks* time to visit Lady 
Murray, the first pupil I had in London. She spends most of her time in 
Edinburgh and exercises command over musical affairs. Lord Murray 
lives in a most beautiful district on the sea-coast. In fact one has to cross 
the sea to get there. I must also go later on to Kek, near Stirling, a place 
famous for its beauty, where some cousins of Miss Stirling live near 
the sites mentioned in The Lady of the Lake. 

How kind my Scots ladies are to me here ! I no sooner have time to 
wish for something than it is ready to hand they even bring me the 
Paris newspapers every day. I have quiet, peace and comfort but I 
shall have to be leaving in a week. The lord has invited me for the 
whole of next summer: I would not mind staying here all my life, but 
what would be the use? My room is well away from the others so that 
I can play and do as I please. I am completely free; for, as Barcinski 
will tell you, the chief consideration with these people is that a guest 
should not be restricted in any way. In my room I found a Broad- 
wood; in the drawing-room is a Pleyel, which Miss Stirling brought 
with her. Country-house life in England is most pleasant. People are 
arriving all the time for a few days. The houses are most elegantly 
fitted up: libraries, horses, carrkges to order, plenty of servants, etc. 
They usually come down for lunch (or, to adopt the late Dmuszewski's 
spelling: LONCZ) at two o'clock (each guest breakfasts in his room, as 
and when he pleases) and for dinner at seven. In the evening they sit 
at table for as long or as little as they choose. Some evenings I play 
Scotch songs to the old lord the good man hums the tunes to me and 
expresses his feelings in French as best he can. Although everyone in 
high society, especially the ladies, speaks French, the general conversa- 
tion is usually in English and then I regret that I can't follow it; but I 
have neither the time nor the desire to learn the language. Anyhow, I 
understand everyday conversation; I don't allow myself to be cheated 
and I should not starve to death, but that is not enough. 

I have been ten days or more in writing this letter and I simply must 

337 



finish it today I am sorry for you, as it is ages since you received 
anything from me. De Rozieres, bless her, wrote to say that she couldn't 
wait for me and was going to write to you. She has gone to stay with 
some friends in the country, to rest after all the frights and shocks they 
had in Paris. I had a letter from Solange: she too is with her husband's 
parents at Besan^on. She is well. She saw her mother several times in 
Paris the mother was advised to get away from Paris. When she 
returned to Nohant she had a bad reception from the peasants (on 
account of being mixed up with the recent deplorable events) and was 
forced to leave she is now at Tours. During these last months she has 
been wallowing in a lot of mud and has brought trouble on many 
other people. They blame her for the ranting proclamations which set 
a spark to civil war. Her second paper failed completely; it was too 
extremist. It only inflamed those who cannot see further than their own 
nose and was banned. Even before then it was dying, like the first one, 
for lack of readers. Who could have imagined it all a few years ago ! 
They have printed and are selling on the streets a biography of her, 
written and signed by Augustine's father [Brault] who accuses her of 
debauching his only (!) daughter and turning her into Maurice's 
mistress; after which she handed her over to a nobody, against the 
parents' wishes, although she had promised to marry her to her son. 
He quotes her own letters in short it is the filthiest business and the 
common talk of Paris today. It's a disgusting trick on the father's part 
but it is TRUE. So there you have the charitable deed she thought she 
was doing ! I was against her doing it in that way from the very first 
day the girl set foot in the house. She should have been left with her 
parents and not have had ideas about the son put into her head. He will 
only marry for money and even then only if they plead with him, 
for he will have enough money of his own. But he liked having a 
pretty cousin about the house and he made so much of her that the 
mother placed her on the same footing as Solange. She wore the same 
clothes and was even better looked after such being Maurice's wish. 
Whenever her father tried to take her away they would not give her 
up again because Maurice did not wish it. They made out that 
Augustine's mother was crazy, because she clearly saw the state of 
affairs and it even dawned on the father in the end. And so Mme Sand 
made a victim of the girl who was also persecuted by her own parents. 
Solange saw it all and so she became a nuisance. Maurice needed that 
fellow Lambert to screen himself from Solange and the servants [while 
having an affair with Augustine] ; Borie needed Augustine to screen 
himself from Maurice and Solange [while having an affair with George 

338 



Sand] ; and Maurice needed Borie to give the impression in La Chatre 
that he [Borie] was after Augustine. It was awkward for the mother 
to have Solange about, seeing unfortunately all that was brewing. 
And so you have lies, shamefacedness, embarrassment and the rest. 

But to return to Scotland. On the 28 August I am expected at Man- 
chester where I am to play at a concert at which Italians from London 
will sing Alboni and others. I am getting 60 for it, which is not to 
be turned down; so I have accepted and in a week's time I shall be 
travelling there, just over 200 English miles eight hours by train. In 
Manchester some kind friends are awaiting me, wealthy manufacturers 
who have Neukomm staying with them. (He was Haydn's best pupil 
and used to be court conductor to the Emperor of Brazil you must 
have heard his name.) They have also Mrs Rich, daughter of Mr 
Mackintosh, a highly esteemed man who was a Member of Parliament 
he is a speaker and writer. She is a great friend of both myself and 
the StirBngs and Erskines. After the concert I am to return to the 
Glasgow district to visit Lord Torphichen's sister-in-law [Mrs Houston, 
at Johnstone Castle], then on to Lady Murray's and back to Stirling 
[Keir House], They want me to play at Edinburgh in the first days of 
October. If it means making some money, and if I have the strength, I 
shall certainly do it, for I don't know how I am going to manage this 
winter. I have my regular apartment in Paris but I don't know how 
things will turn out there. Many people would like to keep me in 
London for the winter, in spite of the climate. I would rather do some- 
thing else, but I don't know what. I shall wait until October to see how 
things stand with my health and purse; and so another hundred guineas 
in my pocket won't come amiss. If only London were not so black and 
the people not so heavy and dull, and if only there were no sooty smell 
or fogs, I might already have learnt English. But these English are so 
different from the French, whom I have become attached to just as if 
they were my own people. They consider everything in terms of 
money; they love art only because it is a luxury. They are good kind 
souls, but so eccentric that I quite understand that if I stayed here I 
myself could become petrified or turned into a machine. If only I were 
younger I might let myself become a machine: I would give concerts 
all over the place and play the most tasteless trash (anything to make 
money!). But it's difficult for me to begin now to turn myself into a 
machine. 

The weather is lovely today, and so my head is clear of all dry and 
dusty ideas. The park is bathed in a wonderful light it is morning 
I forget all my troubles I am among you at home I feel well and I 

339 



shall only begin to think about the winter when I am simply forced to. 

And now I send you all my love.

The above letter was sent to Grzymala in Paris with an appeal to treat it 
"as though it were one of my greatest works" and to post it carefully to 
Warsaw. His separate letter to Grzymala contains the same news. 

Chopin played at one of the Gentlemen s Concerts in Manchester on 2$ 
August and was the guest of the Salis-Schwabes at Crumpsall House in the

Johnston Castel [sic] n miles from Glasgow, 
My dearest friend, f BegUn 4 Se P tember > finished 9 September 1848] 

Since I last wrote to you I have been in Manchester. I had a very 
good reception; I had to play three times [two groups and an encore]. 
A fine haU and an audience of 1,200. I lived in the suburbs as there is 
too much smoke in town: all the rich people have their houses outside 
the town. I was staying with my good friend Schwabe you may have 
seen him at Leo's. He is a leading manufacturer and owns the tallest 
chimney in Manchester it cost him .5,000. He is a friend of Cob- 
den's and a great free-trader himself. He is a Jew or rather a Protestant 
convert like Leo. His wife is particularly kind. They insisted on my 
staying longer, as Jenny Lind is arriving there this week and will also 
be staying with them. (They are great friends.) While I was there we 
also had that dear Mrs Rich whom you saw at my place with Miss 
Stirling. I also saw at Schwabe's Leo's brother, who is in Manchester 
on business. Schwabe knows the Albrecht at Le Havre, so I at once 
sent a message by him to our Albrecht in Paris, asking him to pay my 
rent and taxes for the Square d'Orleans. . . . 

I am here at Mr and Mrs Houston's. She is the sister of my Scots 
ladies. The castle is very fine and luxurious, and is kept up on a grand 
scale. I shall stay a week and then go to Lady Murray's, in a still more 
beautiful district, where I shall spend another week. I may perhaps play 
in Edinburgh, so I shall remain in Scotland until October. Please address 
your letters from now on to: 

Doctor Lishinski, 

Warriston Crescent, 

Edinburgh, Scotland. 

340 



Lyszczynski, a Pole, is a homoeopathic doctor in Edinburgh who has 
made a good marriage, has settled down quietly and is completely 
English. He will know where to forward my letters. 

This letter which I am now finishing was begun yesterday, but the 
weather has changed and it's horrible outside. I am unwell, depressed, 
and the people weary me with their excessive attentions. I can neither 
breathe nor work. I feel alone, alone, alone, although I am surrounded 
by people. [Seven lines blacked out.] But what's the use of wearying 
you with my lamentations? You are up to the neck in your own 
troubles. I ought to try to entertain you by my letter. If I were in a 
cheerful mood, I would describe one of these Scotswomen, said to be the 
thirteenth cousin of Mary Stuart (sic I her husband, whose name is 
different from his wife's, told me so in all seriousness !). They are all 
cousins here, male and female, belonging to great families with great 
names which no one on the Continent has ever heard of. The whole 
conversation is conducted on genealogical lines: it's just like the 
Gospel such a one begat so-and-so, and he begat another, who begat 
still another and so on for two pages, up to Jesus Christ. 

[Some days later] The people here are arranging a concert for me 
at Glasgow. I don't know whether anything will come of it. They are 
very good and kind and I receive every possible attention. There is a 
varied crowd of old ladies and seventy to eighty-year-old lords, but no 
young people they are away shooting. I can't go out as it has been 
raining and stormy for the last few days. I don't know what will come 
of my trip to Strachur (to Lady Murray's). One has to sail across Loch 
Long (one of the prettiest lochs here) and go along the west coast of 
Scotland but it only takes four hours from here. 

Today is the pth. I am sending my old letter, begun on the 4th. 
Forgive me for writing all this rubbish; you know what a torture it 
sometimes is for me to write the pen burns my fingers, my hair falls 
over my eyes, and I can't write what I would like to and so I scribble 
a lot of useless nonsense. I haven't written to Solange or to de Rozieres. 
I shall do so when I feel my nerves less on edge. 

All my love. Yours till death, 
Ch. 

Write, and may God be with you ! Give my regards to Mme Etienne 
[his concierge] and say I shan't forget her. 

I forgot to tell you that since I last wrote I have had a strange accident 
which fortunately did no real harm, but which might have cost me my 
life. 

We were driving to see some neighbours on the coast. The carriage 

341 



I was in was a coupe, with a very handsome pair of young thorough- 
bred English horses. One horse began to rear; he caught his foot and 
then started to bolt, taking the other horse with him. As they were 
tearing down a slope in the park, the reins snapped and the coachman 
was thrown from his seat (he received a very nasty bruising). The car- 
riage was smashed to bits as it was flung against tree after tree : we should 
have gone over a precipice if the vehicle had not been stopped at length 
by a tree. One of the horses tore itself free and bolted madly, but the 
other fell with the carriage on top of it. The windows were smashed 
by branches. Luckily I was unhurt, apart from having my legs bruised 
from the jolting I had received. My man-servant had jumped out 
smartly, and only the carriage was demolished and the horses wounded. 
People who saw it all from a distance cried out that two men were 
killed, when they saw one thrown out and the other lying on the 
ground. Before the horse could move I was able to crawl out of the 
carriage unhurt, but none of those who saw what had happened, or we 
ourselves, could understand how we had escaped being smashed to 
pieces. It reminded me of the ambassador in Berlin (Emmanuel) and 
his accident in the Pyrenees he was knocked about like that. 

I confess that I was calm as I saw my last hour approaching, but the 
thought of broken legs and hands appals me. To be a cripple would 
put the finishing touch to me. 

The concert at Glasgow took place at the Merchant Hall on Wednesday 
27 September 1848. Chopin cleared 90 by it. 

318. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Keir. Perthshire. 

i October [1848] Sunday. No post, no trains, 
no carriages (even to take the air), not a boat, 
not even a dog to whistle to. 
My dearest friend, 

Just as I was beginning to write to you on a different sheet of paper 
they brought me your letter, containing one from my sister. At any 
rate the cholera has spared them so far but why don't you tell me what 
is happening to you? you write more easily than I do. Since my 
return, a week ago, from the north of Scotland (Strachur on Loch 
Fyne) I have written to you every day. I know you have someone ill 
at Versailles, for de Rozieres wrote that you had called to see her and 
were hurrying to Versailles to a sick friend. Was it the grandfather? 

342 



I should hate to think it might be the grandchild or one of your kind 
Rohan neighbours. In any case I would rather it were someone not 
too closely connected. So far there has been no question of cholera 
here, but it has already started in London. 

At the same time as your letter to Johnstone Castel [sic] the one in 
which you said you had been to the Gymnase Theatre with Solange 
I received another from Edinburgh, announcing that Prince and Prin- 
cess Alexander [Czartoryski] had arrived and would be glad to see me. 
Although tired, I jumped into the train and caught them still in Edin- 
burgh. Princess MarceUina is kindness itself, just as she was last year. 
I revived somewhat under the influence of their Polish spirit, and it 
gave me strength to play at Glasgow where a few score of the nobility 
drove in to hear me. The weather was fine and the Prince and Princess 
also came by train from Edinburgh, bringing little Marcel who is 
growing into a fine boy. (He can sing my compositions, and if anyone 
doesn't play them quite correctly he sings to show them how.) It was 
on Wednesday afternoon at three o'clock; and the Prince and Princess 
were kind enough to accept an invitation to dinner at Johnstone Castel 
(12 English miles from Glasgow). So we spent the whole day together. 
Lord and Lady Murray and old Lord Torphichen they came a hun- 
dred miles for the occasion drove over with them, and the next day 
they could not find praise enough for Princess MarceUina. The 
Czartoryskis returned to Glasgow and were to go back from there to 
London, after having had a look at Loch Lomond. Then they are 
returning to the Continent. 

The Princess spoke very kindly of you with great feeling and she 
fully understands what a noble soul like yours can suffer. You can't 
imagine how that day brought new life to me. But I am already de- 
pressed again this fog ! Although, from the window I am writing at, 
I have under my very nose a most lovely view of Stirling Castle (that 
castle near the town of Stirling the one in Robert Bruce, at night, on 
the top of the cliff you remember?), and of the mountains and lakes 
and splendid parks in short, one of the finest views in Scotland 
well, of all this I can see nothing, except when the fog is now and then 
so obliging as to give way to the sun for a few minutes a sun which 
shows very little fight here. The owner of the house is called Stirling. 
He is the uncle, on the father's side, of our Scots ladies, and is the head 
of the family. I made his acquaintance in London. He is a rich bachelor 
and has here numerous fine pictures many Murillos and paintings of 
the Spanish school. He has lately published an expensive volume (you 
know how well they do that sort of thing here) on the Spanish School. 

343 



He has travelled widely and has been in the East: he is an intelligent 
man. Whenever members of English society are visiting Scotknd they 
come to see him. He keeps open house and there are usually about 
thirty people to lunch. 

Various celebrated beauties are also here just now (Mrs Norton left a 
few days ago), and dukes and lords. They were more numerous than 
usual this year as the Queen was in Scotknd and passed this way un- 
expectedly yesterday by train. She has to be in London by a certain 
date, but the fog was so bad that she did not sail back, as she had come; 
and while the sailors and the usual processions were awaiting her she 
took the night-train at Aberdeen in the most prosaic manner. They say 
Prince Albert must have been very glad: he is always seasick, whereas 
the Queen, like a true Ruler of the Sea, is not afraid of it (I mean the 
sea ) i s h a ]l S oon be forgetting Polish. I shall talk French like an English- 
man, and I shall learn to talk English like a Scotsman, resembling old 
Jaworek who used to talk five languages at the same time. 

If I am not pouring out my lamentations it is not because I think you 
won't commiserate with me; for you are the only one who knows all 
about me. I know that if once I begin there will be no end of them, and 
it would be the same old story. I am wrong to say the same, for as far 
as the future is concerned things are worse. I feel weaker I cannot 
compose anything; not because I have no desire to, but because of 
material obstacles, since I have to hop along another branch every week. 
But what else can I do? Besides, it allows me to save up something for 
the winter. I have a host of invitations, and I can't even go to the houses 
I should prefer the Duchess of Argyll's, for example, or Lady Bel- 
haven's, as the season is too advanced for my health. Nowadays, for 
instance, I am not fit for anything during the whole morning, until 
two o'clock [lunch] and after that, when I have dressed, everything 
irritates me and I go on gasping until dinner-time. Dinner over, I have 
to remain at table with the menfolk, watching them talk and listening to 
them drinking. Bored to death (thinking of quite different things from 
them, in spite of all their politeness and explanatory remarks in French 
around the table), I must call up all my strength of mind, for they are 
by that time curious to hear me. Afterwards my good Daniel carries me 
off upstairs to my bedroom (as you know, bedrooms are usually 
upstairs in English houses), helps me to undress, puts me to bed, leaves 
a candle, and then I am free to gasp and dream until morning, when it 
starts all over again. As soon as I have got somewhat used to being in 
one place I have to go off somewhere else; for my Scots ladies give me 
no peace. They either turn up to fetch me or cart me around to their 

344 



families; but note that I always insist on a pressing personal invitation. 
They will suffocate me out of kindness and I, out of politeness, will not 
refuse to let them do it. 

Your 

Fryderyk 

319. To MILE DE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

Keir, Perthshire. 2 October 1848 

I am very grateful to you for your kind letters and really vexed that 
I cannot give you as much pleasure with mine. You know how in- 
capable I am of writing two consecutive words without real pain; and 
so I count on your remembering all that, and I imagine that I am 
forgiven. ... I am grieved to hear what you say about Solange and 
about Luce [her maid]. If ever Solange goes to Russia, whom will she 
be able to talk to about France? Whom will she be able to exchange a 
word with in her Berry dialect? Such things don't seem very important, 
but I can tell you that in a foreign country it is the greatest consolation 
to have someone who carries you back to your native land every time 
you look at him, or speak or listen to him. What about your own 
holiday-travels? Why should you miss them? unless you have already 
stored up enough energy to see you through the winter a winter 
which I don't know where to spend. I would like to act for the best and 
I am sure I shall act for the worst. But such is my fate. No one can 
escape his destiny. I am choking worse than I was a month ago in this 
beautiful homeland of Walter Scott. The Queen left Aberdeenshire 
only yesterday all England came to Scotland this year, as much to 
be in attendance on Her Majesty as for the reason that there is no peace- 
ful spot on the Continent. The place I am now living at is called Keir, 
in Perthshire, near Stirling. Tomorrow I go to Edinburgh for a few 
days; I may even play there. Don't imagine, however, that, apart from 
the fact that it is an engagement, it causes me anything but impatience 
and depression. But I find here many people who seem to like music 
and plague me to play. Out of politeness I do so, but every time with 
fresh regrets, swearing I will not be caught again. If the weather were 
fine I should spend October here too, for I have invitations which I 
have not been able to reply to, and country-house life in high society 
is really very interesting. They have nothing like it on the Continent. 

If it is fine I shall go to the Duchess of Argyll's at Inveraray on Loch 
Fyne, and to Lady Belhaven's [at Wishaw], one of the krgest places in 
the country. She is here at this moment, and there are about thirty other 
people some very beautiful, some very witty, some very eccentric, 

345 



some very deaf, and even a famous name (Sir Walpole) who is blind. 
There are fine dresses, diamonds, pimply noses, lovely heads of hair, 
marvellous figures, the beauty of the devil himself and the devil minus 
the beauty ! This last category is the commonest to be found wherever 
one goes. They are all going to Edinburgh today for the Caledonian 
Rout. All this week there will be race-meetings, entertainments, balls, 
etc. The local fashionable set, the Hunt Committee, arrange these 
fetes every year. All the local aristocracy puts in an appearance. I hope 
this gossip satisfies you, but I don't know when I shall be able to write 
any more. I must now write to my family and to Solange. I have made 
fifty attempts to write to her. I scratch out as many letters as I set down, 
so one cannot say I am lazy. Oh, here's a ray of sunshine which en- 
courages me to say; "I hope to see you soon." It has only to hide itself 
for me to believe the opposite. Come on, give me a warm handshake 
and write to me at the usual address in Edinburgh: your letter will 
reach me wherever I am. How is Franchomme? I have not answered 
his letter, but I simply can't write as much as I would like to my friends. 
It's all very stupid, but I must stop, otherwise I might end by tearing up 
my letter if my crossings-out continue. 
My greetings and most friendly good wishes. 

Always yours devotedly,

I am only finishing today, 3 October, and in Edinburgh, the letter I 
began at Keir [i.e. No. 318], Today the weather is fine, even warm, and 
I feel better. I am to play here tomorrow evening, but I have not seen 
the hall or settled on the programme. Jenny Lind and Mrs Grote (I 
met the latter at the station) have been here and have gone off to give a 
performance in Glasgow. Grisi, Mario and Alboni and all the others 
have been here. After Glasgow Jenny Lind will be going to Dublin. 
They did not have quite the same success this year as last: the novelty 
had worn off. Roger was the tenor in Sonnambula, but between our-

After his Edinburgh concert on 4 October at the Hopetoun Rooms (now 
the hall of the Mary Erskine School, Queen Street] Chopin returned for a few 
days to Calder House. He had decided to accept the invitation to Wishaw and 
wrote to Lady Belhaven on 1 6 October: * 'Madam, if I may still take advantage 
of your invitation, on which day may I have the honour of presenting my 
respects at Wishaw? I am leaving Calder House today for Edinburgh. . . . I 
shall stay three days at Warriston Crescent" At the same time he wrote to 
Adolf Gutmann in Heidelberg, but his letter contains nothing that has not 
already appeared elsewhere, apart from a few sentences referring to his Edin- 
burgh concert: "I played in Edinburgh. All the local gentry had gathered to hear 
me. They say it went well a little success and a little money." And he again 
speaks of the "red cap" ghost: "It haunts the corridors at midnight with its red 
cap I haunt them with my doubts and hesitations" After Wishaw he went to 
Hamilton Palace to stay with the Duke and Duchess of Hamilton* The follow- 
ing fragment of a letter was sent to Grzymala with his letter of 30 October:

[Fragment] By "art" they mean here painting, sculpture and archi- 
tecture. Music is not an art, and is not called by that name; and if you 
say "artist" these English think you mean a painter, sculptor or 
architect. But music is & profession, not an art, and no one ever calls any 
musician an artist or uses the word in such a sense in print. In their 
language and customs music is something different from an art it is 
a profession. Ask any Englishman you like and he will tell you the 
same; and Neukomm has assured me of it. Of course musicians have 
only themselves to blame, but just you try to alter such things! They 
play the most fantastic pieces, supposing them to be beautiful, but it's 
absurd to try to teach them decent things. Lady . . . , one of the most 
important ladies here, at whose castle I spent a few days, is said to be 
both a grande dame and a musician. Well, after I had played and other 
Scottish ladies had sung various songs, they brought out a sort of 
accordion [a concertina!] and she, with the utmost gravity, began to 
play the most dreadful tunes on it. But what can you expect? It seems to 
me that every one of these creatures has a screw loose. 

Another kdy, showing me her album, said: "I stood beside the Queen 
while she looked at it." A third declares that she is "the thirteenth 
cousin of Mary Stuart". Another one, always to be original of course, 
accompanies herself standing at the piano while she sings a French 
romance with an English accent : "J'aie aiimaiie* ' which she pronounces : 
J'ay ay-may ! ! ! 

347 



The Princess of Parma told me that one of them whistled for her, with 
guitar accompaniment! The ones who know my compositions ask 
[in French]: "Play me your Second Sigh [Nocturne in G major] . . . I 
love your bells." And every comment ends with the words: "Leik 
water**, meaning that the music flows like water. I have never yet played 
to an Englishwoman without her saying: "Leik WATER!!'* They all 
look at their hands and play wrong notes most soulfully. What a queer 
lot! God preserve them!

That's a lord in a collar and gaiters he stutters.

This is a duke in red-leather boots and spurs. He is wearing buckskin 
trousers with a sort of dressing-gown over the lot.

Edinburgh. 30 October [1848] 
My dearest friend, 

Have you forgotten what I am like, that you go and deduce from my 
letters, in which I have told you that I am every day weaker, more 
bored, without a shadow of hope, without a home of my own, that I 
am going to be married? On the day I received your good kind letter 
I wrote a sort of list of instructions for the disposal of my stuff in case 
I should happen to expire somewhere. 

I have been wandering about all over Scotland but it's already too 
cold for that, and tomorrow I am returning to London, for Lord 
Dudley Stuart has written to ask me to play on the i6th [November] 
at a benefit-concert for the Poles, to be given before the ball begins. 
Coming back from Hamilton Palace (60 miles from here), where I 
spent a few days with the Duke and Duchess of Hamilton, I caught cold 
and I haven't been out for five days. I am staying with Dr Lyszczynski 
who is giving me homoeopathic treatment, I decline all invitations to 
stay with people, for the cholera is on our doorstep. Besides, if I 
collapse anywhere it will be for the whole winter, the way I am now. I 
have promised that if the weather improves I shall return to Hamilton 
Palace and go from there to the Isle of Arran (the whole of which 
belongs to them) to stay with the Baden princess who has married 
their son, the Marquis of Douglas. But I already know that nothing 
will come of all this. During my stay at Hamilton they had not only 
many local aristocrats and members of the family but also the Prince 
and Princess of Parma and the Prince of Lucca. The Princess is the 
sister of the Due de Bordeaux: she and her husband are a very gay 

348 



young couple, and they have invited me to their house at Kingston on 
my return to London. Since they have been forced to leave Italy they 
will now be living in England. 

All these things are very fine but they are now beyond me, and if I 
hastened to get away from Hamilton it was once again because I could 
not remain at table from 8 till 10.30 without suffering pains, as I did at 
Gutmann's do you remember? Although I breakfasted in the morn- 
ing in my own room and came down late, and was carried up and down 
the stairs, I was ill at ease with it all. Before I received your letter, I 
wrote to you while I was at Wishaw, at Lady Belhaven's, but my letter 
was so despairing, so awful, that it was just as well I did not send it. 

After 16 November, if the situation in Paris improves somewhat, or 
if the London fogs drive me away, I shall return to Paris, provided it 
is not too late in the season for me to travel. 

My good Scots ladies, whom I have not seen for a week or two, will 
be coming here today. They would like me to stay longer and go trot- 
ting from one Scottish palace to another, here, there and everywhere 
that I am invited. They are kind-hearted but so tiresome ! ! may God 
be with them ! I get letters from them every day but I never answer a 
single one; and as soon as I go anywhere they come running after me 
if they possibly can. Perhaps that is what has given somebody the idea 
that I ani going to be married. But there must be some sort of physical 
attraction; and the unmarried one is far too much like me. How can one 
kiss oneself? . . . Friendship is friendship, I have said so distinctly, but 
it gives no claim to anything else. 

Supposing that I could fall in love with someone who loved me in 
return, and as I would wish to be loved, even then I would not marry, 
for we should have nothing to eat and nowhere to live. But a rich 
woman looks for a rich husband and if she does choose a poor man 
he must not be a feeble creature, but young and vigorous. A man on 
his own can struggle along, but when there are two, poverty is the 
greatest misfortune. I may give up the ghost in an institution, but I 
won't leave a wife to starve. 

Anyhow it's a waste of time to write all this you know how I feel. 
[Sentences blacked out.] And so I am not thinking at all of a wife, but 
of those at home, my mother and sisters. God fill their hearts always 
with happy thoughts ! But in the meantime what has become of my 
art? and where have I squandered my heart? [Crossings-out.] I can 
scarcely remember what songs they sing at home. This world seems to 
slip from me, I forget things, I have no strength. I no sooner recover 
a little than I sink back lower still. 

349 



I am not complaining to you; but you wanted an explanation, so I am 
merely making it clear that I am nearer to a coffin than a bridal bed. 
I am fairly calm in my mind. [Words blacked out, the only legible 
phrase being: "I am resigned/'] 

Send me a few lines. Address to Szulczewski Esq., 

10 Duke Street, St James's. 

Stuart [Lord Dudley Stuart] has his Polish Literary Society there. I 
wrote a fourth letter but I am not sending it only one page of another 
letter [No. 321] which I wrote in a moment of impatience. I send it to 
show you how black my mood sometimes is. 

Yours till death, 
Ch. 

He returned to London on 31 October and, as his diary shows, moved on 
5 November to 4 St James's Place. 

323. To WOJOECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

London. 17 and 18 [November 1848] 
My dear friend, 

I have been ill for eighteen days, since the day I reached London. I 
have not been out at all, having had such a cold, with headaches, 
suffocation and all my bad symptoms. The doctor comes every day. 
(Dr Mallan, a homoeopath, known to my Scots ladies he has a repu- 
tation here: his wife is Lady Gainsborough's niece.) He pulled me into 
shape so that I could play yesterday at the Polish concert and ball [at 
the Guildhall] it was most brilliant. But as soon as I had played I 
came home, and could not sleep all night. I have an awful headache in 
addition to my cough and choking-spasms. The really thick fogs have 
not yet begun, but in the mornings I already have to have the windows 
opened to get a breath of fresh air. I am at 4 St James's Place where I 
have been ill for two and a half weeks. I regularly see Szulczewski, 
good fellow, Broadwood and Mrs Erskine (who is here with Miss 
Stirling). They followed me here, just as I told you they would in my 
letter from Edinburgh [No. 322]. But I see most of all Prince Alexander 
[Czartoryski] and his wife. Princess Marcellina is so kind that she visits 
me practically every day, just as if I were in hospital. 

Continue to address your letters "care of" Szulczewski. I cannot 
return to Paris just now, but I am thinking about how and when to get 
back. I cannot remain here in these lodgings although they are in a fine 
situation and are not dear 4% guineas a week, with fires, linen, etc. 
They would be suitable for any other healthy bachelor, say a Member 

350 



of Parliament. I am quite close to Lord Stuart. The kind fellow has just 
gone, after coming to see how I was after playing yesterday. Well, I 
shall probably move to other lodgings near here, with larger rooms 
which will give me a better chance to breathe. In any case, please 
inquire whether there is anything suitable on the boulevards, starting 
from the rue de la Paix or the rue Royale something on a first floor, 
facing south, near the Madeleine or the rue des Mathurins. But not 
the rue Godot or any gloomy narrow alley. And there should be a little 
room for my servant. There might be something at the Square 
[d* Orleans], at No. 9, which our good Mme Etienne looks after for 
instance, Franck's apartment was to let, upstairs above mine. I cannot 
stay in my present one this winter I know from experience what it is 
like. But perhaps I might stay if there were at least a room available 
for my servant on the same staircase. I should still continue to employ 
Mme Etienne. However I should not like to dismiss my present man 
[Daniel] who, in case I wanted or was able to return to England, is 
already familiar with my needs. 

I don't know why I am troubling you with all this I have really no 
heart for anything. But I suppose I must think of myself, so do please 
help me in this matter and write and tell me what you think. I have 
never cursed anyone, but everything is so unbearable that I should feel 
easier if I could curse Lucrezia [George Sand]. But they too must be 
suffering down there [at Nohant], suffering all the more since they are 
growing old in their fury. I shall never cease to be sorry for Solange. 
What a state the world is in ! Arago wears the Order of the Eagle and 
represents France ! ! ! They take no notice of Louis Blanc here. As for 
Caussidiere, some members of the National Guard [on a visit to 
England] threw him out of the Hotel de la Sablonniere [see p. 148] 
when he came into the restaurant. They shouted: "You are no French- 
man!" and they used their fists to make him leave. The hotel pro- 
prietor had himself to escort him across the Square to prevent him 
from being assaulted, for the London loafers were already beginning 
to put up their fists. 

Please thank Mile de Rozieres, but I can't write I am ill and I haven't 
had the energy to look for the note my sister sent her some time ago. 
I wonder whether I could have some kind of a room upstairs for my 
man? Write and tell me, for we shall perhaps have to have the fires 
lighted at once. But what's the use of my returning ! Why doesn't 
God finish me off straightaway, instead of killing me by inches with this 
fever of indecision? Besides, my Scots ladies are getting on my nerves 
again. Mrs Erskine, who is a very devout Protestant, bless her, would 

35i 



perhaps like to make a Protestant out of me. She brings me her Bible, 
speaks of my soul and marks psalms for me to read. She is devout and 
kind, but she is very much concerned about my soul she's always 
going on about the next world being better than this one I know it all 
by heart, and I answer by quoting from Holy Scripture. I explain that 
I know and understand it all. 

All my love. Write, and forgive me for being so harsh and impatient; 
but I am really ill. 

Yours till death, 
Ch. 

If I had my health, with two lessons a day I would have enough to 
live decently here but I am ill. In three or four months at most I shall 
eat up all I have. If you find a place for me, don't take it before writing 
to me, and don't give notice to quit my present apartment. 

324. To MILE DE ROZIERES IN PARIS 

London. Monday 19 [really 20] November [1848] 
I may be well enough to be able to travel this week and to reach Paris 
on Thursday, Friday or Saturday by the express-service. The English 
climate at this time of the year is definitely impossible for me even in 
the opinion of my doctor, who is not the equal of your MX Curie. I have 
remained in my bedroom, in my dressing-gown, since i November, 
and have been out once only, on the idth, to play for our Polish com- 
patriots. Please be so kind as to keep an eye on No. 9 in case I should 
turn up one of these days. I thank you in advance. 

Ch. 

I have written to Grzymala, but as he may be away and not receive 
my letter for some time, please ask Mme Etienne to buy a good supply 
of wood and to light ample fires in my rooms *, also to dust the furniture 
and curtains thoroughly, especially those around my bed, for I have 
an idea I shall be opening and drawing them for a long time. Make sure 
too that the corners of the little cupboards in my bedroom are 
thoroughly swept out. I can't wait for the time when I shall be able to 
breathe more easily, understand what people are saying and see a few 
friendly faces. 

325. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

London. Tuesday [21 November 1848] 
My dear friend, 

Today I am staying in bed nearly all day, but on Thursday I shall be 
leaving this beastly London at about this time. [He forgets to say what 

352 



time.] I shall spend the night from Thursday to Friday at Boulogne, and 
on Friday I shall reach the Place d'Orleans in daylight reach it to go 
straight to bed. Besides my usual troubles I have neuralgia and my face 
is all swollen. 1 Please get them to air the bedclothes and pillows. See 
that they buy plenty of fir-cones Mme Etienne must not try to econo- 
mise so that I can get warmed right through as soon as I arrive. I 
have written to Rozieres. Have the carpets laid and the curtains hung. 
I will pay Perricher, the furnisher, at once. You might even tell Pleyel 
to send me any kind of piano on Thursday evening see that he is paid 
for the transport. On Friday, get them to buy a bunch of violets to 
scent my drawing-room let me find a little poetry when I come home, 
just for a moment as I go through on my way to the bedroom where I 
know I am going to He a long, long time. 

WeH then, by midday on Friday I shall be in Paris. One more 
day here and I shall not die but GO MAD my Scots ladies are so 
tiresome ! May the hand of God protect them I They have got their 
grip on me and I cannot tear them off. Princess Marcellina is 
the only one who keeps me alive she and her family and good 
Szulczewski. 

If only there were a little room for my man in one of the other 
blocks [in the Square] for the time being but if not, it doesn't matter. 
All my love. 

Get them to light the fires, warm my rooms and dust them I may 
yet recover. 

Yours till death, 
Ch. 

326. TO SOLANGE ClJsiNGER AT GuiLLERY 

London. Wednesday 22 [November 1848] 

You accuse me very unfairly: not a day has passed when I have not 
tried to write to you. Even before I received this letter of yours which 
has just arrived, I had thought of inquiring whether your husband might 
not find work here; and I have just obtained information from people 
who know London and its art affairs. This is the position: fashionable 
society (apart from public servants, magistrates and lawyers) is hardly 
to be seen in town in winter. The people who can help your husband 
only return in March or April, so nothing can be done before the 
beginning of next season. Although it is risky, it is not impossible that 
something might be done if he has certain influential recommendations. 

1 This miserable condition can be observed in the daguerreotype made in 1840. 

353 



If he stayed here a month which need not be expensive your husband 
would see how the land lies. I know a few influential persons who have 
promised sincerely to give what help they can; but at this moment they 
could do nothing. As for what is happening to you in Paris, it may be 
that your mother is doing her best for you, but has no money. She may 
hand back to you the small things she seems to have bought in antici- 
pation of that lawsuit [to prevent their being seized], and that once the 
house has been sold she will settle your affairs on a fresh footing. After 
all she is your mother she may forget herself, but she cannot forget 
you. 

Tomorrow I return to Paris scarcely able to crawl, and weaker than 
you have ever seen me. The London doctors urge me to go. My face 
is swollen with neuralgia; I can neither breathe nor sleep, and I have 
riot left my bedroom since I November (except on the i6th, when I 
played for an hour at a benefit concert for the Poles). Since then I have 
had a relapse. I simply cannot breathe here: the climate is inconceivable 
for people in rny state, but only during these few winter months. 
We light the candles at two o'clock. I have promised to come back 
here next season ! ! Sir James Clark, the Queen's physician, has just 
been to see me and give me his blessing. And so I am going back to lie 
whimpering at the Place d'Orleans while hoping for better times. I 
would seriously advise you to be thankful that you have the healthy air 
of Guillery for your lungs, and your husband at your side. As for the 
rest, well, better times are sure to come. With regard to Russia, the 
very influential people who have given me letters of introduction for 
your husband to take to St Petersburg tell me that it is very difficult 
for a Frenchman to get into the country just now without special 
protection. So don't accuse Mme Obreskoff just yet. If he can find work 
in England he will make more money there and in pleasanter con- 
ditions. Having sound lungs he wiU not have to battle with the climate, 
and if he settles in London he can spend the winter preparing his 
sculptures for the following season. A little patience is all that is needed. 
The permit for St Petersburg may arrive. At the moment London is 
dead for the arts it is the off-season. All who are free to do so live 
outside, and those who are left are not very much interested in helping 
a man of talent to succeed. Fine though it is, your husband's statue will 
have to be very highly praised for people to consider it beautiful the 
first time they look at it. Afterwards they will say, "It's by Clesinger !" 
and everyone will admire it. Above all the great dukes and peers must 
say so but at the moment they are all at their country-houses outside 
London. 

354 



Forgive this confused letter, but I am in great pain today. Never 
think ill of my old friendship it will stand any test. 

CL 

Accompanied by a Polish friend, Leonard Niedzwiedzki, Chopin left 
London on 23 November. Broadwood had made the same arrangements as for 
his journey to Scotland: the seat opposite Chopin was reserved, so that he 
could put his feet up. Niedzwiedzki describes in his diary how Chopin had a 
kind of nervous seizure just as the train moved out. His friend feared he was 
going to die, but he came round, and they had a meal at an inn when they 
reached Folkestone. They spent the night at Boulogne and reached Paris about 
noon on Friday 24 November. 

327. To SOLANGE CLESINGEB. AT GUILLERY 

Paris. Tuesday 30 January 1849 

I have been too ill these last few days to write and tell you that I have 
seen your husband. He came on Friday, and I found Kim well and pre- 
paring to begin on a statue of "Vanity". He sent me a note yesterday to 
say he was working on it. He told me your good news [that she was 
going to have a second child], and said you are brave and as well as 
possible in your new interesting condition. 

We are having real March weather here, and I have to lie down ten 
times a day. Molin had the art of pulling me together. Since he died I 
have had Mr Louis, Dr Roth for two months and now Mr Simon, 
who has a great reputation as a homoeopathic doctor. But they try 
their different methods without bringing me relief. They all agree about 
climate- quiet rest. Rest ! I shall have that one day without their help. 
The rest of Paris has not been disturbed for a moment recently, although 
some disorder was expected on account of the controls placed on the 
Mobile Guards or the Ministry's plan for closing political clubs. 
Soldiers and guns were to be seen everywhere yesterday, Monday, and 
this firm attitude has made an impression on the political trouble- 
makers. Now even I am writing about politics, instead of sending you 
amusing news. But I am becoming stupider than ever, for which I 
blame the cocoa I drink every morning instead of my coffee. Never 
drink cocoa and stop your friends from doing so, especially if you 
correspond with them. I shall try to arrange for my next letter to be 
written after some "sulphate of wit*' which Mr Simon may give me to 
sniff. Until then you must read this scrawl, which gives you news of 
your husband's health and courage. Mme Obreskoff came to see me 
yesterday; but I had Baron Stockhausen, Legouve and others and I 

N 355 



didn't want to discuss St Petersburg in front of them. You know how 
simple Mme Obreskoff is and how she talks. If you send me a few lines 
to say how you are keeping you won't be wasting your time. 

Happiness ! Health ! and again Health ! 
Ch. 

328. PAULINE VIARDOT TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. 15 February [1849] 

. . . You ask me for news of Chopin: here is what I can tell you. His 
health is slowly declining, with passable days on which he can go out for 
a drive, and others when he spits blood and has attacks of coughing 
which choke him. He no longer goes out in the evening. However, he 
can still give a few lessons, and on his good days he can be quite merry. 
There you have the strict truth. In any case it's a long time since I saw 
him. He came three times to see me but I was out. He always speaks of 
you with the greatest respect, and I still maintain that he never does 
otherwise. 

Chopin 3 diary for 1849 shows that his lessons were few in number and 
could not possibly cover his living expenses. On $ March (as he noted later] 
Jane Stirling and her sister decided to make him an anonymous gift of 25,000 
francs. Mrs Erskine sent the banknotes in a parcel, which was handed to Mme 
Etienne, the concierge; but Chopin heard nothing of the money until July. 
His letters give detaib of this strange affair. In the meantime, on 21 May, he 
received 1,000 francs from the Rothschilds and also loans from his friends 
Franchomme and Herbault. 

329. CHOPIN TO SOIANGE GUSINGER AT GUILLERY 

Paris. Thursday 5 April [1849] 

I have seen Mme QbreskofF: she has no news for you [of the permit 
for St Petersburg]. I think that the political horizon is steadily darkening 
in that part of the world, and what was difficult a month ago will be 
still more difficult now. I heard from Mile de Rozieres that you are 
well may God keep you in this good health. I am at the end of my 
tether I am now trying my fourth doctor: they charge ten francs a 
visit they sometimes come twice a day, but with all that they give me 
very little relief. 

Saturday. 

Well, your husband came to see me before I had time to finish my 
letter. He seems to be very well, and he gave me great joy by bringing 

356 



me good news of your health. One can't have everything in this world, 
so be satisfied with the greatest of all blessings health. Your husband 
is considering going to London and I think he is right. There is every 
possibility that he will have great success there. I shall not fail to give 
all the help I can with regard to information about England, letters, 
etc. You can rely on me. 

330. To SOLANGE CLESINGER AT GUILLERY 

Paris. Friday 13 April [1849] 

I am sending you all the stuff I have scribbled just to show you that it 
is not laziness but weakness, or something similar, which is the cause of 
my not writing. Your husband is well; he came to see me again yester- 
day. He said he will arrange to be introduced to the President on 
Monday. He is very resolute and has also been to see Delacroix (who 
spoke to me about a bust which someone wanted to commission from 
your husband). Luck is never twice the same in this world, as M. de la 
Palisse 1 would say. I have nothing but precious sayings like that to 
console you with, so forgive me for passing them on. Well, I hope the 
sun of springtime will be my best doctor, for they are preparing at the 
Opera a sun for Le Prophete which is said to be more wonderful than any 
in the tropics. It merely rises, and does not last long; but it is so strong 
that it puts everything in the shade except the music. It is made up of 
rays of electric light. I was too ill to go to the rehearsal yesterday 
but I am looking forward to the first performance, which takes place 
next Monday. There is much talk of a skaters* dance, on roller-skates, 
and there is said to be a marvellous fire scene and splendid staging. 
They say that Mme Viardot in the part of the mother will make 
everyone cry. There I go, crossing things out. Please do let me hear 
from you when you can. Make the most of your climate. Paris is awful 
twenty different sorts of weather mud all over the place draughts 
in the rooms everything revolting and unbearable just now. 

Yours devotedly, 
Ch. 

In May 1849 Solange CUsinger had her second child, a daughter who died 
when she was six. Her letters to Chopin are, as usual, merely requests for kelp. 

In his miserable condition Chopin's thoughts turned more and more towards 
his family in Warsaw. He longed for a visit from Louise, whom he had not 
seen for Jive years. His friends too felt that time was running out. 

1 A comical French personage, associated with absurd truisms: "A few minutes before 
his death he was still alive," and so forth.

331. PRINCESS MARCELIINA CZARTORYSKA TO 
WLADYSLAW CZARTORYSKI IN PARIS 

Wiirzburg. 16 May [1849] 
Dear Wladyslaw, 

Go and see Mme Kiseleff [wife of the Russian ambassador]. I have 
asked her to get someone to write to Warsaw and apply for a' passport 
for Chopin's sister and brother-in-law. Ask what is happening, and 
request Mme Kiseleff not to mention it until a satisfactory answer is 
obtained; for I should not like poor Chopin to torment himself un- 
necessarily over this business. I enclose a letter for Chopin as I do not 
know his address. 

The Princess did not know Chopin s address at that moment because he 
had moved for the summer to a pleasant country-house at Chaillot, in the 
suburbs. Mme Obreskoff, who arranged the matter, kept the true amount of 
the rent from him and paid half of it herself. 

332. JUSTYNA CHOPIN TO FRYDERYK IN PARIS 

[Warsaw. June 1849] 
Dear Fryderyk, 

I received on the i6th of this month your letter in which you say 
that your health is improved: that was a real name-day gift for me. Oh, 
how I wish I could be with you, to look after you as I used to ! But 
since that cannot be, we must bow to the will of the Almighty, and He 
in His mercy will send you friends to take my place. Put your trust in 
Him and be not afraid, my darling, I expect you could do with some 
money just now, so I am sending what I can for the time being 
2,000 francs; and our good Bartinski will explain what you must do 
from now on so as not to find yourself in need [i.e. a method of trans- 
ferring funds from Poland]. May God bless you and give you health 
this prayer goes to Him from 

Your loving 

Mother 

333. CHOPIN TO WOJCIECH GRZYMALA 

Chaillot. 1 8 June [1849] 

How are you? I think that being in the country will at least do you 
good in a physical sense. I myself do not go out, except now and then 
to the Bois de Boulogne. I feel stronger, for I have been eating more 
and have given up swallowing medicines. I gasp and cough as usual, 

358 



but I can stand it better. I have not yet begun to play, and I cannot 
compose. God knows what sort of fodder I shall have to live on before 
long. Everybody is leaving town some for fear of the cholera, others 
for fear of revolution. . . . 

Kalkbrenner has died [of cholera]. Delaroche's eldest son has died at 
Versailles. An excellent servant of Franchoname has died. There have 
been no deaths at the Place d'Orleans, but Mme Etienne's little boy was 
dangerously ill. The Scots ladies have just arrived. Among other news 
they tell of the Due de Noailles being better; to which I replied that 
King Charles Albert has died at Lisbon. They are so tiresome that they 
will suffocate me. I shall leave my lodgings here at the end of the month 
and return to the Square I have no choice Cochet has returned. My 
Dr Fraenkel I can't get out of him whether I should go to some spa 
or to the south of France has once more stopped prescribing his herbal 
infusion and has given me a fresh medicine which I once more refuse 
to take. When I ask him what measures of hygiene I should take, he 
answers that it is unnecessary to adopt a regular routine in short, he 
is ready for an asylum. Joking apart, he is perhaps very good as a con- 
sultant, like Koreff; but like him, he is incapable of giving continuous 
treatment. 

Mile Lind has been here and sang one evening when I had Mme 
Potocka, Mme de Beauvau and Mme Rothschild. She has left for 
Sweden via Hamburg. Mme Catalan! [Angelica], whom she met here 
the day before she left, has died of cholera. I have only seen Cichowski 
once, as I told you. It's a long way into town and so I only receive 
visits now and then from those who are very attached to me such as 
Franchomme, or who have friends in the district, like the Czartoryskis. 
Today Pleyel came too kind fellow. Gutmann, with all his devotion, 
has not been here for ten days. In fact I began to be afraid he was ill, 
but he has written to say he is all right. The epidemic [cholera] is dying 
down in town. Delacroix has been in the country for a week now. Let 
me hear from you. 

All my love. 

Your 
Ch. 

He repeats much of the same news in a second letter to Grzymala four 
days later, 22 June, thinking his friend has not received the fast one; 
and adds: 

"I had two haemorrhages last night but I did nothing about it. I am still spit- 
ting blood, but much less. That was what brought Princess Sapieha to me, for 

359 



my night-nurse (a Polish woman) told her about It. My Jew Fraenkel has not 
been here for a week he finally did not even trouble to test the urine with 
litmus paper, and did nothing but chatter about an Englishman whom he had 
saved from the cholera, thanks to some medicine which the 'reactionary 
French government* (i.e. Fauchet) [Minister of the Interior] had not thought of 
asking him to import. Perhaps if I am left to myself I shall get out of this mess 
all the quicker. ..." 

334. To LOUISE JENDRZEJEWICZ IN WARSAW 

Chaillot, Monday 25 June 1849 
My dearest, 

If you [and Kalasanty] can come, please do so. I am ill and no doctors 
will do me so much good as you. If you are short of money, borrow 
some; when I get better I shall easily earn money and I shall pay back 
whoever has made you the loan. At the moment I am too hard up to 
send you anything. My place here at Chaillot is large enough to take 
you both, even with two children. It would be beneficial in every way 
ifor little Louise. Father Kalasanty could find plenty to do all day 
there is a horticultural exhibition close at hand in fact he will have 
more free time to himself than he did last time [in 1844], because I arn 
weaker and shall stay at home with Louise. 

My friends and well-wishers consider that Louise's arrival would be 
the best possible medicine for me. She has probably realised that herself 
from Mme Obreskoff's letter, so try to obtain passports. As two 
different persons one from the north and one from the south told 
me, without knowing Louise personally, that it would not only be good 
for my health but for hers. Come along then, Mother Louise and Daugh- 
ter Louise, bring your thimbles and needles and I shall give you hand- 
kerchiefs to embroider with my initials and stockings to knit; and you 
shall spend a few months here in the fresh air with your old brother and 
uncle. Besides, travelling is easier now. You don't need a lot of luggage. 
We shall live here as cheaply as can be. Your board and lodging will be 
provided. And even if Kalasanty sometimes finds it too far into town 
from the Champs-Elysees he can stay at my apartment in the Square 
d'Orleans. The omnibuses come directly from the Square to my very 
door here. 

I don't know myself why I am so eager to have Louise, but it is 
almost as though I were in an "interesting condition". I guarantee the 
trip will do her good as well. I hope the family council will send her, 
and who knows but what I shall bring her back home if I get better. 
And then, shouldn't we all embrace each other, as I wrote once before, 
without wigs on our heads and with all our own teeth! A wife owes 

360 



her husband obedience, so now I must apply to the husband to bring 
his wife. Let me therefore beg him earnestly to do so. If he weighs the 
matter up, he will realise that he can do nothing more pleasurable or 
useful either to me or to her, or even to the children, if any are brought 
(I have no doubt that the little girl will come). It will mean spending 
money, of course, but no better use could be made of it, and one could 
not have a cheaper trip. Once you are here, you will find a home await- 
ing you. Let me know soon, Mme Obreskoff was so kind as to say she 
would write to Louise (I gave her your address) and perhaps she will 
carry more conviction. Mile de Rozieres will add her word; and Cochet 
too would have added something if he had been here, for he found me 
in anything but good shape. His " Aesculapius* * [Dr Fraenkel] has not 
been here for ten days: he finally realised that it was something beyond 
his knowledge. However, you must sing his praises to your tenant and 
to others who know him, and say he has done me a great deal of good, 
but that I am made in such a way that I am delighted as soon as I feel a 
little better. Say also that everyone agrees that he has saved many people 
in Paris from the cholera. 

The cholera has already greatly diminished and has practically dis- 
appeared. Today the weather is lovely. I am in my sitting-room, 
admiring the view over all Paris. From my five windows, with nothing 
but gardens in between, I can see the Tour [Saint-Jacques], the Tuileries, 
the Chamber of Deputies, the Church of Saint-Germain-FAuxerrois, 
Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, Notre-Dame, the Pantheon, St Sulpice, the 
Val-de-Grace and the Invalides. You will see when you come. So now 
get a move on, expeditiously but without rushing, about your passport 
and the money. Send me a few lines at once. They say that "Even a 
cypress has its caprices'*. Well, my caprice today is to see you here. 
God will perhaps allow all to be well, but if He does not, never mind 
act as though He were going to allow it. I am hopeful; for I don't often 
ask for much, and indeed I would have refrained from asking this, if I 
had not been urged to it by everyone who has my interest at heart. 
Get a move on then, Mr Kalasanty, and you shall have a fine large 
cigar I know someone who smokes famous ones but please note, 
in the garden. 

I hope Mamma received the letter I sent for her name-day and that 
she did not miss me. I won't let myself think about it all, for I should be 
thrown into a fever, whereas, thank God, I am not at all feverish a 
fact which baffles and annoys all my doctors-in-ordinary. 

Your devoted but frail brother, 
Ch.

335. To SOLANGE CLESINGER AT GUIIXERY 

Chafflot. Wednesday 4 July 1849 

Thank you for your kind letter. I received a note from Mr Bouscinat 
about my carriage, as you had ordered [it had been lent to her], but a 
recent attack of blood-spitting has changed my travelling plans for the 
moment. The Emperor, who is in Warsaw just now, may give 
permission for my sister to come and see me: only then, and after 
careful consideration, shall I know whether I must leave Paris or 
stay here; for I am no longer equal to long journeys. So much for 
myself. 

I was glad to see that your trip to Bordeaux did not tire you but 
that does not prove that you do not need to take care of yourself. I 
imagine your little girl with a krge head, laughing, screaming, noisy, 
dribbling, biting without teeth, and all the rest. You must make an 
entertaining pair. When are you going to teach her to ride? I hope you 
have plenty of work to keep you busy, and that you wish the day and 
night were twice as long even if your Gascon servant-girl does have 
to wake you often. There I go crossing-out. I have no more to say, 
except that I continue to wish you as you know I always have 
every possible happiness. . . . Do please send me a few lines when your 
daughter gives you a moment's peace, just to let me know how you 
all are, now that you have this large addition to your family. 

God bless you all. 
Ch. 

336. To WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Chaillot. Tuesday 10 July 1849 
My dear friend, 

I am terribly weak. I have a kind of diarrhoea. Yesterday I asked 
Cruveilhier's advice but he prescribed nothing and merely told me to 
remain quiet. He said that if homoeopathic treatment did me good in 
Molin's time it was because he did not overload me with medicines and 
left a great deal to Nature. But I see that he regards me as a consump- 
tive, for he prescribed a teaspoonful of something containing lichen. 
[He mentions one or two friends.] 

. . . Mme Potockais at Versailles and will apparently be going to Spa. 
It is very hot here. I still have no news of my sister. I shall stay here for 
the rest of this month, and if my sister does not come I shall leave I am 
finding all this too expensive. I play less and less: I cannot write any- 
thing. Keep well and get on with your work on your brochure. Don't 

362 



give way to misery or to your troubles. You have already borne with 
so much. God will also give you strength for what is to come. 

Your 
CL 

337. COUNTESS DELHNA POTOCKA TO CHOPIN IN PABIS 

Abc-la-Chapelle. 16 [July 1849] 
Dear Mr Chopin, 

I do not wish to trouble you with a long letter but I cannot remain in 
the dark regarding your health and your plans for the future. Do not 
write yourself, but ask Mme Etienne, or that kind old woman who 
dreams about cutlets, to inform me of the state of your strength, your 
chest, your choking-attacks, etc., etc. You really must think seriously of 
Nice for the winter. Mme Augustine Potocka, in her reply to my letter, 
said she will make every effort to obtain a permit for Mme Andrze- 
jewicz [Louise Jendrzejewicz], but that the difficulties are enormous in 
that unhappy country. It grieves me to think of your being left alone 
in your illness and depression; please send me a few lines to Aix-Ja- 
Chapelle, poste restante. I would like to hear whether that Jew [Dr 
Fraenkel] made his appearance, and whether he did you any good. 
Things are sad and dull here, but for me life flows on monotonously 
wherever I am. When I think of what I have already had to go through, 
it would be enough if only life would pass without worse sufferings and 
trials. Somehow life has not smiled on me either in this world. Every 
individual whom I have ever wished well has always repaid me with 
ingratitude or various other tribulations. In short, life is simply one huge 
discord. God protect you, dear Mr Chopin. I hope to see you at the 
beginning of October at the latest. 

D. Potocka 

338. MME GRILLE DE BEUZELIN TO GEORGE SAND AT NOHANT 

Paris. July 1849 
Madame, 

I am venturing to take a step which may strike you as very strange, 
and for which I beg your forgiveness. You have probably forgotten 
my name, Madame, but a mutual acquaintance [Mile de Rozieres] had 
brought me to your notice, and I possess two of your books which you 
presented to me. 

I will not describe the feelings which your admirable talent has 
aroused in me, or say how natural it was that my lively interest should 
have given me the desire to know more of you. All of which brings me 

363 



to say that, knowing your long friendship for the illustrious person now 
cruelly struck down by illness, I feel that I am not mistaken when I say 
that he grievously realises how much he misses you. And as he is, 
Madame, at the last stage of his long sufferings, if you, through igno- 
rance, did not give him the consolation of receiving some mark of 
remembrance, you would lament it and he might die in despak. I make 
so bold as to send this note, Madame, and beg to assure you that no one 
in the world shall know of this approach. 

I venture to express the wish that I may not incur your censure, and 
I also implore you not to mention this warning of mine to a soul. 

G. de BeuzeHn 

339. GEORGE SAND TO MME GRILLE DE BEUZELIN IN PARIS 

Nohant. 19 July 1849 
Madame, 

I appreciate the kind feeling which dictated the step you have taken. 
It cannot but be echoed in a mother's broken heart, and I can make a 
confident reply. But what can I do, Madame, for the moral relief of the 
unhappy friend to whom you refer? I am compelled to Eve where I am 
at this moment, and even supposing that the connection between us had 
not been voluntarily and mutually broken, circumstances would 
inevitably have separated us. 

An extreme partiah" ty on his side for one of my children [Solange] 
had estranged the other [Maurice], and in my view the latter was in 
no way in the wrong. Things had reached the point where I had to 
choose between my son and my friend. I believe you would have done 
what I did. 

That is the fundamental truth of the matter, and one which has 
brought some bitterness and much pain into our separation. But 
sooner or later, and indeed before long, lack of financial resources must 
have put an end to my residing in Paris, while lack of strength must have 
similarly ended my friend's visits to the country. It was in fear and 
trembling that I kept him so distant from the attentions of celebrated 
doctors while leading a life which he found disagreeable in itself: he 
did not hide this from us, for he used to leave us with the first days of 
autumn, only to return as late as possible with the beginning of summer. 

For a long period he had had the benefit of my care and attention; 
they never failed him, but they were becoming insufficient, and worse 
than that, harmful. The best doctor, who was also the best friend he had 
in this part of the world [Gustave Papet] had long advised me to loosen 
the bonds of this friendship until they ceased to be bonds. I had long 

364 



worked to achieve that, and it was no fault of mine that it was not 
smoothly accomplished. But with a nervous constitution like his, with a 
character so strange and unhappy (albeit a noble one), it proved to be 
impossible; and I myself often lost patience when confronted with 
inexplicable and unjust reproaches. 

I am here putting forward neither accusations nor justifications, 
Madame, for they would be of little interest to you; and, moreover, I 
feel no need to justify myself in any respect whatsoever, or to accuse 
myself unnecessarily. 

Most wrongs in this world are the result of an inescapable destiny, 
itself created by the outside world. But you have given me a piece of 
advice, and it is for me to make clear to you a situation which gives 
you concern, so that you may consider what can be done to lessen the 
harshness of that situation in the interests of the sick man. 

Had I sought your judgement at the time of the breach, and had you 
seen things as they really were, you would have said: "You must part 
without bitterness and without breaking the bond of affection." I 
repeat, it did not depend on him or on me, but on others. For it is others 
who have come between us. There was not even a cooling-off in the 
friendship between the two of us. But, you will say, even when it was 
over, there was still time for us to come to an understanding and to 
console each other with tender words and lasting pledges of mutual 
esteem. I asked for nothing better. I have met him since then, and 
offered him my hand. . . . One would have said he hastened to avoid 
me; I sent someone after him, and he came back unwilBngly, to speak 
neither of himself nor me, but to show in his attitude and looks anger 
and indeed almost hatred [cf. Chopin's letter, No. 297]. 

Since then he has unburdened himself of bitter confidences and 
frightful accusations levelled at me. I have taken it all, as I was bound 
to, for mere raving; and I swear I have forgiven him everything, and 
from the bottom of my heart. But when confronted with this rancour 
and aversion, what could I do, for my part? Nothing. 

Had he but called me to him during my brief visits to Paris, I should 
have gone. Had he but written himself, or got someone to write some 
affectionate note, I should have replied. But now, does he really wish to 
have from me a word of friendship, of pardon, or any sign of interest? 
If so, I am ready. But you tell me, Madame, that no one in the world 
knows of the approach that you have been pleased to make. It is, there- 
fore, neither he nor any of his friends who have urged you to it, for I 
believe you do not know him personally. Do not imagine that I am in 
the slightest degree making this a question of pride pride is out of place 

365 



where a sufferer so gravely threatened is concerned. But were I to write, 
I should fear to provoke an emotional reaction more harmful than 
salutary. And again, I scarcely know what pretext for writing I can 
find; for were I to reveal the anxiety I feel, I should only arouse his own 
anxiety over his state of health. Go and see him? That is absolutely out 
of the question at this moment and would, I believe, make matters 
worse. I still hope he will live, for I have so often seen him apparently 
at the point of death that I never despair of him. However, if the state 
of siege were over and if I could spend a few days in Paris without being 
persecuted or arrested, I would certainly not refuse if he wished to 
see me. 

But I have the inward conviction that he does not wish it. His 
affection has long been dead, and if he is tormented by the memory of 
me it is because he feels in his own heart a pang of self-reproach. If he 
may be given to understand that I feel no resentment, find a way to let 
him be assured of it, without taking the risk of subjecting him to a fresh 
emotional shock. 

Forgive this long letter, Madame, but I could not answer with a few 
words in a matter of such delicacy. I thank you for the secrecy you 
promise, but for me there is nothing secret in all this. It is a long and 
painful family story, and my friends have well understood the suffering 
it has caused me. As you see, I am treating you as a friend in speaking 
so very freely. The friendly solicitude you have shown must be my 
excuse. Believe me, Madame, when I say that it has called forth my pro- 
found and sincere gratitude. 

George Sand 

The affair of the 25,000 francs sent by Mrs Erskine on 8 March (see page 
356) is now explained. 

340. CHOHN TO WOJCIECH GRZYMALA IN PARIS 

Chaillot. Saturday 28 July [1849] 

After your reply and her [Mrs Erskine's] letter I let my hands drop in 
amazement, and I did not know whether to suspect her of suffering 
from hallucinations, or her agent or Mme Etienne of being a thief. And 
I did not know whether to think I had lost my memory or whether I 
was a lunatic: in short, my head was fit to burst. She came and con- 
fessed, and answered so stupidly her sister [Jane Stirling] being sup- 
posed to know nothing of it that I was forced to tell her a few home 
truths; for example, that from no one (except perhaps the Queen or 
Miss Coutts [the English heiress to millions]) would I consent to receive 

366 



such lavish gifts, etc. But here is what happened: the individual to 
whom they entrusted such a sum without his being aware of it, and who 
did not even get a receipt from Mme Etienne showing that he had 
delivered that letter or parcel, well, that person went to Alexis, the 
medium. This is where the drama begins. 

Alexis tells him that on a Thursday in March (the 8th) he had taken 
some very important papers to a certain address (he wrote down the 
name), that the packet had not reached its destination, that he has not 
got it, that in fact he handed it over in some small room, where you go 
down two flights of steps, to some woman there were two of them, 
and the taller one took it. She had a letter in her hand which the post- 
man had delivered to her and, taking also the packet in question from 
the aforesaid individual, she told him she would deliver it at once. But, 
added Alexis, she took it downstairs and did not even show it to me ; and 
he said that I have never seen the packet. 

When he was asked whether he could see what had happened to the 
packet, he said he could not, but that if they brought him a lock ol 
hair, or a handkerchief, or a pair of gloves belonging to the person who 
had accepted the packet, he would be able to tell. Mrs Erskine was 
present at the seance with Alexis, and she came yesterday to tell me 
about it and to ask how she could manage to get hold of something 
belonging to Mme Etienne, so as to be able to give it to Alexis. I sent 
for Mme Etienne, on the pretext of asking her to fetch a French dic- 
tionary and some handkerchiefs, and when she came I pretended to 
want to get rid of Mrs Erskine who was supposed to want a lock of my 
hair for some spiritualist at Saint-Germain (where the Scots ladies are 
living just now) who cures sick people. Well, pretending to get rid of 
her, I said that if the spiritualist recognised where the hair came from 
for I should send some of Mme Etienne's hair then I would believe 
it and send some of mine; but I said I was sure the spiritualist would 
take the healthy hair as coming from a sick person. So at my request 
Mme Etienne cut off a lock of hair, wrapped it up, and Mrs Erskine 
took it away. 

This morning Mrs Erskine and her agent came here after seeing Alexis. 
Alexis had recognised the hair as being that of the person to whom the 
packet had been given. He said she had placed the packet, sealed, in 
some cabinet near the bed, and that it was still in her house and neither 
lost, delivered nor unsealed. He said that if the agent went about it the 
right way she would hand it over, but he must use caution. So the man 
went straight from here at twelve o'clock to the Square d'Orleans, 
found Mme Etienne alone and reminded her that in March he had 

367 



given her a packet for me he had told her it was very important. She 
recognised him and handed over the packet which he had delivered so 
many months ago. It was not unsealed and the twenty-five thousand 
francs in it were untouched. Mrs Erskine unsealed it in the presence of 
the man and myself. What do you make of it? That medium! ! ! The 
packet, so long thrown aside, untouched!!! Such an extraordinary 
occurrence makes my head whirl Please note that I did not accept the 
donation and I could write a great deal about it. I prefer to tell it to 
you sometime personally. You may now believe in magnetism. Thank 
God the money was found. There are many other details which I can't 
write the pen is burning my fingers. 

Now for something else. Princess Sapieha, Isabella and Wladyslaw 
[Czartoryski] have today left for Dieppe. The Wiirttembergs are re- 
maining here. Mme Plichta has probably reached Warsaw. I am begin- 
ning to doubt whether my sister will come. I am neither better nor 
worse. 

I send my love and would like to see you. 

Yours

No news of Orda [who was trying to find a buyer for Grzymala's 
gold watch]. 

On the same Jay Chopin noted in his diary: "2$ July. Mrs Erskine left 
15,000. Alexis, the medium, found the money in a remarkable manner. Paid 
back 500 to Franchomme" 

341. To WOJCEECH GRZYMAIA IN PARIS 

Chaillot. 3 August [1849] 

You can't imagine how I am dying to see you, if only for an hour; 
but I can't ask you to come out of your hole, for although they [the 
Government] have expelled not 200 but only a score or so members of 
the Polish Democratic Society (not one of whom I even knew), it is a 
tricky business if you are nervous. 

As regards my extraordinary adventure, there are many, many 
details which I cannot reconcile with spiritualism, with lies or hal- 
lucinations on Miss Stirling's side, and with Mme Etienne's honesty. 
It is even possible that the whole thing was staged afterwards. On that 
score I have much to tell for instance, I received another kind of 
letter, this time anonymous, which I handed over to them personally. 
I have not said a word to Mme Etienne about all this and I don't intend 
to, although it happened a week ago today. That packet might have 

368 



been given to her three days before. As I was not at home [at Place 
d'Orleans] and she was here, it might have been recovered just as well 
without the medium as with him. All the more so when one takes into 
account the coincidence of various conversations ! ! ! There is kindness, 
but also showing-off [on the part of Miss Stirling and Mrs Erskine] ! 
I would like to see you. 

Clesinger has brought Solange to Paris after a ten-day journey in this 
heat, with her child and nurse but without money, and just at a time 
when everyone is fleeing to the country! "Where are his brains, I won- 
der? He has none, or rather he has stupid ones. Mile de Rozires has 
left: she is at a Belgian spa with Mme Grille [de Beuzelin]. Solange is 
running around looking for a place to live. He wants to find something 
near Chaillot: it frightens me to think what an idiot he is. Apart from 
Franchomme and Herbault everyone is away in the country. Mme 
Obreskoff is at Saint-Germain and visits me every Monday. I am 
drinking Eaubonne water. My sister has not yet received her permit 
later on it will be useless, as her husband's holidays will be over. I gasp 
and cough and just want to sleep. I do nothing and wish for nothing. 
I can't get that Alexis out of my head.

I have not seen Cichowski for two weeks. I know nothing of 
Virginia. Orda has not sold your watch he has handed it over to 
Cichowski. The last people he offered it to questioned its genuineness. 
They looked it up in Breguet [the famous watchmaker] 's books but 
there is no mention of it. I expect that since then your other afiairs have 
been smoothed out. Old Prince Sapieha and the Princess were here 
yesterday evening. The Princess [Marcellina Czartoryska] and Isabella 
and Wladyslaw are in Dieppe and are well.

have at this moment, but with a little more strength, for I am weaker

My respects to Mme Grille de Beuzelin. 

[Louise's postscript:] Just a word, for it is time for this letter to go to

tan-well, and I am sorry I cannot embrace you, my dear kind friend. I 
would gladly have stopped at Chaudfontaine if the train had not passed 
through during the night. I thought about it, and it would have been 
an immense joy to see you. So I need not tell you how sorry we were 
to see our plan frustrated. . . . 

After twenty years Chopin s intimate friend, the beloved Titus of his

My dearest friend, 

I need to be as ill as I am at this moment if I cannot stir from Paris 
when you are about to arrive at Ostend. But I hope that God will allow 
you to come to me. The doctors won't let me undertake any journey. 
I drink Pyrenees water in my bedroom, but your presence would do 
me more good than all their medicines. 

Yours till death,

On Thursday 30 August (according to Chopin s diary), a final consultation 
took place between three leading doctors: Cruveilhier, Louis and Blache, The 
conclusions reached could not but be pessimistic. 

344. GEORGE SAND TO MME GRILLE DE BEUZELIN IN PARIS 

Nohant. i September 1849 
Dear Madame, 

I hear that the sister of the friend whom we discussed [see letter 339] 
is with him. I hope that this will save him, for his sister is an angel and 
he adores her. An opportunity now presents itself for me to do as you 
wished, without arousing the patient's fears for his own state. By 
asking Mile [sic] Louise for news of her own health I am enabled 
to signify an affectionate remembrance of her brother. 

The more I think of what I have suffered, the harder I find it to believe 
that he wishes to remember me. Louise will be the best judge of that, 
and will either mention my letter or keep silent. Mile de Rozires 
should be so kind as not to hand it to her in the sick man's presence. 
Some friends have written to say he was much better, but those who see 
him at other times and in other circumstances have such different 
opinions about his state that I do not know what to think.

Forgive me, Madame, for sending such a brief letter, but I am so tired 
that I cannot continue. Our district has been struck by a serious epidemic 
and I have not a moment's rest. It is very sad to see others suffer and die, 
but one gains strength if one succeeds in saving a life. I send my best 
wishes for you and yours. Please accept my warmest respects and my 
thanks for your kind letters. 

George Sand 
[With the above letter went one to be handed to Louise:] 

Nohant. i September 1849 
Dear Louise, 

I learn now that you are in Paris I was not aware of it before. At 
last I shall have through you some true news of Fryderyk. Some people 
write that he is much worse than usual, others that he is only weak and 
fretful as I have always seen him. I venture to ask you to send me word, 
for one can be misunderstood and abandoned by one's children without 
ceasing to love them. Tell me also about yourself, and do not think 
that I have spent a single day since the time I first knew you when I 
have not thought of you and cherished your memory. Others must 
have spoilt the memory of me which you preserved in your heart, but 
I do not think I have deserved all I have suffered. 

Yours from the bottom of my heart, 
George 

This letter remained, unanswered, and George Sand was at Nohant when 
Chopin died. The stories of her last-minute visit to the dying man are false. 

345. CHOPIN TO TITUS WOYCIECHOWSKI AT OSTEND 

Paris. 12 September 1849 

I have not had enough time to try to get you a permit to come here. 
[The frontier was closed to Russkn subjects.] I cannot go out to see 
about it myself and I have to spend half the day in bed; so I have asked 
an influential friend to do it for me. I shall not know anything for 
certain before Saturday. I wanted to set off in the train for Valenciennes, 
at the frontier, to meet and embrace you, but a few days ago I simply 
could not go as far as Ville d'Avray near Versailles to see my god- 
daughter, and the doctors won't allow me to leave Paris. They won't 
even let me go to a warmer climate for the winter. 'It is my fault 
for being ill, otherwise I should have come to you somewhere in 
Belgium. 

You may perhaps succeed in coming here. I am not selfish enough to 

371 



wish it for myself alone; as I am ill you would only have a few hours 
of boredom and disappointment, mingled with a few hours of joy and 
happy memories. But I would like the time we spent together to be one 
of complete and perfect happiness. 

Yours eternally, 

Fryderyk 

346. To AUGUSTE FRANCHOMME AT TOURS 

Paris. 17 September 1849 
Dear friend, 

I am much grieved to hear of what you had to put up with at Le 
Mans. Anyhow you are now in Touraine where the weather will have 
been more favourable. 

I am rather worse than better. Messrs Cruveilhier, Louis and 
Blache decided in consultation that I ought not to undertake any 
journey just now, but that I should find rooms facing south and stay 
in Paris. 

After many inquiries we have found an apartment which is very 
expensive but fulfils all the required conditions at No. 12 Place 
Vendome. It is where Albrecht has his office. Dr Meara was very 
helpful in my search for the apartment. 

Anyhow I shall see you all next winter and nicely settled. My sister 
is staying with me unless she is urgently required at home. I love you 
and can say no more, for I am dropping with lassitude and weakness. 
My sister is looking forward to seeing Mme Franchomme. So am I 
most sincerely. It will be as God pleases. 

All my friendly greetings to Mr and Mrs Forest. How I wish I could 
be with you for a few days ! What about Mme Lauvergeat is she at 
the sea-side? Remember me to her and to Mme Lasserve. Kisses for 
your children. Send me a few lines. 

Yours ever, 
Ch. 

My sister sends her regards to Mme Franchomme. 

Apart from a few words in his diary on 3 October the above letter appears 
to be the last thing that Chopin wrote. There are the strongest reasons for 
believing that the scrap of paper containing a request for his body to be opened 
was written by his father, Nicholas Chopin, in 1844, and not by Fryderyk. 
The handwriting has all the characteristics of the father, not the son. (See 
also page 235.) 



347. LOUISE JENDRZEJEWICZ TO HER HUSBAND KALASANTY IN WARSAW 
Paris. Tuesday-Wednesday [16-17 October 1849] 

^, 11. Two in the morning. 

On my darling, & 

He has gone little Louise and I are both well. I embrace you 
tenderly. Remember Mother and Isabella. 

Adieu 

[Princess Marcellina Czartoryska continues:] Our poor friend's life 
is over he suffered greatly ere he reached that last moment, but he 
suffered with patience and angelic resignation. The way your wife 
nursed him was exemplary. God gives her immense physical and 
moral strength. She asks me to tell you that she will write and give you 
full details in a day or two. She begs you not to be anxious on her 
account. Chopin's friends will help her to settle everything, and as for 
the return journey, they say it will be safe for her to travel alone. 

I have scarcely the strength to write to you, but my heart impels me 
to say that I will conscientiously fulfil the promise I made to you and 
to our dying friend and I will look after your wife as if she were my 
own sister. 

Yours most sincerely, 

Marcellina Czartoryska (ne Radziwill) 



348. WOJCIECH GRZYMALA TO AUGUSTE 

[Paris. October 1849] 
My dear friend, 

It is a great consolation for me to be able to address you by such a 
title, now that my heart is broken by the despair and mourning which 
you will sincerely share with me. For now that our Chopin is no more, 
the gap he leaves behind ought to strengthen our ties of friendship, if 
only because we shall never for the rest of our lives be able to forget 
him or cease to regret his loss. I had already tried several rimes to write 
to you but when I reached the point when I must speak of Chopin's 
illness the pen fell from my hand. I dreaded setting down on paper the 
fears that devoured me lest I should thereby make their realisation more 
probable. Since you left he was treated by several homoeopathic doc- 
tors of the old school, but without success. Doctors Roth, Simon, 
Oldendorf, Fraenkel from Warsaw, Louis, Bkche and Cruveilhier, 
and many others, did what they could. But his disease had gone too 
far and the patient was too weak to be saved. 

He had moved to Chaillot for the summer. A delightful view and 
sunshine failed to cheer him or even to take his mind off his sufferings. 

373 



A single real consolation came to restore his failing courage: his be- 
loved Louise came from the distant North in spite of all the difficulties 
to be overcome in obtaining permission to travel to Paris. She left her 
mother and her husband and children to become a nurse to her poor 
brother. For a few days a visible and beneficial change was wrought 
in him, but it was the last smile of his life: from that moment life did 
not withdraw slowly it fled from him. Symptoms of dropsy appeared 
and from the outset the disease resisted all the efforts of science. How- 
ever, the patient still had enough hope left to enable him to bear with 
yet another removal and to furnish a charming apartment for himself 
in the Place Vendome, where the Russian embassy used to be, and he 
even prepared to resume his work. His brain was teeming with music 
but he had not the strength to sit at the piano or even to hold a pen. 
What a heart-breaking sight it then was to see such a great genius 
intact and yet made barren by purely physical helplessness and prostra- 
tion! One wonders why the artist's works are immortal whilst the 
genius who creates them must vanish at the dawn of his life. But I will 
not trust myself to enter into such a discussion. 

When his new home was ready and yet he still could not overcome 
his weakness, his mind was seized by the inward conviction that he was 
doomed: a space often days separated that moment from the hour of 
his death. But for his friends those ten days are equal in value to his 
whole artistic life. Never did the greatest Stoic of antiquity leave 
behind the example of a finer death or of a nobler, purer or more 
Christian soul. His death-struggle, after Confession and the admin- 
istration of the Holy Sacraments, lasted three days and three nights ; and 
never has a more tenacious vitality been seen. The doctors could not 
get over it. And at such moments my mind was crushed by the thought 
that if he had not had the ill luck to know G. Sand, who poisoned his 
whole life, he might have lived to be as old as Cherubini. On the last 
day and at the last hour of his life his mind was as dear as ever. He often 
sat up in bed and addressed to twenty persons at least, his adorers in 
ermine or rags who for four days and nights had been kneeling and 
praying, he addressed to them, I say, words of advice, of pleading, of 
consolation almost, with a propriety, a decency and a tact which pass 
belief with a kindness and tenderness far removed from this world. 
He recognised everyone, remembered all their little characteristics, 
and dictated his kst wishes regarding his works with the same loftiness 
of mind that had inspired them. 

"There will be found," he said, "many compositions more or less 
sketched. In the name of the friendship you bear me I ask that they 

374 



should all be burnt, with the exception of a Piano-method which I 
bequeath to Alkan and Reber to see whether any use can be made of it. 
The rest, without exception, must be consigned to the flames, for I have 
always had a great respect for the public and whatever I have published 
has always been as perfect as I could make it. I do not wish that under 
the cover of my name works which are unworthy of the public should 
be spread abroad." And for hours he continued to utter equally lofty 
sentiments. Then a few hours later, on the iyth at two o'clock in the 
morning, on Wednesday, he passed into another life, smiling until 
almost the last minute before his end, embracing Gutmann and seeking 
to embrace Mme Clesinger [Solange]. We may be sure that God has 
his soul in His keeping and that such a soul will be dear to Him. A few 
hours before he died he asked Mme Potocka for three airs of Bellini 
and Rossini. These she sang, accompanying herself and sobbing, while 
he listened to them with sobs and religious emotion as the last sounds he 
would hear in this world. He gave instructions for his body to be 
opened, being convinced that medical science had never understood 
his disease; and in fact it was found that the cause of his death had been 
different from what was thought, but that nevertheless he could not 
have Hved. On the third day his body, embalmed and fully dressed, 
was laid out, covered in flowers, and friends and casual visitors were 
free to take a last look at the Great Master. 

Mozart's Requiem and his own Funeral March will be performed with 
the assistance of Lablache, Mme Viardot and the Conservatoire Concert 
Society. But to show you what a world we live in, and to end my letter, 
I will tell you that the singers have asked for 2,000 francs before they 
will pay to Chopin the homage which their own self-respect ought to 
have impelled them to offer and not to sell to his memory. 

Yours ever, 
Albert

APPENDIX 
The "Chopin-Potocka Letters" 

From the pages of this book there will have emerged for the reader 
the picture of a man living in the aristocratic Paris of Louis-Philippe, 
one whose life and character are mirrored not only in his own letters 
but in those of people who were in close daily association with him 
and who were perfectly placed to judge both the man and his actions. 
These letters are living documents, not vague memories recalled after 
the lapse of years and thus coloured by time and distorted by distance. 
And even if not a single letter of Chopin or his friends had survived 
there would still be enough testimony from other sources to give a 
clear view of Chopin as a personality. The value of individual portions 
of this testimony varies: a writer who met Chopin once or twice cannot 
be so safe a guide as one who saw him almost every day for years. 
Fortunately some of those who fall into this last category belong to the 
clearest minds of their period George Sand and Eugene Delacroix, 
to name only two. 

In 1945 the question arose whether all these people parents, sisters, 
friends, pupils and colleagues, to say nothing of a host of slighter 
acquaintances had been completely deceived in their estimate of 
Chopin's personality; whether for over a century the whole world had 
been the victim of a delusion; and whether the time had come at last 
for the truth about Chopin to be revealed. 

For the task of demolishing the well-established legend it would seem 
that full and overwhelming evidence would be called for and would be 
unhesitatingly produced; that documents of irrefutable authenticity 
would, before our very eyes (however reluctant to believe), prove that 
we had all been mistaken and that Chopin had, in fact, achieved 
miracles of successful hypocrisy and had completely outwitted the 
penetrating feminine gaze of George Sand, the delicate perception of 
Delacroix and the keen glance of Berlioz a feat beside which his 
deception of his simpler-minded parents and lifelong friends appears 
as nothing. But when one asked: What, then, was the bombshell which 
accomplished this work of destruction, the answer came back: A few 

377 



sheets of typescript, produced in 1945 in circumstances now to be 
briefly rekted. Nothing more. Not an original document, not a word 
in Chopin's hand; not a photograph or a facsimile of a word nothing 
but the uncorroborated statements of a woman, now dead, who claimed 
to have seen and copied certain letters supposedly written by Chopin 
to the Countess Delfina Potocka, whose name has appeared several 
times in these pages. 

It must be said at once that a few persons were found ready to give 
an enthusiastic welcome to this "revelation" as being one which adds 
fresh lustre to Chopin's name. It was for them a satisfaction to see the 
He given to Delacroix's famous account of his conversations on music 
with Chopin: 

"During the day he spoke to me of music, and the talk revived him. 
I asked him what logic in music consisted o He made me realise what 
harmony and counterpoint are, and how fugue is, as it were, pure logic 
in music. I thought how glad I should have been to learn all that . . . 
the fact is that true science is not what people ordinarily understand by 
that word, that is to say, something quite different from art, in the 
realm of knowledge. No; science thus envisaged and demonstrated by 
a man like Chopin is art itself. And on the other hand art is not what 
the common herd imagine it to be a sort of inspiration coming from 
I-know-not-where, something proceeding from chance and portraying 
merely the picturesque exterior of things. It is reason itself, adorned by 
genius, but following a course determined and restrained by superior 

laws He told me that pupils usually learn about chords before they 

understand counterpoint, that is, the succession of notes which lead to 
the chords. Berlioz lays down his chords and fills up the gaps as best 
he can. . . ." 

Now look at the new Chopin of the typescript: 

"I have really too many themes, almost an embarrasde richesses, as the 
French say. When it comes to putting them on paper I pick out the best 
bits, but there are always holes left in the complete thing. . . . After 
some time, a theme comes unexpectedly, as if out of the blue, and it 
fits exactly into the hole . . . then another . . . and at last the whole 
thing fits together like a mosaic." 

And he goes on to reveal that his exquisite Prelude in A flat (No. 17) 
is a piece of programme-music far outstripping the most audacious 
realism of Wagner in Tristan: 

"I have just finished a Prelude in which I have immortalised our 
eleventh 'little game' [meaning sexual intercourse]. It contains eleven 
strokes [the A flat in the bass] in honour of our most pleasant frolic. 

378 



When I play it to you I shall explain and you will grasp the whole 
finesse. I know that it will be our favourite just as that little game was." 

It is not surprising after this to find Chopin telling the Countess: 
"Evil tongues gossip and say that you can't have a baby, because you 
have already had too many lovers, and grass won't grow on a well- 
worn path. ... I nearly burst out crying when I heard them. . . . 
When you come back I will give you a baby, and the liars can shut 
their mouths. What I think and dream of is that our baby will become 
a great, great musician. ..." 

The story of how Mme P. Czeraicka came to offer her documents 
in the first place to Prof. Szpinalski in 1941, and to the Chopin Institute 
of Warsaw in 1945, has been told in detail by those who were closely 
connected with the Institute at the time, and has been completed by the 
conference of Polish musicologists which met in October 1961 to 
investigate thoroughly the whole question of these "letters". It is a 
story of shuffling, deceit and promises unkept the promises being 
that the "originals", or at least fragments or photographs of them, 
would be reproduced for inspection. Nothing of the kind was ever done, 
in spite of the most pressing demands for something, for anything, to 
show that her typescript was a genuine transcript of papers that Chopin 
had written. After various contradictory statements, involving a 
mysterious French officer to whom the precious papers had been con- 
fided and a dramatic theft of these same papers on a railway platform 
in Poland, Madame Czernicka handed her typescript to the Chopin 
Institute with the added sentence: "I deckre that the following copies 
agree with the originals, now destroyed." 

Before coming to the substance of these letters it is necessary to make 
a few observations on the general nature of the texts produced. 

There are, properly speaking, no letters in the ordinary sense of that 
word. There are paragraphs, long or short (in one case a single sentence), 
sometimes typed between inverted commas and thus giving the 
impression of being quotations. The language of the texts is an 
imitation of Chopin's style easily obtainable from the published 
correspondence but there are exaggerations, flaws and inconsistencies 
which cannot stand up to critical examination. The reader will have 
noticed Chopin's usage when he speaks of George Sand. Even when 
writing to his intimate men friends she is invariably "Mme Sand", 
"the Mistress of the House", and once or twice only "George". In the 
new texts she became "Aurora", or worse still "Sandowa", a form 
which does not occur once in the authentic letters and is unimaginable 
as coming from Chopin's pen. (There are other linguistic aspects of the 

379 



texts which were fully debated by the Polish conference but which 
cannot be profitably discussed here.) 

The reader will have observed how full Chopin's letters are of day- 
to-day details, news of friends, greetings all round, social gossip, etc., 
and how few are the references to his methods of composition, 
"inspiration", "creativeness" and aims as a composer. In the new texts 
the exact opposite is the case: there he speaks continually of his creative 
processes, linking them with his sexual feelings. Of the ordinary- 
substance of his letters there is no trace, nothing of the Chopin revealed 
in the general body of his correspondence. We are asked to believe that 
Chopin would plunge into a letter like this: 
"Darling Findeleczko, My only one, 

"Once more I shall bore you with questions of my inspiration and 
musical creation; 1 but you will see that it concerns you closely. I have 
reflected deeply on composition and inspiration, and slowly, slowly I 
have discovered the most important thing: thoughts and inspirations 
only come to me when I have not had a woman for a long time. . . . 

"In science the same [sexual] force operates and guides, for we see 
schokrs who are devoted to scientific work and discovery keeping 
themselves away from women. The prescription is, however, simple: 
let the creator, whoever he may be, drive women away from him, out 
of his life, and the strength collecting in his body will not go into 
his prick and balls . . . but will return to his brain in the form of in- 
spiration and will perhaps create the most lofty work of art. Think, my 
sweetest Findeleczko, how much of that precious fluid and strength I 
have lost, ramming you to no purpose, since I have not given you a 
baby: and God knows how many of my finest inspirations and musical 
thoughts have been lost for ever. . . . Perhaps Ballades and Polonaises, 
even a whole Concerto, have vanished for ever down ..." and so on. 
And yet, in a letter to Musical America (May 1960), a writer from Canada 
has actually welcomed these "letters" as being "of inestimable value for 
Chopin's biography as almost the only source of information about his 
artistic credo in his full maturity". 

We are in possession of the love-letters of many outstanding figures 
of Chopin's period Liszt and Marie d'Agoult, George Sand and 
Musset, Delfina Potocka herself and the poet Krasinski, to mention 
only a few famous couples. Whatever may have been the violence of 
their passions and the licence of their behaviour, the language of these 
people, moving in a world of intellectual distinction, showed a respect 

1 The word used here, tw6rczoit, and its associates occur nearly forty times in the few 
pages of typescript in the authentic letters not once. 

380 



for the outward decencies of their own social circles, especially as 
between men and women (men may write and speak very differently 
to each other). Liszt and Marie d'Agoult speak to each other as "vous" 
and follow all the usages of good society. The same standards are 
observed between Musset and George Sand. Why then should Chopin, 
of all people, present such a formidable contrast in his letters to a Polish 
countess who, whatever her morals, maintained at least the appearance 
of a lady? Yet according to Mme Czernicka's typescript (no one 
has seen a word of it in Chopin's hand) the passage given above 
contains the thoughts and language of the man who is portrayed in 
this book. 

It has been believed by some writers that at one time Chopin may 
have had an affair with Delfina Potocka. There is no definite evidence 
of it rather the contrary but it has become clear that the belief, 
picked up from various sources, that there "had been something" 
provided a natural starting-point for the fabrication of "letters" pur- 
porting to fill a gap in Chopin's correspondence. 

But the evidence against anything more than a warm friendship is 
very strong. Things which, in the case of an ordinary man, might appear 
as mere "trifles light as air" assume a real importance when one is 
dealing with a person so morbidly sensitive as Chopin in everything 
relating to the exterior propriety and conduct of life. There are number- 
less proofs of it. He dreaded anything that savoured of the scandalous 
in a social sense. Let the reader consider the important passages of letter 
No. 121. George Sand put her finger on a vital spot: "II craint le 
monde." 1 He had a horror of attracting attention to his private affairs, 
and it was this attitude of mind that prevented him from publicly 
dedicating a single work to any of the three women he is known to 
have loved. One looks in vain for the names of Constantia Gladkowska, 
Maria Wodzinska or George Sand in the Hst of those who were 
honoured by him in this way. Yet the Countess Delfina Potocka twice 
received such a public tribute from him. the only woman (apart from 
Baroness Rothschild) to do so. In 1836, at the very moment when he 
ought to have diverted attention away from his lover, we find him 
dedicating to her one of his most important works, the F minor 
Concerto; and eleven years later the Waltz in D flat, Op. 64. 

Throughout his letters to his family and his intimate men friends he 
refers to her only as Mme Delfina Potocka. He tells his family, "You 
know how fond of her 1 am" contrast this with his reticence over 
George Sand and even in his private diary for 1848, which no one but 

1 See above, p. 160: "he is afraid of what people might say". 

381 



himself might see, he refers to her as "Mme D. Potocka 5 ' (the writer 
has studied the entry in the original diary in Warsaw). With his horror 
of the social gaffe or anything likely to produce embarrassment it is 
almost inconceivable that he should deliberately bring two mistresses 
together under his roof. Yet in 1847 (see letter 263) we actually find 
him writing of George Sand and Delfina Potocka having spent an even- 
ing at his rooms in "a pleasant warm atmosphere" ! And is it likely that 
on his death-bed in 1849, after having made his full confession and 
received absolution and the last sacraments, Chopin would have 
welcomed, in the presence of his confessor, his sister and most intimate 
friends, a weeping ex-mistress so that her voice might console his last 
moments with religious melodies? 

The only surviving letter from Delfina Potocka to Chopin calls for 
the most careful consideration, and the reader should give it close 
attention (see letter 337). She is writing on 16 July 1849: "Dear Mr 
Chopin . . , God protect you, dear Mr Chopin." This is to a lonely man 
with whom she is said to have had for years a most passionate affair! 
He was living by himself at Chaillot (his sister not yet having left 
Poland) and she could have written without fear that anyone might 
intercept her letter. Yet such is the tone she uses. And she remarks that 
"every individual whom I have ever wished well has always repaid 
me with ingratitude or various other tribulations". That would include 
Chopin if there had really been anything between them. 

One of Mme Czernicka's "prize pieces", the letter of 19 November 
1840, deserves special attention. But first of all some facts from the late 
Mr Adam Z6ltowski (a Krasinski scholar) regarding Delfina's relations 
with the poet Krasinski must be given. Krasinski was the most jealous 
and suspicious of men. Yet Mr Z6ltowski personally assured the writer 
in London that he had read literally thousands of Krasinski's letters, 
letters often containing bitter reproaches against Delfina, and that the 
name of Chopin does not once appear. Moreover: "From 1839 all the 
movements of Mme Potocka are well known. However it is certain 
that in 1840 the affair between the poet and Delfina was at its height and 
that the young woman was not in Paris. She spent one part of this year 
with her mother in Naples and the other with Krasinski, first at Rome 
and then at Mola di Gaeta, and finally on the shores of Lake Como. 
There is no trace of a journey she might have made to Paris. No one 
who knows Krasinski can doubt that such an event could not have 
taken place without his knowledge. In the spring of 1841 Delfina went 
for a month to Naples and instantly the poet's letters followed her in 
avalanches." 

382 



Now for the "letter'* of 19 November 1840 an extraordinary pro- 
duction from every point of view. Delfina is supposed to be in Paris, 
only a few steps away from Chopin. She will not come to his bed unless 
he sends a written certificate to guarantee that he still loves her, in spite 
of the George Sand episode. Chopin, it will be remembered, has been 
to Nohant once only, in the summer of 1839, and we are now given to 
understand that he was composing the G major Nocturne, some 
Mazurkas and the Funeral March Sonata while George Sand was in 
bed with a man in the next room ! 
"My darling, 

"You want me to write an explanation or rather an apology although 
I am only a few steps away from you in Paris but you wish to have 
this certificate in writing. The Master orders, the servant must obey. . . . 
But I will remind you that you solemnly promised that if my explana- 
tion is satisfactory I shall receive your pity and supreme favours. . . ." 
He goes on to say that his "liaison with Sandowa" (his actual words) 
had lasted "not a full year" and that "since she wanted it five times a 
night" and he could not satisfy her, she had made this her "pretext for 
the rupture" (again his actual words). 

Never, at any time, was Chopin known to use the words "liaison" 
or "pretext for the rupture", not even after the events of 1847, seven 
years after the time of this letter. To make him use such expressions in 
1840 is a perfect example of the fabricator's being wise years after the 
event. Chopin is supposed to continue: 

"Everyone who goes to Nohant knows perfectly well about her 
lovers, and in Paris it is common knowledge who is her favourite. At 
Nohant she writes during the night and in the daytime she locks 
herself up in her bedroom with her lover, and everybody knows 
about it." 

If this state of affairs was cheerfully accepted by Chopin for the next 
six years what becomes of his almost morbid jealousy, so clearly 
revealed in the letters in this book? The new "letter" proceeds: 

"After the rupture with Sandowa I had a few brief romances, but 
they were passions without love, hardly worth mentioning. ... I always 
look at lovely women with admiration and if one of them inflames me 
into a passion I pull her into my bed. . . . The rest of the women in my 
life have either been youthful dreams, long since buried, or else winds 
of burning passion which swept over me for a short time. To these 
women I used to give my bed, my body and a little life-giving fluid, 
but none of them had my heart. When a great love inflames me and 
passion urges me powerfully ... I forget the world as I used to with 

383 



you and I am ready to sacrifice everything for the woman, both my 
life and creative powers. With those other women it was not like that, 
I never lost my head, I remembered . . . not to exhaust myself as it 
would harm my creative powers so I carefully husbanded my strength 
and life-giving fluid . . . and since, up to the present moment I have 
loved only you and Aurora, you yourself will admit that my heart is 
not swift and easy in yielding to love. Perhaps I have already con- 
vinced you by making it all so clear that even a child could under- 
stand/' He then makes a bargain: "I have had a famous lover followed 
by minor romances; you also took a famous lover after me and there 
has certainly been no lack of smaller romances in your case so you 
see we are quits. I have made my general confession, I am sorry for my 
sins and I eagerly await the return of your favours." 

He ends with the inevitable "stage-properties": his tears fall on the 
paper as he writes; he will come that evening to throw himself at her 
feet with some "apologetic improvisation"; he will play for her as he 
has never played for anyone . . . and as a last inducement : ' 'My romance 
with Sandowa has taught me quite a lot: you'll see how you will be- 
come my pupil and I'll teach you some love-tricks which are absolutely 
new and frightfully piquant!' 

All this in 1840, and after one visit to Nohant! If these things were 
true then one half of the letters in this volume would make no sense 
at all, as the reader will observe by considering the letters from 1839 
to 1849. 

This is not the place to speak in detail of the endless historical im- 
possibilities and contradictions which even a casual inspection reveals 
in Mme Czernicka's texts. Certain of these concern the Polish poet, 
Cyprian Norwid. He was born at the end of 1821 and was still a boy in 
Poland when we find Chopin speaking of him as an adult and equal in 
Paris. The boy is involved with Chopin in learned discussions about 
nationalism in music. The explanation here is fairly obvious. The 
author, ignorant of the details of Norwid's life, was only aware that in 
later life, after Chopin's death, he had written some interesting things 
about the composer things which are no secret in Poland. There are 
passages lifted from biographies and other books on Chopin in fact 
there is little in the texts that cannot be traced to some previous publi- 
cation. The constant harping on begetting, creating, giving birth, etc. is 
quite pathological. For instance, the intelligent Countess is supposed to 
declare that all composers should compose in the same way, "since 
women all have their babies in the same way." "Oh no," says Chopin, 
"with us creators the process is like child-bearing with you one 

384 



woman has a terrible time whilst another spits out a baby like a 
plum-stone." 

Of the texts dealing with other aspects of music and musicians little 
need be said here. It is common knowledge that the German critic 
Rellstab attacked Chopin in the early days (see letter 80) and said that 
whoever attempted to play his studies should have a surgeon at hand. 
This duly appears, with a warning to Delfina that the Studies are 
dangerous and may strain her hand irremediably ! It is also well known 
that Chopin admired Liszt's playing of his Etudes (see letter 77), so 
naturally we find Chopin telling his lover: "I am not sending the 
Etudes: you shall first play them with me when you have heard how 
Liszt executes them." Furthermore we know from various sources that 
Chopin did not approve of long hours of drudgery at the keyboard; 
nevertheless our "author" seems to go a little too far in his recom- 
mendation for the acquisition of a virtuoso technique: "Don't practise 
more than two hours a day, during the summer holidays that's quite 
sufficient." At one point he gives the Countess piano-instruction (by 
mail!) everything else in his letter having apparently vanished save 
a paragraph on pedalling and fingering. Some of the notions attributed 
to Chopin are quite absurd: "I don't know whether I shall write 
forty-eight Preludes, like Bach" as if he did not know that Bach's 
Preludes are introductions to fugues. What sense would there be in 
writing two of Chopin's type of Prelude in each key? 

An unfailing feature of fabrications of this kind are the prophecies 
in which they abound. In the present case there are forecasts of Schu- 
mann's ending in a mental-home in 1856, the eclipse of Mendelssohn 
as an outstanding composer, the discovery of the significance of Scar- 
latti, and so forth. A most remarkable aspect of the whole affair has been 
the attitude of certain people to what is commonly known as "the 
burden of proof". When something so extraordinary as Mme Czer- 
nicka's typescript is brought forward the common sense of the world 
demands: "What proof do you offer that this material is genuine?" 
But since Mme Czernicka committed suicide without producing a trace 
of the originals she is supposed to have copied, the "advocates" of her 
papers have fallen back on the cry: "Someone must prove first of all 
that the papers are not genuine." It has even been suggested that if one 
only has the patience to alter names, dates and other awkward details 
the whole thing can be made to come true I 

At this point it is proper to communicate to the reader the results, so 
far as they are known at the time of writing, of the conference of Polish 
musicologists and linguistic experts which was called by the Chopin 

385 



Institute of Warsaw to consider all the available evidence and to hear 
learned opinion on the subject of these Potocka Letters. The general 
conclusions of the conference may be gathered from these extracts 
from a letter sent by its President to the present writer: 

"I authorise you to communicate the contents of this letter to whom- 
soever you consider should be enlightened. 

"The Letters are spurious. To the arguments already formulated have 
been added new ones, which are quite simply a revelation. In the papers 
left behind by Mme Czernicka were found further 'exercises' com- 
posed by her in the form of one hundred and four fragments of 
'Chopin letters'. Of these only a certain number are covered by the 
letters hitherto produced. It was evidently the lady's plan to proceed 
with a far more extensive publication; she had already picked out those 
fragments which she considered most 'successful'. We are at this 
moment negotiating the acquisition for the Chopin Institute of the 
ledger in which numerous fragments were written by Mme Czernicka 
in different coloured inks. It was further shown that she had engaged 
in musicological studies in France; that at her place of residence near 
Wilno she had something in the nature of a 'Chopin Chapel'; that she 
had at her disposal a considerable library; and that some of her letters' 
are simply taken from Kleczynski, Hoesick and others; also that her 
suicide [in 1949] was connected with the day of the hundredth anni- 
versary of Chopin's death. There was some psychopathic identification 
of herself with Chopin which led her to write 'letters' and to put into 
those letters her own thoughts and imaginings. 

"Further: the philological analysis showed that the characteristic 
linguistic features of Chopin's letters are repeated in the spurious ones, 
but a hundred per cent more frequently. Evidently Mme Czernicka 
"added plenty of salt", wishing to give a flavour of authenticity. 
Again : expressions are found which were not used in the Polish language 
in the years 1830-40 [examples are given]. In the spurious texts are 
found certain vulgar expressions which appeared in Polish only after 
the first World War. Philological evidence places the date of the fabri- 
cation between 1926 and 1945. 

"It was revealed that Mme Czernicka had already shown these 
letters' to Prof. Szpinalski in 1941. She deceived him, promising to 
show him the originals, which she never did. 

* 'There were two branches of the Komar family : (i) one with the coat 
of arms called Korczak, to which Delfina Potocka belonged; (2) an 
untitled branch, with which Mme Czernicka had some relationship. 
She could never have had access to any papers left by Delfina Potocka. 

386 



Finally, no such letters' ever existed, for Deifina handed over during 
her own lifetime all correspondence in her possession to Mme Alexandrina 
Tyszkiewicz, and the latter declared that there were no letters of 
Chopin. Prof. Gomulicki presented a whole series of proofs, but I 
have not room for them in this letter. Within the next few months a 
complete report of the conference will appear." 

As a concluding commentary on the impulses which led to the 
writing of these texts the following declaration made to the writer by 
an educated Polish lady may be quoted: 

"During the first Chopin Festival at Duszniki [in 1946], at the recital 
given by Professor S., I sat next to Mme P. Czernicka, and at a certain 
moment I observed that she was unnaturally excited red in the face, 
with drops of sweat on her brow, her eyes wild, and half unconscious. 
Everything gave the impression of some sexual experience. It was all 
so unusual that I have never forgotten it. Immediately after the concert 
I called my husband's attention to it." 

That statement was made two years before the Chopin Institute 
decided to call the conference a summary of whose results has been 
given.
