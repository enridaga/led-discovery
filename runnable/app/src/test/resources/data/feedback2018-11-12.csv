INTRODUCTION 


Of the life of Herman Melville few facts are known, 
and his biographers have been driven to the building of 
whatever structure they chose to erect largely out of the 
bricks of conjecture. Melville wrote ten novels and a vol- 
ume of short stories, all save two or three of which are 
biographical or at least reminiscent. His descriptive and his 
lyrical poems are, of course, a transmutation of experience. But the author who makes of his biography a fiction or a 
poem draws an impenetrable veil about himself, for, although 
the author is the only reality in the novel or the poem, what 
he might have been is so inextricably interwoven into what 
he actually was, what he might have done is so mingled 
with what he actually did that one can never hope to dis- 
tinguish with certitude fact from fiction."

seas of life, — all this to explain, would be to dive deeper 
than Ishraael can go.” The heightening in this book, the gradual intensification 
of the emotional element, is very skillfully done. From the 
first mention of Ahab before he appears in person he excites 
our wonder, and, as we see him working inexorably and 
ruthlessly toward his end like a force in nature, our wonder 
grows; very skillfully too is the gradual, casual revelation 
of the majestic power and unparalleled ferocity of Moby 
Dick; so that, when, in the hundred pages of breathless 
narrative with which this book concludes, the reader comes 
to the final combat between Ahab and Moby Dick he knows 
that he is witnessing as momentous a struggle as history ever 
recorded or poetry ever dreamed."
