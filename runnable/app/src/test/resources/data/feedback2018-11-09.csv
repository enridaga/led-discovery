and to sing music , and though 1 was of very tender 
years when little children arc wont to be pleased 
with a whistle and such-hke playchmgs, 1 had a 
particular dislike to it, so that only from obedience 
did I ever play or sing. In those days my father 
made wonderful organs with wooden pipes, and 
spinets the best and flnest that had ever been seen, as

and showed a wonderful talent in inventing instru-

ivory. But when he had fallen in love with her who 
became my mother---and perhaps the little flute 
played some part in that, for he gave more time to it 
than he should — he was asked by the fifers of the 
Signory to play with them."

chanced to see in the middle of the most ardent 
flames a little creature like a lizard disporting itself 
in the midst of the iiitensest heat. Suddenl\ aware 
of what It was, he called my sister and me and 
pointed it out to us children. Then he gave me a 
sound box on the ears, which made me cry bitterly, 
on which he soothed me with kind Words, saving, 
*^My dear little fellow, I did not hurt you for any 
harm you had done, but only that you might re- 
member that the lizard in the fire there is a salamander,
