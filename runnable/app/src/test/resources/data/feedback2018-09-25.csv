INTRODUCTION 


Of the life of Herman Melville few facts are known, 
and his biographers have been driven to the building of 
whatever structure they chose to erect largely out of the 
bricks of conjecture. Melville wrote ten novels and a vol- 
ume of short stories, all save two or three of which are 
biographical or at least reminiscent. His descriptive and his 
lyrical poems are, of course, a transmutation of experience. But the author who makes of his biography a fiction or a 
poem draws an impenetrable veil about himself, for, although 
the author is the only reality in the novel or the poem, what 
he might have been is so inextricably interwoven into what 
he actually was, what he might have done is so mingled 
with what he actually did that one can never hope to dis- 
tinguish with certitude fact from fiction."
