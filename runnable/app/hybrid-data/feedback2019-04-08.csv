It is interesting to recall the impressions which they 
ruade on their arrivalo White had visited Shrewsbury 
before ; he came with experience of teaching at King's 
College Choir School and afterwards at Marlborough 
College, and with a reputation as a singer and violin- 
player: a reputation which was entirely justified by his 
performances. At first he made no very distinct impres- 
sion, probably because of his shyness, and he did not seem 
at once to tale very kindlyto Shrewsbur : he was constantly 
recalling witt regret the rime he had spent at Marlborough,

to him the object of reverence which it remained until the

true worth, partly owing to his shyness and partl), owing 
to his modesty ; the latter quality remained to the end as 
one of his most striking characteristics ; it was so perfectly 
genuine. He was an excellent violinist, and he must have

his enthusiasm was extraordinary. Few meals passed without 
his explaining exactly what he had been teaching and how 
and who had done well and who badly ; this soon became 
a source of amusement, in which he fully shared. Another tact that is worth mentioning is the way in 
which a remarkable friendship grew up between these two 
men. It was not entirely due to common interests in 
lire or a similar outlook; it seems rather to have grown 
gradually, each man finding that the tastes of the other 
interested him and were worth acquiring. For instance,

heard of a Duke of Montmorency in the reign of 
Louis XV., who was married to a lady of ancient 
family and great beauty ; but, like many nobles of 
that time, he was not quite a model of what 
husbands ought to be, and lived a very riotous and 
improper life. He even went so far as to appear 
in public with the celebrated dancer, Mademoiselle 
Guimard, about whom all the young men of the 
day were raving. One night, on the Duchess enter- 
ing her box at the opera with several friends, she 
beheld, to her horror and amazement, the Duke, her 
husband, seated at the back of the pit box in which 
the charming dancer displayed her charms. What- 
ever might be done in private, in those days a 
certain decorum was preserved in public, and the 
appearance of the Duke in Guimard's box was 
an outrage which the Duchess could not endure. She sent one of the gentlemen who were with her 
to request her husband's immediate presence, and 
thus addressed the astonished culprit : '• I have 
always been a devoted and faithful wife ; but let 



Ouvrard, the Financier."

was one which, once beheld, could never be forgotten ; 
the perfect oval of the contour, the small regular 
features, fine brow, and dark flashing eyes were in 
perfect harmony. Though she had the Spanish 
defect of a too long corsage, and a somewhat 
thick waist, yet her bust and arms were faultless. And she was not only surpassingly beautiful, but 
possessed a voice equal to those of any of the first- 
rate singers who have appeared upon the stage. She could sing with Malibran, Grisi, Rubini, and 
Tamburini, without appearing out of place. In her 
latter years what once had been so great a charm 
became the terror of her friends ; for she did not 
feel her declining powers, and her voice, which had 
become uncertain, and even hoarse, sounded in her 
own ears as mellow and enchanting; as ever."

repine at our fate, and abandon ourselves to despair; when, in the
midst of our murmuring, the captain all at once cried out 'A sail! a
sail! a sail!' This gladdening sound was like a reprieve to a
convict, and we all instantly turned to look at it; but in a little
time some of us began to be afraid it was not a sail. However, at a
venture, we embarked and steered after it; and, in half an hour, to
our unspeakable joy, we plainly saw that it was a vessel."
