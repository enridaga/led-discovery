"?Another Sunday recollection is that of a Sunday morning gathering in a humble kitchen. Larry [a crippled shoemaker] made his appearance every Sunday morning, as regular as clockwork, with a copy of the """"Northern Star"""", damp from the press, for the purpose of having some member of our household read out to him and others """"Fergus?s Letter"""". The paper was first to be dried before the fire, and then carefully and evenly cut, so as not to damage a single line of the almost sacred publication. This done, Larry, placidly smoking his ? pipe, ? settled himself to listen with all the rapture of a devotee in a tabernacle to the message of the great Fergus, watching and now and again turning the little joint as it hung and twirled before the kitchen fire, and interjecting occasional chuckles of approval as some particularly emphatic sentiment was read aloud.?"
