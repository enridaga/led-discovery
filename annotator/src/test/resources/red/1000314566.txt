"There is a novel, """"Uncle Tom's Cabin"""", which I should not omit to mention, since it made a great sensation when it appeared, and it was the only book of its class brought home by my father. """"Uncle Tom"""" was read aloud in our little family circle, and it gave us many hours of happy, thrilling and not unwholesome excitement.'"
