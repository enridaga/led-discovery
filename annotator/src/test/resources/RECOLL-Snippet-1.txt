He was of fairly good musical 
reputation and an experienced man in all mu- 
sical routine, Signor Salvi was one of the 
best tenor singers living ; Signor Belletti was 
a very fine baritone ; and Otto Goldschmidt 
was a brilliant pianist, who was afterward mar- 
ried to Jenny Lind. There was always a grand 
orchestra. 

Jenny Lind's repertoire during her Ameri- 
can tour was the " Casta Diva," from Norma; 
" With Verdure Clad " and " On Mighty Pens," 
from the Creation; a cavatina from Beatrice 
de Tenday by Bellini ; the great song with two 
flutes from the Star of the North, by Meyer- 
beer ; and " Non mi Dfr," from Don Giovanni^ 
by Mozart. She also sang in the trio from 
// Barbier, and, with Belletti, the duo from 
LElisire d^Amare, and a great variety of 
the Swedish folk-songs. With the latter she 
nearly always ended her concerts.
