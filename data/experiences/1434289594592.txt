Musical Evening. at 8.0. Besides ourselves 3 Colemans, Mrs. & John Nicholson Mr & Mrs Back (who both sing) Mr & Mrs. Owles. Mrs & Miss Phillips. 2 Miss Boyds. 2 Miss Astles (Miss Ethel plays). Miss Banks. Miss Goldsmith. Sing a lot of Part Songs including my variations* - quite good! I play Ravel "Jeux d'eau" & Debussy "Reflets" & Franck Symp. Variations. Mum sings Ireland "12 Oxen" & Armstrong Gibbs "to one who passed Whistling". Quite a success. They go about 11.45.
