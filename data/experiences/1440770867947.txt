<p>Then on to the BBC to hear Oedipus Rex by and conducted by Stravinsky.&nbsp; A great deal of the choral writing was almost pure Taverner, the construction that of an early passion.&nbsp; It is really impressive, it sounds old and cold, a chilly shadow that has never lifted from man's mind....I have been more pleased with Oedipus than with any of the recent Stravinsky I have heard.&nbsp; It is quite dislocated at last, miles beyond <em>Les Noces; </em>and it<em> is </em>so old and cold<em>.</em></p>
