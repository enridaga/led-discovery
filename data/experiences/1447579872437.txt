<p>After a week or two of hard work our anniversary, the 25th, was celebrated. The part that we could control was about all I could ask. The boys spoke well. The singing was excellent. The attendance was 12 to 1500. The weather was very cool. The behavior was very noisy and as usual few could hear. I fear I will have to give up these anniversaries. They have succeeded too successfully.</p>
