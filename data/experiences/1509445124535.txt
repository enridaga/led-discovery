His interpretation of the Mendelssohn Concerto came to German ears like something of a revelation, creating a veritable furore, and indeed I doubt if in lusciousness of tone, crystalline clearness of execution, refinement, and grace that performance has been or ever will be surpassed. Alone the way he took that little A natural, the fifth note of the Andante theme, without letting the string touch the fingerboard&mdash;&ldquo;sur le touche&rdquo; I think is the technical term for it&mdash;gave one a thrill of artistic joy never to be forgotten.</span></p>
