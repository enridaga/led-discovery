Last Monday the Dean and I went to the rehearsal of the Messiah, for the relief of poor debtors; it was very well performed, and I much delighted. You know how much I delight in music, and that piece is very charming; but I had not courage to go to the performance at night, the weather was so excessively bad, and I thought it would be hazardous to come out of so great crowd so far, that is my kind guardian thought so for me.
