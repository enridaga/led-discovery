Jenny Lind retired in earnest, not, it is true, from the exercise of her profession, but from the theatrical boards, and this in the very zenith of her powers. Never perhaps during the whole of her career was there an occasion on which she bore away so great a triumph as when she appeared in the true sphere of her vocation for the last time This was a night of even unwonted sympathy and enthusiasm &mdash; a night of applause that seemed to know no bounds &mdash; a night of recalls, and again recalls, and one more last recall, as though the public could not part from her, or bear the thought of never looking upon her again. And so, with such heartfelt adieux, was Jenny Lind finally lost to the stage.</span></p>
