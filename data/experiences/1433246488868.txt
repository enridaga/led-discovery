In the May following the royal wedding the Czar came over to visit Her Majesty, and during his stay in England a grand performance was given at the Crystal Palace in his honour, by the London contingent of the Handel Festival Choir, and ten military bands, under the direction of Mr. Auguste Manns. After the Russian March and Hymn, and two or three other pieces, vocal and instrumental, Sir
George's "Festal March" was played in grand style by the united bands, to the thorough satisfaction of the composer, who was present.
