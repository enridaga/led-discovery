<p>Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Killerton: Tuesday 20th November, 1838 - Thursday we are to go to the Earl of Devon, at Powderham Castle, and assist in the evening at a christening. Saturday, Tom Acland and others will be here. Sunday, we go to Exeter for the morning service&mdash; it is hoped the Bishop will preach : the most ancient piece of music has been selected for the Anthem, for me to hear&mdash;in short, between the Member for the county and the Bishop of the diocese, I am well provided for. I was to have been present at a great school meeting on Tuesday, but have fought off that, as well as a dinner at the Bishop's&mdash;else it is a great delight to talk with a man of such eminent talent.</p>
