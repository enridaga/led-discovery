In our efforts to produce rounded musicians, we encourage trio playing, quartet playing and all kinds of chamber music, which indeed figures on the timetable as a subject in its own right. Consequently a quartet formed by pupils performed in 1970 at the festivals at Gstaad and Windsor and since then groups have twice visited the United States, on one occasion overwhelming faculty and students of the Julliard School and the Curtis Institute with their performances of Schönberg’s Verklärte Nacht. Indeed adult musicians could not have played it better; I can say this without conceit, for the credit for their preparation is not mind, but Peter Norris’s, who is in charge of chamber music.
