<p>I first came here with my mother and brother for the Festival of Britain when I was ten. Later I sang here with the Ernest Read schools choir events and I also started a life time of concert going here. I remember seeing Vaughan Williams when Malcolm Sargent conducted his last symphony. I can't wait for you to re-open!`</p>
