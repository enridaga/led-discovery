The director is called Polledro, the singers Madame Sandrini, Benelli, etc., etc. Their genuine Italian method and extraordinary power of spontaneous vocalization delighted me extremely, but I was so irritated with their constant ritardando at the finish of each melodious phrase, and the halts and draggings of the band, that I was obliged to brood over my bodily ills, and only got through the three acts by great effort. Myself and my pains I should completely have forgotten had I been present at a classical opera, classically performed. The orchestra, of which I had formed such great expectations, left much to be desired, notably the first horn-player. One passage in the andante of the overture could not be recognized.
