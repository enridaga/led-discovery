One of the choicest entertainments this season was the dramatised representation of Handel's 'Acis and Galatea', performed at Bochsa's conceit; the music allotted to the chief characters was admirably sung by Miss Paton and Braham; Zuccheli, with a gigantic eye in the middle of his forehead, was a very good Polyphemus. [...]  What else had we? Next in order after Handel's music, the Grave-scene from 'Romeo and Giulietta,' exquisitely sung in Italian, by Sontag and Malibran, and for a finale, that German trifle the 'Pastoral Symphony'.
