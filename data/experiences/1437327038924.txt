<pre>[In 1806], in conjunction with Attwood, I composed for Covent Garden, an <br />operatic play, called "Adrian and Orrila." Cooke played the part of the Prince <br />in it, and the very deuce he had liked to have played with it : for, on the <br />morning of the day on which the piece was to be performed, he came to rehearsal <br />so intoxicated, that he could scarcely stand. Both the author and myself were 
on the stage, alarmed, as may well be imagined, for the fate of a play, the <br />principal serious character of which, was to be performed by a man dead 
drunk. </pre>
