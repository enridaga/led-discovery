<p>I have had the honour of playing before Her Majesty Queen Victoria on three different occasions. On the first occasion I accompanied Madame Marie Roze at Balmoral in 1885. I drove with this artist from Ballater to the Castle, but it was too dark to see the beautiful scenery on Dee side. The Queen spoke to me in German and asked me whether I was related to the Conzertmeister Leopold and Moritz Ganz, who had played before her at Windsor many years before. I replied they were my uncles. On referring to my diary I find this happened on June 10th, 1856, twenty-nine years before ! I well remember taking my uncles down to Windsor and having great difficulty in finding rooms at an hotel, as it was Ascot week. I went with the mand the other artists to the Castle and listened to the concert in the next room. The Queen seemed pleased with Madame Roze's singing; I remember that the. Duke of Connaught was there, dressed in Highland dress, as were also some of the other men present, and I had to sign the Queen's visitors' book. The drawing-room in which the music took place was hung round with a number of en- gravings of the Royal Family, and the furniture was upholstered with Scotch plaid. Everything was very simple and unceremonious. When all was over, one of the gentlemen-in-waiting handed me, in the name of the Queen, a cat's-eye breast-pin set in diamonds, which could also be worn as a stud. Supper was then served to us, and we drove back to Ballater, a distance of eleven miles.</p>
