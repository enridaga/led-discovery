There was no city in Italy of its size, at the time I visited it, which could boast of so many good musical amateurs, vocal and instrumental, as Verona. Signor Barbella promised to take me to a concert, performed by one family only ; to my very great surprise he took me to gaol, and introduced me to the gaoler. We were shewn into an apartment elegantly furnished, and after we had taken our coffee and chasse, had really an excellent concert ; the performers were, the gaoler, who played the double bass ; his two eldest sons, first and second violin ; a third the violoncello ; his youngest son, the viola; one of his daughters presided at the harpsichord, and his two youngest daughters executed some airs and duets extremely well. They had good voices, and sang like true artists : the whole of this gifted family were amateurs ; the young men were in different trades, but had they been obliged to live by music, they could in my opinion have successfully adopted it as a profession in any part of Italy. They were all enthusiasts and excellent performers, and extremely courteous in their behaviour ; and I returned to my hotel, after having supped with them, much gratified by the pleasant evening I had passed, though it was in prison.
