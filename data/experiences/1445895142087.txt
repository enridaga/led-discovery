<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Jack studied him for a moment, and the sardonic lips twitched in amusement.&nbsp; He approached the French piano as though stalking a sitting hare (it was the colour of a hare), sat down, pulled the stool closer, and began to play the Chopin Prelude No. 17, which has an ominous bell-note in the bass.&nbsp; It came out on the instrument like the distant sound of a woodman&rsquo;s axe at the bole of a hollow tree.&nbsp; At each punctuation by these muffled bell-notes, a tiny wrinkling of the skin at the corner of Jack&rsquo;s eyes was to be observed.&nbsp; I, who could read that epidermal script, knew what the wincing meant.</p>
