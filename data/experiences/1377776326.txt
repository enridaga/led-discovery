When tea was over, I began to be uneasy at my father's not returning. Dr. King I saw looked displeased; but the politeness and liveliness of the Russian [M. Pogenpohl], who was too well bred to appear dissatisfied, soon dissipated my anxiety.... Music was now proposed, Mr. Pogenpohl had often heard Bach, of Berlin, and by his conversation shewed so fine a taste and so good a judgement of the art, that neither Susan nor I could be induced to touch a note.... We, however, persuaded Mr. Lattice to play, which he did, in a horrible old-fashioned style; insomuch that I did not dare to meet the Russian's eyes, I was so sure it must be ridiculous to him.
