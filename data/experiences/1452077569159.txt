<p>As in duty bound I had shown the song to the Principal. I felt as though I were laying bare the innermost recesses of my soul as I sang the words, into which, by the way, I put as little expression as possible, &ldquo;pour me donner une contenance,&rdquo; but either he was too busy listening to the music or he was too kind to chaff me about them. In spite of the dreadful sentimentality of the words - perhaps for that very reason - the song had an unqualified success. It was loudly encored, and both the singer and I stepped off the platform highly pleased with each other. I had never written anything the least like it. It belonged to the same category of songs as Sir Arthur Sullivan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Let me dream again&rdquo; and &ldquo;Once Again&rsquo;&rsquo; - two songs which one never hears now, but which had an immense vogue at the time they were written.</p>
