<p>7.30 p.m. Glorious chorus of 'Good-bye, Virginia' from room of officers' servants next door: it must be the young Davis (it was), who delighted me so enormously on Xmas Day at Houtkerque. I can't stop myself from wanting to listen. . . Very excellent indeed: it has made a great difference, thank you!</p>
