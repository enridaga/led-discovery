<p>I missed the Eisteddfod this year - but instead had a perfectly glorious fortnight of sunshine &amp; beauty in Norway. One evening - at Bergen - a dozen dancers &amp; singers in native costume came aboard &amp; gave us a genuine folk entertainment. Songs, dances, reels, to the accompaniment of a 7 stringed violin with a drone bass. The singing games of which they gave several examples were charming. Of course I&rsquo;ve no idea what they were all about &amp; had the hopeless task of trying to explain what I wanted at the music stores the following day. It was unfortunate that this entertainment should have been given on the last evening &amp; that we should be leaving before 10.30 - &amp; that gave me no time to hunt out what I wanted.&nbsp;</p>
