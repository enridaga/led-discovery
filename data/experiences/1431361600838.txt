I was one again on duty in the stage band when Kleiber conducted "Rigoletto". The first thing he did was to reseat the orchestra with the brass in the centre which he said was in the "Italian style". He was an absolute purist about everything that was sung: any attempt by Walter Midgley to soar up to an extra top note would be greeted with: "Is there a B flat there? Have you your score?"
