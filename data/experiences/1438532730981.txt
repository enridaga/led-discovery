Mascagni's third opera had <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>seen the light at Florence only in the previous <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>November. The book appeared to offer a promising combination, being written by the librettist <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of &ldquo;Cavalleria Rusticana&rdquo; and founded upon a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>novel, &ldquo;Les Deux Freres,'' by MM. Erckmann - Chatrian, the authors of &ldquo;L'Amico Fritz." Unfortunately, the material of the plot proved altogether inadequate for a four-act opera, while the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>love interest which so largely predominated in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;L'Amico Fritz'' was here subordinated to the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>events of a sordid quarrel between two wilful, ill-tempered brothers. Moreover, Mascagni treated <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the quarrel in an intensely tragic vein, which is <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>nowhere more strikingly exemplified than in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>long and elaborate finale to the first act. This <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>ambitious piece of writing I have described as <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>strong, rugged, original, and clever. &ldquo;Nevertheless, a big effort of the imagination is required to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>suppose an entire village so upset by a squabble <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>over a field as to stand in two sections in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>open piazza, shouting at each other for ten minutes by the clock!" Even a street row in Nuremberg, aroused by a matter of genuine public <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>interest, was depicted by Wagner in less time than <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>So, despite the presence and cooperation of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>genial young composer, &ldquo;I Rantzau&rdquo; was not a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>success. The principal parts were sung by Melba, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>De Lucia, Ancona, David Bispham, and Castelmary, and the opera was mounted in thoroughly <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>efficient style.</span></p>
