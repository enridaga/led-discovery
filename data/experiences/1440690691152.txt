<p>Yesterday morning we went to the rehearsal of the "Messiah", it was very tolerably performed.&nbsp; I was a little afraid of it, as I think the music <em>very affecting</em>, and I found it so - but I am glad I went, as I felt great comfort from it, and I had the good fortune to have Mrs. Bernard sit by me, the Primate's sister, a most worthy sensible woman, of an exalted mind; it adds greatly to the satisfaction of such an entertainment to be seated by those who have the same relish for it we have ourselves.</p>
