At four we had the tennis party, which, like a snowball, grows as the weeks roll by, becoming by degrees almost a garden party; and then came a big dinner for eighty-six people in the Marble Hall, and after that an evening party…. We had asked some of the native society to this party, and a selection of the European, principally people who don't dance, and who are therefore more difficult to entertain. It was a very pretty party, and the presence of so many strangers made it interesting…. I had a little music, a few songs, and a quartette or two, to which nobody listened, but which gave some point to the entertainment.
