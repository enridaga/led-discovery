<p>On the 15th of October, 1884, a jubilee celebration&nbsp;took place in Vienna at the Wieden Theatre, to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the day upon which&nbsp;Johann Strauss, the "Walzerkoenig," made his first&nbsp;public appearance in the character of an orchestral conductor. The stalls, boxes, and pit were crowded with&nbsp;the elite of Viennese society, fashionable, artistic, and&nbsp;literary...fill[ing] all the "numbered''&nbsp;seats at the Wieden...&nbsp;whilst the galleries were thronged almost to suffocation by Strauss's most enthusiastic admirers &mdash; the true&nbsp;bom Viennese of the lower middle classes. Archduke&nbsp;William &mdash; who, being Grand Master of the Order of St.&nbsp;John, seldom shows himself in a theatre &mdash; occupied the&nbsp;Imperial Box, whilst King Milan of Servia sate out the&nbsp;whole performance in a ground-tier stage box, signifying&nbsp;his admiration for the <em>b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire's</em> talents and achievements by conferring upon him, towards the close of the&nbsp;evening, the Cross of the Takovo Order. The progranmie of the occasion consisted of selections from&nbsp;Strauss's operas, conducted by himself. His desk was&nbsp;converted for the nonce into a gorgeous flower-bed of the&nbsp;costliest exotics; and his appearance thereat, baton in&nbsp;hand, was the signal for a demonstration of affectionate&nbsp;rejoicing on the part of the audience, such as, according&nbsp;to the leading journals of the Kaiserstadt, has never&nbsp;before been witnessed within the walls of a Vienna&nbsp;theatre. He opened the entertainment with his bright&nbsp;little overture to <em>Indigo</em> &mdash; his first opera, produced at the&nbsp;Wieden Theatre about twenty years ago &mdash; which was&nbsp;rapturously re-demanded. Then came the first act of <em>A&nbsp;Night in Venice</em>, followed by the immortal <em>Schoene blaue&nbsp;Donau</em> during the entr'acte, which inimitable waltz&nbsp;brought down a shower of laurel wreaths upon its composer's head. The second act of <em>Fledermaus</em> with some&nbsp;additions to the dialogue written especially for the&nbsp;occasion, came next, and was succeeded by "musical&nbsp;episodes " from <em>Spitzentuch, Methusalem, Cagliostro, Der Lustige Krieg</em> and the <em>Carnival in Rome,</em>&nbsp;each successive&nbsp;number being supplemented by presentations of addresses,&nbsp;medals, and flowers.&nbsp;</p>
