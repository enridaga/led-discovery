After dinner I go to Lemare-MacN. concert no.2. at Ballet club. Desperately dull. Quartets by Locke, Gordon Jacob (not even competent, I feel) & Phant. of Helen Perkin (the best of the programme, in spots amusing but never really felt. Among these Muriel Herbert (acc. by Alannah Delias for whom I turn over) sings some of her impossible songs, & one each of Betty Lutyens & E. Maconchy.
