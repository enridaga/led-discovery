Write until 11.0, practise till 12. & then go to College to find that Benjamin will teach me tomorrow instead. Practise in afternoon. Go to Augenerâ€™s for M.S. paper, & to Hills for gut for my broken viola, after tea. Go to a recital of D.F. Tovey & Adila Fachiri (tickets from Hills via Miss Atkinson). Beethoven Kreutzer & op 96, & Brahms D min Sonatas. No. 1 played with fire, & spirit, but rather inaccurate. No 2. with right lucid touch, for this delicious idyll. Players well matched in last; fine interpretation, if rather rough. Mr. Summers goes with me.
