<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">Both these unrivalled and inimitable productions [&lsquo;Worthy is the Lamb&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hallelujah&rsquo;], and indeed all the other chorusses, some of them yielding but little to these in grandeur, were extremely well performed; and on this department, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">on this day</em>, the highest praise may be bestowed.</p>
