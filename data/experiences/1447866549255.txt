<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">October 26th 1957 - &nbsp; Our wedding day. After the reception we travelled to London later on in the afternoon to a concert at the Royal Festival Hall that evening. Otto Klemperer conducting Beethoven Symphony No 3. That was the start of our honeymoon (3 days)! and also the start of our wonderful concert visits to the Royal Festival Hall.&nbsp;</p>
