Such a curious Fantasia I heard today. It was a miserably weak commentary on the motto it bore, 'Emotion is only fit for women, man's spirit should strike fire.' Mighty Beethoven! thou couldst make women weep and inspire men, but thy imitators are more diseased in mind than ever deafness made thee! - that Fantasia in three movements, E flat minor, A major, and E flat minor, with twenty-three other keys besides, stormed and whined, and any glimmering of spirit, depth, or poetry, was diluted in the length and monotony, the hopeless want of form and evenness of construction. I don't think the young composer answerable for this; he has talent and judgment enough to do something much better in time. Why not show him, in charity, his faults, and tell him to wait patiently for the ripening of his gifts?
