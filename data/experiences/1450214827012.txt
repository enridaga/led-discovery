<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">At the age of seven or eight, I was taken to see <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Sleeping Beauty</em>. (I realize now that I was older than this when I saw the opera <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">A Life for the Tsar</em>.) I was enchanted by the ballet, but had been prepared for what I saw, ballet being of the utmost importance in our culture and a familiar subject to me from my earliest childhood. I was able to identify the dance positions and steps, and I knew the plot and the music long in advance. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Moreover, Marius Petipa, the choreographer, was a friend of my father, and I had seen him several times myself. Of the performance, I remember only my musical impressions, and perhaps those are really my parents&rsquo; impressions, repeated to me afterward. But I do know that I was excited by the dance, and that I applauded it with all my strength. If I could transport myself back to that night seventy years ago, I would do so primarily to satisfy my curiosity about the musical tempi, for I am always interested in tempos in other periods. </span></p>
