The 1966 World Festival of Negro Arts in Dakar, Senegal, is a really great accomplishment. Every field of art is represented… Never before or since has the Black Artist been so magnificently represented and displayed...

 And every night, on the balcony of the ninth floor of the Engar Hotel, I sit and listen to the sea singing her songs of the historic past on the island from which the slaves were shipped. Farther in the distance, I can hear the tribes that have gathered on another island to rehearse for their show next day. And then sometimes I wondered whether it was really a rehearsal, or was it a soul brothers' ceremonial gathering with all of its mystical authenticity. Anyway, I wish I could have seen or recorded it. Too much, baby! Full distance…

Papa Tall is considered the best artist in Senegal, and he is also the head man at the tapestry factory. Although he studied in Paris, it is impossible to miss the feeling of Old Africa in each and every stroke of his work. I have about eight of his works, and want to buy another, but he won't let me have it. "It isn't finished," he says. He is adamant about it, no matter how much I say I love it just as it is. Later in the year, he sends it to me--and I still love it!
