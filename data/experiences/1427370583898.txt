My whole family could sing. Vi had a sweet, soft voice. Ching's was bell-like and resonant, Louise's rich and warm. One of the first pieces I remember Vi singing was "I Don't Want to Play in Your Yard." Ching's favorites were "There'll Come a Time" and "Volunteer Organist." 

But in the beginning it was always the story told in the song that enchanted me. I'd ask one of them, "Tell me a story," when I was little, and they'd sing it.
