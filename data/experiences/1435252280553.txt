<p>I had to go to Church Parade this morning at 9.20. It was good having the free use of one's lungs in the hymns; the men make a terrific noise. We had the band to play us there and back with musical comedy and the regimental march, a splendid thing, which I've known for a long time. The band is quite good. It's glorious weather here, and I am sunburnt and fit.</p>
