<p>I was working at the time with Hans Sitt at orchestration and was working at an orchestral suite, which I called "Florida", and it was arranged that it should be played at a rehearsal of a military orchestra in the coming spring. Sitt had arranged for an orchestra of about 60 to give me a 2 hour rehearsal in the Rosental Restaurant and all it would cost me would be a barrel of beer for the orchestra. This accordingly took place one spring morning, the audience being Grieg and Mrs Grieg, Sinding and myself, Sitt conducting. In the Suite was a very noisy nigger dance where I had used the trombones very noisily and <strong><em>ff</em></strong><em></em>, and Grieg after the performance said to me that he found it "scheusslich interessant".</p>
