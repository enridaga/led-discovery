<p>We [Sam Myers and Elmore James] had some good times together, in and out of the studio. Elmore recorded "Dust My Broom" over a dozen times with different labels. He really had an identifying thing with his slide guitar, though. A lot of guys played slide, but the minute that he put that slide on his finger and ran it across those strings, you would know it was him doing it. We used to play a lot out at one of Percy Simpson's clubs in Jackson, Mr. P's. It wasn't a really big club, but it was nice-sized. They had gambling facilities in the back, and guys would come there just to gamble. While they would gamble, their lady friends would stay up front and listen to the music. Boy, there was a lot of gamblers who lost their women up in there! Lost their money and their women.</p>
