<p>[L]ast Saturday morning [28 November] mine Fader sent a present of his History to Pachierotti, - by way of an incentive to the study of the English Language. At the Opera, at night, - he promised to call here on Sunday. And <em>so</em> - on Sunday morning he came, - attended by Signor Bertoni.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>[H]e promised to come hither <em>frequently</em>, to take Lessons of Conversation: By way of beginning with <em>vigour</em>, he settled to Drink Tea here the next Day [30 November].</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>They came early, - and I am more pleased with Pacchierotti than ever; he seems to be perfectly amiable, gentle and <em>good</em>: his Countenance is extremely benevolent; and his manners, infinitely interesting...</p>
<p>He had a very bad Cold, - yet <em>sung</em>, - with the utmost good humour, as soon as asked. Bertoni accompanied him. He first sung a rondeau of Artaserse, -: it is a very fine one, and had it been a very execrable one, he would have made it exquisite: such taste, expression, freedom, fancy and variety never were before joined, but in Agujari. His Voice, however, was by no means <em>clear</em>, though extremely <em>touching</em>: but his Cold quite tormented him. He afterwards sung a song for a <em>Tenor</em> in the same Opera, - and admirably. Then some accompanied recitative to a song in the <em>Orfeo</em> of Bertoni: - and lastly the '<em>che far&ograve; senza Euridice.</em>'</p>
