Lesson at 2.40. Mummy arrives at 4.0 by bus from Lowestoft. Barbara comes to dinner Go with Mummy to B.B.C – Beethoven concert, conducted by Oskar Fried. Fidelio, 4th & 9th Symphonys. The first two were played beautifully. But Fried seemed to frighten the orchestra in the 9th. He altered scoring right and left. 1st movement, impressive, 2nd mov. too fast, the 3rd two slow. Last movement was notable for fine singing of Nat. Chorus & soloists. All considering it was rather a disappointing performance – of the conductor’s. He was raging all the way through the 9th – there is no reason why he should blame the whole orch & choir for the slips of the 4th Horn (Cb scale (3rd mov.) & Timpani (2nd mov.)
