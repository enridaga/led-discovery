Never have I seen Chopin so moved as at the last lesson. Karl played Chopin's Grand Concerto in E minor a piece which calls for both perfect technique and perfect interpretation. He concluded the first movement, played the Andante and then attacked the Finale with an execution so perfect, so intellectual, that I was amazed at the Master's silence and felt really vexed. I was ready to accuse him of mere capriciousness, when I realised my mistake - he was actually weeping and could not speak. He took my hand and uttered a single word: "Unbelievable" When he had recovered his composure he turned to Karl and said, "Very good, my boy. Some things are excellent, others are not so good," etc.
