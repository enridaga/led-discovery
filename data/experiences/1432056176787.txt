<p>In selecting the opera of Lionel and Clarissa for my first appearance [in London], I was guided in my choice by the circumstance of knowing all the songs, which, besides, were much in my style of singing. When the opera was produced, I sang all the original music, and introduced an Italian air of Sarti's, with English words, written for me by Mr. Richard Tickell, brother-in-law to Mr. Sheridan ; and a duet, written by the well-known Doctor Lawrence, the civilian. I composed the melody, and Stephen Storace put the instrumental parts to it. This duet was his first introduction to Drury Lane theatre. That eminent actor, King, who had been a friend of my father's in Dublin many years before, took a great deal of pains to instruct me in the dialogue of the part. To Mr. Linley I was also much indebted for his able tuition, and from all the performers I experienced the most kind and friendly attentions.</p>
