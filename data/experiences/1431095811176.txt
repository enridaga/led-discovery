My initiation into the ever-fascinating realm of Opera had an exciting result, as the handsome young timpanist, George Loveday (afterwards Toole's business-manager) beside whom I sat, realized during a performance of Norma. The Arch-Druid (Herr Zelger) was an exceptionally imposing man with a great voice and an appropriately large stomach. His appearance in flowing white robes, when slowly stalking forwards to the footlights, proved too awe-inspiring for a child's nerves, and I slid down between the kettledrums for safety. In that ignominious position I remained until a convenient moment arrived when I could be restored to my seat and senses by the drummer, to a gentle accompaniment of titters from the members of the orchestra.
