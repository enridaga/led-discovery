Sometimes I visited the cabaret where Garreta played. It was a third-rate cabaret, noisy and smoke-filled with a tawdry atmosphere. I never wanted to go there â€“ it made me feel like weeping to see that wonderful artist playing in such a place. When not at the cabaret, he could always be found composing in the nearby, shabbily furnished room where he lived. What music poured out of that little man!
