<p>Why is life so tragic; so like a little strip of pavement over an abyss.&nbsp; I look down; I feel giddy; I wonder how I am ever to walk to the end. But why do I feel this? Now that I say it I don't feel it. The fire burns; we are going to hear the Beggar's Opera.&nbsp; Only it lies about me; I can't keep my eyes shut.&nbsp; It's a feeling of impotence: of cutting no ice.</p>
