<p>Listened with JH and Donald Collup to Argento's&nbsp;<em>The Water Bird Talk</em>, and hour-long solo turn by Collup himself. Argento's language by its nature demands tunefulness, for me he is harmonically sparse and tonal (if instrumentally rich). But do I remember a thing about his music form year to year? He is afraid to take a chance, a chance with a tune perhaps for fear the tune will prove tacky.</p>
