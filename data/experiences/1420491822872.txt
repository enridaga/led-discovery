His last appearances in London (in 1977 on his ninetieth birthday and the following day) were memorable occasions. None of us thought he would make it, because at two of the rehearsals during that week he had to be carried out in a state of collapse due to extreme exhaustion; but he came back bright and early the following day in each case, having apparently been revived by acupuncture. The concert was being recorded for an album, and in case of any mishap it could be cross-cut with the performance to be given the next day. One such disaster occurred in Debussy's L'Apr√®s Midi d'un Faune with a bubble of water in a clarinet pad. Stokowski showed no sign of having heard it; but the next night he sprang suddenly to life at that very bar, watching and listening intently until he was sure the mistake was well covered, after which he relaxed. (It is a pity that the engineers did not seem to be so wide awake, because that bubble is clearly audible on the finished record - o was there another reason? Stokowski was always very much in charge of all editing sessions! Perhaps he just liked it.)
