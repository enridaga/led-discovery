<p>Thalberg plays famously but he is not my man; he is younger than I, popular with the ladies, writes Pot-pourris on themes from <em>Masaniello</em>, produces piano with the pedal instead of with the hand, takes tenths as easily as I do octaves and wears diamond shirt-studs. Moscheles does not impress him so it's not surprising that he liked only the <em>tuttis</em> of my concertos. He too writes concertos.</p>
