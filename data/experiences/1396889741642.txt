The orderlies of this unit are chiefly Irish and we shall have a glorious time with them today - Saint Patrick's Day. They started by marching down to parade WITH A BAND! And such a band! Whistles and drums playing Irish airs - and at 2 p.m. there is to be a football match, England v Ireland. After that we will draw a veil!

... When the fishermen heard our Irish band it was too much for them and they ran to see what the excitement was all about....

... The football match ended in a win for us - England 2 - Ireland 1. Patients who were able were allowed to attend the match and 12 Irish men in their hospital blues, their faces blacked and in gay turbans, got up such a wonderful band of whistles and drums and led them off. Such a procession of the maimed, the sick, the halt, the blind and men in wheelchairs you never saw.
