<pre>It was in St. Andrew's Hall, also, that I was vouchsafed as a boy the privilege <br />of hearing, on a solitary occasion only, one of the greatest artists the world <br />has ever possessed. I refer to Jenny Lind. The close association which existed <br />between that gifted and noble woman and the city of Norwich is a matter of <br />common knowledge. A bishop of Norwich (Dr. Stanley) it was who persuaded the <br />first of the "Swedish Nightingales" to abandon, on religious grounds, the <br />operatic stage; which premature and much-regretted event occurred in 1849. But <br />the famous singer frequently visited Norwich, and more than once she appeared 
at concerts given on behalf of the funds of the Jenny Lind Infirmary for <br />Children, an institution founded by her and still flourishing in the old city. 

At one of these concerts, some time during the middle "sixties," I heard Jenny <br />Lind sing. The voice, I remember perfectly, was as exquisitely clear and fresh <br />as a young girl's; its sweet tones haunted me long afterward. Of the wondrous <br />art of the great singer I was too young to judge; but I shall never forget what <br />she sang, or the rare wealth of religious sentiment with which she invested the <br />prayer of <em>Agathe</em> in the favorite <em>scena</em> from "Der Freisch&uuml;tz." Upon the stage, <br />of course, the heroine of Weber's opera always kneels while uttering her <br />touching appeal for her lover's safe return, and Jenny Lind also knelt while <br />singing the same passage upon the platform of St. Andrew's Hall on the occasion<br />I am alluding to.</pre>
