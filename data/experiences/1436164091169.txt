<p>The late Duchess of Cambridge and her daughter, the Princess Mary of Cambridge (the late Duchess of Teck) used often to dine at Orleans House. Princess Mary joined in the music, singing various songs, one of which I remember distinctly was Marras's "S'io fosse un Angelo" and also Mendelssohn's duets in the original German, with the Duchesse d'Aumale. I always accompanied them on these occasions.</p>
