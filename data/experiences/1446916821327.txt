<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">We flew down from Scotland for a wonderful weekend in London.&nbsp; We visited the Royal Opera House, went on the London Eye, had a great meal and ended up at the Rene Flemming concert.&nbsp; What an artist, a voice that is as good live as it is on DVD.&nbsp; I shall never forget her Strauss.&nbsp; A wonderful evening to end a special weekend.</p>
