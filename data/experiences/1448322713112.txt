<p>The society have no entire building for the purpose of worship, and meet in an &ldquo;upper chamber,&rdquo; in a large building near the St. Thomas church. They have here a very commodious chapel, neatly finished, capable of seating, perhaps, five hundred persons. The whole congregation yesterday did not number more than one hundred and fifty persons. The form of worship does not differ essentially from the Lutheran church; yet there is a space in the service left for extemporary prayer. There is no choir,' but the singing is lead by five or six boys, who sing at the top of their voices the principal melody; tune or pitch being as true as the organ-pipe. The organ was played quite loud throughout all the hymns; so that the boys and the organ together quite filled the small place with sound, and constituted a ground or foundation upon which any one of the congregation might rest his voice with perfect security. One might sing under such circumstances without the danger of deviation from pitch or tune, or of being frightened, or of fearing he might frighten others by the sound of his own voice.</p>
