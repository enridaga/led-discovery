By the advice of some kind friends I relinquished my intention of giving my Oratorio at my own expense, as I had projected doing in a second Concert; since the great expenditure which a large Orchestra and a numerous Chorus would have superadded to that of a usual Concert, forbade the hope to realise any profit from the undertaking. Yet as I was very desirous to have this work heard in Vienna, for I still considered it to be one of the grandest of its kind, I offered to perform it for the benefit of the “Widow’s and Orphan’s Society” on the condition only, that for its production, the society would provide a well appointed orchestra supported by the most distinguished Singers and Instrumentalists in Vienna. This condition was accepted, and fully carried out by the society, which provided a personel of three hundred assistants from among the best artists in the city. The work was carefully studied in two grand rehearsals, and on its production, was better performed than I had yet heard it. I became anew enraptured with my creation, and with me several of the assistant Muicians, among whom more especially Herr Clement the Director of the Orchestra of the “Theatre an der Wien”. 

He, had so thoroughly imbibed the spirit and substance of the work, that the day after its performance he was enabled to play to me on the Piano several entire parts, note for note, with all the harmonies and orchestral figures, without ever having seen the score. But Clement possessed a musical memory such perhaps as no other artiste ever possessed.
