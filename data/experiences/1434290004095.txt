Letter from Bunsen to his wife, 77 Marina, St. Leonard's: 12th May, 1854-
I arrived here prosperously, and was received at the station by Emily and a servant, to my great refreshment. I came on foot hither, where the excellent master of the house met me, followed by Mrs. Wagner, with the hearty kindness peculiar to himselfâ€”he having been cured of an indisposition, and called out of bed by yesterday's successful election of Mr. North. After the ' substantial tea,' the two good girls played Beethoven and other things, and then I went (quite well) to bed, and rose early this morning. Before six I was writing at my ' Conclusion ' for the press, which I hope to finish before noon.
