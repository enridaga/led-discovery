<p>Vladimir de Pachmann has of late been so frequently&nbsp;heard in English concert-rooms and salons, and, during&nbsp;the past season, has achieved so unequivocal a status&nbsp;here as a popular favourite, that I may confine my&nbsp;remarks upon his pianism within a very brief space.&nbsp;As an interpreter of Chopin he is probably unrivalled at&nbsp;the present time. Since the death of that composer no executant &mdash; except, perhaps, the inimitable Princess&nbsp;Czartoryska, who was taught by Chopin himself &mdash; has&nbsp;made the true meaning and sentiment of his works so&nbsp;vividly manifest to the public as his compatriot, M. de&nbsp;Pachmann...His&nbsp;r&eacute;pertoire is comprehensive, and he plays all manner of&nbsp;music with excellent taste, delicacy, and finish; but&nbsp;Chopin is distinctly his speciality. For endurance he is&nbsp;entitled to rank on an equal footing with Eubinstein and&nbsp;Joseffy &mdash; "les deux in&eacute;puisables,'' as Madame de&nbsp;Schleinitz once aptly styled them.</p>
