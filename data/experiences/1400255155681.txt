... I got up a concert for the company two or three days ago while we were in billets at Nieppe. I managed to borrow a piano, and the men sat in the open on forms. There were quite a lot of good singers to be found in the battalion, and it was a great success. I could not help thinking of the last occasion when I had done this sort of thing, as President of the Union Society at Uppingham. You would have been amused to see me on an improvised stage of planks singing a duet with a French girl to the strenuous accompaniment of a somewhat heavy handed corporal at the piano.
