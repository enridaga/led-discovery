At that time we had only two teachers of the harpsichord in Leicester, who both refused to give me lessons, supposing that I was intended for the musical profession. I was thus left to struggle on as well as I could; and through the kindness of Mr. Ludlam I was occasionally permitted to visit this noble instrument [the organ of the presbyterian meeting-house]. The first time we went to the church, the old philosopher, on sitting down, commenced with a preludio upon the diapasons; and, by way of exciting my imagination, said, “We shall have the men with their oboes here presently;—they are coming; I see them on the road.” Then, drawing the stop, cried, “Here they come!” After playing a while, the bassoon-men were announced in a similar way, and then the trumpeters; upon which he poured forth the full organ; and my imagination was not a little roused to guess how this phalanx had entered.
