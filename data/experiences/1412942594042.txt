    [W.H.] Lannigan from boyhood had only one ambition—to be a comic singer. He had a good voice. So keen was he on getting original songs that he made us all poets for his own purpose.
    But no song was useful to him unless it had a good chorus. He was a great favourite with the young folk. Wherever he was appearing, there in front of him were the youngsters.
   The public didn’t know, though we did, that Lannigan bought the tickets for them. They were called “Lannigan’s Choir.”
    When his audience seemed a bit blate, he would stop and say : “ Now then, let them see what Lannigan’s Choir can do.”
    I can hear them now with their high-pitched voices singing or shouting:
        “Oh, I’ve just cam’ tae the toun the day,
        For I want to buy some toys.
        I’ve dolls for all the lassies,
        An’ I’ve monkeys for the boys.
        An’ when they see me comin’ roun’,
        With joy their hearts will fill;
        For it’s only wunst a year they see 
        Their Uncle Will.”
