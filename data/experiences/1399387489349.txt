Dear Isolde,

I attended the concert last night which was my first time seeing the Philharmonia and I must say that it was by far my favorite concert since coming to London, if not the best I have attended in general. I could not stop smiling throughout the entire performance and for a long while afterwards.  I went because the Smetana is my favorite work, but I had never seen it live. I thought that Jakub Hrusa was phenomenal- such an exciting, charismatic, energetic and sensitive conductor and the orchestra responded so well to him. Everything was so passionately played. I have only heard a few things by Dvorak and am never moved by his music but last night's performance made me want to forget etiquette and jump up clapping after every movement. 

I have always enjoyed orchestral concerts but never before have I been so inspired by a performance. Many thanks to everyone involved with the Philharmonia and you now have a dedicated listener. I was glad to find out that you have student concessions on the night. I've only been to LPO concerts since I get their Â£4 student ticket offers but I will now endeavor to attend your concerts whenever possible and have already purchased a few recordings online following the performance.
Many thanks and congratulations on a fantastic performance last night.
All the best,
