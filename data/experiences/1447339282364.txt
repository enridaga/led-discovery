<p>I attended the opening concerts.&nbsp; One should have been conducted Toscanini (as were several) but he was indisposed and his place taken by Paul Hindesmith.&nbsp; I was 20 then, and thrilled by the magnificent sound of the music in this fabulous, modern Concert Hall (with "flying boxes" ), - the whole experience reinforced and enhanced by my love of music, which is my passion ever more today. I look forward to experiencing the new building.</p>
