<pre>I did myself the pleasure, on the 21st of October, 1810, to commemorate the natal <br />day of Lord Eardley, by composing the music of an ode, for three voices, written 
on the occasion. It was sung by my brother, Captain Kelly, Mr. Bellamy, and <br />myself, at Belvidere, before a large company invited on the occasion, amongst <br />whom were all the artillery officers from Woolwich: their band was also in <br />attendance: The day was passed with great hilarity, our noble host was in high <br />spirits; and as the jovial glass went round, told a number of anecdotes; among <br />others, one that seemed to amuse his visitors very much. </pre>
