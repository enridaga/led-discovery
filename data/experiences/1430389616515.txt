The first time I sang after my throat operation was at that ship's concert. It was one of the tensest nights of my life. But my voice, which for some years had had a certain husky quality, proved to have a clearer tone than ever before. I also could sing now in a higher pitch. 

God once again had stayed in my corner, nobly assisted by the Honorable Dr. Cyril Horsford.
