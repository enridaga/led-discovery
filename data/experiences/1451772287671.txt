<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">&nbsp;</span>In the Columned Hall of the Trade Union House recently, the Radio Orchestra conducted by Samuil Samosud gave the first performance of Prokofiev&rsquo;s Seventh Symphony. Unfortunately I did not manage to attend any of the rehearsals or study the score of the work before its public performance. Consequently I shall not try to make a serious analysis of the work here, but merely give a few impressions of its first performance. / The symphony is a great success for Prokofiev. It is cheerful and lyrical, and its clear, light content and fresh, harmonious language are a sheer delight. Once again, the work reveals Prokofiev&rsquo;s wonderful talent for melody. Here, the melodies flow freely and naturally, vividly expressing the composer&rsquo;s thoughts. Another of the work&rsquo;s great merits is the fact it holds the listener&rsquo;s interest from beginning to end &ndash; and not to cheap effects but by the vigour of its musical idiom&hellip;</p>
