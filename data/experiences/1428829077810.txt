<p>[Letter from Charles E. Halle (Carl) to his parents, from Darmstadt, 1836]</p>
<p>[Y]esterday I was invited to a large party, where I enjoyed myself greatly. I made the acquaintance of Kapellmeister Mangold, of Concertmeister Mangold (an excellent violincellist), and of two other Mangolds, one of them a very good violinist, and who, according to Rinck, must be quite a genius ; there were several other gentlemen and many ladies. I had to play several times, and the two Mangolds and I have agreed often to play duets and trios together.</p>
