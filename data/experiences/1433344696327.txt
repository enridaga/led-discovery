<p>Yeah, that's just the way it was in those days. You'd march to the graveyard playing very solemn and very slow, then on the way back all hell would break loose! No music you understand, we didn't know what a sheet of music was. Just six or seven pieces, half a dozen men pounding it out all together, each in his own way and yet somehow fitting in all right with the others. It had to be right, and it was, because it came from the right place.</p>
<p>Oh, the brass bands might have had more men, two clarinets maybe, or two cornets. Bolden used Bunk on second but I never heard that outfit. Oliver called Louis north to Chicago, but that was an exception. Usually there were six musicians in a band: a clarinettist, trombonist, banjo player, drummer, bassman, and trumpeter, who was almost always the leader. Once in a while a pianist might be added, but never a saxman! One of the Hall boys, not Edmond and not Robert, tried to make a go of the saxophone. He didn't get many jobs.</p>
