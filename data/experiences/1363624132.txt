I heard mass in the choir of the cathedral, where were assembled all the officers of state. They are very fond of music here; you hardly ever meet with either man or woman that does not know something of one instrument or another; and every body sings, though fine voices are rare. The mass that I heard was no great things; the only point aimed at, apparently, was who should shout loudest.
