<p>I was hoping to see you during one of my visits to Paris but I am stuck here with my nose to the grindstone. In a letter there is always the risk of being misunderstood and I would not want you to think for one moment, because of what I am about to say, that I do not admire you, since in fact I have always given you abundant proof to the contrary. Having made that clear, may I say that your recording is not worthy of you and that I do not advise you to allow it to be released. We are all victims of the treachery of the wax - this is the reason why six sides of Bernac- Poulenc in Faur&eacute; have just been put in the waste bin. No, quite frankly, the recording is not 'you'. What struck me most while listening&nbsp;<em>very carefully</em> to the test pressing is your lack of joy. If you had seen yourself in a mirror while you were making the recording you would have understood immediately that this was not the vivacious,&nbsp;<em>lively</em> Madeleine of the recital hall. / I think the microphone terrorizes you - only in this kind of music, naturally - and I am wondering whether we would not do better with some serious Poulenc, of the&nbsp;<em>Po&egrave;mes de Max Jacob&nbsp;</em>type. / Think about all this, while repeating to yourself that I remain forever your devoted and admiring (but of course!)</p>
