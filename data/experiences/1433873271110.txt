<p>Among the great pianists of Chicago was a man called Glover Compton, who always played with a big cigar in his mouth. He was at the Dreamland and his favourite song was "Dearest, I Love You", which he played in his own style--that is to say, the ragtime tradition.</p>
<p>Glover remained later for a long time in Europe and especially played in Paris, a little before the last World War [World War II]. There are no records by him.</p>
<p>And before Louis Armstrong and the orchestra of Carroll Dickerson played at the Sunset, at the corner of Thirty-fifth Street and Calumet, the Sunset had a remarkable band headed by Sammy Stewart. For many years it remained one of the best in Chicago. Sammy Stewart had gathered together only musicians of class and he played arrangements in a style that was sophisticated for that era. This pianist also played classical works magnificently.</p>
