On my arrival at Gosport w'ch was in the evening, one of the first things I enquir'd about was concerning my sister's proficiency in music, who had for 3. or 4. months been learning of Mr Wafer the organist to play upon an old spinnet of my Aunt Pratten's which she had lately sent for from Twickenham, where she had left it on coming to live with my father; & in this I was immediately gratified, not indeed by a mere recital of what she co'd do but by the thing itself, as at my aunts [sic]  desire, she immediately sat down to the spinet; & with the first introductory prelude she played I was unexpectedly pleased particularly with the chords, which I thought much in the style of my favourite instrument the organ. After this I listen'd with great attention to T'amo tanto, a ground of Mr. Wafer's, Lady Coventry's Minuet, & 2 or 3 other tunes in different keys, of the same kind, but not without insisting on the proper prelude or chords being struck at each change of key, previous to a fresh tune being began.
