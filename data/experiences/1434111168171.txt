<p>An extract from a Contemporary Letter, Mr. Adderley's, Hams House: 19th September, 1849 - In the mornings a vast amount of sightseeing was accomplished ; at the Asylum for the Blind we enjoyed a musical performance of as many portions of the 'Messiah' of Handel as we could stay to hear, being desired to select what we pleased, whether solos or choruses, as performers among the inmates were found for each and all, accompanied by an organist who was also blind.</p>
