<p>Practised in the afternoon for the concert: I was nervous about the Fifth Sonata, which I had completely forgotten. Some Russian students came to see me; even in a place like this you find refugees from Russia turning up. I enjoyed playing: the small hall was packed and the audience, thanks to Chevillier's efforts, knew something about new music and listened attentively. Chevillier opened the proceedings by giving a short talk (based on what I had told him) about contemporary Russian music, and spoke about Stravinsky, me and Myaskovsky. Ptashka sang quite well and in this room her voice sounded better than in the awful Stockholm hall. She got four curtain calls and Stravinsky's 'Rosyanka' was encored. Personally, I had a great success with the Toccata and the Gavottes.</p>
