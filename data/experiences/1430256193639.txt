Worked at the analysis of Schumann's trio for the next concert, in which I proffered the opinion that the German element contained in Schumann's works, and which has some affinity with the spirit of Jean Paul, militates somewhat against a right understanding of them in other countries. Worked at the trio itself, as also on the little Heller things. Some of Schumann's 'Noveletten' I played through with delight.
