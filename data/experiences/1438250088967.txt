The thing came to him in a good hour; the theme is beautiful, finely articulated, prolific, and the variations are, as they should be, independent growths that nevertheless depend on the theme. I can't put it properly but you will know what I mean. A true theme for variations has a paterfamilias character that one recognizes at once, and the children should show heredity and yet each have its own individual physiognomy and value. . . . </span></p>

But even in the poem there are certain moments that transcend the temporal, and the repentant sinner is a figure that always makes me shed uncritical tears. Who can resist the words "There was a time when'"etc.? ... The music is admirable almost throughout, and yesterday the scoring revealed to me a wealth of beauty I never noticed before, so much so that I asked myself: "Is it I who have learned to listen, or has it learned to sound?"</span></p>
