Knyvett. It was this song, I believe, that first gained her reputation. Of course she is partial to it, and introduces it on every occasion. There appears to me to be a fault in her execution of it. She sings it too slow, thereby making it tedious. It is a soft, soothing melody, but not in the least degree melancholy, which it is rendered by her manner. It ought, on the contrary, to flow on in a smooth and easy strain, expressive of calm contentment.</p>
