The eldest is a scholar of Signor Santarelli and sings divinely with more grace, taste and expression than any female in public or private I ever heard. She was so obliging as to sing 6 or 8 capital airs in different styles, and all charmingly but her <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">fort</em> is the pathetic. She has a good shake and well toned voice an admirable portamento with great compass and high finishing in all she attempts.
