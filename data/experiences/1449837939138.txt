As at the military concert in Hamburg, they played with thrilling effect a programme of about twenty pieces separately and unitedly. In the music for the combined bands there was not that replication of parts so common in similar performances in England, but it was specially arranged so that each band in turn took its part accompanied by the others. The whole performance concluded with a military piece entitled the &ldquo;Battle of Leipzig,&rdquo; in which cannons were fired at intervals with unerring precision at the beginning of the bar. This pleased me less than any other piece, but it seemed to raise the rest of the audience to the highest pitch of enthusiasm.</span></p>
