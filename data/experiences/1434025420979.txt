Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Brunswick: Thursday 28th August, 1845 -
For the evening a surprise had been contrived for me. In Waldeck, as elsewhere, singing associations have been formed—the vocal Round Table being the method by which the voice of Vetter Michel breathes forth his deceived hopes, and keeps up his courage, although not his confidence, for
the future. I had observed at eight o'clock an unusual movement and a low hum round the house, and at nine the whole society appeared with lanterns and music-books—at their head Herr von Hadeln, a much respected magistrate, one of the men of 1813, who had shed his blood at Ligny and Waterloo. They sang German songs, and Iast of all, the ' German Fatherland.' Then came a deputation, and Herr von Hadeln made me a short and hearty speech—alluding to the German hospitals in Rome and in London. (He is a man of small income, of which more than half is given to the poor.) I
answered, also from my heart, and begged the whole company to come in.
