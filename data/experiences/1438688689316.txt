<p style="text-align: justify;">On the 26th of January, 1814, I had the pleasure to witness the first appearance of Mr. Kean, as Shylock, in "The Merchant of Venice," and was delighted with the performance of my original Cupid in "Cymon." There was not a good house, but the audience gave him that applause, on his entree, which they are always liberal enough to bestow on a first appearance...In my humble opinion, Kean's acting in the third act of "Othello," is his best performance. The first night he acted it at Drury Lane, I sat in my seat in the orchestra, which was appropriated to me, as Director of the Music; and next to me was Lord Byron, who said, "Mr. Kelly, depend upon it, this is a man of genius."</p>
