Letter from Bunsen to his wife -
Dr. Pritchard's house stands on the foundation of an ancient abbey of Carmelites ; in the inside is the date 1590, there is a splendid drawing-room, of which the walls and ceiling are covered with the finest carving, of flowers
and beautiful figures of angels. The whole family was collected, including the eldest son, who is Tutor at Oriel College, mother and daughter very pleasing, and taking interest in the occupations and studies of the husband and father. After
dinner we had some good singing and playing, and we talked on till near midnight.
