<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Morrissey's Meltdown gave us all the opportunity to see the fabulous New York Dolls onstage once again.We were as far away as we could be but the energy of their performance filled the hall.A most amazing gig, made all the more bitter sweet by Arthur Kane's death just a few weeks afterwards. Thank you Morrissey and thank you Festival&nbsp; hall for allowing these events to take place!</p>
