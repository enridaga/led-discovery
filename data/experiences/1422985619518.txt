Go up to Harrods in morning to see abt a Pft for Pop to give to Bobby. Practise in Lounge 11–1.0. Practise in N. School of M. 2.40–3.40. Go to Madrigals at 6.0; General meeting as well as singing. Get back for dinner at 8.0, & listen afterwards, on wireless in Lounge to Prom – Ireland’s Pft Concerto & Holst’s Planets. I still think the first very loosely put together, & second too sugary (celeste); both have v. fine & beautiful moments; but I feel no music of that generation can be compared to works like Walton’s Viola Concerto
