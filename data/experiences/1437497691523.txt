<pre>I had composed a plaintive ballad in the second act [of "The Royal Oak"], for a <br />Miss Wheatley (formerly a pupil of Attwood's), who possessed a fine deep contre <br />alto voice...<br /><br />Upon the fifth representation of the new play, Lady Hamilton, with a party of <br />friends, occupied one of the stage-boxes, appearing all gaiety and animation. <br />Scarcely, however, had this ballad commenced, when she became tremulous and <br />agitated ; and at its conclusion, upon the encore being loudly demanded, she <br />exclaimed, "For God's sake, remove me I cannot bear it." Her terrified friends <br />withdrew her from the box, whence she was immediately conveyed home in a <br />fainting condition. 

The following morning, Miss Wheatley received a note from her Ladyship, (to <br />whom she had previously been unknown,) inviting her to her house, where, <br />after complimenting her upon the force and feeling with which she had given <br />the melody, she added, "The description brought our glorious Nelson with such <br />terrible truth before my mind's eye, that you overwhelmed me at the moment, <br />but now I feel as if I could listen to you in that air for ever." She <br />prevailed upon her visitor to repeat the ballad no less than four times at <br />the piano-forte, "as if increase of appetite grew by what it fed upon." 

Eventually, so powerful became this sentiment, that she induced Miss Wheatley <br />to retire from the stage altogether, and accept, under her roof, the post of <br />musical governess to the young Horatia Nelson, who had been confided to her 
Ladyship's guardianship. Not a day afterwards elapsed, but the favourite song <br />was put in requisition. I published it under the title of "Rest, warrior, rest.<br />"It was generally esteemed one of my happiest efforts ; and at the present day <br />is perpetually performed at concerts and music-meetings, by that delightful <br />singer, the charming Miss M. Tree, who has given it a renewed fashion and zest.
