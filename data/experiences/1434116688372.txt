Go (Frank Bridge takes me) to Q.H. to B.B.C. Symp. Concert at 8.15. Locatelli's Concerto di Camera in Eb. Gieseking in Bach. D min (not at all a good performance - dull & heavy) Sch√∂nberg 5 orch. pieces [Op. 16] (some quite fine - better than I expected - Colours - no. 3 [Farben] - marvellous) & a Dull & unscholastic (especially in treatment of grace notes in 2nd mov.) perf. of Beethoven's marvellous 7th symph. Orch. as before - material marvellous - but badly trained in ensemble & everything by that worst of all conductors (?) Adrian Boult
