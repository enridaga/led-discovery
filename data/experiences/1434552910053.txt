During the season of 1906-1907, I finished my symphony and dedicated it to him [Rimsky-Korsakov]. I composed also a little suite for voice and orchestra, 'Faurne et Berg√®re', on three poems by Pushkin in the manner of Parny. Rimsky-Korsakov, who had closely followed the composition of these two works, wishing to give me the opportunity of hearing them, arranged with the Court orchestra to have them performed in the spring of 1907 at a private audition under the direction of its usual conductor H. Wahrlich.
