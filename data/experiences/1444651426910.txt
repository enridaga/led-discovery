<p>My granny bought my family tickets for Tchaikovskys 'The Nutcracker'! It was a magical experience and I recall writing about it in my ' What I did in the Christmas holidays essay'. It was probably the first time I had been to the Festival Hall; I recall looking at the entries to an art competition run by the MagpieTV programme in the hall's foyer.</p>
