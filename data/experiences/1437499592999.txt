<pre>On the 25th November, 1813, was produced at Drury Lane, a musical piece, written <br />by Mr. Arnold, called "Illusion." The subject was taken from the popular tale of <br />"Nourjahad," written by Mr. Sheridan's mother, the authoress of "Sidney Biddulph," <br />&amp;c. I composed the music; it was received with great applause. </pre>
