<p>Letter from Bunsen to his Wife, Friday 19th October - Paretz is a small country residence, which the King inhabited when he was Crown Prince, and which the late Queen Louise particularly delighted in ; it consists of only two stories, with very few rooms; between the royal dwelling and the village consisting of a few houses there is a small park. No military guard approaches this peaceful spot. The King is himself magistrate (Schultze) of the village, and the whole life of the place proceeds in patriarchal simplicity. On the stroke of two o'clock, the High Chamberlain appeared, with staff and bow, before the King, who went straight in to dinner ; besides the Royal Family, the High Chamberlain, Prince Wittgenstein, von Humboldt, and another Chamberlain, no one was there but myself, and not one of the Ministers of State ever has been there. During dinner there was music in the antechamber, and the villagers were collected before the windows ; everything taken off the table was straightway given to them, and on rising each person of the royal family took fruit or cake from the dessert, to distribute with their own hands from the window.</p>
