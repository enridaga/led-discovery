<p>I used to hear [Buddy] Bolden play every chance I got. I'd go out to the park where he was playing, and there wouldn't be a soul around. Then, when it was time to start the dance, he'd say "Let's call the children home". And he'd put his horn out the window and blow, and everyone would come running.</p>
