 At an orchestral concert given by him and conducted by Berlioz, the 'March au Supplice,' from the latter's ' Symphonie Fantastique,' that most gorgeously instrumented piece, was performed, at the conclusion of which Liszt sat down and played his own arrangement, for the piano alone, of the same movement, with an 
effect even surpassing that of the full orchestra, and creating an indescribable furore. The feat had been duly announced in the programme beforehand, a 
proof of his indomitable courage.
