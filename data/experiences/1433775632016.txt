Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Friday 19th October - 
The wooded hills on the banks of the Havel, and the wide expanse of lakes through which the river flows, are seen to the best effect from Glieuicke, the country-house of Prince Carl, who personally showed me the gardens, which are
admirably arranged, in the course of our sightseeing. During the splendid banquet the loud harmony of the band spared me all effort of conversation ; afterwards we followed the Crown Prince into the apartment of Frederick II., where, having discovered the great King's own compositions for the
flute, the Prince at once tried them on the pianoforte.
