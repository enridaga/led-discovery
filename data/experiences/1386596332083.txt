Late last night orders were sent round the divisions to be prepared for marching at daybreak, and early this morning we left the blood-stained heights of the Alma â€“ a name that will ever be memorable in our history. Soon after dawn the French assembled all their drums and trumpets on top of the highest of the hills they carried, and broken by peals of sound from the bugles of the infantry, celebrated their victory ere they departed. It was spirited, stirring, and thrilling music. And its effect, as it swelled through the darkness of early morning down over the valley, can never be forgotten.
