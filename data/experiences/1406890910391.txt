In 1891 when I first went to Parry he was indeed an out-and-out radical both in art and life. He introduced me to Wagner and Brahms - which was quite contrary to curricula then obtaining in academies. He showed me the greatness of Bach and Beethoven as compared with Handel and Mendelssohn. He once discovered with horror that I did not know the finale of Beethoven's Appassionata Sonata, so he sat down and played it to me, pointing out as he went on, how the development grew to a great climax. It was a wonderful performance and I shall never forget it.
