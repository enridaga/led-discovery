<p>We were entertained at a grand banquet at the Sorbonne in the evening, which was attended also by the British Ambassador and M. Briand. I had the pleasure of sitting beside Dr. Saint-Saens, who, in spite of his years, bore himself with sparkling vivacity, and was one of the lions of the occasion. There were numerous toasts and speeches. The banquet fittingly concluded with a concert given in the Great Hall of the College, when, under the direction of M. Gabriel Pierne, the fine Colonne Orchestra was heard in a well-chosen selection, and artists from the Opera-Comique sang. A feature of the programme was some dances, charmingly presented by a troupe under the direction of M. Paul Vidal, comprising among other items a Gavotte of Lulli, a Rigaudon of Dardanus, and a Menuet of Handel. Dr. Saint-Saens won much applause by his performance of his Fantasia for Pianoforte, "Africa," accompanied by the orchestra, and concluded the programme by conducting a brilliant interpretation of Berlioz's "Marche Hongroise." The medal of the University of Paris was conferred upon Dr. Saint-Saens amid the prolonged applause of the audience.</p>
