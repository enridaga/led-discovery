<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I have a great affection for the Festival Hall, having seen many concerts there over the years, including the Vienna Boys Chor, Chris Barber and many of your Christmas shows. In 1951 I visited the Festival of Britain many times, and as part of that celebration sang in the "London Children's Concert" as part of that festival.&nbsp; I am so pleased to see the improvements to this building, being a "Londoner" myself, I do regard it as "mine". I stil have the programme of the children's concert for 1951 and wondered if you would like it as a part of your "Love The Festival Hall" event? Although over 50 years old it is still in excellent condition.</p>
