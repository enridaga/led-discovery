<p>It must have been in 1932 or 1933, before Vienna had awakened to the acuteness of the Nazi menace; Josephine Baker, the Negro star from Paris, was drawing packed houses at the premier night club of the capital; the Social-Democratic Arbeiter Sinfonie Konzerte were playing all the advanced symphonic works which later were labeled &ldquo;Entartete Kunst&rdquo; (Degenerate Art) by the Nazis; /Szigeti gave a recital under my management featuring this then much-discussed work with the famous &ldquo;Blues&rdquo; movement. / In all my long managerial experience, this was the first time that such a &ldquo;bagarre&rdquo; developed at a recital in venerable Musikvereins-Saall After the Blues, hoots and cries of &ldquo;Negermusik!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pfui&rdquo; from the few Nazi provocateurs back of the orchestra stalls soon developed into a free fight, in the course of which the rowdies were ejected. Little did we realize that incidents like these, which we minimized then-they were repeated nightly at Josephine Baker&rsquo;s performances too- were all part of the Nazi master plan: to lump all exotic, advanced art- Stravinsky, Picasso, Schoenberg, Alban Berg, Kandinsky, Marian Anderson, whatever it might be- together as &ldquo;Negroid&rdquo; and discredit it as unworthy of the Aryan.</p>
