<p>I dare not talk to you to-night before that heterogeneous mob, &amp; I could not write about your work. Frankly I did not think the interest sustained to the end,&nbsp;<em>because</em> the end was so badly played. But up to 2 -3<sup>rds&nbsp;</sup>till after the Largo - the poignancy of the emotion was so strong that had you gone on I must have collapsed. I think I never was so moved by modern music as by that, in spite of horns "cracking" etc. And for that reason, old hand as I am, I could not write. My notice conveys nothing, I fear, though it may show one or two that I felt the sincerity of the composition Also I felt not a little bitter at all the youths being there &amp; regarding themselves as your equal - But for the genuine emotion, for the sheer loveliness of that Largo, I thank you sincerely &amp; from the bottom of a heart that I thought was growing stoney &amp; cynical &amp; hard as nails.&nbsp;</p>
