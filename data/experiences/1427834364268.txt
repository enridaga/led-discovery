<p>It&rsquo;s quite strange, but my tastes keep changing, and rather radically. Things that I liked quite recently I now like less, considerably less, and some I don&rsquo;t like at all. So how can I speak of music that I heard for the first time several decades ago? For instance, I remember Shcherbachev&rsquo;s piano suite, Inventions, written long ago in the early twenties. At the time it seemed rather good to me. I recently heard it by accident on the radio. There&rsquo;s no inventiveness there at all. / And it&rsquo;s the same with Prokofiev. So many of his works that I liked once upon a time seem duller now.</p>
