Rome, 16 Nov. [1830].... Pray tell Neukomm that we have Felix Mendelssohn here, and that I have already heard him play a Fantasia of Beethoven, and the Preludi of Sebastian Bach, and he will then tell you what enjoyment that is. Felix Mendelssohn's adagio-touch is the only thing I ever heard like Neukomm's.
