<p>Monday, the David Ensemble movingly premiered my Last Songs for soprano, cello and piano (Sheila Schonbrun, Jonathan Abramowitz, Warren Wilson). Peter Davis in the Times wrote two things I agree with. "While a suggestion of blank note-spinning pervades the cycle..." Yes, more than a suggestion. All music is the spinning of notes into a fabric whose seams mustn't show, "Stevens already seems detached from earthly considerations - one wonders, in fact, it another man's music isn't an unnecessary intrusion..." Yes, again. All music is an intrusion on the poetry it illustrates; When is that intrusion necessary? When Schumann intrudes on Heine? Music does not intensify the sense of words, it changes their sense. (Music does not heighten, it broadens a text.)</p>
