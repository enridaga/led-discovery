<p>The final Koussevitzky concert, consisting of works by Stravinsky. I listened with great pleasure to&nbsp;<em>Petrushka</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Rite</em>, although both works, when done without staging, tend to come across as formless and fragmented (except the first movement of&nbsp;<em>Petrushka</em>). Stravinsky has made strides not only as a conductor but as a pianist, and rattles through his Concerto with great vigour, even though he has a tendency to bang the keyboard unpleasantly. He had a great success, and the audience was more numerous than at the previous concert. But as before I do not find the Concerto congenial, except for a few splendid places. Dukelsky loved it, and I said to him: 'Oho, now you've well and truly put your foot in it!'</p>
