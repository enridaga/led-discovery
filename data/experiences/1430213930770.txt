This winter Byron's 'Manfred', with choruses set by Bishop, was given as a novelty in Covent Garden Theatre. There was an immense outlay in scenery and decorations, the music was not much more enjoyable than that of the 'Bravo', by Marliani; a melange made up of the well-worn phrases of Rossini, Pacini, and Mercadante. The beauty of the mise-en-sc√®ne would have done equally well, apart from the ear-torture.
