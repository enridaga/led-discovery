    At one of our concerts an Italian lady, who was associated with the Italian Opera Company, sang three songs and, being still enthusiastically applauded, reappeared and sang, “ Home, Sweet Home.”
    At the close of the concert a man who was unknown to me told me that the song had broken him in pieces. He said he was a musician and had been sent away by his wife on account of his intemperate habits. I was so much struck by the tone of sincerity with which he told his story that I went with him to his wife’s house.
     At first she refused to see him, but, through the intercession of the two daughters, she agreed. He came up: for a moment they looked at each other—and fell into each other’s arms. For twenty years that man and I remained firm friends, and a happier home was not to be found in Glasgow.
