When I went in [to class], they [the soldiers] were still sober and the hut was packed to the door. Most of them were singing and some few laughing and talking. Would you like to know what they sang? No ‘Rule Britannia’ or ‘God Save The King’ - English soldiers rarely sing either unless they are bidden. No - it was a chorus we were to hear every day for the next six months, with varying emphasis — ‘When do we go home?’, each word punctuated by thumps of mugs on tables, and the last word raised the roof….

Outside bells blared; flags flew; bands played; at every window in the Grande Rue faces looked out, laughing, crying. In the distance the ‘Marseillaise’ came rolling down and its echo ‘It’s - a — long — way - to - go.’
