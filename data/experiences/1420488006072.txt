Sir John Pritchard... I vividly remember one occasion when he flew out to Kiel, in Germany, to conduct that orchestra [BBCSO] in the late 1960s. We were in the middle of a tour, and the main work of the evening was Schubert's great C Major Symphony - a work which can be among the most thrilling for any orchestra, but also in some conditions the most boring (the description of it as 'Schubert's Heavenly Length' has been quoted by many a weary fiddler, in many a band). John hardly rehearsed it at all, yet the performance was nothing short of masterly.
