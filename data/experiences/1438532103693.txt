<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The features of the season of 1893 were the first visits to London of Leoncavallo and Mascagni,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and the production there of their respective operas, &ldquo;Pagliacci&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Rantzau&rdquo;. The fame <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of Leoncavallo's sensational opera had preceded <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>it, and the public expected something remarkable. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>They were not disappointed. I have rarely seen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>an audience so breathless with excitement over<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the development of an opera plot. The effect of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the little tragedy was augmented by the burning<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>intensity of De Lucia, whose portrayal of the hapless Canio's anguish and suffering was a triumph<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of realism. His touching soliloquy at the end of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the first act was delivered with an abandonment <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of feeling that completely carried away his auditors. Very fine, too, was Ancona's rendering of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>already famous Prologue; deliciously pure and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>sweet was Melba's vocalization in the haUateUa<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>for Nedda; excellent were the new-comers Richard Green and Bonnard as Silvio and Peppe; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>while Mancinelli's conducting left not a point <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>undiscerned throughout. Leoncavallo, modest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and unassuming, waited quietly in the background <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>till the end, and then had to be forced on to the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>stage by the artists to acknowledge the ovation <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that awaited him. This was quite early in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>season (May 19), and Leoncavallo remained in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>London for several weeks. I found him to be<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a man of great culture and strong intellect. He is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a poet as well as a musician, and in both arts he <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>reveals the grasp of a profound thinker. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /></span></span></p>
