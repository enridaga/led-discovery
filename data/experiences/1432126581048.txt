<p>A party of steerage passengers were gathered one foggy day below decks on an Allan liner near the entrance of the Belle Isle Straits. They were cold and cheerless and weary of the voyage, though only two days out, and a lady had come down to talk and sing to them. The subject was " Stepping over the line," and the song was " Safe in the arms of Jesus." She told the story of a young sailor, who was summoned to his mother's death-bed. " Willie," said the mother, looking up at him with tearful eyes, " sing to me once more ' Safe in the arms of Jesus.' " " Mother," he replied, " I can't sing that song. It would be a lie ; I am not safe, and I can't sing a lie."</p>
