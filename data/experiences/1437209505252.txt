<p>Finishing binding "Boy" in morning before lesson with Ireland at 11.10. Have rehearsal of Phant. in it, at 12.0 to which Foss comes. unfortunately it goes very badly, so he doesn't get too good an impression. However he comes back to lunch at 173, &amp; hears "Boy" &amp; seems very pleased with that.</p>
