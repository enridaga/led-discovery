<p>...[T]he 3d day we reached the Devizes.</p>
<p>And here, Mrs Thrale and I were much pleased with our Hostess, Mrs Lawrence, who seemed something above her station in her Inn: - but, while we were at Cards before supper, we were much surprised by the sound of a Piano Forte; - I jumped up and ran to listen whence it proceeded; I found it came from the next Room, where the Overture to the Buona Figliuola was performing. The Playing was very decent, - I returned to finish the Rubber; ... Well, another Deal was hardly played, ere we heard the sound of a <em>voice</em>, - and out I ran again, - the singing, however, detained me not long, as it was equally tasteless and powerless, - and so back I whisked: but the performance, however indifferent in itself, yet surprised us at <em>the Bear at the Devizes</em>, and therefore Mrs Thrale determined to know from whom it came: accordingly, she tapped at the Door; - a very handsome Girl, about 13 years Old, with fine Dark Hair upon a finely formed Forehead, opened it;...<em>another</em> Girl, however, advanced, and obligingly and gracefully invited us in... We found they were both the Daughters of our Hostess.</p>
