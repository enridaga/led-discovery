One morning, long before breakfast, we met in the spacious music room leading to a conservatory in which stood Roubiliac's famous statues of Handel. "At, der Alte!" (Oh, the old fellow!), was his cheerful greeting, "I used to play a fugue of hisâ€“in G Minor. H'm, let me see," and, sitting down, he began to play it to an audience of one. It was my last chance of hearing him.
