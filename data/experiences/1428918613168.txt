[T]he new choral society, of which I had laid the foundations before my departure, had to be brought to completion, and in this I have got so far that its first concert, Haydn's ' Creation,' takes place this very day, with the unheard of number of 1,600 subscribers, and an orchestra and chorus of 300. I have just come home from the very satisfactory final rehearsal, and am full of expectation for this evening.
