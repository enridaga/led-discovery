It was in those days a rare event for an English singer to venture upon the boards of the Anglo-Italian stage; and the force of fashion and prejudice made the venture one of unusual difficulty. But with his advantages of Italian training and style, Mr. Sims Reeves was entitled to be fairly considered as an Italian singer. He had not only a beautiful natural organ, but expression and passion were at his command, and there can be little doubt that he might have permanently justified the enthusiastic welcome of what might be termed the "national" portion of the audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, and might have battled successfully against prejudice, had not difficulties, created by himself, arisen, and caused his secession for the remainder of the season.</span></p>
