<p>JH called me to the piano to display his arrangement. Rightful contempt of the translation beneath the original Czech words in the Dvor&aacute;k songs he plans to use for the service next Sunday - the willy-nilly superimposition of King James (meaningless on the continent) at the expense of the vocal line. JH, with his own new churchy translations, keeps Dvor&aacute;k's note values quite intact.&nbsp;</p>
