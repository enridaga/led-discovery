Usual practise until & writing (9.15-11.0) in morning. Go to College in afternoon, & have 20 mins. pft. lesson (not 40. mins in spite of Mum's plea with the Director). I also get leave to drop Music classes, (Dr. Buck) as they're so easy. Go to H. Reeves after lesson, & get some music 2nd hand. Listen to BBC concert on Miss Prior's (quite good) wireless in evening. [Handel] E min Concerto Grosso, Concerto l (Liszt - Solomon) Iberia (Debussy) - the tragedy was, that in the middle of the Schubert C maj (End of Slow mov.) The only performance I've ever really enjoyed, the battery ran out. Still, the 1st 2 movs. were very good.
