<p>The house I frequented with the greatest pleasure, was that of La Signora Moretti. She was a very charming person, and (which was not her least recommendation to <em>me</em>) an excellent judge of music, and a good singer and performer on the piano-forte.

It was a great treat to hear him sing some of his comic songs, replete with humour and taste, accompanying himself.</p>
