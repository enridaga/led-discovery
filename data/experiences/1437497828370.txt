<p>Mangeot brings me back for a hurried dinner, after which I meet Barbara at Q. Hall for Prom (tickets from B.B.C.). Thoroughly light &amp; vulgar 1st half, which I thoroughly enjoy - selec. from Mignon, Carmen, Rigol. Pagliacci, Walton's Fa&ccedil;ade, &amp; above all Strauss's wonderful, moving Don Quixote, excellent played by L. Kennedy, but v. scrappily by orch. 2nd half we only stuck a garish arr. of Handel Org. Conc. played (when one could hear him) by Stanley Marchant.&nbsp;</p>
