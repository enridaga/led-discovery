<p>It was 1957, the end of the Christmas term, celebrated as usual by Queen Mary College, London University, at the Charter Week Ball. I was there with my boyfriend and we enjoyed dancing in the huge space provided by the foyer of the Festival Hall.&nbsp; We got engaged later that night and were married in the autumn of 1958. During our 48 married years together we have visited the South Bank to hear chamber concerts at QE Hall and the Purcell Room. I remember too a full cycle of Vaughan Williams' symphonies in the Festival Hall.</p>
