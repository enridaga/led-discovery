<p>The building is in good taste and convenient, being in size and form much like one of our larger city churches. It is quite free, however, from all those appearances of finery, or attempts at display or show, which we sometimes see in our American churches, and which are always unbecoming; while, on the other hand, there is nothing of the rudeness or coarseness which is to be seen in some of the Swiss churches. It seats, probably, from 1,200 to 1,500 persons, and was, when we were present, quite full. The centre of the house, below, was occupied by women; and the outside or wall slips, by men. The galleries, on both sides, were occupied exclusively by men. The organ is large, extending nearly across the end of the house; one man (precentor) leads the singing, aided by some twenty girls and boys, whose voices could hardly be heard. The organ was played in fine church style, with dignity, elevation, and firmness. It is certainly a great relief to hear these German organs (or many of them) played without the least attempt at showing off stops, or at that prettiness which seeks to please or tickle, without elegance or grandeur; and also entirely free from an ever-continued and sickening seesaw of the swell, thought to be so exquisitely fine by some organists in England and America.</p>
