My life here is exceedingly pleasant ; it is quite a new existence for me. The most delightful hours are those I spend in the house of Mr. von Ploennies (medizinalrath). One meets the whole artist-world of Darmstadt there: painters, musicians, poets all artists are welcome...At these parties the entertainment is most varied ; either Duller or Mrs. von Ploennies reads one of their latest compositions, then there is music. I have had to play each time, on a very fine grand piano, only a little hard to play on ; duets and quartets are sung, and so on ; all this to a flowing accompaniment of wine and punch, whilst the palate is also most delicately catered for.
