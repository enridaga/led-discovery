So far, however, I have only been to one concert, and that was a sacred concert. But Joachim played – and Oh-h, what a tone he draws out of the violin! I could think of nothing but Mrs Moulton’s voice, as he sighed out those exquisitely pathetic notes. He played something by Schumann which ended with a single note, and as he drew his bow across he produced so many shades that it was perfectly marvellous.
