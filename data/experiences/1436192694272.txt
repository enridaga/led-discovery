<p>A remarkable concert took place in 1872. Among the artists who lent me their aid was the great Teresa Titiens, and also Miss Clara Louise Kellogg, an American soprano, and Mlle Marie Roze. Mile Roze was a very pretty woman, and Auber wrote the principal part in his latest opera, Le premier jour de bonheur for her, which was produced at the Opera-Comique in Paris. She became very popular, and a great favourite at Her Majesty's Theatre. Signor Fancelli, the tenor, and Signor Agnesi, the baritone, also sang at this concert, but one of its sensations was the singing of the new tenor, Signor Italo Campanini, brother of Signor Cleofante Campanini, lately the principal conductor at Covent Garden, who created as great a furore on his first appearance at Drury Lane in 1872 as Cennaro in Lucrezia Borgia as Giuglini did at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1857.</p>
