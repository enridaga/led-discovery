My father was a Jewish minister, and his singing at the synagogue attracted worshippers from near and far. My evident inclination for music was also stirred by his practicing at home. He had a fine tenor voice, and later on I began to realize how beautiful his phrasing was â€“ he was naturally musical, good music absorbed him, and to him principally I owe passion for it.
