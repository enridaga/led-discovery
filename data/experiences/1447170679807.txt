<p>The date was 11 October 1957, my very visit to the RFH. It was also the first concert in the first London Beethoven series by the Philharmonia under Otto Klemperer. The programme included the Eroica Symphony, Klemperer's recording of which had two years earlier been decisive in establishing his position as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century.&nbsp; The evening was unforgettable. The concert programme incidentally listed other Philharmonia concerts in the following months. As well as more by Klemperer, were others with Karajan, Giulini and Sawallisch. Has London ever enjoyed such a rich feast? The RFH subsequently became, and still is, one of my favourite places, the setting for so many moving experiences.</p>
