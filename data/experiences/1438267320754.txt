<p>Listen to a Contemporary B.B.C.concert. I can't judge the Suite (Black Masquers) by Roger Sessions - it seemed very hysterical &amp; over elaborate, tho' int. Arthur Bliss's M&egrave;l&eacute;e Fantasque was dull and unoriginal. Gerschwin's 2nd Pft &amp; Orch Rhapsody was in the typical style. By far the best work was a Dance Symph. by Aaron Copland.* Most of this was really beautiful &amp; exhilerating.&nbsp;</p>
