<p>I am well, and from Tuesday onwards there has been something new at the theatre every day, as though put on especially for me. Best of all, I have already heard one oratorio at the Sing-Akademie and also, with great satisfaction, <em>Cortez</em>, Cimarosa's <em>Secret Marriage</em> and Onslow's <em>Colporteur</em>. However, Handel's oratorio <em>St. Cecilia</em> came nearest to the ideal which I had formed of great music. None of the most cried-up singers were there except Mile Tibaldi (contralto) and the young, seventeen-year-old Schatzel whom I previously heard at the Sing- Akademie and later in the <em>Colporteur</em>. I liked her best in the oratorio; perhaps I was in a better mood for listening. Even then there were "buts".</p>
