<p class="MsoNormal">Freddy Keppard was playin&rsquo; in a spot across the street and was drawin&rsquo; all the crowds. I was sittin&rsquo; at the piano, and Joe Oliver came over to me and commanded in the nervous, harsh voice, &ldquo;Get in B-flat.&rdquo; I did, and Joe walked out on the sidewalk, lifted his horn to his lips, and blew the most beautiful stuff I have ever heard. People started pouring out of the other spots along the street to see who was blowing all that horn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Before long, our place was full and Joe came in smiling, and said, &ldquo;Now, that _______ won&rsquo;t bother me no more". From then on, our place was full every night.</p>
