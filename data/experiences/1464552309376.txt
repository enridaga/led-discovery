<p>Dobrowen's subsequent performance of Tchikovsky's Sixth Symphony was met with a clamorous ovation; it is a long time since I heard the Sixth and therefore was able to approach it with fresh ears: the first movement is a magnificent construction, the second the direct opposite, badly done and poor material. The Scherzo is superbly put together and mostly very beautiful, except for the end, which is bad. The conclusion of the fourth movement is astoundingly beautiful (and what a sound!), but the remainder of it is debatable.</p>
