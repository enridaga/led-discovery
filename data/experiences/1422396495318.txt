It was like a dream come true for me, because when I was just twelve I first heard his work with the Philadelphia Orchestra on record, and it seemed to me to be the most exciting thing ever - Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, in his own arrangement. It was stated to be not only arranged by Stokowski, but personally balanced by him for recording.
