Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delvile, Nov. 30, 1750 -
Yesterday we were at a charitable music, performed in the round church of Dublin ; we had Corelli's 8th Concerto, Mr. Handel's Te Deum Jubilate, and two anthems ; I cannot say there was so great a crowd as I wished to see on the occasion.
