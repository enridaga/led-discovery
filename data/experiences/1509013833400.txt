In some places they have Evening Litanies, which they sing at the Altars, under a Picture or Image of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Madonna</span> in the Streets; and 'tis pleasant enough to see a parcel of Children only, got together sometimes, before one of those Altars, (Girls very often) one of them, the Prolocutor, calling over the Names of the Saints, and the rest joining in a Chorus of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Ora pro Nobis</span> to each.</span></p>
