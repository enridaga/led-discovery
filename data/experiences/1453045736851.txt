<p>Altogether I had every reason to be satisfied&nbsp;with my first experience at one of those big&nbsp;music festivals, which augured well for the&nbsp;future, and it was a happy summer I spent&nbsp;that year, partly with my people and friends&nbsp;in the Thuringian woods, partly in the Austrian&nbsp;alps, with the Joachims, who, in the happy&nbsp;temporary possession of a charming little villa&nbsp;in Alt-Aussee in Styria, had suggested to me&nbsp;the taking of rooms somewhere near them, so&nbsp;that we could make excursions together, and&nbsp;now and then some music as well.&nbsp;I do not know which I enjoyed more : a&nbsp;day's wanderings with the great musician, often&nbsp;starting at five o'clock in the morning-- he was&nbsp;an excellent walker roaming on the tops of&nbsp;the hills surrounding the picturesque village-- or accompanying on the piano, his playing&nbsp;of his own Hungarian Concerto and those of&nbsp;Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Spohr, and sonatas by&nbsp;Locatelli, Tartini, Handel he practised every&nbsp;day for some time or singing with Frau&nbsp;Joachim songs and duets for hours at a time.</p>
