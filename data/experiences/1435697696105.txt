Go on to London Musical Festival concert (B.B.C. orch) after with Grace. (Good seats from B.B.C.). Conductor Serge Koussevitzky. Not so startling as I imagined. He seemed too finicky & not at ease. He wasn't very enlightening in Sibelius 7th Smph, abt. which I can't make up my mind. It contains some fine things & some utter tosh. A hectic perf of Tsch. 5th finished. An uneven work. Concert began with Prokofiev's Classical Symph. Brilliant, witty scoring. Rather dull second movement.
