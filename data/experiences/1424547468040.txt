How happy I was to receive your letter! Many times I think of you and of the times we made music together. It was always a joy and a privilege for me to play with you. I wish so much that we may meet again! / Our deal mutual friend Sir John was magnificent at our Festival. It was a great experience for me to hear his Mahler Symphony and I was deeply moved. I had never heard such a performance of this work. And, of course, needless to say, we were both so happy and moved to be with one another again.
