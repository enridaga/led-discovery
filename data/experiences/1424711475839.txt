This week has been quite an eventful one. It began on Monday with the funeral of Prince Albrecht, the youngest brother of the Emperor, and it was a very imposing spectacle...Presently the bells began to toll, and exactly at eleven the procession started...The band played a chorale, "Jesus, my Refuge," and the bells kept tolling all the while.
