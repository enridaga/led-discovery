Another 1935 concert that stands out in my memory was a B.B.C. recital with Arthur Rubinstein in the concert hall at Broadcasting House. Included in the programme was Arthur Bliss’s sonata for viola and piano. Rubinstein arrived from the Continent only on the morning of the recital, and he had never seen Bliss’s work. The crossing from the Hook of Holland had been rough – he had twice been thrown from his bunk. He turned up smiling all the same, and the moment he arrive we had the rehearsal and the usual balance-test in which he read the difficult piano score at sight. At the light of the intricacies and technical difficulties of the piano part, and his interpretation musically was perfection.
