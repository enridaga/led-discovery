I had great pleasure in her [Miss Mary Linwood] acquaintance, as she was the only lady in Leicester that could read difficult music at sight. Upon my purchasing a copy of Haydn's Seasons, I was surprised and delighted to find that she could with facility execute both the voice and piano-forte part of that difficult work. This lady, I believe, has composed an opera, and oratorio, and is also an authoress.
