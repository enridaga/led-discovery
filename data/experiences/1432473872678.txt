From a strictly musical point of view I owe her [Nelli Melba] few lasting memories, but the girlish freshness of that voice and the indolent languorous grace with which she sang some things remain unforgettable to me to this day. Recently, when arranging for publication some short pieces for violin, I decided to include Lalo’s “Aubade” from 'Le Roi d’Ys' in the series, probably to give substance to my memory of her singing of this song. A small thing, to be sure, but her own; and ineffably beautiful this small thing must have been to have retained its hold on me through all these years.
