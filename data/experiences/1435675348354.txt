Soon afterwards I conducted ‘Oedipus’ in London for the British Broadcasting Corporation. That institution, with which I had already worked for some years and with which I continue to be on the best of terms, merits speciaI attention. A few well informed and cultured men – among them my friend of long standing, Edward Clark – have been able to form within this huge eclectic organization a small group which, with praiseworthy energy, pursues the propaganda of contemporary music, upholding its cause with invincible tenacity. The B.B.C. has succeeded in forming a fine orchestra, which certainly rivals the best in the world. / I should like here to say a few words about English musicians. The fact that England has not for a long time produced any great creators of music has given rise to an erroneous opinion concerning the musical gifts and aptitudes of the English in general. It is alleged that they are not musical; but this is contrary to my experience. I have nothing but praise for their ability, precision, and honest, conscientious work, as shown in all my dealings with them, and I have always been struck by the sincere and spontaneous enthusiasm which characterizes them in spite of inept prejudice to the contrary prevalent in other countries. I am not speaking merely of orchestral artists, but of choruses and solo singers, all alike devoted to their work. It is therefore not astonishing that I should always have been more than satisfied with their rendering of my works, and so now with ‘Oedipus’, in which these qualities were fully displayed.
