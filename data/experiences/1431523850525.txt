<p>Not long after reaching this tribe of savages, they surrounded me by hundreds, all armed with spears. I could not speak their language. As a lamb among wolves, there I stood. Christ was with me. In Him I trusted ; He heard my prayer. Tuning my violin, I began singing and playing that precious hymn : <em>All hail the power of Jesus' name / Let angels prostrate fall</em>, etc. I closed my eyes while singing, and on reaching the verse, <em>Let every kindred, every tribe / On this terrestrial ball</em>, I opened my eyes, and every spear was dropped, tears were coursing down the cheeks of those warriors.</p>
