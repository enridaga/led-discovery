<p>We spent the morning listening to the King's funeral.&nbsp; Good things were - the muffled Westminster bells: the iron-chain noise of the feet of the ratings and the troops (just like Great Eye's beach after storm) and the ripple of the horse-hoofs.&nbsp; Big Ben tolling once a minute for each year (56) of the King's life; above all, at Paddington &amp; at Windsor, the pipe-playing.&nbsp; I think I have never heard better, especially Macheidlhe - I don't know how to spell it - the Cameronian tune: strange how small, after the long piping and marching up to St George's, the actual church ceremony: a divine dolls-house after that timeless music.</p>
