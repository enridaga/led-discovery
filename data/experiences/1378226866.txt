A concert was the first entertainment given at the Palace. The St. James's band was added to the King's private band, and the singers for the choruses were chosen from the Windsor choristers. Mr. and Mrs. Harrison, the Messrs. Abrams, Signor Tasca, and Madame Mara were also engaged, and the Queen begged the latter to direct the arrangement of the platform for the orchestra. This was made the entire width of the room, with steps the whole length of it, and seats at the two ends for the singers when unemployed, the instrumental performers remaining of course in the orchestra, except between the two acts. 

Mara was to sing `The Prince, unable to conceal his pain,' from `Alexander's Feast,' which she did, as before, to perfection. The excitement of listening to music was rather feared for the King, but his Majesty, with Lady Pembroke at his side (his Queen Esther), was very happy, and the concert ended to the pleasure and satisfaction of all concerned in it, and of the numbers of invited guests.
