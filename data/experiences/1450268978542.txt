<p>An Ohio friend related his experience to me. Jenny Lind was to sing in Wheeling, West Virginia, and he lived just sixty miles west, towards Columbus. He was then a boy of eighteen, and had been for three years apprenticed to a clock-maker. His father was a clergyman, with a large family and small salary, and though a warm-hearted music lover, was too poor to think of going to hear Jenny Lind. Father and son had read together a long notice of the approaching song-festival in Wheeling, and the father had remarked with a sigh of resignation, &ldquo; I wish I could hear her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The son determined to try and go to Wheeling for that purpose.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">[&hellip;]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In short, my friend spent three days on the road to Wheeling, mending clocks by the way and getting a little money for each. He reached Wheeling, paid three dollars for his concert ticket, heard Jenny Lind, and returned home in a two days&rsquo; march. His father asked him where he had been, and he answered<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>that he had walked to Wheeling, mended clocks, earned money to hear Jenny Lind, and was happy. The father saw that he had a son who was made out of good stuff, embraced him, and said not one word of reproof.</p>
