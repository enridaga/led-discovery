<p>In the rented car that brought us here yesterday the radio played a Vivaldi Psalm for alto, in several movements, called&nbsp;<em>Nisi Dominus</em>. But one of the movements isn't Vivaldi's, it's by Villa-Lobos. Sly fox, his famous fifth&nbsp;<em>Bachiana brasilieras</em> isn't filched from Bach at all, but note for note from Vivaldi. Yes of course it's his too, like Borge's&nbsp;<em>Don Quixote</em>.</p>
