The season of 1882 began on April 22nd, 
when I gave the first performance in England of 
Liszt's great Symphony founded on Dante's 
" Divina Commedia " which he dedicated to 
Richard Wagner. It is, of course, a very diffi- 
cult work, and in the last movement a chorus 
of women's voices is required, and also an organ. 
There are three movements in all : (1) Inferno ; 
(2) Purgatorio ; (3) Paradiso (Magnificat) ; and 
besides the usual full orchestra I had again to 
engage several additional instrumentalists, which 
brought the number of players up to ninety-four. 
I don't think the audience grasped the beauties 
of the work, with its sublime last movement, 
when the female voices come in, and it did not 
have a good reception with the English Press, 
save for such enlightened critics as Dr. Francis 
Hueffer of the Times and a few more, but I was 
bound to give novelties and not continue to 
perform humdrum works, and I was justified 
in following this policy.
