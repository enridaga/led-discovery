I was introduced to Grappelli through his recordings, which so impressed me that a few years ago I persuaded him to play with me. Again, my part was prepared in advance (by Max Harris, an excellent musician), but in our recording sessions Grappelli never repeated himself; each “take” he played differently, as the inspiration of the moment suggested. He is a man I envy almost as much as I love him, who off the cuff can use any theme to express any nuance – wistfulness, brilliance, aggression, scorn – with a speed and accuracy that stretch credulity.
