<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Despite the darkness and turbulence of this mundane world, there is a fuller and brighter life to which we may confidently aspire - should we but listen to sublime music. Of all my wonderful memories in 'my' beloved RFH there is one that towers over all. Arthur Rubinstein's annual concerts - rather EVENTS - when artist, composer, instrument and audience were blended into One.&nbsp; A peak experience was his performance of the Chopin G minor Ballade as an encore.&nbsp; I was standing but a few feet away from what felt like powerhouse of spirituality. It was unforgettable.</p>
