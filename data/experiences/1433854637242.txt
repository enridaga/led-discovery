Letter from Bunsen to J. Schnorr von Carolsfield, Easter, 1830 -
.... As to our habitual life, we have allowed ourselves a new enjoyment,â€”that of having every Sunday evening five singers of the Sixtine Chapel, with from five to seven dilettanti, to perform the finest pieces of Palestrina's composition. At our family table we have now only Gerhard, to whom we are becoming more attached than ever. My relation to Tippelskirch is most cordial.
