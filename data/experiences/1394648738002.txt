The Stadthouse (or Townhouse), a large & magnificent structure, has also its clock & carillons over it in a turret, or cupola, over the centre of the building. These carillons are however also played twice a week at a stated hour, by a person called the carrilloneur, who stripping himself to his shirt & putting on a kind of gauntletts on his hands falls to work on a sett of iron keys, placed not close together like those of the organ etc. but wide apart so that each may be struck by the whole hand, which it is necessary to do in order to work the hammers upon the bells. This carrilloneur upon about 3. octaves of bells produced astonishing musical effects, which performance is admirably described in Dr Burney's Musical Travels. Tho' these are played but twice a week by the carrilloneur, they are however played every hour by the machinery of the clock & in a small degree at every quarter & smaller still at every five minutes. There being an open circular space or gallery close under the bells Richard once or twice wish'd me to go up with him at the time they played.... Having therefore the same idea of the disagreeableness of the sound of church bells when nearly in contact with them, I co'd not be prevailed upon to go near them except immediately after the chiming was over, when I was always sure they would be silent for some little time at least.
