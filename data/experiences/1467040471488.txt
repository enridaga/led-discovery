<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Mrs. C[haplin] was intensely musical, and with her clairvoyant vision could see the colours and thought-forms which the various types of music produced [&hellip;] Among the well-known composers, those, she told me, who produced the most brilliant colours and thought-forms were not the so-termed classical composers, but the more modern ones such as Wagner, Debussy, Ravel and Scriabin.</p>
