<p>I attended a concert starring Fats Domino and after a great perfromance during which he never left his piano stool, he did an encore in which his New Orleans Rythmn and Blues band strutted their stuff in the isles whilst Fats himself( not the small chap by any standards) proceeded to stand up and with&nbsp; a not inconsiderable girth, bumped the grand piano all around the stage. Now that was Rock n Roll!</p>
