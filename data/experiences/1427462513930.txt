<p>As my master, whose church music was highly approved of, conducted the principal church fes-tivals, I was allowed to sing at many of them, being a Christian, or, as I have before explained it, a Roman Catholic. I was delighted at this, not for the lucre of gain, (although they pay their singers liberally,) but because the nuns of the convents where the performances take place, send round trays full of delicious sweetmeats, made by themselves. Such traits of female attention were peculiarly gratifying to me at that period.</p>
