<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a very strange coincidence that the season which witnessed Liszt's final adieu to England should have likewise been the occasion of Anton Rubinstein's last visit. The one left in April; the other came in May. Within a period of six weeks we heard and saw, for the last time, the two greatest pianists that the world had then known. The leonine Russian gave at St. James's Hall that wonderful series of "Historical Recitals " which has since become historical in every sense that marvelously comprehensive cycle wherein he illustrated the progress and development of pianoforte music from its earliest epoch down to the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century. It was, alike mentally and physically, an extraordinary <em>tour de force</em>. No one save Rubinstein would have attempted the Herculean feat involved in the execution of such programmes. What must the task have been for the executant, if the bare labor of listening was an exhausting process! But Rubinstein was a giant, and the considerations that applied to ordinary pianists did not arise in his case. These recitals yielded the largest sum ever taken at St. James's Hall for a series of seven concerts, the gross receipts amounting to &pound;6000 ($30,000). An extra recital was given, and out of the proceeds Rubinstein divided &pound;300 ($1500) among various charitable institutions.</p>
