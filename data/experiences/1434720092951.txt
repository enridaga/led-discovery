<p>One of the best summers I ever had was when Louis [Armstrong] was at the Savoy Ballroom in Chicago. Muggsy [Spanier] and I were working with Floyd Town that summer, and Jess Stacy and Teschemacher were also in our band, but Muggsy and I had a standing date for every Sunday afternoon at the Savoy. When Louis started blowing the introduction to "West End Blues" (man, that was mellifluous), everybody in the ballroom started screaming and whistling, and then Louis lowered the boom and everybody got real groovy when we went into the first strains of "West End". Muggsy and I always got there about twenty minutes before the first number, because Louis would always be warming up and Zutty [Singleton] would be on hand, too, so we would stand outside Louis' dressing room getting a little air and jiving each other.</p>
