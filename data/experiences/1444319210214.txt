<p>On 29 June 1951 in the Cambridge summer vac ( a mature student with national service in the RAF and a year in hospital behind me) I travelled from my parents' home in Essex with friends of both sexes to London. We had a meal at Ley Oh's in Soho, and went to a concert at the Festival Hall, after which we evidently found time to walk round the Festival Exhibition before taking the uncertain train back in the early hours from Liverpool Street. The concert contained Vaughan Williams "Five Tudor Portraits" and Hamilton Harty's "The&nbsp; Mystic Trumpeter". It was perhaps the most elegant looking concert programme yet seen in those austere times (one shilling), with a gold frieze on cream paper. Conducted by Frederick Haggis, the New London Orchestra and Goldsmiths Choral Union, it was the first of many concerts enjoyed since. Asha Desmond and Harold Williams soloists. Began with Elgar's arrangement of National Anthem.&nbsp; (Terrace Stalls, Row L Seat 33).</p>
