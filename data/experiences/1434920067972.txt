Listen to wireless all afternoon (Mum & Pop are having a Marconiphone on approval). Mengelberg from Hilversum. An excellent performance of Mozart G min* Thibaud plays Lalo's Symph Espagnol very well, but sentimentally. Walk with Pop & Mum after tea, & with Pop before bed. Wireless & gramophone as well.
