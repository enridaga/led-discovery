Butterfly went very well as far as the press and the public were concerned, but not so far as to please me. It was a performance without poetry. Farrar is not too satisfactory. She sings out of tune, forces her voice, and it does not carry well in the large space of the theatre. I had no struggle to obtain two full-dress rehearsals, including the general! Nobody knew anything. Dufrich had not taken the trouble to study the mise en scène, because the composer was there. Vigna did his best but he can’t control the orchestra. As long as he had me at his elbow things went very well, but whenever I left the field there were disasters.
