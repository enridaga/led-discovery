I must tell you that Kessler gives little musical at-homes every Friday. We all go and play there is no definite programme, we play whatever happens to turn up. Thus on the Friday before last we had Ries's Concerto in C sharp minor, played with quartet accompaniment, and also Humme's E flat major Trio and Beethoven's last Trio, I've never heard anything so great: in it Beethoven snaps his fingers at the whole world. Although these things came after Beethoven's Trio they did not suffice to efface the enormous impression which the Trio made on me, particularly as it was well performed. Serwaczyiiski accompanied, which he does extremely well. . . .
