Today saw a great Intercession Service on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral, in the presence of nearly 4,000 troops of London Territorials. Vast crowds stretched all the way down Ludgate Hill, and along the side streets. Muz and I went to the offices of the London Diocese Registry. Daddy and Uncle Hugh are Joint Registrars to the London Diocese, and their office windows look straight over the great space and steps in front of St Paul’s. We reached the office by back ways so as to avoid the great crowds.
     We had not long to wait before the Mounted Police appeared at the head of the procession. First the Clergy and the Bishop, then the fine troops in khaki, all London recruits, and these ranged themselves symmetrically in semi-circles at the foot of the steps. The Bishop stood on the steps supported by the Clergy, the Staff Officers and the massed bands, and the service began with O God our help in ages past, sung by the whole assembly.
     It was a most impressive sight, especially when the western sun lit up the group of white-robed figures on the platform, the scarlet cassocks of the two Bishops, and the multitude of khaki-clad warriors below.
