<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My first memory of the visit to the Royal Festival Hall was to a concert of Mantovani and his orchestra. My cousin brought me as he had a spare ticket. I thought it was the most wonderful night of music I had ever heard. You see I had just come over from Ireland to live in London and I have never forgotten that night of music. I wanted it to go on and on and never end. I have always loved the Festival Hall - it has a great atmosphere. I hope it does not change much. I thought it fine as it was. Sometimes change is not always for the better.</p>
