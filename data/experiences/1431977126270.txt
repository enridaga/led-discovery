And I was called to Darmstadt, Colomba having been commanded to make her appearance on the occasion of a Court wedding–not as a Fest Oper, as the Hessian Court was in mourning–on April 29. How much of that honour I owed to Bulow I never knew. Hofkapellmeister Willem de Haan and the company took great pains with the production, and a pleasant time was provided for me in the stiff and rather dull Resident-Stadt. An excellent orchestra and willing singers gave of their best.
