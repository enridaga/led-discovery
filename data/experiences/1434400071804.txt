Go out afterwards to Phil. concert (Queen's Hall) - Malcolme Sargent - Idomeneo ov. & Surprise Symphony - tepid performances - rather bad in detail.* Ravel's New pft. concerto which I cannot take seriously. Brilliantly played by Marguérite Long & inefficiently conducted by Ravel.** The slow movement is piffle! Léon plays Eugene Goosen's attractive Oboe Conc.*** superbly as can only he. De Falla's El Amor Brujo, which wears very well, to end an interesting concert. Sargent not too bad in modern works seemed out of place in classical.
