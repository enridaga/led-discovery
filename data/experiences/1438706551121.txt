Overtures were immediately made to her for an engagement for the ensuing season in London; whereat Sophie Cruvelli was "in ecstacies." Her family objected that it was "too early yet" for her to risk the ordeal of an English public ; but the young and spirited prima donna herself listened with "charmed ears" to my proposals. In my own opinion of Sophie Cruvelli, I was fortified by that of Rubini, who congratulated me on my intention.</span></p>
