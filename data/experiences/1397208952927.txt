On my first visit to Liverpool I was attracted by a good-looking music-shop, kept by Mr. Hime, and I bought of him a cheap edition of Haydn’s canzonetts, published by his brother in Dublin...Mr. Hime, finding that I was a stranger who had some little knowledge of the art, said he was going to have a quartett party in the evening, and would be glad to see me. I was flattered by the invitation, and waited upon him. I met that fine violinist, Yaniewicz, whom they had engaged as the leader of their concerts. I heard him play a quartett of Mozart’s. It was one of a set of three, commencing with a violoncello solo. I was charmed by the breadth and scope of his play; I had never before heard any style so magnificent. As it was the first quartett I had heard of Mozart (like Gainsborough, who, on hearing Fisher play, insisted upon purchasing his oboe), I bought the book, and brought it home with me. At supper we were joined by several ladies and gentlemen, for a vocal party, in which I met Mr. Webbe, son of the great glee-composer. He was repeatedly asked to give us something on the piano-forte, but declined, saying there was not anything he could recollect. Some time having been lost in these intreaties, I ventured to observe that I thought I could mention a piece he could play. Seeing I was a stranger, he said, in a supercilious tone, “And pray, Sir, what is that?"  “A composition of your father’s, ‘Discord, dire sister of the slaughtering power' ” He was then sitting on the music-stool, with his back to the piano-forte; he instantly revolved upon his seat and executed it in a masterly style. I had the thanks of the company, and he seemed pleased with the manner in which I had entrapped him: he came up to me, and we talked over the merits of this fine composition. I engaged to breakfast with him the next morning, and was much gratified by the knowledge he possessed upon musical subjects.
