'. . . On October 31, the Consecration is to take place — the title will be, 'Bishop of the Church of St. James at Jerusalem,' in which all parties are understood.' ....
'I hope Ernest wrote to you all details of October 15 :—never had I so celebrated the day, and never again can I so solemnise it !' ....
'I went to fetch Gladstone, to drive with me to the dinner at the Star and Garter, at Richmond, at five o'clock—in the finest weather, after three weeks of rain. Dr. Alexander gave the King's health in an enthusiastic speech. I returned
thanks, and gave the health of the Queen, and afterwards of the Queen Dowager ; whereupon we sang (in a chorus) 'Heil ! Friedrich Wilhelm, heil ! ' with a slight alteration in the third verse.

Der du mit Herz und Muth
Bitterer Kriegeswiith
Richtig gewebxt,
Vater dea Vaterlands,
Schutze des deutschen Manns
Heimischen Heerd !

Hereupon Ernest alone, with chorus, sang to the tune of 'Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser,' ' Gott erhalte unsern Konig,' &c. Last was sung, ' Wer sprenget auf dem stolzen Ross,'  translated by a young lady.'
