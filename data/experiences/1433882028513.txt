<p>I had the honour of being introduced to the Noble men's Catch Club, at the Thatched House Tavern, by Temple West, Esq., who was president of the evening, and I sat next to him in the chair of the Duke of Argyle, who happened to be absent....Besides noblemen, and many other distinguished persons, there were not less than twenty professional gentlemen, eminent as vocalists...These convivial meetings commence on the opening of parliament, and continue every Tuesday, with a splendid dinner at four o'clock, immediately after which the grace, <em>Non nobis Domine</em>, is sung by the whole company...I ventured to choose that beautiful composition of Webb's, &mdash; " If Love and all the world were young." What was extraordinary, it could not be found in the index ; but, after much search, a copy was procured. Lord Clinton asked me what part I should like to sing, and I chose the bass...we began the glee, and I did my best to sustain the part. I was pretty alert, or I should have had my heels tripped up by the tasteful liberties they took in performing it. However, on its being finished, I received a slight tap of approbation from Mr. Vaughan, who whispered in my ear, " You are a scientific performer, Sir." More than ordinary applause followed, and I was complimented upon my choice by one or two noblemen, who said they had never heard it before.</p>
