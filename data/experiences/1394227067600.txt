On my next visit therefore to my father one of my first questions was, how the organ business was settled, when he told me that Hudson & Wheatley were the successful candidates, the latter of whom was to live in Greenwich & generally do the duty, which he continued to do afterwards constantly in the style he set out with, giving us perpetual Cornet pieces, except about once a month or 6 weeks perhaps a Trumpet & Echo piece. It was the more remarkable his playing always Cornet pieces, as they always require some degree of execution in the performance, but Mr Wheatley never had a good finger on the instrument in his life.
