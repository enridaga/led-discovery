<p>My lessons with Moscheles proved highly&nbsp;interesting and profitable, and sometimes&nbsp;amusing as well... Chopin and Schumann&nbsp;were the most advanced composers he admitted&nbsp;for study in his lessons, and I remember well,&nbsp;playing once a phrase of Beethoven's in a some-what rubato style, his gently chiding me and&nbsp;innocently saying, "My dear sir, you may do that with Schumann or Chopin, but not when&nbsp;you play Beethoven or me"</p>
