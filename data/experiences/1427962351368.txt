[Hiring horn players in the late 1950’s], of all the guys I heard, one stood out in particular--a baritone saxophonist named Leroy Cooper. Sometimes they called him Hog.

Leroy was an amazing player and--as with Don Wilkerson and Fathead--there were very few if any limitations to what he could do. Hog played fast, like Bird, when he wanted to. He played blues--very filthy blues. And he could romp and wail with as much old-fashioned spirit as Harry Carney…

Phil Guilbeau was a cat I spotted playing first trumpet for the house band at the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C. He could play--I heard that instantly--so I hit on him and hired him immediately. Turned out to be one of my most expressive musicians.
