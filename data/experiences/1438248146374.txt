<p>Early dinner &amp; we both go to the opera to see Strauss' incredible Salome. V. finely done, with a superb Salome - Hildegard Ranczak - who sang and acted in a first rate manner. The rest of the cast was good - with a few exceptions - &amp; the orchestra played v. well under Hans Knappertsbusch, who isn't so bad when he can't be seen. Of course the idea &amp; the music, are too thrilling &amp; horrible for words. A great &amp; epoch-making work.&nbsp;</p>
