The Weimar folk have fought a battle with the Leipzigers; but there were no slain, only a few wounded. Liszt is reported to have said before the concert: 'I suppose they will prepare a defeat for me,' but they did no such thing. He conducted his 'Preludes,' which, although rather obscure, have many grand effects. His stormy 'Mazeppa' music, and his pianoforte Concerto, played with extraordinary power by BÃ¤low, were warmly but not enthusiastically received.
