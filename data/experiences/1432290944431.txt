The constant rain disappointed us yesterday of our intended walk, so we allowed ourselves to be enticed to a 'Zither' and vocal concert, that was said to be national, and was not enough so for our taste. The costume was Tyrolese, the zithers also; but the worm of modern music had gnawed its way into the healthy Tyrolese fruit. We had to endure in the first part some pieces of 'Martha,' all kinds of waltzes, and a 'Strapazier Polka;' we ran off before the second part began.
