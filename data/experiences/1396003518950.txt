Have 1 hrs. lesson with John Ireland (after waiting 3/4 hr): very nice tho' very subduing! He's going to take me thro' a course of Palestrina; tho' to reassure me he tells me that every musician, worth his salt has done this. Practise 1 hr (right hand alone) 2.30-3.30; write a little more of concerto. I go to dinner (there & back, tube,) with Howard Ferguson; jolly nice time. He plays me his Symphony, which I like immensely. Also go through Ravel trio, & some of my things. Return 9.15-10.0.
