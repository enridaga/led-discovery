<p>From Leicester Baillot repaired to London, and made his debut in the Philharmonic Society, and was justly esteemed the greatest performer on the violin that had ever visited this country. While at Leicester, he prepared his concerts for that occasion, and requested me to name some popular song tune for him to introduce in it, as a slow movement, and I named " O Nanny wilt thou gang with me," composed originally as a song, by my friend Mr. Carter. This melody was charmingly introduced, and being played by a Frenchman, was considered a compliment to the audience.</p>
