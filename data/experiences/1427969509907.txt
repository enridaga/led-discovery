There was a lot of black music in the last half of the sixties that I could relate to. More blacks sang the way they really were...

One musician towered above the rest. That was Aretha [Franklin]. She's terrible, man. I'd been following her ever since she was fourteen or fifteen, singing in her daddy's church. And she always sang from her inners. She's my one and only sister. In many ways, she's got her father's feeling and passion. When C. L. Franklin--one of the last great preachers --delivers a sermon, he builds his case so beautifully you can't help but see the light. Same when Aretha sings. She's all a-fire.

I loved her gospel singing, I loved her when she was on Columbia, and I loved her when she started singing for Atlantic and my old friends Ahmet, Jerry, and Tommy.
