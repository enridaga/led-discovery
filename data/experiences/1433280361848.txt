<p>Among my musical visits none were more delightful than those I frequently paid to Mr. Johnson, at Aston Rectory, in Derbyshire [...] To concerts I was invited, and had much pleasure. Our music consisted of the instrumental works of Corelli, Bocherini, and Handel. Soon after, we had Haydn and Mozart ; but it was not till Beethoven's Sinfonies were published, as chamber music, that we became acquainted with the wonderful thoughts of that great composer...We frequently had the neighbouring clergy as auditors.</p>
