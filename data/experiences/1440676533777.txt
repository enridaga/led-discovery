<p class="MsoNormal">Jabbo [Smith] was standing out in front, and I'll say this, he was <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">blowing</em> - really coming on like the Angel Gabriel himself. Every time he'd fan that brass derby on a high F or G. Altis, his buddy from Small&rsquo;s would yell, &ldquo;Play it, Jabbo! Go ahead, Rice!&rdquo; (Everybody from Charleston called each other rice. It was the hometown nickname.) &ldquo;Who needs Louis?&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;You can blow him down any time.&rdquo; When Johnson's set ended with Jabbo soaring above the rhythm and the crowd noise, everybody gave them a big hand. I could tell from the broad grin on Jabbo&rsquo;s face that he felt that once and for all he&rsquo;d shown Satch who was king.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then all of a sudden [King] Louis bounced onto the opposite stage. [...] I've forgotten the tune, but I'll never forget his first note. He blew a searing, soaring, altissimo, fantastic high note and held it long enough for everyone of us musicians to gasp. Benny Carter, who has perfect pitch, said, &ldquo;Damn! That&rsquo;s high F!&rdquo; Just about that time, Louis went into a series of cadenzas and continued into his first number.</p>
