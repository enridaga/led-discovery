Letter from Bunsen to his wife, St. Leonard's: 4th September, 1851 -
'Out of children grow up people,' as the German proverb says ; and out of pages grow books. My ' Hippolytus ' has grown into two volumes. The order of the day is : I rise at five ; walk on the sea-shore from half-past eight to nine ;
breakfast ; work till twelve, then a second walk till one o'clock. The Princess holds her Court sitting on the sands ; we talk and read aloud. Rest from one to half-past ; then dine ; from two to three, talking and music ; from three to
six, driving or walking ; from six to eight, working ; then tea ; after that, general conversazione. I sit on the balcony, head uncovered : Ernest sings, so does that dear Else.
