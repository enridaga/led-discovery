<p>Letter from Bunsen to a Friend, 22nd December, 1856 - Imagine that my married children have united in making me a great surprise against the New Year by the valuable present of a billiard-table ! Up to the day when it came, and was put up, I played daily at bowls in the garden with Theodore (who had, without saying anything, meanwhile arranged the whole), but since then it has become too cold for bowls; and thus the substitute has arrived exactly at the right time. You know, that for almost forty years without exception we have, alone in our home-circle, sat up to await the year's beginning, with choral-singing and other solemn music, and in serious conversation with pauses between. This time we shall also do so, but without the dear Sternbergs (as Theodora has the influenza), but they will be with us in spirit, and you also : is it not so? Now farewell, dear friend, and receive my heart's thanks for all the kindness and friendship which you have shown me in this departing year ! God bless you, and your house so rich in blessings, abundantly in the new year !</p>
