Malibran and De Bériot appeared at eleven o'clock, after our eighty guests had satisfied their musical appetite with English vocal music, solos by Lipinsky and Servais, and my own 'Concert Fantastique'. She looked weary, and, when she sang, one scarcely recognized Malibran, she was so voiceless. [...] She was soon herself, however, and sang two 'Freyschütz' scenas in German, a comic English duet with John Parry, three Spanish, Italian, and French songs, winding up with the duet, 'Cadence du Diable', for herself and De Bériot, in which she prefaces his daring and marvellous violin passages with the words, ' Voyez comme le diable prélude'. [...] John Parry amused us with his masterly parody of the scena in the Wolf's Glen in the 'Freyschütz'.  With a sheet of music rolled up, with one end in his mouth and the other resting on the music desk, he produced the deepest horn or trombone notes; his hands worked the keys, and his feet a tea-tray.
