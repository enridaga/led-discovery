F. Cramer, Lindley, and Dragonetti, radiant with complacent smiles and triumphant airs. Lindley, with his inevitable Cadenza, seems to lead up to a happy close, but it is only to return to his everlasting arpeggios and flageolet tones. It reminds me of the fly which will come back to the sugar on the plate. And yet this has its charms for a certain class of subscribers. No wonder they don't venture on Beethoven's last quartets.
