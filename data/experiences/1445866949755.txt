<p>My husband and I brought our 3 daughters and my parents to see the dance version of A Christmas Carol.&nbsp; My father is in a wheelchair and he was ably helped by a steward who took him via the lift in the back of the stalls.&nbsp; The space for a wheelchair was adequate but not overly comfortable. We were all thrilled when my parents were transferred to the Royal Box for the remainder of the performance.</p>
