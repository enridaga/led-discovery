Ernest Read.... One occasion sticks in my mind because I shared it with the youngest soloist I ever met - a beautiful little six-year old Icelandic girl called Thorunn Tryggvason, who played a movement from a Mozart piano concerto (without pedals, of course) with great Ã©lan. I have met her many times since,  many land the world over, including Iceland. She is now Mrs Vladimir Ashkenazy.
