In the part of Amina, in "La Sonnambula," she surpassed all previous expectations. In simplicity, tenderness, and grace, in perfect impersonation, these qualities being combined with exquisite delivery of the music, she was universally declared to have beaten all her compeers "out of the field." Not only was she the Sonnamhula, but Amina was generally looked upon as the culminating point of her unprecedently successful season. Ably seconded by Gardoni, she stamped the part as her own, and threw a fresh charm over an opera, always beautiful, it is true, but yet "hackneyed" to the last degree.</span></p>
