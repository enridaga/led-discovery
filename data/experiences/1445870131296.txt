<p>At a very low point in my life I happened to see that Alfred Brendel was going to be playing Schubert at the Festival Hall.&nbsp; (He is my favourite pianist and was playing my favourite pieces).&nbsp; I bought a ticket only the day before the concert and assumed I would be up in the Gods.&nbsp; I was truly stunned to find that I was only six rows back and had a perfect view of the great man's hands.&nbsp; I was mesmorised from the moment he started playing.&nbsp; When you are very low you assume everything is going to be a disappointment.&nbsp; This was such a wonderful moment for me it proved to be a changing point in my life.</p>
