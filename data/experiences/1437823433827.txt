His fame had preceded him. Leghorn, where seven years before he had forfeited his famous Stradivarius and won a Guarnerius, received him with open arms, although his appearance was marked by an amusing contretemps. He came on to the stage limping, having run a nail into his heel. At all times odd- looking, he, no doubt, looked all the more peculiar under these circumstances, and there was some tittering among the audience. Just as he began, the candles fell out of his desk more laughter. He went on playing, the first string broke more laughter. He played the rest of the concerto through on three strings, but the laughter now changed to vociferous applause at this feat.</span></p>
