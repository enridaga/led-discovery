Chapel at 8.15,10.30 & 6.30. Quite nice services, with a typ. J.R.E sermon at 6.30. Quite harmless but striking out no new path & lacking any orig. or helpful thought. Write letters in morning, & then listen to grm. in aft. (pt. of time Brahms D'bl concerto on new grm.) It is a marvellous thing, I adore the first mov. & 2nd also but not so much the 3rd as yet. Try over with Greatorex & Miss Chapman my Bagatelle & scrap of Mendlesohn D min. It goes quite well, better than I expected.
