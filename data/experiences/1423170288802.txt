... somewhere in the West Country, when I had a wild guess at a tune which seemed to contain a large chorus, a big orchestra, and some very exciting noises. I said I really didn't know the opera, but it sounded vaguely Russian, an could be Glazounov [sic]. It wasn't an opera, it seemed. It was Rachmaninov, a work for chorus and orchestra called 'The Bells'. I had played it with the London Symphony the previous night, and they were now playing a record I had made a month before. I can only say that it sounds different from where I sit, and that in any case working with the LSO involves so many diverse activities that the ability to forget is certainly as important as the capacity to remember.
