<p>Gounod asked me if I would like to go to the Conservatoire Concert next morning, and of course I said "Yes": he then offered to fetch me from my hotel and take me there with him. Unfortunately, he was taken ill, so could not go, and his son came in his stead and we went together to the concert, which took place in the Salle du Conservatoire. It was conducted by M. Taffanel, and was a wonderful performance. The orchestra is celebrated all over Europe, and I must say I never heard a finer performance of Beethoven's<em> Eroica</em>. It was a revelation to me, and "The Funeral March" affected me to tears. Choruses from Gluck's <em>Armida and Iphigenia in Aulis</em> were also given.</p>
