<p>I had tea with Lady Cunard....Then in came Lord Donegall, a glib Irish youth, dark sallow slick, on the Press.&nbsp; Don't they treat you like a dog? I said. "No, not at all" he replied, astonished that a marquis could be treated like a dog by anyone.&nbsp; And then we went up &amp; up to see pictures on stairs in ballrooms &amp; finally to Lady C's bedroom, hung entirely with flower pieces. The bed has its triangular canopy of rose red silk; the windows, looking on the square, are hung with green brocade.&nbsp; Her poudreuse - like mine only painted &amp; gilt stood open with golden brushes looking glasses, &amp; there on her gold slippers were neatly laid gold stockings.&nbsp; All this paraphernalia for one stringy old hop o' my thumb. She set the two great musical boxes playing &amp; I said did she lie in bed listening to them? But no. She has nothing fantastic in that way about her.</p>
