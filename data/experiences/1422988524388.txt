Lesson with Benjamin 12.20. Start a new Psalm (150) before that. Practise N.S.M. 2.30–3.30, hair cut at Whiteleys. After dinner I go to Arthur Benjamin’s House in Carlton Hill. To hear William Primrose play his Vln Concerto (new) & Sonatina (Vln & Pft) – both v. fine works. The rest of the London St. Quart were[crossed out] are there (Primrose is the violist); & seem to be very nice. The 2nd Violin (John Petri?) brings me to Edgware Rd. underground in his car. Arrive home abt. 12.45 a.m.
