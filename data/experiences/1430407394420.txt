Mr. Harris came over to the theater in Philadelphia. He was the one who had insisted all along on the song staying in, and now he said: 

"We will try out ‘Supper Time’ at the Wednesday matinee and evening performances. If the audiences like it, ‘Supper Time’ stays in." 

There were some good Catholics working backstage, including Minnie Eisler and Jackie, the wardrobe mistress. And before that Wednesday matinee those people burned plenty of candles for me. After praying for help from Him I went on and sang "Supper Time." When I was through and that big, heavy curtain came down I was called back again and again. I had stopped the show with a type of song never heard before in a revue, and a number that until then had been a question mark. 

"Supper Time" was in the second act. Marilyn Miller and Clifton Webb had to follow it with a flippant bedroom dance. They didn't like the idea of trying to be cute and amusing right after the people had heard that grim, overwhelming song. 

"It stays in," said Sam. H. Harris, the producer.
