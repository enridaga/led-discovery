<p>Imagine Joachim's feelings when in the&nbsp;evening, as he presented Hauptmann to the&nbsp;King, he had to hear His Majesty say to the delighted composer : " Ah, my dear Mr.&nbsp;Hauptmann, I am so glad to make your&nbsp;personal acquaintance. ... I have always&nbsp;been a great admirer of your excellent compositions. . . . There is especially a Sonata . . .&nbsp;I think it is in G ... which I am particularly&nbsp;devoted to. ... Such a lovely Adagio . . .&nbsp;Joachim must always play it twice to me;&nbsp;isn't that so, Joachim?" Of course, poor&nbsp;Joachim not only had to bow his assent, for&nbsp;the King could not have seen that, but audibly&nbsp;to express it!</p>
