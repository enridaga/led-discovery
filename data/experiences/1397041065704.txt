As before when I had the German patients, the whole population of Étretat turned out to see them carried in (37 were on stretchers), and they made themselves such a nuisance that I closed the ground-floor shutters. The youth of Étretat have been parading in front of the house, whistling and singing the ‘Marseillaise’ for the benefit of the Germans, and our own people are as bad. I find bunches of strange orderlies gazing at them, and I make myself thoroughly unpleasant and banish the lot. I’m not going to keep a peep-show. If they want to see Germans, I tell them to join an infantry regiment and they will get all the Germans they want.
