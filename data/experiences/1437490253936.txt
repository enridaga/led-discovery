Among the musicians present there were Dusseck and Cramer, who played on the piano, and were accompanied by Viotti and Jarnowickz, the celebrated violin players. Lady Flint's desire to gratify her friends, however, was often frustrated by the annoying conduct of those who had no taste for music, who disturbed the enjoyment of some of the most beautiful pieces by the rattling of their cups and saucers, and the tone in which their conversation was carried on. Jarnowickz, the violin player, having upon one occasion commenced a concerto by Beethoven, accompanied by his little orchestra, consisting of Cramer, Spagnoletti, Lindley, and Dragonetti, suddenly ceased playing, and apologised for so doing by stating, that the discord caused by the tea-drinkers was such as to mar the effect of the immortal composer's music. He added, that those who thus showed that they did not understand music, would perhaps appreciate better the piece which he was about to play,&mdash;viz., "God save the King," to which they would listen at least with respect. The reproof had a good effect, for always afterwards a complete silence reigned during the performance.</span></p>
