<p>When Sophie Tucker came to New orleans in about 1910 or 1911, they would have a ballyhoo truck. (There was always a big to-do about shows and dances, and the bands would get on those trucks and wagons and ride all over town.) Sophie Tucker and the Avon Four, who were playin' at the Orpheum Theatre, were on one of the those trucks, and I followed them around all day. At that time, she was singin' "Some of These days" and "Alexander's Ragtime Band", and other new songs, and after hearin' her sing them, I'd go home and play them over until I got them under control.</p>
