<p>At the seventh concert I conducted Signor Schira's overture to his opera, The Lord of Burleigh. Apart from being a successful composer, he was one of the most sought-after singing professors. Frederick Cowen's "Festival Overture" was also performed under my direction, and Alfred Jaell, a distinguished pianist of immense girth but with an exquisite touch, played Schumann's Concerto in A minor. Mile Titiens sang the aria "Non mi dir" from Don Giovanni with overpowering effect, and on leaving the platform she said to me in German, "Mit Ihnen braucht man nicht zu probieren" (With you it is unnecessary to rehearse) as we had not had a rehearsal. I thought this a great compliment, and felt very proud of it.</p>
