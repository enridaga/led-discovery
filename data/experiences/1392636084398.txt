Having seen this [the English] procession I went to witness that of our King [Francis], which was in this fashion. There were no footmen, but about 400 horses, all gentlemen in good trim, the doublets of cloth of gold being in the proportion of 20 to 1 of any other material.  Then came the Switzers with their feathers in their caps reaching to the clouds; then the 12 trumpeters or "miquelets" with 12 heralds, and the trombones, who played the whole time.
