It isn't easy to come to terms with the fact that the very young second fiddle in the Martin String Quartet in London, with whom one did a very early broadcast - 1948 I think - of a Mozart Quintet, for the BBC (which was far from epoch-making on anyone's part), is now Sir Neville Marriner. (We get along very nicely, in spite of the fact.)
