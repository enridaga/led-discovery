During my first year, our house, like Caliban's Isle, was "full of strange noises." In one room a couple of violinists–good ones–practised. A clarinettist blew his loudest in the wood-cellar; a double-bass grunted in the wash-house; a trombone was heard from a corner in the garden, while other wind-instruments added to the din from various parts of the house.
