<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My earliest memory is the first visit of Rostropovich (?) to England, when he performed the Dvorak cello concerto in RFH. I do not have the exact date, nor which orchestra or conductor. But the impact of his extraordinary playing is still vivid in my mind - in particular the extraordinary quality of his legato playing with such fullness of tone. This was quite unlike anything I had heard before. I believe I had only recently left the RCM as a cello student.</p>
