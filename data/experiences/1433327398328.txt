While at Kendal Sir George was induced to give a short organ recital, to the immense pleasure of a large congregation assembled in the fine old parish church. This is claimed to be the largest in England, having five aisles. Recitals in churches were a thing he would rarely give, as he held very strongly that organs were put there to assist men to worship God, and not for the glorification of the organist. After his death, Mr. Armstrong, the organist of Kendal, referring to this visit, wrote as follows to Lady Elvey. "The loss of Sir George is deeply felt everywhere. We in Kendal always looked forward to his visits with real pleasure, and delighted to hear him on our parish church organ.
