<p>I seize this opportunity of paying a warm tribute to that veteran English conductor, Sir Henry Wood, a musician of the first rank, whose great gifts I had an opportunity of appreciating quite recently - in the autumn of 1934 - at a concert in which I conducted &lsquo;Pers&eacute;phone&rsquo; and he most perfectly &lsquo;L&rsquo;Oiseau de Feu&rsquo; and&rsquo; Feu d&rsquo;Artifice&rsquo;, and accompanied me with so sure a hand when I played my 'Capriccio'.</p>
