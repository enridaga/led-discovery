<p>After he had made a record date with us in 1935, I always had a yen for Ben [Webster]. So as soon as we thought we could afford him, we added him on, which gave us a five-piece saxophone section for the first time. Although Barney Bigard used to play tenor saxophone, clarinet was his main instrument, so Ben Webster was really our first tenor specialist and soloist. His splendid performances on "Cottontail," "Conga Brava," "All Too Soon," "Just a-Settin' and a-Rockin'," and "What Am I Here For?" were a sensation everywhere, and he soon became a big asset to the band. His enthusiasm and drive had an especially important influence on the saxophone section.</p>
