<p>Lil never was flash. She is a fine soloist and can lay those chords four beats to a measure and solid just like the doctor ordered.</p>

<p>Getting back to Lil, most of the tunes Louis composed, Lil wrote the music to. Louis would play the melody and Lil would write it down as fast as Louis played.</p>
<p>When playing some of Louis Armstrong's records recorded by the Hot Five, notice the foundation. It will speak for itself.</p>
