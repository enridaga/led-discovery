<p>That Dreamland was some place. It was <em>big</em>&nbsp;and always packed. And you had to be a singer then--there were no microphones and those bands were marvelous. King Oliver's band was there when I started (Louis [Armstrong] wasn't with him yet), and, I'm telling you, you could sing one chorus or fifty or sixty choruses and that band would never be a beat away.

<p>Everybody would go to hear Tony Jackson after hours. Tony was just marvelous--a fine musician, spectacular, but still soft.

He had mixed grey hair and always had a drink on the piano--always. It was just beer but he drank plenty of that.</p>
