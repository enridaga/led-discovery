<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">The first concert I went to shortly after the Royal Festival Hall opened was given by the London Mozart Players conducted by the late Harry Blech.&nbsp; Although the acoustics of the Hall have been criticised since, in those days, the music sounded to me to be fresh and clear.&nbsp; My other abiding memory of the 50's is of the elderly figure of Otto Klemperer wonderfully conducting the Philharmonia through a series of Beethoven concerts and receiving rapturous applause from the audience, all within a few years of the end of the war.&nbsp; I continue to be a regular concert goer, and look forward to hearing the LMP and the Philharmonia again in the refurbished RFH. &nbsp;</p>
