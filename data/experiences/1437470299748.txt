Now, as a matter of fact, this is not so extravagant. It really only works out at &pound;20 a performance, and there are many artistes who will only sing two songs at a concert for &pound;80. Leno's golden asset was the domesticity of his humour. He took the ordinary things of daily life and wrote, or gagged, round them. He never knew his part on a first night, and never learnt his songs. Once he sang a song on Boxing Night entirely at variance with every note of the melody in the band parts. How the house yelled and screamed with delight! "How like Dan!" they shouted.</span></p>
