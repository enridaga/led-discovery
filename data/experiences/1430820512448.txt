After I left him [Miles Davis] in '87 I saw him a couple of times at different various shows and such, and we were very friendly, always cordial, and it was always good to see each other. But we were fairly distant at that point. Somewhere around, I don't know, just before he passed away [in 1991], when he did the Montreaux show for Quincy [Jones], I ended up putting that show together for Quincy and Miles... 
That was an amazing show. That was the hardest ... in the seven years I worked for him, that was the hardest show I've seen him doâ€¦
 He [Miles Davis] was reading charts, he was like, he was pulling notes that he hadn't pulled in ... that he hadn't tried to look for in thirty years ... that kind of thing. And he didn't have to ... prior to that I think he did the Paris show where it was a tribute to Miles, with McLaughlin and everybody came on stage. And you know, Miles played on that show, and Miles, well ... he needed to be Miles at that point, be the center stage attraction. But on the Montreaux show, he and Quincy were, were reaching for music that needed to be reached and they, thank god they did it, but it was, it took a lot of work.
