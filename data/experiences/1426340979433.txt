It was at the College that I first played for Beecham, though only in a rehearsal of the "Eroica" symphony. I remember a great deal of laughter, generally at somebody's expense and finally at mine. Determined to be noticed, I belted out the second clarinet part in the last movement with great ferocity. A pained expression came over Sir Thomas's face. " The second clarinet" he said in those endlessly imitated tones, "sounds exactly like a hurdy-gurdy."
