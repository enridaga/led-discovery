<p>I travelled by train, with the then love of my life, early one morning from Glasgow to London and returned that night on the sleeper ...... all to see Keith Jarrett....it was magical and inspiring even if he was a little bit of a diva.... we were all mesmorised by his playing when he suddenly stopped and walked across the stage and began shouting at someone in the audience beleiving them to be taking photographs, which we had been warned was most definitely prohibited....later an apology was forthcoming as what he saw was a light reflecting off something and not a camera at all!!! However it was easy to forgive his ill-mannered disposition when he played so amazingly.</p>
