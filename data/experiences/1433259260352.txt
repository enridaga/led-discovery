<p>I think you can measure success as a musician in several different ways. There's the guy can play a little bit of everything. I respect people who can play anything or sing anything; they just have the ability to play music. But it moves me more, and this is just a personal thing, to see someone who has their own style, like B.B. King. I can hear him play three notes and I know it's B.B. King. I can hear Sam play three notes on the harmonica or sing a little, and I know it's him. He has a unique style that's all his own. As musicians, that's what we all strive for, to have some unique quality about us that makes us different and sets us apart from everyone else.</p>
