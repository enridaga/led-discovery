This was a time in my life [around eleven or twelve years old] when my musical horizons were expanding. Course I already knew church music. I had been singing it all my life. On records I heard gospel singers like Wings Over Jordan and the Golden Gate Quartet. In school I sang in the choir--they even gave me a little uniform--and some of us kids put together our own informal singing group, doing the same kind of rhythmic gospel musicâ€¦

You also have to understand that the South was full of country-and-western sounds--hillbilly music, we called it --and I can't recall a single Saturday night in those years when I didn't listen to the Grand Ole Opry on the radio. I loved Grandpa Jones and those other characters. I could hear what they were doing and appreciate the feeling behind it. Jimmie Rodgers, Roy Acuff, Hank Snow, Hank Williams, and later Eddie Arnold--these were singers I listened to all the time. I wasn't fanatical about their music, but I certainly dug it and paid it some mind.

At the same time I didn't lose interest in the big white bands--Dorsey and Miller and Goodman and Krupa and Shaw. And naturally I knew the black bands--Jay Mc-Shann and Jimmie Lunceford, Lucky Millinder, Buddy Johnson, Basie, Ellington, and later Billy Eckstine, whose version of "Blowing the Blues Away" is something I still play.

Al Hibbler singing with Duke, Ella singing with Chick Webb or the Ink Spots--this was music which hit me hard. I also knew all the white singers of the time: Bing Crosby, Dick Haymes, Vaughn Monroe, Tony Martin. Of the whites, only one--Jo Stafford--impressed me much. She had a silky quality to her voice which I liked; there was something haunting about her style.

I listened to the Hit Parade on the radio in those years and heard the early sides of Frank Sinatra, though I don't think he really started wailing till later in his career; he's one of those people who has improved and mellowed with age.
