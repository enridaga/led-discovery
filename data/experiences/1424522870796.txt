<p>1974, sitting at the very front to see Boris Christoff - terrifying, not because I expected to be called upon to sing along with him, but just in case I breathed too loud and he might just LOOK AT ME WITH THE FEROCIOUS GLARE THAT ONLY HE COULD DO. I managed to survive by not breathing for 90 minutes - an extraordinary singer. The only other time I have felt quite so un-nerved was to find myself sitting at the very front for a Max Wall performace (not at RFH).</p>
