At one of the Philharmonic Concerts, he played three of my 'Studies' quite admirably. Faultless in the way of execution, but by his powers he has completely metamorphosed these pieces; they have become more his Studies than mine. With all that they please me, and I shouldn't like to hear them played in any other way by him. The Paganini Studies, too, were uncommonly interesting to me. He does anything he chooses, and does it admirably, and those hands raised aloft in the air come down but seldom, wonderfully seldom, upon a wrong key.
