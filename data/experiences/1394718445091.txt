About this time Mr Peachy our neighbour got a small organ for his drawing room which immediately attracted my notice. being impatient to hear it & giving Mr peachy a broad hint one day (tho' we did not visit) he imediately [sic] invited my sister to come & play upon it & all of us to come & hear it, on w'ch a morning was fix'd & my sister play'd some of Handel's concertos, during which my delight was to shift the stops for the forte & piano parts, there being no pedal for that purpose. The youngest Miss Peachy also play'd, but not near so well as my sister.
