And there were at proclamation four trumpeters and three heralds of arms and the Earl of Arundel, the Earl of Shrewsbury, the Earl Pembroke, my lord treasurer, my lord of the privy seal, my Lord Cobham, my lord warden, Mr. Mason, and my lord mayor, and divers other noble men. And this was done at the cross in Cheap. And from that place they went unto Paul's. And there was&nbsp;<em>Te Deum laudamus</em>&nbsp;with song and the organs&nbsp;playing and all the bells ringing through London, and bonfires and pictures in every street. And wine and beer and all and every street full of bonfires. And there was money cast away.</span></p>
