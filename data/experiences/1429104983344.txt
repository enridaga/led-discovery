<p>When the season ended I went back to Harlem, and the first showman I called on was Edmond. He warned me not to try to work for anyone else. "This is not Atlantic City, Ethel," he told me. "And I'm not going to let you get away with it." I just laughed at him because I had no intention of working in any other Harlem club if he still wanted me. I'd come to love that gruff, big man almost like a father. And that winter the really top names in the colored show world came to see and applaud me. Among them was Bill Robinson. Florence Mills, then with the Tennessee Ten, was at the ringside every night with her husband.</p>
