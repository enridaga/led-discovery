After becoming a nonagenarian I did not of necessity go out to evening concerts, but I always made one exception to the rule â€“ I would not, as long as I had one leg to stand upon, miss a recital in London where Arthur Rubinstein was concerned, because it was always the most thrilling musical experience for me. The last recital of his I attended was on 15 June 1970, when at the age of eighty-two he played, if anything, more wonderfully than ever.
