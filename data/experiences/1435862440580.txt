<p>On the 24th of January, 1793, there was not any play performed, from respect to the memory of the unfortunate monarch, Louis the Sixteenth, who was murdered in Paris on that day...Mr. Sheridan appointed Stephen Storace and myself joint directors of the Italian Opera, with a carte blanche ; but he was proprietor, and of course consulted on all important points ; and whose advice on theatricals, or any thing else, indeed, was so good, when he chose to give it...The Italian Opera Company was good, in both the serious and comic departments. Signor Bruni, the first soprano singer, possessed a fine voice and fine person ; Madame Mara was the prima donna ; and myself the serious tenor. For the comic opera, Morelli was the primo buffo ; Rondini, the second buffo ; Signora Storace, the prima donna ; with several others. Paesiello's charming comic opera, the " Zingari in Fiera," was produced that season ; its popularity lasted many years.</p>
