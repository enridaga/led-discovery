<p>In January I went to Antwerp, having been invited by La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Nouveaux Concerts to conduct a program of my earlier works. From there I went to Brussels, where the Pro Arte Society had organized a concert of my music. The celebrated Quartet- know under that name (MM. A. Onnou, L. Halleux, G. Pr&eacute;vost, and R. Maas) - with its usual masterly seriousness played my Concertino and my &lsquo;Trois Petites Pi&egrave;ces pour Quatuor &agrave; Cordes&rsquo;, while I myself conducted my &lsquo;Octuor&rsquo;, &lsquo;La Suite de Pulcinella&rsquo;, and my opera &lsquo;Mavra&rsquo;, the vocal parts of which had been carefully studied and prepared by the singers before my arrival with the help of that enthusiastic Belgian musicians, Paul Collaer. I give all these details because I retain a grateful memory of the Pro Arte group for this concert, organized in a highly artistic fashion, which enabled me to present my work, especially &lsquo;Mavra&rsquo;, under conditions which I could not have wished better.</p>
