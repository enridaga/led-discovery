" Allons done, mon cher," cried&nbsp;Liszt, " chantons ' Les Adieux de Wotan,' '&nbsp;and he sat down at the piano, I standing next&nbsp;to him bending over the score, and we then&nbsp;and there read that Grand Finale for the first&nbsp;time, amidst frequent exclamations of wonder&nbsp;and delight on the part of the audience, and&nbsp;had to do parts of it over and over again.</p>
