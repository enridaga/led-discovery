After having dined, we went to hear the military band at a Garden, just above the Town. It was so full, that seeing there was not a chance of getting seats, we remained in the Carriage from whence we heard quite enough, I should almost say more than enough, for the band is very noisy. They played music too chromatic, too German, even for my Ears. I longed for some melody and was on the whole much disappointed. It was the Prussian band, which I heard. I am told that the Austrian, which plays alternately with it is far superior.
