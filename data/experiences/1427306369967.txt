On one never-to-be-forgotten occasion, after I had played and we had enjoyed a long silence, Paganini rose and approached his violin-case. What then passed in me can hardly be imagined ; I was all in a tremble, and my heart thumped as if it would burst my chest ; in fact, no young swain going to the first rendezvous with his beloved could possibly feel more violent emotions. Paganini opened the case, took the violin out, and began to tune it carefully with his fingers without using the bow ; my agitation became almost intolerable. When he was satisfied, and I said to myself, with a lump in my throat, ' Now, now, he'll take the bow ! ' he carefully put the violin back and 
shut the case. And that is how I heard Paganini.
