<p>Yesterday afternoon, Sunday, Catherine Crozier's organ recital at Saint Bartholomew, including the <em>Messe de la Pentec&ocirc;te</em> of Messiaen, the composer closest to JH's heart. This is the best performance he's ever heard. Why? Because Crozier makes the music sing and dance, and has the fluent to avoid all that profundity mot organists bring to it. Ecstasy may be profound, but it;s also freedom and lets you cavort out of your body.</p>
