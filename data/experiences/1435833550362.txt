Exhausted during a rehearsal with Katherine and Kristine Ciesinski in Ferris's parlour, I retire to the bedroom from where I hear the sisters as they continue working and am so touched by their English tutoiement, the patience and mutual regard with which they listen to each other, aid each other, do not complete with each other, trust and admire each other, that I drift off content.
