<p>Sunday was memorable for me for another visit to Shelley House - where I actually shook hands with Miss Sands, Katie, &amp; Elena Rathbone.&nbsp; All expressed great surprise at seeing me, as if I were a strange bird joining a flock of the same species. I felt strange enough; but oddly familiar with their ways after the first.&nbsp; Elena was almost like an old friend - a very old friend who persists, remembering what went on before I took my dive &amp; she hers.&nbsp; She pressed me, almost affectionately, to come &amp; see them....Katie rather ensanguined &amp; flesh covered, but with great dignity and amplitude of feature, sitting very up right, eyes half closed, in the front of the room, listening to Ravel and Schumann, which she said she admired equally.</p>
