Madame Lind-Goldschmidt sang for the 'Pension Fund,' and was our star at the Subscription Concert. She can tone down her glorious voice to a pianissimo whisper, and the sound, however attenuated, is distinctly audible in the remotest corner of the Concert room; she is wonderfully versatile. After astounding every one with her 'fioriture,' and stirring all hearts with her deeply expressive singing, she becomes at once exquisitely naive and sings a 'Kinderlied' by Taubert, or the 'Sonnenschein,' in a style that makes her hearers feel young again.
