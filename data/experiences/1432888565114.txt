On one occasion the party was a good bit larger than usual, and among the many elegant persons I was especially fascinated by a very striking young man. [...] As usual there was music, and finally this young man was asked to play. And what an accomplished pianist he turned out to be! [...] Never before had I heard such novel and dazzling difficulties such cleanliness and elegance in performance, nor such intimate and tender expression, nor even so much good taste in improvisation; when later he performed a few of Mozart's sonatas with violin (he was accompanied by Krommer) these compositions, which I had known for a long time, seemed like a completely new world.
