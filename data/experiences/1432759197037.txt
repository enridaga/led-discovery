The concert in the evening was again very full. It has much interested us to watch the growing interest of the public. The applause during the last two concerts has been very different : much more genuine and spontaneous than at the first. It would not take long to educate them, and to make them appreciate the best music. Before us, nobody had ever played them a sonata by Beethoven, or any other really good music.
