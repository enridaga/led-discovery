Daddy and I went to a wonderful Thanksgiving Service at Mr Gough’s, the popular War preacher at Holy Trinity, Brompton... There was such a crowd that Nannie grew alarmed, elbowed her way out and took you to St Paul’s, Onslow Square. There you sat through the service, enthralled by a big soldier who sang the psalms, hymns and responses lustily. You could hardly take your eyes off him.
