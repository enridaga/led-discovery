The following year (1885) I was gratified at finding a place in the Birmingham Festival. For this meeting I set Mr. Gladstone's Latin translation of Toplady's hymn, "Rock of Ages". Afterwards we performed it at the Abbey, Mr. Gladstone himself being present. He wrote me a very kind and appreciative letter, and was good enough to allow me to dedicate my work to him, saying he "cordially
wished it success."
