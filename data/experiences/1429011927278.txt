We were hardly there [back in their room at Windsor] when a servant came in with the agreeable message ; 'The Prince and Princess of Wales wish to see Mr. Halle' We went in all haste to the private apartments (Ruland to present me)...A moment later, we followed her in, and the Prince of Wales, after shaking hands cordially, presented me to his wife, of whose beauty and grace the photographs give no idea. There was no one present but the Prince and Princess of Wales, Princess Alice and Prince Louis, Ruland and I, and I stayed until half-past seven o'clock, either making music, or joining in familiar and most agreeable conversation upon all manner of subjects.
