It requires no thought to thank you heartily, in the first place, for all the trouble you have so kindly taken about my Piano Forte. It arrived safe at the proper time, without being even much put out of tune by the jumble. I am much pleased with the tone of it, which is sweet and even; in the pianissimo it is charming. Altogether the instrument is delightful, & I play upon it con amore, & with the pleasure I expected. If it has defects which a good harpsichord has not, it has beauties & delicacies which amply compensate, & which make the harpsichord wonderfully flashy & insipid when played after it; though for some purposes, & in some of my musical moods (though not the best, I confess) I might turn to the harpsichord in preference. There are times when oneâ€™s ear calls only for harmony, & a pleasant jingle; when one is disposed to merely sensual music, that tickles the auditory nerves, & does not disturb the indolence of ones feelings or imagination. But as soon as ever my spirit wakes, as soon as my heart-strings catch the gentlest vibration, I swivel me round incontinently to the Piano Forte.
