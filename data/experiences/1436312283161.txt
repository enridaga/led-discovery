Miriam Gideon, seventeen years older than I to the hour, gave us her music at Merkin Hall. The new little Piano Sonata, pleasantly played by Sahan Arzuni, was a novel delight. But the aesthetic of her vocal music so goes against my own (gratuitous repetition of words and verses, undifferentiated tone from song to song, gimmicky switching from language to language within one song, and the offensive new translation of Saint Paul's letter to the Corinthians, where "charity" smarmily is mistranslated as "love"), so put me off that I couldn't hear the music.
