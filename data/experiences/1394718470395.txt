Soon after this I began attending another of the same kind at Mr Wafers [sic] on a Saturday evening, both of which meetings were occasionally attended by Mr McArthur, then principal 2d. fiddle at Portsmouth Concert, Mr Clarke, writing master at the Naval Academy, and elderly & very respectable man, tho' but a moderate performer upon the fiddle; Mr Chapman, apprentice (or assistant) to Mr Hawker, organist of Portsmouth, who play'd the tenor, & Mr Ducket of Gosport an elderly gentleman who play'd a very good fiddle in the old style of playing; so that we frequently play'd the Corelli, Handel & Geminiani's concertos compleat, of which I now began playing the ripienos at sight.
