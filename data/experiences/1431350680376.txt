From my earliest years, I was in thrall to Shostakovichâ€™s music. I loved the First Symphony, and my first hearing of 'The Nose' had a seismic effect on me. I felt absolutely that it was what Gogol himself would have written had he never thought to set his incomparable text to music. Shostakovich became my idol.
