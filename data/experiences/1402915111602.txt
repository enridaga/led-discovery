Arrive at Bombay at 6.00 am. Detrain at 9.00 am. A general scrum down for kit bags...Embark on SS Somali at 11.00 am, towed out of docks, and set sail at 3.00 pm. The band of a Mahratta Regiment was formed up on the quayside and we slowly glided away to the tune of ‘Should Old Acquaintance be Forgot’. I felt an infinite sadness. I remained on deck until Malabar point and the last vestige of the shores of India faded from view. I had left India behind for good, India where I spent the happiest years of my soldiering. I felt lonely and depressed, I can’t explain why.
