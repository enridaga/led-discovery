Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: Tuesday 23rd October, 1827
To give an account of my time, I shall mention having been at the Opera on Saturday â€” we had the 'Euryanthe' of Weber, a splendid piece; Sontag sang the
whole well, and much of it exquisitely. It is terrible to behold how the society of Berlin, with few exceptions, revolves round the theatre as the sole attraction and occupation !
