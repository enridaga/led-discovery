<p>The first visit was with my parents to see Italian tenor Luigi Infantino around 1953 followed by every type of music concert I could attend: from jazz to individual singers; big bands; solo artists; dance; musical theatre; expensive seats or choir seats; side of stage; behind performer (feels like being on stage with them, they also turn around to include audience); seats - free foyer performance. All wonderful performances. But the best of all, seeing my daughter dance with the London Festival Ballet in "The Nutcracker". I went to every performance of course.</p>
