    Mackenzie Murdoch, the Scottish Paganini, is associated in modern minds mostly with “Hame o’ Mine,”... 
    A brilliant technician, Mackenzie Murdoch cultivated two distinct styles of fiddle-playing, each very effective. When he was handling a Scots song he played it with complete simplicity, getting a wonderful plaintiveness out of his instrument; but when he was playing a dance he would run all over the fiddle, displaying a dexterity not often encountered even amongst talented players.
He won his way to popularity largely by his skill as a violinist but, all-in-all, it was the song “Hame o’ Mine,” which immortalised him. I have heard this sung on many occasions, and always it has stirred me deeply, but never has its pathos made such an impression on me as when, in Sighthill Cemetery one day a few years ago, it was sung over his grave at the unveiling of the monument to his memory.
    Sir Harry Lauder it was who performed that memorable ceremony, and it is pleasing to note that the famous comedian, out of regard for his old comrade, still sings a verse of Murdoch’s “Hame o’ Mine” as an encore.
