<p>I used to spend nights listening to Doc Perry, Louis Brown, and Louis Thomas. They were schooled musicians who had been to the conservatory. But I listened to the unschooled, too. There was a fusion, a borrowing of ideas, and they helped one another right in front of where I was standing, leaning over the piano, listening. Oh, I was a great listener! Louis Brown had unbelievable technique. He played chromatic thirds faster than most of the greats of that time could play chromatic singles (his left hand could play an eleventh in any key). The others could only marvel at this, but not with envy, for they enjoyed another piano player's sterling performance. They applauded with wonder and appreciation, laughed and slapped each other on the back when he finished, and then each would take his turn and display his own unique devices. Doc Perry and Louis were the Conservatory Boys but they had also a profound respect for the cats who played by ear... Even the listeners were enchanted and never had enough.</p>
