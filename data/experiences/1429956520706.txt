I attended one such mongrel representation, and found in that piece of patchwork, 'The Demon', Meyerbeer's best intentions utterly destroyed; fine scenery and ignorant listeners could alone save this performance from complete failure. Drury Lane, in rivalry with Covent Garden, wanted to produce another version, and having better singers, partially succeeded; still there was no Meyerbeer in it.
