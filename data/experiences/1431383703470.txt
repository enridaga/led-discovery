<p>There has already been one rehearsal of the Thirteenth Symphony, but so far only with the orchestra. They have kept it in their memory very well, and I know they will give an excellent performance on the 20th. Kondrashin was not well today: he has lost his voice so had to take the rehearsal in a whisper. It is not serious though; the voice will come back tomorrow or the day after. / Please God Gromadsky doesn&rsquo;t fall ill. Yurlov told me that the chorus also has a good recall of the piece.</p>
