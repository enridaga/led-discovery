<p>I remember the first time I heard Perlman play was at the RFH. I was about 12 or 13 and I think he was playing Mendelssohn concerto. I was studying the violin and I remember just crying and standing up at the end in disbelief at how beautiful it was. Definitely a seminal moment of musican inspiration. I also always remember the repeated tonal A? that you play to signal the end of the interval - I hope you keep it!</p>
