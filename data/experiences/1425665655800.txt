<p>[...] Colli and Mme Toussaint sang a few weeks ago in <em>The Barber [of Seville]</em>. It so happened that I arrived just then in Warsaw from Sanniki with Kostus 2 for a few days. I was most curious to see that first act-- they only did the first act-- in Italian: all day long I rubbed my hands in anticipation. But on the evening itself if it hadn't been for Mme Toussaint I could have murdered Colli. He acted so much the Italian low comedian and sang so much out of tune that it was frightful. Once, as he rushed off the stage, he fell over. Need I say more? Just imagine this Colli fellow, in short breeches, with a guitar and a round, white hat, lying on the floor. Awful!</p>
