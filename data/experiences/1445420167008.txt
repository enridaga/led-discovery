The house was very full and the actors in great spirits. I was to night for the first time soon enough to hear the overture: it is very pretty and fanciful, consisting only of 2 movements, which trimmed the fiddles; but Piccini never suffers them to sleep. With what pleased me before, I was more pleased now, and am now more and more charmed with the originality, and resources of this author.</span></p>
