In the year 1785, some eminent musicians were visiting Mr. Hudson, of Wanlip, and my father thought this a favourable opportunity to have a day’s performance for the benefit of the Infirmary. With the assistance of Mr. Frudd, a celebrated dancing-master, who played an excellent violin, they hastily convened our Leicester forces, and, with the Londoners, a selection from the 'Messiah’ was performed in St. Martin’s church. Madame Mara, Signor Tasca, and Mr. Harrison were the principal vocalists. Among the instruments were, Mr. Mara, violoncello; Signor Gariboldi, double-bass; the Master Ashleys; and the celebrated oboe-player, Mr. Parke.
