Great do this evening in the Dining Hall. A Grand Concert, arranged by Lady Dudley, to celebrate St Patricks Day. Crowds of members of staff from other hospitals visited and the hall was terribly crowded. Entertainment was provided by some officers out of various crack cavalry regiments who were really good performers. The jokes were bordering at times, as was the rather broad humour, but it was still an excellent show and two of officers had delightful singing voices. Lord St Germans was one of the performers and gave a sort of dress performance of an old woman discanting with another crony on the war and it was a fine effort and produced much laughter.... The whole show didnâ€™t last too long, which was a comfort. It was over at 7.45 and all the guests departed in crowds of motor ambulances and returned to their various hospitals after the little outing.
