<p>It was my good fortune at different times, in Vienna&nbsp;and Rome, to hear him [Franz Liszt] play a few of the great masterpieces of Beethoven, as well as a good many of his own&nbsp;original compositions and inimitable "transcriptions"; moreover, he extemporised twice in my presence &mdash; the&nbsp;first time at great length upon Schubert's exquisite Serenade (Staendchen), and the second, more briefly, but&nbsp;with surprising elaboration, upon "Batti, batti." I have&nbsp;therefore been able to appreciate his various qualities as&nbsp;a performer in their three principal developments ; and&nbsp;in all three I found him not only unrivalled, but unapproachable. His interpretation of Beethoven, whilst&nbsp;distinguished from that of almost every other great&nbsp;contemporary pianist by a devout fidelity to the tempi and&nbsp;worded or marked instructions of the composer, was at&nbsp;once dignified, romantic, and passionate. All the secretsof the great master's conceptions were revealed and&nbsp;explained by Liszt's magic touch.&nbsp;</p>
