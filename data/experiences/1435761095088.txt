<p>Yes, Kaycee [Kansas City] was a place to be enjoyed[. &hellip;]</p>
<p>There was the best food to be had--the finest barbecue, crawdads, and other seafood. There were the races, and swimming, and the beautiful Swope Park and zoo to amuse you. There were jam sessions all the time, and big dances such as the union dance given every year by our local.</p>
<p>As many as ten or twelve bands participated in this event, and you were sure to hear at least eight original styles there, as well as one or two outfits trying to imitate Duke.</p>
