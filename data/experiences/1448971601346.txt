<p>The latter [&ldquo;Zadoc the Priest&rdquo;] appeared tame and weak in comparison [to Handel's "The Creation"] though many parts of it are very beautiful, and some few of the chorusses extremely fine, almost emulating in sublimity those of Handel. The opening solo was performed by Mr. Bellamy; the ensuing chorus has been already noticed. The first air was sung by Mr. Vaughan, the next, &ldquo;The marvellous Work,&rdquo; by Miss Stephens. It is a sweet composition, and she sang it extremely well. It introduces the charming chorus of &ldquo;The Second Day.&rdquo; This was followed by an effective song by Mr. Phillips. The next piece is the air, preceded by a recitative, &ldquo;With verdure clad,&rdquo; given by Madame&nbsp;Caradori delightfully. This was decidedly the best solo performance of the whole concert, in which that excellent singer had nothing more to do. Nothing was allotted in this oratorio to Mr. Braham but a good recitative accompanied, preceding the noble chorus which concludes the first part, &ldquo;The Heavens are telling the Glory of God,&rdquo; by far the finest of the whole. The beautiful little trio introduced which gives it such pleasing variety, was feebly sung, but the finale was very fine.</p>
