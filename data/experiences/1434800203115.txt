<p>I met the Chevalier Neuckomm at Mr. Moor's house in Birmingham, during the festival in 1834. I found him a plain intelligent man, speaking very good English. I could suppose in person he somewhat resembles his great master, Haydn. He laid before me the oratorio of David, just composed by him, which I heard the following day. The choruses are magnificent, but so loaded with the brazen sounds, that they require at least fifty additional stringed instruments to a part, to counterbalance and assuage their terrible roar. There was also an enormous bass instrument, the <em>Ophicleide</em>, procured from Germany. It appeared like a column of brass towering in the band, and required a pair of Stentorian lungs to play upon it. Its lower tones were distinctly heard growling below all the other instruments. The author had, no doubt, preconceived the clamorous effect of a Jewish orchestra, to which the sackbut, shawn, and timbrel imparted a barbaric character. However learned and scientific this work may be, I was more gratified with what little I heard of his '<em>Mount Sinai</em>.' " The manner in which the Commandments are delivered at intervals from the holy mountain, in the tones of the ancient ecclesiastical <em>canto fermo</em>, accompanied by the sounds of the brazen instruments, is full of awful grandeur." This is a specimen of fine shifting scenes in harmony. I know nothing like it except the trombones, in the ghost scene in 'Don Giovanni.'&nbsp;</p>
