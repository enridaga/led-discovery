<p>My grandfather&rsquo;s funeral occurred in the modest church in the village of Tomintoul [&hellip;] As we filed out of the church, the organist struck up with &lsquo;The Road to the Isles&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a well-known Scottish folk song of nineteenth-century music-hall origin &ndash; rife with pseudo-Gaelicisms and tinged with remembered Jacobitism &ndash; about dreamed-of western landscapes, the open road that leads to them and the foot-travel by which they will be reached. It plays with the walk west to the Hebrides as a walk in the direction of loss, a journey towards the setting sun. My mother&rsquo;s mother had sung it to her, and she in turn had sung it to me as a lullaby and as a walking song, in her high voice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A far croonin&rsquo; is pullin&rsquo; me away</em></p>
<p><em> As take I wi&rsquo; my cromack to the road</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em> The far Coolins are puttin&rsquo; love on me</em></p>
<p><em> As step I wi&rsquo; the sunlight for my load.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The organist duffed note after note, but the song was still recognizable, and the old words ran through my head in time to the music [...] People were bustling and talking, louder now, while the organist played boldly on. The hearse gleamed [&hellip;] The bearers emerged, wheeling the coffin on its carriage. A whispered <em>one, two three, heave</em> and the coffin was off the carriage and into the back of the hearse [&hellip;]</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sure by Tummel and Loch Rannoch and Lochaber I will go</em></p>
<p><em> By heather tracks wi&rsquo; heaven in their wiles.</em></p>
<p><em> If it&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo; in your inner heart the braggart&rsquo;s in my step,</em></p>
<p><em> You&rsquo;ve never smelled the tangle o&rsquo; the Isles.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the coffin-bearers stepped into the middle of the road, and raised a flat hand to stop the traffic with all the authority vested in him by death and dark clothes. The cars slowed, stopped, began to back up into a queue. From inside the church the final verse of &lsquo;The Road to the Isles&rsquo; drifted out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The blue islands are pullin&rsquo; me away</em></p>
<p><em> Their laughter puts the leap upon the lame;</em></p>
<p><em> The blue islands from the Skerries to the Lewis</em></p>
<p><em> Wi&rsquo; heather honey taste upon each name.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] Sun glints on the dark road, the hearse creeps forwards, the undertaker makes my grandfather&rsquo;s final walk for him, his journey marked by the beat of each carefully placed and lifted foot.</p>
