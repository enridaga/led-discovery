Neither of them indeed has any pretence to beauty, but of the two Cuzzoni has the advantage in that particular. Her voice is also clearer, and she is mistress of a greater compass of notes. On the other hand, Faustina has a very graceful manner of singing, more skill and variety of modulations, makes quicker trills or shakes, and acts better on the stage than Cuzzoni. As these two ladies are declared rivals, they never sing together.</span></p>
