4, Carlton Terrace, 30 Oct., 1844… On the 18th we reached London, in time to witness the opening of the New Exchange by Queen Victoria in person, when holiday was made in the City, and such a mass of human beings crowded the way she passed, even to the very roofs of the houses, as I never saw together before, – all in the best humour, cheering the Queen, who was greeted with the crash of all the church-bells, with the singing of the school children of the two churches in the Strand, and again with a band stationed before the Exchange, where, after receiving an address, and making a gracious reply, she accepted a luncheon, of which 1,200 persons partook, and then retired with the same plaudits as when she entered.
