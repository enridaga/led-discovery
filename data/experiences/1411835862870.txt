<p>In 1996 it was John Peel's chance to choose his music choice for Meltdown. We tried to guess who he would choose and were delighted to attend two concerts in one day. Firstly, the Scottish poet Ivor Cutler who is a member of the Noise Abatement Society and later on Extreme Noise terror from Ipswich. Brilliant to see them on a large stage with great sound and a mix only John Peel could present.</p>
