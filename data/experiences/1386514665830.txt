Reed bands [military bands] may be said to belong to the public in general. What a band of stringed instruments is in a room, a theatre, a concert-hall, etc., reed bands are in the open airâ€¦ An orchestra of string instruments combined with vocal solos and chorus, always will produce the most elevating impression, and is alone that which forms, improves, and perpetuates really artistic taste for music.
Reed bands, on the contrary, permit the minds of those present to be busied with other pleasures, which they endeavour to unite with artistic enjoyment.
