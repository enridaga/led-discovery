"I moved to London from my native city Rome in 1997.After a few months of excitiment i began homesick.Royal Festival Hall is one of the rare places in London that made me feel, and still does, lucky and proud to live in this country. The man I then married used to invite me to the hall, even just to look around, have a drink in the bar anf get to know each other. I loved it and I remember once when he was very late and thought he was going to stand me up. While I was waiting lonely at the bar I said to myself: ""If he turned up in the next 15 minutes he's the one for me.
If he doesn't it's over, no excuses."" Needless to say that he did and we are still together. We attended various fantastic gigs like Fisherspooner
and Siousxie and the Banshees and we still really much enjoy the venue. "
