This second season [in America] and the following ones brought me many other musical satisfactions, like the joint concert with Alfred Cortot at the Library of Congress on Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge’s birthday, the already mentioned sonata program with Gieseking, a similar one with Gabrilowitsch, orchestral appearances under Furtwängler, Fritz Reiner, the Ysaÿe pupil Henry Verbrugghen, Mengelberg, and others.
