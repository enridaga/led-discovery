I suppose that everybody remembers the music that they listened to when they were teenagers and because it evokes fond memories they retain a liking for it, even when they are old and grey. There is probably something of this in the way that today’s middle-aged men and women are still fond of seventies music, but there was also the fact that it was simply great! This is of course a subjective judgement, but it cannot be a coincidence that so much of the music from that time is still heard today. You can’t say the same for the fifties and sixties. Apart from anything else, there was the sheer variety of the good stuff, which ranged from folk to rock, all the way through to the disco dancing music of the Bee Gees and Saturday Night Fever.
