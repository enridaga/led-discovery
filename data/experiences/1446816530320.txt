<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">A few memories of RFH from Julia Woolhouse - Event Co-ordinator. My first memory of RFH was from my very first day as I was walking towards the RFH artists entrance and seeing the black Philharmonia truck parked outside and the feeling of coming to work somewhere exciting! Little did I know that a few years later I could be looking after the orchestra's every need at the RFH as their event co-ordinator! Working in the performing arts office in the RFH building I remember constant coffee runs to EAT in the foyer trying to remember who wanted a 'tall skinny latte' and who had 'cappucino extra shot'! With only a tiny window we attempted to keep cool in the hot spell of 2003 and taped wet-wipes to the fans to keep the air fresh! We would regularly creep upstairs and enter the RFH boxes the back way so that we could watch sound-checks and rehearsals, and then sneak away again un-noticed (mostly!). So many memorable concerts over the years, but a few that spring to mind, Ibrahim Ferrer of Buena Vista Social Club. Coldplay, Divine Comedy, Blue Planet with David Attenborough, the Philharmonia's final concert in the 'old' RFH with Ashkenazy and Grimaud duetting in the foyer and of course the National Festival of Music for Youth, 12000 kids performing in a week!&nbsp;</p>
