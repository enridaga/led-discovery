And there was usually something worth hearing in town those days, even if Pittsburgh was not one of the jazz centers. One Saturday night I went to a theatre on Frankstown Avenue where all the Negro shows were booked. But I hardly noticed any part of this show, for my attention was focused on a lady pianist who worked there. 

She sat cross-legged at the piano with a cigarette in her mouth, writing music with her right hand while accompanying the show with her swinging left! Impressed, I told myself, "Mary, you'll do that one day." (And I did, traveling with Andy Kirk's band in the 'thirties on one-nighters.)

The lady turned out to be Lovie Austin, who was working with the pit band and making all the orchestrations. It so happened that she was behind time, and hurriedly arranging a number for one of the acts down the bill. 

Another week, the fabulous Ma Rainey came into a little theater on Wiley Avenue. Some of the older kids and I slipped downtown to hear the woman who had made blues history.
