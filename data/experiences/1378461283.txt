We all met at Ballygunge, where there was tea and polo. In the evening we went to a party at the Nawab of Dacca's. He has taken a house here, and is giving entertainments almost every day. There had been a dinner party, but we only went to the native music and nautch after itâ€¦. There was only one girl to dance, and when we had seen enough of her we listened to some native music. One of the performers did all the expression with his face, and made such grimaces of agony and cast up such beseeching eyes that it became quite embarrassing.
