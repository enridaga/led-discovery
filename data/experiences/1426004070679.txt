St. Stephen's tower in a blaze of fire-works at the people's fête in the Augarten was most beautiful [...] The 'Vestalin,' by Spontini; Rossini's ' Mosé,' and 'Jean de Paris,' as well as Handel's oratorio of ' Samson ' were performed before the Princes.... Handel's 'Samson!'... which always strengthens and elevates my soul! The first time I heard it, I was in ecstasies of delight; since then I have heard every rehearsal and every performance of this masterpiece, and always found my self refreshed anew.
