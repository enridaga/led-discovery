<p>While speaking of Madame Viardot Garcia, I may add that in 1867 I was staying at Baden-Baden, then a resort of the most famous artists. At one of the concerts I attended at the Kursaal, Grisi, Mario, and Madame Viardot Garcia all sang. Madame Viardot invited my wife and me to visit her, and I well remember a certain matinee d'invitation which she gave at her house, where she had a beautiful musicroom, with an organ. We heard delightful music, rendered by Mile Artot, Delle Sedie, and de Beriot. Madame Viardot accompanied almost everything herself, and also played the organ in Gounod's "Ave Maria." The Queen of Prussia was present, and praised all the artists. I noticed, among the guests, the famous Russian novelist Turgenieff a fine, tall man with a white beard.</p>
