On a second hearing of Schumann's Symphony in C, I feel more and more that he follows boldly in Beethoven's footsteps, reminding me of him in daring, but scarcely in tenderness. I think his D minor Trio a composition of the most passionate character it is based less on intensity of ideas than on his power of moving in the most varied keys. The Scherzo is the most piquant movement, the Adagio very gloomy.
