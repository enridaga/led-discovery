I recently received an invitation from the New York Philharmonic to conduct eight concerts in October. I turned it down, as I am no conductor. All the same, when I heard my Seventh Symphony conducted by Konstantin Ivanov three days later, I was regretting my decision having come to the conclusion that the art of conducting canâ€™t be as difficult as all that.
