<p>As a matter of fact the theatrical bands of this metropolis can stand comparison, favourably to themselves,&nbsp;with those of any Continental city. I venture to make&nbsp;this assertion somewhat confidently, having, in the&nbsp;course of the past twenty years, attended every imaginable sort of theatrical performance in all the countries&nbsp;of Europe, except the Scandinavian kingdoms and the&nbsp;Hellenic realm... Of course bands engaged to&nbsp;play ballet music and the accompaniments of comic&nbsp;opera, operetta, etc., are expected to be of a quality&nbsp;superior to that of the average theatrical orchestra. But the latter, in London at least, has attained so high a&nbsp;standard as to leave little to be desired.</p>
