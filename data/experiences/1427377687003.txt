<p>In the summer of 1842 I made a short concert tour through Germany, playing at Wiesbaden, Mayence, Frankfort, Darmstadt, and other towns. At Frankfort I had the happiness to meet Mendelssohn, and to spend a few weeks closely associated with him and rich in musical delight. At the concert I gave, he and Hiller played with me Bach's triple concerto in D minor.</p>
