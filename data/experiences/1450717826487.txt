If I didn&rsquo;t play a solo with all the tenderness, or charm, or brio with which some great singer had sung it, he would stop me over and over again. &ldquo;No, no, you haven&rsquo;t got it; don&rsquo;t you remember the splendid virility with which he simply brought the house down with such and such an aria? Don&rsquo;t you remember how she lingered on that note?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;Try and make that finale sound as if there were a crowd of people singing,&rdquo; etc. etc. And I took to this Italian operatic music like a duck to water. There was something emotional in it that appealed to the youth in me, and I loved to try and make the piano a living and breathing human voice. That my playing of these scores gave real pleasure to someone very dear to me was in itself a powerful incentive. Perhaps the actual music only stirred me on the surface - still, even surfaces are facts that cannot be denied, and have to be reckoned with. And I adored, with every reason, the really beautiful singing I heard so constantly; my love of vocal music grew apace, and in my admiration for the singer I often failed to detect the flimsy quality of the music.</p>
