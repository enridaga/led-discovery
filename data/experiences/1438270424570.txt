<p>Grace Williams come to dinner at Burleigh House where I am staying, &amp; after we both go to the Mercury Theatre to the Iris Lemare concert. Orch. Nothing of much interest, except a Suite of Grace, which has some good things in - esp. 1st &amp; 2nd mov, &amp; a ballet on an amusing subject - Great Agrippa by Elizabeth Maconchy - some doleful arrangements of forgotten dirges, &amp; a long clumsy immature, work of Elizabeth Lutyens finishes the programme.*</p>
