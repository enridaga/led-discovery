Sublimity is a measure despised & suspected very naturally nowadays, but I’ve always believed it to be a criterion of greatness; & along with Blake, Beethoven & Melville, Whitman had a sense of the sublime in a measure I find lacking in, say, Emerson. By the way, do you know of anyone who retains it today? I confess I would be ready to read such an one if he made a fool of himself on every page. Sibelius, I think, has it; but I can’t think of a writer.
