The Sunday was our last concert day of the season and everyone tried to feel either sorrow or relief, but was too tired to do so.... I personally felt that I had switched on to automatic pilot; I had no real idea of how well the afternoon concert went, and even the last concert, which by all accounts was a great success, passed by on another wavelength.

But the Schubert Quintet in the second half was the best-balanced performance I had heard all summer, and therefore the most moving. It did not have the high colour of some of the other performances; it did not have the dramatic personality of the performance in Cheltenham with Steven Isserlis, but it was the most finely blended with Dickie as the second cellist, and for the first time this summer I felt that everyone was so intent upon the music that their personal egos were set aside; no-one tried to draw attention to his or her own playing by disproportionate physical gestures.
