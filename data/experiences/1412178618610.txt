Here's another week gone, & it is in vain I find now to wait any longer for leisure to write more. Every day increases my hurry, & narrows my meals & repose by new & unexpected engagements. Last night I had 3 patients to visit ere I could get to Pachierotti's Benefit, in spite of all my arrangements & diligence. - However between 8 & 9 I had the great satisfaction to find the house well filled, & to hear him more applauded in Sacchini's Se cerca, se dice - set formerly for Millico - & Paessiello's divine Rondo, Ti seguiro fidele than ever he, or almost any performer I ever heard, was before. Such an encore to this last! had any one disputed it, or dared to hiss I do believe he would have shared Marsyas's fate.
