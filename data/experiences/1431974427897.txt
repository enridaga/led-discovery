Really during all these years passing by, was that name singing in my head. Tenderly and truly. And so you can believe how touched I am 'you' remember 'me'! Dvorakâ€™s Cello-Konzert and you! Both always seemed to be united in the same time and in enjoyable remembrance. I can hear it now, how long ago you played it first. Hear it in ears, mind, soul, heart.
