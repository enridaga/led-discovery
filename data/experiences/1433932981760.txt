<p>The next morning [8 October] we had the Company of 2 young Ladies at breakfast, - the S.S. and a Miss Birch, - a little girl but 10 years old...</p>
<p>This Miss Birch is a Niece of the charming Mrs Playdel - and so like her, that I should have take her for her Daughter...</p>
<p>Her Voice is really charming, - infinitely the most powerful as well as sweet I ever heard at her Age, - were she well and constantly taught, she might, I should think, do <em>any thing</em>; - for 2 or 3 Italian songs which she learnt out of only 5 months teaching by Parsons she sung like a little angel, with respect to <em>Taste</em>, <em>feeling</em> and <em>Expression</em>, - but she now learns of Nobody, and is so fond of French songs, for the sake, she says, of the <em>sentiment</em>, - that I fear she will have her wonderful abilities all thrown away. O how I wish my Father had the charge of her!-</p>
<p>She has spent 4 years out of her little life in France, which has made her distractedly fond of the French Operas, - and she told us the <em>story</em> quite through of several I never heard of, always singing the <em>sujet</em> when she came to the Airs, - and comically changing parts in the Duets.</p>
