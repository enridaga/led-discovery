In our meetings in Great Britain, 1873-74, this hymn was much used. It was sung at the watchnight service in 1873, in the Free Assembly Hall, Edinburgh. A young lady who was present — Maggie Lindsay, of Aberdeen—was much impressed by the hymn, and those seated by her side heard her exclaim, " O heavenly Father, is it true that the gate is standing ajar for me ? If it is so, I will go in." That night she became a disciple of the Lord Jesus.
