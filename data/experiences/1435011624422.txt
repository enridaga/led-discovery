Go to Camargo Ballet after supper with Bridge's and Miss Fass. Pretty dismal show except for Wendy Toye's magnificent dancing in F.B's "Willow".* There were things I didn't like about her choreography tho'. Other ballets were Sylphides - Infanta's Birthday - amusing stage show but putrid music by Betty Lutyan's & Constant Lambert's "Adam & Eve" in the same style**
