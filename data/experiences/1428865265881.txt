I have now heard him [Liszt] twice : at the rehearsal, where he only played once, and at the concert three times, for I invested five francs in a ticket. When I heard him first I 
sat speechless for a quarter of an hour afterwards, in such a stupor of amazement had the man put me. Such execution, such limitless truly limitless execution no one else can possess. He plays sometimes so as to make your hair stand on end! He who has not heard Liszt can have no conception literally no conception of what his playing is.
