Thomas Twining to Charles Jenner, Fordham, February 20 1769
I left town before the Oratorios began; Mr. John Stanley took me to the Rehearsal of Gideon, the newly discoverâ€™d, [bogus] posthumous oratorio of Handel, which I suppose you have heard of. A great deal of the music of it was taken from some old things he had formerly composed in Italy. I cannot say I was struck with many things in it; but there is scarce any judging of what one hears in such a miserable way. I heard but one passage I thought very fine; which was a chorus towards the beginning of the last act, & in the grand, fuguing, learned style. I know nothing of the words & heard it merely as instrumental music.
