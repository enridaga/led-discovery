<p>I was punctual the following morning ; exactly at ten I was set down by a gondola at the house of Signora Benini, on the Canale Maggiore. The Signora received me at her toilette ; where she was braiding up a profusion of fine black hair. I thought her handsome at the play the night before, but the Italian women all contrive to look well by candlelight; nature gives them good features, and they take care to give themselves good complexions. But Signora Benini wanted not " the foreign aid of ornament ;" her person was petite, and beautifully formed ; her features were good, and she had a pair of brilliant expressive eyes. After breakfast, she requested me to sing. I sang my favourite rondo, " Teco resti, anima mia." She appeared pleased, and said she had no doubt of my success.</p>
