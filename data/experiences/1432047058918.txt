"It was on December 28 that I, like (I dare say) a great many others, went up to the Assembly Hall, out of sheer curiosity, an unconverted sinner. I heard Mr. Moody preach, and I am sorry to say I was very little affected by it. After Mr. Moody had finished his discourse, Mr. Sankey sang ' Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.' I was deeply moved by it, and when he came to the lines,

Too late ! too late ! will be the cry ; 
Jesus of Nazareth has passed by ;

I thought to myself, Will that not be my cry ? Will God not then say to me, ' Depart from Me, I never knew you ' ? I felt in great anguish of soul ; but I went home without remaining to the inquiry-meeting.
