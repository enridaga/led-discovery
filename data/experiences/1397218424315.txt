Yesterday evening Trott, C[hristie] and I went to one of Lena Ashwell’s concert parties in the YMCA tent. Such a treat of music - Westminster Singers, the Letts and Carrie Tubb. The former were simply wonderful and were much appreciated. Phyllis Lett sang very well, as did Carrie Tubb. They must have been tired as they had given a concert in the afternoon and then in the evening they had to attend dinner at the Officers’ Mess.
