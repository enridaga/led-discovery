<p>I first met [Leonhard Emil] Bach at the Abddeen Palace in Cairo, where he and his fellow-traveller &mdash;&nbsp;for the nonce, Ole Bull &mdash; were the instrumental stars of a&nbsp;state concert given by Ismail Khedive, then in the zenith&nbsp;of his viceregal splendour. At that time (February,&nbsp;1876) Bach was a mere stripling, and had but recently&nbsp;terminated his studies. His playing, however, struck&nbsp;me as uncommonly vigorous and intelligent; and he&nbsp;scored heavily in the diplomatic salons of the Egyptian&nbsp;capital, in which music held its own manfully and&nbsp;womanfully ten years ago.&nbsp;</p>
