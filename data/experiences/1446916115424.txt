<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I moved to London after college in Ireland to work in the classical music business and the RFH has always been a central focal point for my career to date, hearing artists I manage perform with or conduct the Philharmonia or the LPO.&nbsp; My first orchestral concert in London was at the RFH in 2000.</p>
