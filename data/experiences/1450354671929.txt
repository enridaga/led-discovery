<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Knowing next to nothing of Hindemith&rsquo;s music, I am hardly entitled to an opinion of it. I have seen none of his operas and heard only a few pieces of his concert music. I did not like <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Das Mareinleben</em>, but enjoyed <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Four Temperaments</em> in Balanchine&rsquo;s choreography, also his other ballet, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">H&eacute;rodiade</em>. The <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Schwanendreher</em> seemed pleasant when I heard him play it in 1935 or 1936. As for <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Ludus Tonalis</em>, which he sent to me, I found it interesting to look at but arid and indigestible as cardboard and as little nourishing. </span></p>
