St. Elizabeth attracted a large audience, including the Prince and Princess of Wales, to St. James's Hall on April 5; but, except for the fact that the unusual height of one of the soloists caused my baton to come into contact with her headgear with unexpected consequences, only a dim recollection of that exciting performance remains. An anxious conductor had to thank the successful efforts of Mesdames Albani, Pauline Cramer, Messrs. Santley, Vaughan Edwards, and others, and the enthusiasm of a fine choir of the satisfactory result.
