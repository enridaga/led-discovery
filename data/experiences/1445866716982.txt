<p>I remember 2 electrifying concerts by the Algerian singer Cheto Mami; oe in the late 1990s supported by the wild and raucous Rachid Taha. The second was equally wonderful but also memorable for another reason; afterwards I made an excuse to my companion, rang the mobile of a woman I'd met briefly and arranged to see her again at the Anchor on bankside half an hour later. We'll be celebrating our 5th anniversary this October.</p>
