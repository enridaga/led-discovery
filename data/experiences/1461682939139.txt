<p>We have recently had an opportunity of attending a lesson on chanting, given by C. C. Spencer to the Rev. Mr. Brock's (Baptist) congregation. Mr. Spencer is well known as a warm friend of old psalmody, and especially by his "Explanation of the Church Modes." His manner of chanting is good, quite a different thing from that of the Cathedral choirs. The words&nbsp;are delivered about as fast as in speech, and time in the cadences is almost wholly disregarded. His beau ideal seems to require the absence of all regular division of time, or all that which we commonly call measured rhythmic effect. He is favorable to the unisonous singing of the old church tunes, and the congregation tried some of them under his direction with good results.</p>
