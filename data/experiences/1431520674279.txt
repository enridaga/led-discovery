<p>On August 3, 1875, a great farewell meeting was held for us in Liverpool. Several addresses were made by prominent speakers, and one of some length by Mr. Moody. As we took our departure on the<em> S.S. Spain</em> we were greeted with the most enthusiastic applause and evidences of good will, the great crowd on the shore singing several of our hymns as the vessel moved out of sight.</p>
