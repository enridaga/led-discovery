<p>After this I had to go to the USA. The Northwestern University in Evanston was to confer upon me an honorary doctor's degree. From Copenhagen we went to the French port of Le Havre, where we boarded the Soviet ocean liner&nbsp;<em>Mikhail Lermontov,&nbsp;</em>making her maiden trip to the United States. / To be honest, I've never enjoyed anything so much in my life. Everyone is in a great hurry these days (myself included), flying to the other side of the world in no time, and I shall never forget this week-long voyage. Until then I had never seen the sunrises and sunsets one gets on the open sea, or the colours of the water and sky. The&nbsp;<em>Mikhail Lermontov&nbsp;</em>herself is a marvellous ship. Much has been written about her at home and abroad and there is no need for me to elaborate. But I would like to mention the excellent amateur performances given by the crew. They are no worse than many professional ensembles, and I was very impressed by the sailor's dancing, singing and playing.&nbsp;</p>
