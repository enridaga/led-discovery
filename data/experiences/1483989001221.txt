<p>The concert immediately followed the rehearsal, at noon. I had a success, but a much greater success greeted the local whistler.&nbsp; The programme also included Respighi's <em>Pines of Rome</em>, which incorporates the sound of nightingales usually conveyed by a gramophone recording of the real sound of a nightingale. But in this performance instead of a gramophone they had invited a local Miss whose whistling was superior to that of the gramophone. And since Miss was the daughter of a local celebrity, the audience greeted her performance with an ovation. At the end, while she was standing with her bouquet of roses, I asked her if her lips were not liable to freeze from nerves. She laughed and said that no, her lips did not freeze up, but it had been very frightening. The last item on the programme was Liszt's <em>Les Pr&eacute;ludes</em>. It is long since I heard this work, and now I listened with interest. It is good, but much of it is contrived and cold.</p>
