<p>Bix [Beiderbecke] blew into Indianapolis and asked me to go to Richmond with him to hear him make some records.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>"We're going to make some records in 'slow-drag' style", Bix said, "and I've got some guys who can really go. Tommy Dorsey, Howdy Quicksell, Don Murray, Paul Mertz, and Tommy Gargano."</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>Bix started doodling on his horn. Finally, he seemed to find a strain the suited him but by that time everybody had taken a hand in composing the melody, though as the bottles got still lighter nobody seemed to have a definite understanding of what that melody was.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>As far as I could see, they didn't have any arrangement worked out [&hellip;] but when the technician came in and gave them the high sign, they took off. Away they went. Away down.</p>
<p>They named the piece "Davenport Blues" in honour of Bix's hometown. It was done in lazy 'jig style' and, as the dead soldiers [marijuana cigarettes] were racked up, their music grew screwier and screwier.</p>
<p>"Toddlin' Blues" was the next number, and by the time it was finished, they were having a little trouble staying in front of their horns. But the effect was wonderful. They used the "I'se a-comin' " strain from "Old Black Joe" and there were among them those who were soon "a-comin' ." A few years later three of those six boys who got together to blow jazz were gone. Little Joes, all.</p>
