<p class="MsoNormal">My dear Friend: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In an artist's life every new role is a stage in that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>long journey toward the summits of art, toward the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>beautiful, the infinite. ''Werther," the other night, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was for me one of those unanimous successes wherein <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the heart &mdash; the science of causing it to beat in one's audience and before one's audience &mdash; stood in true proportion <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to every artifice. The true path &mdash; that of emotion &mdash; that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>goal for which I am striving all my life &mdash; was reached <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>in the presence of a public which did not understand<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the words, but which divined by instinct that my conception of the character arose from that simplicity, that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>pure, unexaggerated truthfulness which age and maturity alone can confer upon the thinking artist. . . . <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I am sending you the cuttings from the newspapers<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>here; show them to Harris, who, I hope, will mount the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>opera for me. Mancinelli conducted the orchestra admirably. Eames and Arnoldson are two adorable little <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>sisters. In a word, I believe that to the cultivated <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>London public, accustomed as it is to novelties, it will <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>come as a delightful surprise. I sing regularly three <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>times every week, and my voice is excellent. At this <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>present moment I am reaching my forty-first performance. Accept, my dear friend, from Edouard and myself, a thousand affectionate remembrances, together <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>with a hearty shake of the hand. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
