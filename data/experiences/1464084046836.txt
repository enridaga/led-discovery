<p>Next morning we went to the hall, which is a picture gallery; the concert will therefore take place against the background of the exhibition (by coincidence I am playing&nbsp;<em>Pictures from an Exhibition</em>!). There was not a single soft object in the room, so without an audience it was colossally reverberant. All the better for Ptashka, as it takes away any worry about whether or not her voice will sound. The concert was in the evening: a large audience, partly because the tickets were not expensive. I was generally fairly unconcerned; Ptashka was nervous and did not reach all her high notes in her first group (my songs) but sang well in her second, which was Russian songs and had a great success, not less than my own.&nbsp;</p>
