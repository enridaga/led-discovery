I have been to the opera twice – once to “Fantaska,” a grand ballet, and the second time to “Trovatore”…The scenery and dresses are superb, and I never imagined anything to equal to them. The orchestra too plays divinely.
     The singing is the only thing which could be improved. The Lucca, who is the grand attraction, is a pretty little creature, but I did not find her voice remarkable. The Berlinese worship her, and whenever Lucca sings there is s great rush for the tickets. Wachtel and Niemann are the star singers among the men. Niemann I have not heard, but Wachtel we would not rave over in America. I am in doubt whether indeed the Germans know what the best choral singing is.
