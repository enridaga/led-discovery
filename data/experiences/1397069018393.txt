[At the town house of Sir William Bagshaw] I met the Scotchman, Mr. Paton, who brought his daughter to exhibit her musical talent. I happened to have in my pocket a proof of a song in 'Judah', 'He that ruleth Israel', which requires no ordinary talent to perform. It was exquisitely sung by my friend, and admirably accompanied on the piano-forte by Miss Paton. I afterwards heard the young lady sing, and did not hesitate to pronounce, that, with common diligence, she would certainly rise to distinction. The father seemed highly flattered by my commendation, and told me she was musically bred.
