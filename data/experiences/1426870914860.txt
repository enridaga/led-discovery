Film sessions were also a good source of income but you had to be on the books of the fixers for the film studios. In 1934 I only got one session by chance because one of the fixers, Adolf [sic] Borsdorf, came to play at the Old Vic while I was there. It was "Lorna Doone" at Ealing, a very long day from 8 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. perpetually playing the music for the storm scene over and over again, with constant comings and goings by the big shots who had other dates and were sending deputies for part of the time. K. Ernest Irving was apt to throw a temperament and say everyone was sacked, but you just went and sat in the canteen until it blew over. On the other hand he was very good at getting money for the players, writing in two notes for a bass clarinet if you were on clarinet so that you got doubling money and spinning it all out for several sessions when it could have been done in one. All in all, although it was good money it was rather wearisome and I was not too worried not to be one of those who were in the charmed circle.
