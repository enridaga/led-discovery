<p>In the summer of 1788, I went to Liverpool, Manchester, Chester, and Birmingham ; Mrs. Crouch was also engaged at those places ; our reception was most flattering, and we reaped a plentiful harvest. From Birmingham, we returned to Drury Lane. The first novelty was Dryden's alteration of Shakspeare's " Tempest," which was received with marked applause for many nights. I composed a duet for myself and Mrs. Crouch, as Ferdinand and Miranda, which was a favourite : the whole of the delightful music by Purcell, was well got up by Mr. Linley; the accompaniments by himself.</p>
