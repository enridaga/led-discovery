<p>Harold "Shorty" Baker came into the band in 1942 to give us our first trumpet section of four. He joined Ray Nance, Rex Stewart, and Wallace Jones, and with his phenomenal phrasing and tone control he was an immense asset. He ad-libbed hot or blues as though he were recalling some beautiful dreams of St. Louis, his home and birthplace. His way of playing a melody was absolutely personal, and he had no bad notes at all.</p>
