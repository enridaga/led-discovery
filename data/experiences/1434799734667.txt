<p>I was present when Paganini made his first appearance in the Opera House, and the crowd that surrounded the doors at an early hour consisted entirely of composers and musicians. The eagerness was much increased by two previous disappointments ; Paganini not daring for some time to come before an English audience. I got in, at the hazard of my bones, and the house was filled in an instant ; hundreds being left in the street. I stood next to Mr. Venua, of Cambridge, and a Scotchman who had come from Edinburgh, and was more fortunate than Venua, who had made an unsuccessful journey the week before. We stood in breathless anxiety till the Signor made his appearance. As his gaunt figure glided from the side scenes to the front of the stage, involuntary shouts burst from all parts of the house ; many rising from their seats to view the spectre : his appearance was more like a devotee about to suffer martyrdom, than one to delight you with his art ; he was evidently in great trepidation, but gained confidence as the thunders of applause and cheering continued.
