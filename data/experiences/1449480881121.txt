<p class="MsoNormal">Teresa [Carrefio ]* made her first appearance in Boston, January 4, 1863. She remained here about one month, and was a great attraction at the grand orchestral concerts which were given at that period under the direction of Carl Zerrahn or P. S. Gilmore. She created a furore of enthusiasm every time she played. I doubt if any child pianist of the same age has ever exceeded her in ability. Imagine a child of nine years playing Thalberg&rsquo;s Moses, Gottschalk&rsquo;s Jerusalem, and similar pieces, full of technical difficulties.</p>
