The music given to Queen Mab in 'Romeo and Juliet,' is not only effective and charming, but worthy of being placed by the side of Mendelssohn's works of a similar kind. Berlioz's conducting inspired the orchestra with fire and enthusiasm, he carried everything as it were by storm; I am glad to have made acquaintance with him, both as a com- poser and conductor.
