In another club on Bourbon [Street], Oscar "Papa" Cellestin, now well into his seventies, has the jazz world on its toes. Believe it or not, Papa Celestin today is just the same great trouper that he was in the early 'nineties [1890's], when jazz fans couldn't agree as to which of the two between himself and the immortal Manuel Perez produced the better tone on the cornet. Perez has gone to his Maker, but the other representative of the real New Orleans jazz music is fortunately still with us.
