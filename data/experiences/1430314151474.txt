Al Foster, on the drums, was a little older than the rest of the [Miles Davis] band. A jazz drummer, he could swing, and had the ability to drop the dynamics from a roar to a whisper in a heartbeat. He was always in the pocket, as musicians say, which means he was truer than a metronome. Al is a highly evolved human being, and I would develop a tremendous respect for him. He raised a pile of daughters while working as a musician on the road, and he loved Miles deeply. It was Al who stayed at Miles's bedside when he lay dying.
