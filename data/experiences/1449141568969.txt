<p class="MsoNormal">I&rsquo;d learned the scale and learned how to play to tunes in a certain key, the key of G for the saxophone, you know, concert. I'd learned the first eight bars of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Lazy River</em> and I knew the complete tune of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Honeysuckle Rose</em>. I didn't ever stop to think about any different kind of keys or nothing like that. So I took my horn out to a joint where the guys, a bunch of fellows I'd seen around, were, and the first thing they started playing was <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Body and Soul</em>. So I go to playing my <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Honeysuckle Rose</em> and they laughed me off the bandstand, laughed at me so hard I had to leave the club.</p>
