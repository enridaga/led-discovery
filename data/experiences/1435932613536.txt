Jazz is a very personal way of playing music. Everyone has his own personal style if he's good. Like Nat Cole on The Street [52nd St., New York]. Nat had that personal thing of his. Art Tatum could cut him up and down any way you go, but Nat had his own thing. I remember at a session he sat down after Art and without a rhythm section. Man, that's asking for it! Yet, Nat played his own way and played well. One thing about his style is that Nat was one of the greatest pianists for doing  things with the blues.
