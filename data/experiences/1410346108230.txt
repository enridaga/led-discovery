The Organ is Execrably bad, out of an hundred and fifty that I suppose there are in London, I dare say there is no One so bad. & Add to that a Total Ignorance of the most known & Common Musicall Merits that runs thro' the Whole Body of People I have yet Convers'd with, Even Sr J: who is the Oracle of Apollo in this Country is extreamly Shallow, I say the bad Organ & the Ignorance of My Auditors must totally extinguish the few Sparks of Genius for Composition I may have, & entirely Execute a Meritorious tho' Difficult Piece of Music, be repaid if like Orpheus I am to Perform to Stocks & Trees. In short, I wish I Cou'd Make a good retreat, that is Without Offending the Gentlemen Who have been at pains as they thought to Serve Me, & before 'tis too late to be reinstated in My London Business. I wish to know (& I shall enquire to Morrow) how the 100Â£ that the Organ Salary is Made is to be paid...
