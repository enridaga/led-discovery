<p>With me, ensemble playing started very early - as the dawning realization of a nine-year old that plying along with others was as big a thrill as that first high dive, that nicely potted black or that pass that almost got the winning goal. It was a jolly experience, and far better than playing on one's own, if only because some of the brighter lads could get all those black-tailed notes with obvious ease, and it was good to be carried along. It all seemed so natural.</p>
