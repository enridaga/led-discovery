Let me now turn to Belmonte’s aria in A major, “O wie ängstlich, o wie feurig.” Would you like to know how I have expressed it - and even indicated his throbbing heart? By the two violins playing octaves. This is the favourite aria of all those who have heard it, and it is mine also. I wrote it expressly to suit Adamberger’s voice. You feel the trembling - the faltering - you see how his throbbing breast begins to swell; this I have expressed by a crescendo. You hear the whispering and the sighing - which I have indicated by the first violins with mutes and a flute playing in unison.
