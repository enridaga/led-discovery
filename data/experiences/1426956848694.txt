My father had a private box at the theatre, and my mother, passionately fond of theatricals herself, often took me to the play. From the time I first saw him act, nothing ran in my head but Webster, unless, indeed, it was the desire of going on the stage. I used to look at him with wonder, when he was performing Macheath ; and those who recollect him in that character will agree with me that it certainly was a masterly performance. He had a fine figure, with a marked and rather handsome countenance; his voice was a fine baritone, 
with a sweet falsetto, of which, being a good musician, he made a judicious use, particularly in "The Charge is prepared;" indeed, I think it impossible that his performance of this character can be surpassed.
