Listen to the winning 3 of Telegraph comp on wireless. Armstrong Gibbs 4tet. competent I suppose, dull as ditchwater & v. unoriginal. E. Maconchy Ob. 5tet. Not so competent, but one or two fresh Ideas. Eric Cundell (1st prize), technically efficient I suppose. Superficially brilliant & disonent fast move. Ordinary & rather cheap slow ones.*
