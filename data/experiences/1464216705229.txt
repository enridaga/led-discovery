<p>Koussevitzky's concert, with the first performance of Honegger's Concerto for Piano. It was nice, pleasant orchestral effects from modest forces, and some attractive tunes. But it was an extremely boring work for the pianist, and technically elementary. I said it would be a good new Concerto for Stravinsky to add to his repertoire. Suvchinsky liked the work, but Dukelsky was very critical. It was followed by Scriabin's&nbsp;<em>Extase</em>, which I have not heard for a long time and which, apart from a few passages, I now listened to with some enjoyment. I shall doubtless be stones for this admission, since these days hardly anyone has a good word for Scriabin. But I believe this to be a temporary phenomenon.</p>
