This was the 1st recital in the rather restricted music giving which wartime allows and it was pleasant to see a pretty good audience in spite of the counter attractions of the first L.S.O. Symphony concert at the Queen's Hall... All in all the main satisfaction of the afternoon was in having once again heard some music at first hand.
