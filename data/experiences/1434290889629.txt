Listen to pt. of B.B.C. symph. concert at 9.5 - Ansermet very good. Egmont ov. quite well played. 2 songs from Egmont (Irene Morden) quite well sung. Bach 2nd Brandenburg with Eb Cl. instead of Trumpet (most of time). One gained in confidence but missed the power & character of the trumpet - but the Eb Cl. sounds very like a small trumpet, & there was better balance. Honnegger's Symphony (1930)* to end with. Some amazingly beautiful ideas: but it seemed to me too complex. I liked the slow mov. best for one long broad string (afterwards brass) theme. Last mov. began well but meandered: beautiful ending - Delius!!
