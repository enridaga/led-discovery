They form a kind of theatre, and a brass globe supported on the shoulders of Atlas, ejects water on all sides. [&hellip;] The column of water in the center of the fountain rises to the height of seventy-four <em>palmi,</em> and is attended with a noise like the whizzing of sky-rockets. Here is also a Faunus, or Polypheme (near which are several other statues and five <em>basso-relievo's)</em> playing on one of the ancient pastoral-pipes, consisting of several unequal reeds, and a Centaur blowing a horn, which is said to be heard for four Italian miles. The water which supplies these curious works is brought hither from a spring six miles distant from this villa. In an arched hall here, is also to be seen mount Parnassus, with Apollo, the Muses, and Pegasus; the music of the choir proceeds from an artificial cuckow, and an organ with variety of stops put in play by water, as is another placed before the theatre. The keys of these instruments are moved by brass pins fixed in a cylinder, which turns on its axis by means of a water-mill.</span></p>
