<p>But I did love to dance, so I danced with the customers. White men often were eager to dance with the performers. The other Negro girls in the show just wouldn't dance with them. Most colored people can't bear to dance with white folks. Invariably whites dance in a broken rhythm, don't listen to the music and count. They're off the beat most of the time. Besides dancing with the white customers, I worked in the ensemble numbers with the chorus. My leg had completely healed, but there was still that inches-deep gash there which I concealed by wearing long opera stockings. My big solo song numbers at Rafe's Paradise were "The Japanese Sandman" and "Rose of Washington Square."</p>
