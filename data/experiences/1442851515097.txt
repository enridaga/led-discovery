<p>Uncle Sam inspired my love of classical, especially violin music. I'd expected a famous violinist to be old, grey and wizened: but the first one I saw was Yehudi Menuhin. A teenage crush developed! We came to the RFH for many concerts - the Oistrakhs wherever possible. I think Uncle Sam's favourite was Campoli. I hope the renovations haven't changed the hall too much - I still expect to see Sam, many years dead, round the next corner.</p>
