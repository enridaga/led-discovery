    With so many Highland folk coming into Glasgow, it was natural that Jacobite songs were also favourites.
    The Kennedy family specialised in that line. Mr. Kennedy, the leader (father of Mrs. Kennedy-Fraser, the great Hebridean song writer and singer), was particularly successful in “ MacGregor’s Gathering.”
    It is hardly to be understood nowadays that fifty years ago Glasgow audiences felt such songs as that. The Jacobite spirit was still alive—even in Queen Victoria's days.
