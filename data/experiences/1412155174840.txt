Music is perhaps a little too strongly urged, in accusing me of Injustice & prejudice, two terrible Qualities in an Historian! - which it may even be dangerous to hint at - again - my Enthusiasm in favour of Italian Music, at wch the Critique wonders hits a little too hard - & will certainly raise the allarm among the English Musicians - I have already had a Curious Letter from Dr Arne, wch I must shew you, on the Subject. He is hurt at not being mentioned tho' the three foreigners, Giardini, Bach & Abel are. - But I heard their music performed throughout Italy, whereas that of the poor Dr has never yet been able to Clamber the Alps.
