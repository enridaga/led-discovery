We had a farewell dinner to the Rivers Thompsons, and a concert after it. D. proposed the Lieutenant-Governor's health in `suitable' terms. Mr. and Mrs. Cunningham also dined here for the last time before they return to England. Colonel Chatterton arranged the concert for me, and we had very nice music and a pleasant party.
