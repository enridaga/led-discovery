<p>When chanting was first introduced into the&nbsp;Weigh House chapel, (Rev. Mr. Binney's,), about four years since, it was received with almost universal favor from the first; but there was one good old man who made strong objection to it; it grieved him much; but as the people were almost all in favor of it, he yielded in a good Christian spirit, looked on his book during the exercise, and tried to submit patiently to that which he could not approve. The sixty-seventh Psalm was, and is, often chanted. Indeed, they have but very few selections from the Psalms that they use, nor have they more than two or three chants, Tallis' chant is the principal. The few Psalms that they use, therefore, with the tunes, are well engraved upon the memory of the people. A few weeks since the old man died. When on his death-bed, he sent for his minister. Mr. Binney immediately obeyed the summons, and as he entered the sick chamber found the old man on his death-bed, with his Bible open before him, trying to chant the sixty-seventh Psalm.&nbsp;</p>
