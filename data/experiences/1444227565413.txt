Upon enquiry I found these were nothing more than a company of psalm-singers La Compagna. They say all the companies of artisansgo to church in this manner singing psalms and hymns in parts. This institution is very ancient as it is mentioned by the historians to have been practiced by Lorenzo il Magnifico, who with his courtiers used to go thro&rsquo; the streets singing in 3, 4, 5, 6, and even 8 parts. The company stopt before a church, just after they had passed the inn where I was lodged and sung a cheerful hymn in 3 parts very well.</span></p>
