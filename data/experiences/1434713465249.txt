It was a busy time and that autumn Sir Edward Elgar honoured me by asking me to play the Cello Concerto with him in Worcester Cathedral. I was the first woman instrumentalist to play there, and I believe that Sir Edward had some difficulty in persuading some of the dignitaries that all would be well, as some of them seemed uncertain. I tried to dress very suitably in a lovely frock of red and gold velvet with a long train and a head-dress of gold net surrounded by pearls and round my neck I wore Motherâ€™s cross of emeralds and pearls. The atmosphere of the cathedral was like no other and something greatly spiritual descended on the cello and I know the orchestra experienced it too. The following year I played at Gloucester Cathedral and the next at Hereford and always the same feeling of serenity was with me.
