<p>Listen to F.B. conudcting B.B.C. orch. in a programme of light music - delightfully done. William Tell, ov.; Chant sans paroles; Funeral March of a Marionette was just superb; Sylvia Ballet; Barcorolle etc. from Tales of Haffman; and Marche - P&egrave;re la Victoire to finish.* The whole programme was just&nbsp;right.</p>
