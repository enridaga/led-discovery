At the quartet meetings we had a great variety: In the first place, Schumann's quartet in A major, strongly Beethovenish in character; then back to one of Haydn's, by way of transition to the Mozart school, and lastly, Beethoven's quartet in B major, op. 130. In this work Beethoven storms heaven itself, and yet again what child-like simplicity and passionate grief!
