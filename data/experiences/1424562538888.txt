A few days after the establishment of the new government, I conducted my orchestra at a ceremony celebrating the proclamation of the Republic. The concert took place in the great palace of Montjuich in Barcelona, and seven thousand people were present. We performed Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. At the end of the concert, the President of the newly formed Catalan government, Frances Maciá, declared the Republic had come into being on the wings of the Hymn to Brotherhood – that noble chorale with which the Ninth concludes. / I was then fifty-three years old. I had conducted Beethoven’s Ninth many times. But that spring night the glorious words of the Finale had a symbolic significance for me that they had never had before (…) For me, at that moment, there was a true joining of man and music. For me that moment symbolized what the people of my country had dreamed of throughout long years of struggle and suffering – the coming into being of a government dedicated to the highest aspirations of man, to freedom and happiness and universal fraternity. That moment was a triumph for the people of all Spain – for the people of all nations. Alas, who then foresaw that this triumph would end in terrible tragedy?
