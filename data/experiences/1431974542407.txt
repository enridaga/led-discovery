Ida [Beatrice Harrison maid] was tall and buxom with pince-nez spectacles on her nose and she wore a small cap which always fell forward when she spoke. She knew a great many folk-songs and Monica, my little sister who had such a lovely voice, used to enjoy singing them with her. It was touching to see them, one so tall and one so small, singing together with their whole hearts and souls 
united by the lovely old melodies.
