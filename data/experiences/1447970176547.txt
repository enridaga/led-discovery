<p>To me his [Johannes Brahms] playing was always intensely interesting. Its inaccuracy and slovenliness vexed my ear;&nbsp;but its descriptiveness and, still more, its suggestiveness&nbsp;were fruitful in exercise for the intelligence. One of&nbsp;the strongest impressions it made upon me &mdash; leaving, of&nbsp;course, its vigorous and subtle intellectuality out of the&nbsp;question &mdash; was that the great Hamburg composer never&nbsp;thoroughly studied any work selected by him for performance in public, but contented himself with mastering&nbsp;its plan and intention, as he understood them, and with&nbsp;imparting his view thereof to his hearers. This he succeeded in doing, as far as my experience of his playing&nbsp;enables me to pronounce an opinion, in a highly forcible&nbsp;and intelligible manner.</p>
