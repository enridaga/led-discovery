<p>Working such long and exhausting hours left me little time for recreation. But whenever I could I'd spend an afternoon in the peanut gallery of the Alhambra. And it was there I saw for the first time the standard Negro acts that had been playing the white time for years --Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, Moss and Frye, the dancing Dotson. I also heard many of the popular white singers: Belle Baker, Sophie Tucker, Blossom Seeley, Eva Tanguay, and Trixie Friganza.</p>
