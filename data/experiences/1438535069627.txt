In the autumn of 1894 he challenged criticism as a conductor only, and was &ldquo;let off&rdquo; pretty lightly. He <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>wielded the baton with his left hand, but his beat <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was firm and distinct, and his readings, if colorless, were intelligent and clear. In the summer of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>1895 he appeared as a composer, and presented to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the world, for the first time, a symphonic poem written after Schiller's &ldquo;Sehnsucht. "This work revealed promise, but it was &ldquo;the promise of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>child who tries to run before he can walk, the prematurely exposed talent of the artist who represents on canvas some great problem of human life <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>before he has mastered the art of mixing his colors." At the same concert he gave a practical <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>demonstration of his father's ideas concerning the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>interpretation of Beethoven's &ldquo;little&rdquo; symphony in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>F. On the other hand, his reading of the &ldquo;Der Freischutz&rdquo; overture was &ldquo;simply remarkable for <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>wilful eccentricity and a flagrant disregard for the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>obvious intentions of the composer."</span></p>
