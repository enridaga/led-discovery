<p><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">What I find attractive in Britten is his power and sincerity, the outward simplicity of his music and its deep, emotional effectiveness. Personally I do not like to listen to a work and remain unaffected by it: it should act on me and open up something new in the world and in myself. This is precisely what Britten does in all his works, from his operas and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">War Requiem </em>to his quartets and romances based on the poetry of Pushkin. </span></span></p>
