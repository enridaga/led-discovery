<p>Now it was a very strange thing at these jam sessions in Kansas City. Nobody ever got in nobody's way. Nobody ever had to point a finger and say, "You take it now. You take the next chorus." Any place in Kansas City where there was a session the guys would just get up on the bandstand, and spiritually they knew when to come in&hellip;Like when there were either two tenors and two trumpet players on the stand no one had to point to you and tell you to follow the trombone player. They just felt which one was coming next. I remember sessions with guys like Dick Wilson and Ben Webster, and sometime Pha Terrel would come right out of the audience and sing right in the middle of a number, and he knew exactly where to start. I haven't heard a jam session like that since I came to New York.</p>
