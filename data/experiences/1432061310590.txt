While my friend Storace was earning laurels in the Haymarket, I was most kindly treated at Drury Lane. My performance which succeeded Lionel, was that of Young Meadows, in " Love in a Village." In addition to the original songs, I 
introduced one of Gluck's, to which Mrs. Sheridan did me the honour to write English words, " Love, thou maddening power ;" this was a great favourite, as also the duet, " Each joy in thee possessing," both of which were always encored.
