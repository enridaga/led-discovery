<p>Up to the present time there had been but few signs of a crowd. The procession, however, had not gone far down the road, before many men on horseback came forward to meet the officers, and some of the horsemen struck the horses in front of the conveyance which carried Major Bassett Lewis violently about the head and body. A large crowd also came forward armed with all sorts of instruments capable of producing discordant sounds and headed by an ominous-looking black flag on which was painted in white, "The death-knell of the Tithe Church."&nbsp;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The crowd was accompanied by a choir of small girls singing the following lines:-</p>
<p>Mi glywais gan rywun, un rhyw le, rhyw bryd,<br />Fod bedd mawr Llanllwchaiarn yn ddigon o hyd<br />I gladdu y degwm a'i deulu mewn hedd:<br />Ac yn y dydd olaf ni welir eu gwedd;<br />Ar ddiwrnod eu hangladd mi gredaf bydd llu<br />Or hir offeiriadon a'u gwenwisg yn ddu.<br />Au gwenwisg yn ddu<br />O rhyfedd fath beth; O rhyfedd fath beth,<br />Fod rhaid talu y degwm<br />A thalu y dreth.</p>
