Before he [Hugues Cuenod] left he asked if I could play Poulenc's "C" - he has some new words for it. I accompanied him through a parody which began, "Je suis dans un W.C., c'est là tout a commencé,"and grew predictably more lewd, while playing suggestively, as Aragon does, with the sound of the sibilant "c' (sucer, etc.). I said, "Francis l'aurait adoré," but was in fact vaguely embarrassed.
