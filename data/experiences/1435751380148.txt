<p>This evening, the ninety-minute TV documentary on the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival filmed two summers ago. In the flame-color shirt I look pretty good (so do we all - Harrison, Schuman, Copland, and the pretty players), and what I say isn't dumb; but every statement is lopped off. Even the music's truncated, with no piece played straight through. The film's not about music, it's about a music festival.</p>
