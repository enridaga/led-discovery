I am extremely happy with Thomasâ€™s company & conversation. On Sunday evening he walked with R. & J. Mills to the barracks, & when he returned he introduced into the room a black (or copper) performer on the tambour de basque (or some such thing) belonging to one of the military bands. "Sir", says he, "I have brought a friend with me!" The man was an Indian Mussulman who came over in an E. I. Ship.
