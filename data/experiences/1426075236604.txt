Plans are now ready for a soiree to be given at Lewicki's where, among other things, Prince Galitzin is to play Rode's Quartet. They will be doing Hummel' s Sentinelle and will finish with my Polonaise for 'cello, to which I have added an Introduction especially written for Kaczynski. We have tried it over and it goes well.
