Our concert in Toppan Hall is the biggest success yet. The audience is completely while we're playing, as if they are utterly absorbed. At the end, they clap so much and for so long that we have to run to the dressing-rooms to get a second piece of music to use as a second encore. Even after that, they clap on and on. All the staff of Hyperion's Japanese distribution have come to the concert, and they tell us afterwards that they are pleased they are with our CD sales - 50 or 60 at each concert. Small fry for pop musicians, but pleasing for us. After the concert I comment to Ant that the audience gave me the feeling that they were not used to sitting together in that new hall, and didn't quite feel an identity as an audience. Ant says that he knows exactly what I mean, but wonders how on earth we could pick up on that feeling from the stage.
