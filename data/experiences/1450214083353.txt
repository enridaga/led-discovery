<p class="MsoNormal">Our Quintette Club was engaged to play with Ole Bull for a week. He was requested to play first violin in one of Mozart&rsquo;s quintettes,&mdash; a first movement only. We had to stand up while playing it. To sit down and play was an impossibility for the heroic Ole. At the time of the first Jubilee in Boston, he and Carl Rosa played at the first desk of violins. We all thought it noble of him to take part.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ole Bull had all the fine traits of the successful player. After each of his performances there was usually great applause. When he came out on the stage to acknowledge the compliment, his manner was so uncommonly graceful, so stately-courteous, as he bowed right and left, that the audience was, if possible, more completely captured than when he was playing to them</p>
