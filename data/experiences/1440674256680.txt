<p class="MsoNormal">It would make you tremble when one of those bands, it came into sight. One of them would come up in front of the other and face it, and you'd hear both of them. There&rsquo;d be the two. And then you&rsquo;d start noticing onliest the one. Somehow you&rsquo;d just hear it better. Maybe it was clearer, maybe it was just giving you a lot more feeling. And so you'd want to hear it closer and you&rsquo;d get up nearer. And then, it seemed it was <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">all</em> you were hearing. It was the only one that came through. And the other band, it would get away father and father until finally you just didn't hear it at all.</p>
