We were told that our battalion was to go up for instruction to a Welsh battalion, and some of us feared a rough type. Well, up we went through the interminable communication trenches … reached our point, were detailed, and then - C[ridlan] and I crawled into a candle lit dugout, and so met four of the nicest young men you could meet, possibly. They knew folksong. And one of them sang 'David of the White Rock' and 'A Slumber Song'… A most amazing evening, as you must admit. I had but 3 hours sleep the night before, but sleep was out of the question on such an occasion. Some of them came from Welsh universities, one of them was a Yorkshireman. All of them good fellows, and as kind as could be to us new arrivals.
