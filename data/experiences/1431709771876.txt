Some hours before the performance Shostakovich and I came in to the city from Zhukovka to hear Moysey Vainberg play through the Michelangelo Sonnets on the piano, which he did magnificently. I listened to the Suite with a rare feeling of excitement, and Shostakovich similarly found it hard to control his emotions.
