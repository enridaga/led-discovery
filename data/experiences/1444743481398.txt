We arrived about 7 in the morning, found the roads and town very full of country people as at a wakes but very few <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">gens comme il faut</em>. Great preparations were making in the great square for the diversions of the evening. At 11 was a great musical performance but not what I expected as to performers - the heat, that of the black hole at Calcutta - such a crowd and such a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">hive</em>. The music of the mass was really pretty, full of new and elegant passages - there was however but one good singer, Abate Fibietto, a tenor whose voice and taste were charming. He sung a motet with such execution, precision and taste as I never remember to have heard.</span></p>
