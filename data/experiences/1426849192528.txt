At the house of Schulze, Professor of Music, I heard several choruses and motets without accompaniment, admirably executed by his pupils, and these performances were in the presence of Zelter, the severe critic, who happened to be at Leipzig at the time. I heard also in the Thomas Church eight part motets and fugues sung with much force and precision by pupils under the directorship of my friend Cantor Schicht.
