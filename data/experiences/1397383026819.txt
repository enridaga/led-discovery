...I first became acquainted with Mr. Clementi in passing through London, on my way to Paris, on the concluding of the peace of Amiens... The peace had brought many foreigners to London, and I sat down at his table with French, Spanish, Germans, Italians, Russians, Turks, and Arabs, and with every one of these Clementi held a conversation, generally in their own language...While we were at table a young gentleman named Field, an élève of Mr. Clementi, sat down to the pianoforte, and gratified the company by playing one of Bach’s fugues, in which, by his force of touch, he maintained a clear distinction in the four different parts.
