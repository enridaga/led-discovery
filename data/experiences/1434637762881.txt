<p>Mrs Granville to Mrs Dewes Friday,10 at night - Mrs- Viney made me go from church to-day to dine with her, which is the first visit I have made to anybody, she is heartily yours, so are her daughters ; Mr. Hays was there and Smith, and we had a good deal of music vocal and instrumental. Mrs. Duncomb was here yesterday, and cards the entertainment. Mrs. Gaudinau has quarrelled with the H's, so they don't now meet at all, and they are sadly put to it for parties at play.</p>
