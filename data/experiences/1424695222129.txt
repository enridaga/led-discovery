<p>Yesterday I had the Singverein. While practising I felt as if I had already been at the work for twenty-five years. My voice is of no little use to me on these occasions, because I have to shout so loud, and it is an advantage that, like every other, I exploit to the full. My voice sounds quite majestic. While the choir is singing I exercise it and yell above the din, really only on my own account in order to get practice. We intend to do the Zigeunerleben and I am sure it will soon go splendidly. How childishly easy such things are compared with old church music, and my Salve Regina is easy as such things go. This piece would please you very much. I can&rsquo;t tell you very much about Rovetta except that he lived about 1640. Both pieces please the singers very much, and they are taking great pains with them. The Zigeunerleben is exquisite and sounds wonderful. Yesterday with Bargheer I had to accompany the Prince in his songs. I hope it won&rsquo;t often happen&hellip;.</p>
