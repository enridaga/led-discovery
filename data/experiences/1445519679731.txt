<p class="MsoNormal">I went this morning to the convent of Saint Ursula to see the ceremony of a nun take the veil... I was close to the alter and saw and heard every word that was uttered. The 1st ceremony was saying mass &ndash; then came Cardinal de Rossi in great state, while the organ was playing and mass was singing with instruments, all performed by nuns and ladies of the convent in the organ loft &ndash; the music was very pretty, but ill performed &ndash; the organ was bad and too powerful for the band. [...] [M]ore pretty music badly performed, the organ playing all the sinfonies and accompaniments overpowered the violins and had a bad effect, tho&rsquo; neatly performed.</p>
