<p>Will Parker arrives Saturday for thirty-six hours of rehearsal. Meanwhile I practice the Ives songs. Although I have a certain respect for some of them (<em>Tom Sails Away</em> is as upsetting as a Griffith movie in slow motion), I take no pleasure in working join them. Those random dissonances, with no concept of the hand!</p>
