<p>After Portsmouth my object was to see Chichester cathedral... It happened to be the feast of St. Michael, 29th of September, when a full choir are in attendance, or I should have had the mortification of paying my visit on a day when the organ is never used. It is a noble instrument, and played in a masterly manner by young Mr. Bennett, brother to the unfortunate gentleman killed by the overturning of a coach when going to the Worcester music-meeting. The diapasons are of ancient make, and enamelled, producing such a body of tone that I mistook them for the bourdon stop. This organ and the performer are so excellent that, in justice to both, the Chapter ought not to delay another hour in appending the modern improvement of the double diapason. I was much delighted with the service by Croft.&nbsp;</p>
