In 1880 my father brought out a work at his orchestral concerts in Manchester, the production of which gave him the greatest pleasure and interest; this was Berlioz's ' Faust.' The Hungarian March and the ' Ballet des Sylphes ' were well known, as 
they had often been given at previous concerts ; but to give the work in its entirety had been my father's ambition for years, and he at last ventured on it in spite of the doubts expressed by many of his friends as to its proving a popular success. The concert excited much interest throughout England, and many well- known musicians repaired to Manchester to hear the first performance of a work which had been so much discussed, and about which so many contrary opinions were held. The performance, which had been preceded by many careful rehearsals, was at all points magnificent, and reflected the greatest credit upon both band and 
chorus, whilst the principal vocalists, Miss Mary Davies, Mr. Lloyd, Mr. Hilton, and Mr. Henschel rendered the solos admirably. The work was received with so much enthusiasm that my father gave it a second time during the same season, a very 
rare proceeding on his part.
