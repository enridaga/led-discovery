… Mo, Norman, and I were walking by the Riverside Inn, when the door opened and we heard the most incredible sounds. We immediately stepped inside, and on the small stage was a four piece vocal-instrumental group singing the most modern harmonies we’d ever heard. That was our introduction to the Four Freshmen. I became so enraptured, I reminded myself of Mr. Brooks, my boss at the Capitol theater in New York City, when he took me to see George Shearing. I knew then what he had felt. From that day on, I’ve been one of the Four Freshmen’s greatest fans.
