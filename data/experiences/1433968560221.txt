<p>When Rossini visited this country I was introduced to him by Spagnoletti. He was a fine, portly, good-looking fellow, a voluptuary that revelled in the delights of the table as much as in the luxury of sweet sounds. He had just composed a dirge on the death of Lord Byron, the score of which he exhibited to me, obviously penned with the greatest rapidity. I heard part of it performed, and thought it worthy of that great genius. I am not aware that this work has been printed. He sang the principal airs himself in a graceful manner, and with a rich liquidity of tone ; the easy movement of his voice delighted me; his throat seemed lacquered with Florence oil, so ripe and luscious were the tones he threw out. He was a perfect master of the piano forte, and the mode of his touching that instrument was beautifully neat and expressive.</p>
