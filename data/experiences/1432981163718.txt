A little difficulty awaited me at the beginning of my work at Montreal. I understood I was to deliver my opening address in the Cathedral ; but it appeared there had been some opposition, the Bishop, who I think
was also the Dean, not agreeing to the Cathedral being used for that purpose. It was a trifling bit of obstruction that unfortunately is sometimes met with in
Church matters. However, I was invited to the Presbyterian Church of St. Paul, and must say that it was in many of the Presbyterian Churches throughout
Canada that I had the best success. I felt much at home in the Scotch atmosphere, meeting many Scotsmen who had friends and relatives in that part of Scotland where I spend my holidays. A bright example in the case of the English Church was at Toronto. There the Rector of St. James's Cathedral, a man of liberal views, welcomed me, placing his Church at my service, while the choir, under the direction of Dr. Ham an admirable choirmaster and good
all-round musician rendered a selection of Cathedral music, from Dering to Wesley, in first-rate style. The "atmosphere " imparted to the music was somewhat different from that which I had come to associate with
my Presbyterian lectures, inasmuch as the choir, as in an English Cathedral, was composed of men and boys, whereas in the Presbyterian churches the trebles were women. But except in large places like Toronto, it appears almost impossible in Canada to get together a choir of boys. Dr. Ham, however, showed that it could be done, and I think the organists of many of the Churches of the Established Church in Canada could be laudably ambitious in this direction.
