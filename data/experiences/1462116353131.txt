<p>I arrived back today from Berlin, - as is usually the case with me: disgusted by the Jewish music market, which holds sway there permanently; an evil, stifling atmosphere. In this market only publicity and power count, they do not deal in serious values. Thus your piano concerto appears to have been found too serious. The reception in the evening was very warm; Schmid Lindner played his part excellently and with affection, I think we did justice to the work, but what I have read about it so far is sheer nonsense; someone discovered that you have now gone over to the unrestrained impressionistic manner of the new French school - - - &amp; moreover you work is 10 years old &amp; belongs to a "long-outmoded" movement in its melody &amp; austere form. Priceless!/ I greatly enjoyed your work. Certainly the instrumentation is rather heavy; but of course it is not really &nbsp;a concerto&nbsp;<em>for&nbsp;</em>piano but&nbsp;<em>with&nbsp;</em>piano. I am not quite sure about the ending (from the Maestoso on); it seems to me as if it is rather too terse? Or am I wrong? I am rather ashamed that you had so colossal a success with the concerto in London, &amp; it is a bad sign for Berlin. But there too it will probably change!&nbsp;</p>
