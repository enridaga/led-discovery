<p>In the first place, whether opera, symphony, stringed&nbsp;quartet, or any other variety of concerted music be announced in the bill, all the German youths and maidens&nbsp;present who have a mind to prove by demonstration that&nbsp;they know all about it, and no mistake, bring full scores,&nbsp;oblong in form, with them, and turn over the leaves&nbsp;during the performance in a flappy way that is peculiarly&nbsp;irritating to the auditor who happens to be listening for&nbsp;his pleasure, and not to show other people how intensely,&nbsp;absorbingly, far-more-than-professionally musical he is.&nbsp;I used to find a gloomy consolation for the annoyance&nbsp;inflicted upon me by these disturbers of my peace in&nbsp;observing how hard Nature had been upon them in connection with their personal appearance. No pretty girl&nbsp;or tolerably good-looking younker ever turned over the&nbsp;leaves of a score in any Berlin theatre or concert-room&nbsp;when I was present.&nbsp;</p>
