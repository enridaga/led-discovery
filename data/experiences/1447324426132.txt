<p>During the summer of 1954 I attended a student ball and, aside from the fun of the occasion, remember sneaking up to the highest level with my escort, where we found a door open to the auditorium, to see the magnificent new organ. The inaugural concert had been earlier in the evening, in the presence of the Queen Mother, I believe. I worked abroad for many years, but in the sixties much enjoyed the subscription concerts. Nor have I forgotten the entertaining 'Point and Counterpoint' comments on the back of the monthly brochures.</p>
