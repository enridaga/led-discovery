As an instance of versatility of talent, I mention my friend, Mr. Mann, woollen draper, Bradford, Yorkshire. I was in the habit of serving him with hosiery, and for some time knew him only as a plain intelligent tradesman, speaking the patois of the country. In one of my visits my attention was caught by the tone of an organ in an adjacent room. On remarking to his brother that it was beautifully voiced, he said, " Ye be bit of a music man, I'm thinking." " Yes, I am a little fond of it." " Then yell just suit brother Tim ; gang this way, man." I found my friend completing an organ he had just built. No science more agreeably brings people together than music. Though I was upon a friendly footing before, this bond of union drew our acquaintance still closer. The instrument occupied a small recess in his parlour, and was chiefly composed of wooden pipes of so good a quality, that, under the hand of the maker, it breathed a heavenly music. Mr. Mann, although unacquainted with the written works of eminent composers, was a fine extemporary performer. Under his hand the instrument would discourse with a modulation and air highly interesting ; preluding, as it were, without any design, and roving through the most eccentric harmonies.
