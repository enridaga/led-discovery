<p>Some of the singers one sees nightly on the video stations are pretty cute. That's just the trouble. They're selling themselves, not a transferable music. Where is the music here so championed by Sandow and Rockwell? Not certainly in a composer. Springstein (pretty cute) pains me physically with his<em> Born in the U.S.A.</em> rasped from a strep throat.</p>
