<p>As a pianist, Mussorgsky was compared with Rubinstein. His piano &lsquo;bells&rsquo; are often recalled, and even his enemies admitted that he excelled as an accompanist. He wasn&rsquo;t a purist about it either, he banged away as a young man, not because he needed the money as I did, but just &lsquo;for company&rsquo;. When he was older, he did marvellous improvisations of humorous scenes, for instance, a young nun playing 'A Maiden&rsquo;s Prayer' with great feeling on an untuned piano.</p>
