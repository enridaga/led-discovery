He is master of twenty-three different notes or gradations of voice ; and as it is universally allowed that he excels all other singers, this extraordinary talent is said to have been bestowed on him by the virgin Mary, as a grateful return for the extraordinary adoration which Farinelli's mother constantly paid to her. He is now in the twenty-third year of his age ; so that he may possibly improve, and even surpass his present skill.</span></p>

But we must observe that opera's are not calculated to please the judgment, but to tickle the ear ; so that propriety of characters is as little to be expected in these pieces, as sublime and poetical language.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The music of the airs is often composed before the words; and the author is sometimes obliged, in certain syllables pointed out to him, to introduce a word which has the vowels e or a ; those vowels being the two sounds on which a good voice can best display its strength and variety of modulations.</span></p>
