This evening Paul, Dina and I, sat together, and then they left me alone. The moon was shining into my room and I did not light the candles. I went out on the terrace and could hear the sound of violins, guitars, and flutes, in the distance. I came in again quickly and sat down near the window so as to hear it better. It was a charming trio. I have not listened to music with so much pleasure for a long time. At a concert one is more occupied in looking at the audience than in listening, but this evening, quite alone in the moonlight, I may say I devoured this serenade, for it really was one. Some young men of Nice gave us a serenade. Could anything be more gallant?
