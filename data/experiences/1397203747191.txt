Finish my carol in morning. Practise. Lesson with Benjamin 2.40. Go to University Library get Chopin - Godovsky Studies vol. 1. Brahms F 5tet & Bruchner no8 Symph. Go to very fine B.B.C. concert conducted by O. Fried. Coriolan ov. (v. finely played). Brahms 2nd Concerto (Gieseking) - simply magnificent. He was as brilliant as Rubenstein, but put the music to the fore simply magnificently - I've never heard a Concerto played so well. Berlioz Fantastic Symphony - more polished than the Hall√©, & consequently March to Scaffold lost a bit. But the orchestra was simply superb, all the evening. Kennedy's solo in the Brahms too gorgeous.
