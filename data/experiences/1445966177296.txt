When he sung as first man at our opera he was uncommonly handsome, and a remarkably good actor; Garrick himself having taken pains to instruct him. His voice was then a soprano of the finest description, and his performance, particularly of Orfeo, was described as having been delightful. He was now advanced in years, and sung as contralto: his voice was still full and well toned, and his style appeared to me excellent.</span></p>
