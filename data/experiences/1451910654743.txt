<p>In no executive branch of the musical art has a more&nbsp;striking and general advancement been achieved in this&nbsp;metropolis [London] within the past quarter of a century than in&nbsp;that portion of theatrical entertainments which consists&nbsp;of orchestral performances, such as may be heard every&nbsp;night in any London theatre, agreeably prefacing the&nbsp;play or plays on the bill of the evening, and, in one or&nbsp;two instances, making the <em>entr'actes</em> or "waits," even&nbsp;more recreative to the audience than the stage business&nbsp;itself. A good band is nowadays well nigh as essential&nbsp;an attraction to a metropolitan playhouse as a good acting&nbsp;company; and the former may be counted upon by the&nbsp;public with even more confidence than the latter, taking&nbsp;one theatre with another.</p>
