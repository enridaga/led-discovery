I had yet to learn that only a conductor of genius - for preference not the composer, except in very rare cases - can produce a new orchestral work intelligibly; at that time too the idiom of Brahms was unfamiliar, and doubtless the rendering lacked conviction. One thing I well remember, that on this occasion I first realized exactly how much critics grasp of a new work not yet available in print. The great Leipzig Extinguisher, after making the usual complaints as to lack of melody, excess of learning, and general unsatisfactoriness, remarked: "About half-way through the very tedious first movement there is one transient gleam of light, a fairly tuneful passage for horns.&rdquo; He had not noticed this was the recurring first theme, which had already appeared for those self-same horns in the second bar!</span></p>
