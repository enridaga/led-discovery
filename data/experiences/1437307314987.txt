<pre>When last in Paris, I had been to the Theatre Frangais to see a petite comedy <br />performed, entitled "Les Deux Postes," and delighted I was with the manner in <br />which it was acted. Baptiste, the elder, played the Blind Old Man to <br />admiration. Indeed, the whole dramatis personae were perfect. I procured a <br />copy of the piece, and gave it to my friend George Colman, who, being pleased <br />with the subject, resolved to write a musical afterpiece from it ; and his <br />adaptation was far superior to the original, as indeed was every thing he did <br />in the same way. It was brought out on the 28th January, under the title of <br />"We Fly by Night ; or, Long Stories," at Covent Garden Theatre. I composed the <br />whole of the music. Munden's personification of the Old Story-teller was <br />perfect ; indeed, all the performers in the piece gave it their best support ; it was 
strongly cast. Liston and Fawcett were exquisitely comic ; the part of the <br />Englishman (in the French original so well performed by Baptiste the younger) 
was transposed into a Frenchman, and very well acted by Farley ; Miss Tyrer, <br />now Mrs. Liston, was truly comic in the Landlady, and sang with her usual <br />sweetness; Miss Bavies was the Heroine. The piece was eminently successful, <br />and had a great run. Both Miss Tyrer and Miss Davies were pupils of Mrs. <br />Crouch and myself. Mrs. Liston was always attentive to her profession, and <br />scrupulously honourable in fulfilling all her engagements.
