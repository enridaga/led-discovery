The party at dinner were Lord and Lady Derby, Lord and Lady Granville, and Sir Charles and Lady Mary Wood. Lady Canning, who is in waiting, was most amiable and conversible…. Charming was the music during dinner; the first thing being the Midsummer Night’s Dream, exquisitely played. In the evening Sainton played finely on the violin, with accompaniment.
