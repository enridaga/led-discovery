<p>Rubinstein's playing has always impressed me as&nbsp;being, in certain important respects, unique ; for instance,in its fiery impetuosity, its inexhaustible capacity for&nbsp;varying its productions of tone-colour, and &mdash; last, though&nbsp;not least remarkable &mdash; its extraordinary <em>pianissimi</em>;&nbsp;mere instrumental whispers, but perfectly articulate and&nbsp;free from indistinctness. There is more than one eminent&nbsp;performer of the present day who can "sing " upon the&nbsp;piano quite as sweetly and intelligently as Rubinstein,&nbsp;and who is fully his equal in the execution of individual&nbsp;<em>tours de force</em>; but I know of no other whose forces&nbsp;manifestly increase, instead of diminishing, with the&nbsp;vanquishing of each successive difficulty that presents&nbsp;itself to him, and who, at the end of a long programme,&nbsp;can play its last number &mdash; generally a terrible exposition&nbsp;of some paramount technical difficulty or difficulties &mdash;&nbsp;more brightly, crisply, and vigorously than he played its&nbsp;first. Rubinstein compels the pianoforte to yield up and&nbsp;give out its utmost tone-power, not by thrashing it as&nbsp;though it were an hereditary foe with whom it is his&nbsp;purpose to settle an account of offence that has been&nbsp;running for several centuries, but by applying to its&nbsp;keyboard the exact sort of pressure which is bound to&nbsp;bring it to compliance. It may be said that pianofortes&nbsp;find the discipline they receive at his hands extremely&nbsp;trying&mdash; more so, even, than some of them can bear with-&nbsp;out breaking down under their trials. But, on the other&nbsp;hand, a good master chastens the servant whom he loves&nbsp;&mdash; of course, for that servant's good &mdash; and no pianist&nbsp;alive, I will be bound to say, is more deeply attached to&nbsp;the instrument upon which he plays than is Anton Rubinstein, that fine musician, magnificent executant,&nbsp;and prince of good fellows to boot.&nbsp;</p>
