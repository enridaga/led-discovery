<p>The fourth day of January was made a great scaffold in Cheap hard by the cross in readiness for the King's lord of misrule, coming from Greenwich and landed at Tower wharf. And with him young knights and gentlemen, a great number, on horseback, some in gowns and coats and chains about their necks, every man having a baldric of yellow and green about their necks. And on the Tower Hill there they went in order.</p>
<p>First a standard of yellow and green silk with St. George. And then guns and squibs, and trumpets and bagpipes and drumslades and flutes. And then a great company, all in yellow and green, and doctors declaring my lord great. And then the morris dance dancing with a tabret. And before twenty of his council on horseback in gowns of changeable lined with blue taffeta and capes of the same, like sage men.</p>
