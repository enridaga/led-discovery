<p>We have been planting tiny grains of seed in the front bed, in the pious or religious belief that they will resurrect next spring as Clarkia, Calceolaria, Campanula, Larkspur &amp; Scabious.&nbsp; I shan't recognise them if they do; we are planting at a venture, inspired by a seedsmen's language: how they stand high &amp; bear bright blue petals.&nbsp; Then there's weeding. Very soon, in any occupation, one makes a game of it.&nbsp; I mean (for I'm cold &amp; inept at the moment - church bells ringing, fire just catching, &amp; the great log we sawed about to plunge into fiery caverns) that one gives character to weeds...Then the tea bell rings, &amp; though I sit &amp; ponder over my cigarette, L. runs out like a child allowed to get down &amp; go.</p>
