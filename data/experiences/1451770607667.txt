<p><span lang="EN-GB">On 19 March, in the Grand Hall of the Moscow Conservatoire, a concert was given by the Russian Song Choir and the Boys&rsquo; Choir of the Moscow Choral school. The programme of the concert, conducted by Alexander Sveshnikov, consisted of works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The current concert season has included many works by Bach, in commemoration of the bicentenary of the great composer&rsquo;s death. In the summer of last year I had the good fortune to attend the Bach Festival in Leipzig, where many of his works were performed by the top musicians of the German Democratic Republic. I must confess, however, that the performances there were not always of the highest quality-especially those of Bach&rsquo;s choral works. At the recent concert in the Grand Hall of the Conservatoire, I could not help remembering our stay in Leipzig. What heights were attained by the Soviet choir, how profoundly they interpreted Bach&rsquo;s great legacy, and what technical brilliance they showed in performance!/&hellip;Bach&rsquo;s bicentenary has been well celebrated in the Soviet Union. I should like to see a bigger space in our concert programmes given over to his works &ndash; and not only during his anniversary celebrations, but all the time. </span></p>
