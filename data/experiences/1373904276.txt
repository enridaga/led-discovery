2 May, 1821. - This day se'nnight I went to Madame de Redens. We did not arrive till ten, because Charles had much to write, and we came away at one o'clock, but the greater part of the intermediate time I was waltzing, and was at the last so far from tired, that I could willingly have waltzed longer. Two days after I had a violent cramp, which made me quite lame, so that I hopped and hobbled about the house all Saturday morning, but on Saturday evening, Ringseis [a German doctor in Rome] came for his leave-taking visit, and we had some other people to meet him, who by degrees were so wound up by singing, that all set about waltzing - and soon I waltzed too - and the end of the story is, had no future cramp or fatigue.
