<p>In evening, Beth &amp; Aunt Flo go to a film, but I stay and listen to a B.B.C. orch concert, conducted (atrociously) by R.V. Williams. Grace has 2 Psalms done - nor her best works but definitely musical, &amp; far away the best of the programme which inc. dreadful concoctions by E. Maconchy, R.O. Morris, Robin Milford, &amp; R.V.W. (5 dreadfully boring mystical (?) songs). It is concerts like this which make me absolutely despair of English Music and its critics.</p>
