Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Basle: Tuesday, 30th June, 1840 -
'Valette went to our friend Riggenbach, the architect, and Sophia Wurstemberger was fetched to the house of friends, while I accompanied my honoured and gifted guide to the Antistes Burkhardt, with whom I found assembled about eighty persons, from France, Germany, and Switzerland, seated in a circle, of whom he enquired in succession, beginning with the nearest, first the name, and then the matter, as to which a communication would be asked or offered.' ....
'Among the most satisfactory communications were those respecting the awakening in the Baden-country,—and two societies, one numbering sixty
three, of such as preach Christ and His doctrine faithfully.' ....
'I believe all prayed with him and me at this moment ; and nowhere will a truer and freer act of homage have been performed. When Le Grand had finished, another was requested to intone a verse of a hymn ; he gave the words, then commenced the chant, and soon was followed by the second voice, till by degrees all fell in, and produced a grand choir of four parts. So we parted—the whole had been truly national. I thought of the grand world -assembly at Exeter
Hall a year ago ;—this brotherly greeting was very simple and unpretending in comparison, but so heartfelt and spiritual !'
