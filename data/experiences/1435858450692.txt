<p>[Mrs Crouch and I] went to Worcester and Birmingham for a few nights, and returned to London for the opening of the winter season at the King's Theatre., October 18th. At that theatre was introduced to the public, for the first time, the musical romance, called " The Prisoner," written by the Rev. Mr. Rose, one of the masters of the Charter House. It was a piece of much interest ; the principal scene (and a most effective one it was) I saw at Paris, and gave it to the author, who with a great deal of ingenuity, in grafted it on his own drama. It was that where the prisoner escapes by the aid of the gaoler's children. Chenard, the French actor's performance of the gaoler, was very fine acting ; and it is but justice to say, that Wewitzer's representation of the same character in its English garb, suffered nothing by comparison. The music by Attwood was very pleasing.</p>
