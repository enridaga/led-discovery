<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Sunday 26th Feb. 1967 and the first appearance on the concert platform in the UK, perhaps anywhere, of Otto Klemperer after he fell asleep with a cigarette alight and nearly burned himself to death. He appeared from the left, the audience errupted as he was helped up the steps to the platform. Then in the most amazing emotional atmosphere, the New Philharmonia and Klemperer performed Mahlers 9th Symphony, whose fourth movement Klemperer has described as "the majesty of death". An incredible unforgettable evening at the Royal Festival Hall.</p>
