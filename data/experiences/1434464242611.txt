<p>Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Clarges Street, Feby. 25th, 1743-4 - Well, to change from discord to harmony I will shift my subject, and tell you I was last night to hear Samson. Francescina sings most of Mrs. Cibber's part and some of Mrs. Clive's : upon the whole it went off very well, but not better than last year. Joseph, I believe, will be next Friday, but Handel is mightily out of humour about it, for Sullivan, who is to sing Joseph, is a black with a very fine voice, and Beard has no voice at all. The part which Francescina is to have (of Joseph's wife) will not admit of much variety; but I hope it will be well received; the houses have not been crowded, but pretty full every night.</p>
