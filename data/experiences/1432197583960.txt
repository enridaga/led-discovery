" A young stock-broker, the child of many prayers, was given to a life of gambling and drunken dissipation, bringing disgrace upon his wife and family, and costing his parents some thousands of pounds to save him from utter failure. On the Stock Exchange he was a leader in ridiculing the work of
the evangelists from over the sea. 
" One day the question was put to him, ' Is it fair to mock at what you have not heard ? ' He owned it was not, and promised to attend one of the meetings. As he entered, this hymn was being sung ; and he was all attention as the second verse pealed forth from the vast congregation :

Tell me the story slowly 
That I may take it in, 
That wonderful redemption, 
God's remedy for sin. 
Tell me the story often, 
For I forget so soon ; 
The early dew of morning
 Has passed away at noon.

" These words went to his heart. It was an exact description of his case. His early goodness had all passed away Hke the morning dew, and all was dry as the desert. While the succeeding verse was being sung he entirely broke down. But the words ' Remember, I'm the sinner whom Jesus came to save,' brought hope, then confidence, then joy ; and that day he realized that Jesus was a sufficient Saviour for the vilest sinner.
