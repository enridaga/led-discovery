My friend Johnstone took great pains to instruct me in the brogue, but I did not feel quite up to the mark; and, after all, it seems my vernacular phraseology was not the most perfect; for, when the opera was over, Sheridan came into the green-room, and said, "Bravo ! Kelly; very well, indeed; upon my honour, I never before heard you speak such good English in all my life." This sarcastic compliment produced much laughter from the performers who heard him*.</p>
