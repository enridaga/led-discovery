I went one evening to a concert of the celebrated Kozeluch's, a great composer for the piano-forte, as well as a fine performer on that instrument. I saw there the composers Vanhall and Baron Diderstoff, and, what was to me one of the greatest gratifications of my musical life, was there introduced to that prodigy of genius - Mozart. He favoured the company by performing fantasias and capriccios on the piano-forte. His feeling, the rapidity of his fingers, the great execution and strength of his left hand particularly, and the apparent inspiration of his modulations, astounded me. After this splendid performance we sat down to supper, and I had the pleasure of being placed at table between him and his wife, Madame Constance Weber, a German lady of whom he was passionately fond and by whom he had three children... After supper the young branches of our host had a dance, and Mozart joined them. Madame Mozart told me that great as his genius was, he was an enthusiast in dancing, and often said that his taste lay in that art rather than in music.
