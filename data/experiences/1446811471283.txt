She was rather like Storace, possessing most of her defects without all her excellencies. She however surprised the public towards the close of her engagement by her excellent performance of the part of Tancredi, for which nothing could be less suited than her figure; but the music was well adapted to her voice, and her singing it was really so good as to make her appearance of no consequence.</span></p>
