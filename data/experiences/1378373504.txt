The foreign officers have arrived, and we had a state dinner and a concert for them; the Hungarian violinist Remenyi played, and we had a very pleasant evening -- eighty people at dinner, and about sixty more afterwards. The music was in the drawing-room and a buffet in the ball-room, which opens into it with pillars, so that those who preferred talking to listening were able to stroll away and be happy in their own way.
