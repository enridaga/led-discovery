<p>During my brief sojourn in Pesth on the above-mentioned occasion and in connection with the so-called&nbsp;"Reconciliation Week," I underwent a very curious&nbsp;and exceptional musical experience, chiefly worth recalling because so pre-eminently illustrative of the wild&nbsp;excitement then prevailing throughout all classes of&nbsp;Hungarian society, and finding vent in extravagances&nbsp;of action that struck me at the time as all but incompatible with sanity of mind in their perpetrators. One of&nbsp;the fetes organised by the patricians and artists of Pesth&nbsp;in honour of the great national rejoicing was announced&nbsp;under the amazing title of "A Fools' Evening, given by&nbsp;the Committee of Folly," and came off one Sunday&nbsp;evening in the Grand Redoute, with the co-operation of&nbsp;over five thousand persons of both sexes, one and all&nbsp;earnestly bent upon proving themselves, in appearance&nbsp;and behaviour, bereft of their senses. The entertainment lasted ten hours; and I am bound to say that,&nbsp;from beginning to end, it was an uninterrupted and&nbsp;kaleidoscopic display of more or less humorous insanity...After the possessor of a voucher (himself necessarily travestied into some maniacal seeming) had&nbsp;passed the ordeal of examination by the Committee,&nbsp;stationed on the grand staircase, he was received with&nbsp;triumphal blasts, at the main entrance to the hall, by a "Mad Orchestra" consisting of ten bugles, eight side-drums, and one violin... A second&nbsp;later they "jumped to the eye," as the French idiom&nbsp;hath it, on a raised platform at the further end of the&nbsp;hall, pent up in an enormous built cage some twenty&nbsp;feet high, and constituting an orchestra, eighty in number, assiduously engaged in performing The Beautiful&nbsp;Blue Danube. The disguises were admirable, and had&nbsp;been allotted to the wearers in such sort as to intensify&nbsp;the general incongruity suggested by furred and feathered music-makers. For instance, the leading flautist&nbsp;was an elephant, whose aspect whilst diligently blowing&nbsp;his Querpfeife under his trunk was irresistibly comical.&nbsp;The triangle was being gravely tingled by a Royal&nbsp;Bengal tiger of alarmingly truculent mien ; a portly old&nbsp;lion, his tail comfortably adjusted across his knee, led&nbsp;the violoncelli ; a solemn pelican was tooting the French&nbsp;horn, its mouthpiece inserted in the side of his bill ; the&nbsp;drums were being administered to by a mild-eyed grey&nbsp;bullock of the true Banat breed ; side by side, amongst&nbsp;the first violins, were a bear, a colossal perch, and a frog&nbsp;of prediluvian dimensions ; the two bassoons were deftly&nbsp;handled by a mammoth spider and a shiny sturgeon,&nbsp;whilst a giant prairie tortoise clashed the cymbals as&nbsp;though that were the exclusive function to fulfil which was his inborn mission in life. The leader, a famous German chef d'orchestre &mdash; appeared as a gorilla of unexampled hideousness, quite the most appalling creature&nbsp;my eyes had ever thitherto beheld; and he conducted&nbsp;with a mimic knotted club formidably suggestive of&nbsp;"homicide with intention.'' The whole tableau was&nbsp;irresistibly provocative of convulsive and inextinguishable laughter. Moreover, facing this zoological band, at&nbsp;the opposite end of the hall was installed another "full"&nbsp;orchestra, consisting of life-size puppets set in motion&nbsp;by machinery, and occupying the lid of a Brobding-nagian musical box, the inside of which was tenanted&nbsp;by a real live military band in full play, so that its&nbsp;strains, produced by an unseen agency, seemed to proceed from the dolls, whose conductor, a singularly limber&nbsp;automaton, rivalled his dos-a-dos, the gorilla, in wildly&nbsp;energetic action. Taken in connection with the practice of the divine art, the orchestral menagerie was the&nbsp;funniest sight a musician could hope to look upon in&nbsp;the flesh. Of the puppet band one wearied readily; not&nbsp;so of the harmonious wild beasts, whose infinite variety''&nbsp;custom " could not stale."&nbsp;</p>
