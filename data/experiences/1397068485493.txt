At this time Hull was the most unmusical place I ever visited.

I attended a concert given by Mons. Aldy, the celebrated violinist. Scarcely more than half-a-dozen persons were present, and so few professors resided in the place, that a violoncello performer could not be found to accompany him: this part was wretchedly performed by a man upon the bassoon. I introduced myself to him, and condoled with him in his piteous situation, and encouraged him to play his succeeding pieces by himself.
