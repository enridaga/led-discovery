Yes, more and more of the modern guys began to come onto The Street [52nd St., New York]. Around 1947, J.J. Johnson had a group and Bud Powell had started. Al Haig had come in with Bird [Charlie Parker] and Dizzy [Gillespie]. That was in 1945. It was a fabulous thing--Bird and Diz both blowing together and blowing great. Dizzy finally got a big band together--with Kenny Clarke on drums--and that hit The Street toward the tail-end of The Street's importance in the jazz scene.
