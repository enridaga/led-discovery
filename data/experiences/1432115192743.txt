When the famous Peter Ilitsch came to conduct his Fourth Symphony in '93 he seemed already a spent man, nor did he live very long after his visit; the weak voice, intense nervousness, and exhaustion after rehearsal, plainly indicated failing health. His unaffected modesty, kindly manner and real gratitude for any trifling service rendered, all contributed to the favourable impression made by a lovable man. Truth to tell, Tchaikowsky possessed no gifts as a conductor, and knew it; nevertheless, thanks to the assistance of an attentive and sympathetic orchestra, No. IV scored a complete success.
