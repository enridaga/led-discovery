A bright lovely Spring day.

I went down the green lane between the orchards and through a gate which brought me under the gable of a small farmhouse.... In the door stood a tall fair comely girl with a clear fresh open face, kind grey eyes, and golden brown hair, Annie Abberley.... As we stood at the door talking a voice floated up from the Lower Cwm through the evening air singing the Canadian Boat Song.
