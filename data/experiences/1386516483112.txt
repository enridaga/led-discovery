It was early in the morning, before daylight, that we paraded for the execution, and formed three sides of a square, the open side being left for the balls to pass through when the soldiers fired…After the first dawn I could see the party stand with the prisoner, when they were ordered to proceed in the following manner: first the provost with his arms reversed; then the band and drummers, playing the ‘Dead March’, the drums being muffled with black; next the firing party, with arms reversed; then the coffin, borne by four men; next to this the prisoner, in company of the minister praying, and his comrade on the left of him, flanked by a man on either side with swords, the escort following. They started from the left; the band played the dismal and solemn march, which made my blood run cold. As he passed his own regiment he bade his officers and the men farewell, and told them he hoped it would be a warning to all to keep from drink…he began to weep…Poor man! I thought my heart would melt in me…Several men being unable to stand it, they had fallen to the rear….the man knelt upon his coffin…the minister read the funeral service…and…putting up his hand as a signal that all was finished, the report of the muskets was heard as they poured out a volume of smoke, and the man fell dead.
