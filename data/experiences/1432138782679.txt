<p>On the 22nd of August we began our engagement, with Lionel and Clarissa. Tate was the Colonel Oldboy, and Mr. Betterton (Mrs. Glover's father), Jessamy: being the race week, York was crowded with company, and the theatre always full. This was the first place at which I saw Miss Farren, who was then on a visit to Sir William and Lady Milner. My worthy friend, that excellent actor, Fawcett, then belonged to the York theatre, and was the Douglas of the company.</p>
