One scene I witnessed characterises another side of his behaviour at that time. The programme of one of his concerts given in the ' Salle du Conservatoire ' contained the ' Kreutzer ' sonata to be played by Liszt and Massart, a celebrated and much esteemed violinist, professor at the Conservatoire. Massart was just commencing the first bar of the introduction when a voice from the audience called out ' Robert le Diable ! ' At that time Liszt had composed a very brilliant fantasia on themes from that opera, and played it always with immense success. The call was taken up by other voices, and in a 
moment the cries 'Robert le Diable !' 'Robert le Diable!' drowned the tones of the violin. Liszt rose, bowed, and said: ' Je suis toujours l'humble serviteur du public, mais est-ce qu'on desire la fantaisie avant ou apres la sonate?' Renewed cries of 'Robert, Robert!' were the answer, upon which Liszt turned half round to poor Massart and dismissed him with a wave of the hand, without a syllable of excuse or regret. He did play the fantasia magnificently, rousing the public to a frenzy of enthusiasm, then called Massart out of his retreat, and we had the ' Kreutzer,' which somehow no longer seemed in its right place.
