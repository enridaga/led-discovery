<p>Jelly [Roll Morton] was one of the best in 1902 and, after that, noted more so than Tony Jackson and Albert Cahill because he played the music the whores liked. Tony was dicty. But Jelly would sit there and play that barrelhouse music all night--blues and such as that. I <em>know</em>&nbsp;because I played with him in Hattie Rogers sporting house in 1903. She had a whole lot of light-coloured women in there, best looking women you ever want to see. Well, I was playing with Franky Duson's Eagle Band on period Street and sometimes after I'd knock off at four in the morning, Jelly would ask me to come and play with him--he'd play and sing the blues till way up in the day.</p>
