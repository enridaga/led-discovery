<p>Listen to Concergebouw orch. from Hilversum, evening - simply perfect orchestra under Bruno Walter - I am not a worshipper of Walter - many things he does I don't like. But as an interpretation of Walter's ideas it was a consummate show. Mozart's superb G. min (surely the loveliest bit of music ever conceived) &amp; Mahler's 5th Symphony - Enormously long but I was interested &amp; thrilled for the full 1 hr &amp; 10 mins.*</p>
