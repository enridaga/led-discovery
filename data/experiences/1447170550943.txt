<p>In 1952, my sister Catherine and I, members of Parti Glannan'r Glaslyn , Cerdd chant group, sang in the Festival Hall, this huge new concert hall.&nbsp; I know that I felt dwarfed on the stage before the huge auditorium, but I also felt the beauty of the Hall, and how warm all woodwork felt, in spite of the fact that we all sang on a prayer because we couldn't hear each other sing! We had especially made Welsh costumes, lace caps, not hats, on our heads. And we were very proud to be invited to this new Hall. Such a marvellous memory!</p>
