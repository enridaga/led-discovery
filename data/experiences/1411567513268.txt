<p>One of the first concerts I went to with my wife was Klaus Tennstedt and the LPO when they played Mahler's 2nd Symphony. From the first note it was a rivetting performance and quite simply the best concert I have ever been to. This established the Festival Hall as a regular venue for us and we are really looking forward to the re-opening.</p>
