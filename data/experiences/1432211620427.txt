 How well I remember the hymn Mr. Sankey sang as a solo at the closing moment of that meeting, as his voice rang out :

To-day the Saviour calls ; for refuge fly ;
 The storm of justice falls, and death is nigh.

It seemed almost prophetic. It was the last verse sung in that beautiful hall. We closed the meeting and went out into the streets, never to meet again.
