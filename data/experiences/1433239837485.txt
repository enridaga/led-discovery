On the Sunday afternoon following the wedding, it was known that a portion of the music used at this ceremonial was to be performed, and an immense congregation filled the choir and nave of St. George's Chapel, the majority having to stand throughout the service. A small band, led by Mr. Gunness, was in the organ-loft, and the trumpeter was Mr. T. Harper. T.R.H. Prince and Princess Christian were present at the service, which was brought to a close with Sir George Elvey's "magnificent" Festal March.
