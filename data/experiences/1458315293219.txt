<p>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">I feel I must mention one other thing- lack of respect for our work. Once I was listening to the radio, and it was nice to hear them broadcast one of my works. But suddenly, before it was finished, they interrupted it and began some sports programme. That was horrible- and not just because it was my work: the same thing happens with other composers. It is really so difficult to calculate the time precisely, and, should a work not fit into the time available, replace it by something else? / This kind of attitude to music ruins people&rsquo;s tastes and is detrimental to the important task of aesthetic education. In my view, a great deal of restructuring is required in our musical programmes on radio and on TV, which has enormous potential. </span></span></p>
