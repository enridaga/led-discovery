<p>One of my proudest evenings, and this is a true anorak's confession, was in Stockholm. I was doing a last minute rewrite on a thriller [...] One of the Swedish producers invited me round to his house for supper.&nbsp; Knowing of my passion he had lined up some music to eat and drink by, this being Scandinavia - and the implied challenge was to name the musicians.&nbsp; They were, naturally, the local heroes: Lars Gullin, Arne Domn&eacute;rus, Bengt Hallberg. I scored a hundred per cent.&nbsp; At any rate that's the way I remember it, to the extent that I remember anything at all about the evening.</p>
