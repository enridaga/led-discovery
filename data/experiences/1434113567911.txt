Go to Albert Hall Concert 3.0 L.S.O. Beecham. Smetena's sparkling Bart. Bride ov. Mozart 32. C maj, delightful, Symphony, Edna Iles in Beethoven's Fine 3rd Concerto - Delius Marvellously beaut. but Wagnerian Walk to Paradise Garden (Vill. Rom & Juliet) - & Bizet's Charming 1st L'Arlesienne Suite. Orch. probably very good (also Edna Iles) but Echo was more than usually vile where I was sitting (Stalls - ticket given by Lauricella). Thomas Beecham v. good tho' too spectacular - we want a screen!
