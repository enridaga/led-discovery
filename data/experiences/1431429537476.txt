<p>Among my recent aesthetic experiences I must single out a record Irina has bought of gypsy songs fabulously sung by Volshaninova with a gypsy choir. The songs are wonderfully beautiful, although very sad. Listening to them makes the tears flow and engenders a keen desire to imbibe strong drink with 'zakusky'.</p>
