<p class="MsoNormal">The Don Jose of Jean de Reszke has been variously criticized. I hold the opinion, however, not <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>only that it was, and still is, a superb embodiment, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>but that it did a great deal to restore to the character the musical and histrionic value which it had <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>gradually been losing in inverse ratio to the ever-growing prominence of the central figure of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>opera. For this reason I quote some lines that I <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>penned anent M. de Reszke's impersonation at the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>time: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">He showed us that it was as easy for one great artist <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to revive the importance and enhance the interest of a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>good role as for twenty mediocrities to drag it down to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the level of their own talent. It goes without saying <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that the Polish tenor copied nobody's Don Jose in particular. He knew the traditions of the character, just <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>as he learned those of Sir Walter von Stolzing by visiting Bayreuth. He read his Merimee and carefully studied <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>his libretto; but like an artist of individuality and resource, he also thought the part out for himself. The <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>result, curiously enough, was a conception more closely <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>resembling Campanini's than any we have seen since. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It was free from the melodramatic exaggeration into <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>which other tenors had fallen. Take, as an instance, the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>last act. M. de Reszke did not make himself up like a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>starved ghost, neither did he rush about like a savage <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>animal in a cage. He looked the picture of despair, and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>he made his piteous appeal to Carmen with the tone of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a man who is yearning for love, not for an excuse to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>commit murder. When at last driven to extremities, he did not gloat over his revenge nor chase his victim from <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>corner to corner as a cat might chase a mouse. He simply stood at the entrance to the bull-ring, and when <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Carmen made her attempt to escape, he seized his dagger as by a sudden impulse and stabbed her as she was <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>endeavoring to pass him. An instant later he was leaning over her lifeless body in tears, horror-stricken at the deed he had committed. This surely was the true reading of the episode. Nor was it the only scene upon which <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>M. Jean de Reszke, with rare artistic insight, contrived <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to throw a new and consistent light. He depicted with <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>wonderful subtlety and skill the gradual stages by which <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Don Jose is drawn under Carmen's fascinating influence. Fierce and absorbing passion revealed itself in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>his facial expression, his gestures, and, above all, the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>thrilling tones of his voice. Never before has the beautiful passage where Jose brings forth the flower that Carmen gave him and tells her how it cheered his lonely <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>prison hours, been invested with such charm of voice and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>such tenderness and warmth of delivery.</span></p>
