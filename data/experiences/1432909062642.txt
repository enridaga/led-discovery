The most important public occasion I ever sang at was the Recreation Silver Band Concert on Thursday, the 12th March, 1908, at the King's Head Assembly Room, and I felt and still feel proud of the most intent and appreciative reception given me by that densely crowded room of people, the largest audience I ever sang to. In 1892-3 I lent my list of songs to Miss Lucy E. Broadwood (later Hon. Secretary and Editor to the Folk Song Society), and sang to her a large number of them, which she noted. Miss Broadwood left her old home, "Lyne," near Horsham, in 1893, and some eleven years later suggested to Dr. Vaughan Williams, a country neighbour, that he should come to see me. I sang to him such songs as he asked for, all of which he took down; some of them he recorded by his phonograph. This was the first time I had seen or heard one of these marvellous machines, and I was amazed beyond expression to hear my own songs thus repeated in my own voice.
