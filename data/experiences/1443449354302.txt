<p>In the afternoon I sorted drawers, &amp; mended my Newton Abbot shirt to go to Italy.&nbsp; And listened to Messaien's Catalogue des Oiseaux.&nbsp; The first time I had liked him.&nbsp; He has worked out a genuine piano resonance for the bird songs that are so nearly cries; a very fine Oriol in an oak tree; its sharp bitter-sweet summer voice. A passage of choral curlews that nearly undid me &amp; perhaps most impressive of all, an Alpine chough flying alone up a snowy pass. The birds are realist-formulae; the back-grounds are landscapes - very much as in old bird pictures, the landscape suitable, picturesque, &amp; entirely detached &amp; background. This indeed I enjoyed.</p>
