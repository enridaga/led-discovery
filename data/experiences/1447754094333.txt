<p><em></em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 9.1px;">At the age of 6 yrs (1956) I was taken by my mother to see my first ballet - Swan Lake - I was smitten and continued with my ballet lessons for 16 yrs with annual visits to the ballet performances at the RFH. In the 1970s I was training at Great Ormond St Hospital and subsequently worked there for 30yrs!! When days were difficult/emotional I would walk down to the South Bank and take refuge in the RFH enjoying concerts food and the general atmosphere to recharge my batteries - Thank you.</span></p>
