Mrs and Miss Thrale, Miss Owen and Mr Seward came long before Lexophanes [Samuel Johnson] . . . 

The Conversation was supported with a good deal of vivacity - (N.B. my Father being at Home) for about half an Hour, and then Hetty, and Suzette, for the first Time in public, played a Duet, and, in the midst of this performance, Dr Johnson was announced.  . . . 

He is shockingly near sighted, and did not, till she held out her Hand to him, even know Mrs Thrale.  He poked his nose over the keys of the Harpsichord, till  the Duet was finished, and then, my Father introduced Hetty to him, as an old acquaintance, and he cordially kissed her.  . . . 

My sister then played another Duet, with my Father: but Dr Johnson was so deep in the Encyclopedie, that, as he is very deaf, I question if he even knew what was going forward.  When this was over, Mrs Thrale, in a laughing manner, sai, ‘Pray, Dr Burney, can you tell me what that song was, and whose, which Savoi sung last night at [J. C.] Bach’s concert, and which you did not hear?'  My Father confessed himself by no means so good a Diviner, not having had Time to consult the stars, though in the House of Sir Isaac Newton.  However, wishing to draw Dr Johnson into some Conversation, he told him the question.  The Doctor, seeing his drift, good naturedly put away his Book, and said very drolly ‘And pray, Sir - Who is Bach? – is he a Piper?' – Many exclamations of surprise, you will believe, followed this Question.  'Why you have Read his name often in the papers, said Mrs Thrale; and then she gave him some account of his Concert, and the number of fine performances she had heard at it.  

‘Pray,’ said he gravely, ‘Madam, what is the Expence?’ 

‘O,’ answered she, ‘much trouble and solicitation to get a subscriber’s Ticket; - or else half a Guinea.’ 

‘Trouble and solicitation,’ said he, ‘I will have nothing to do with; - but I would be willing to give Eighteen Pence.’
