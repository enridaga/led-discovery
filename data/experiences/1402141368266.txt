The concert, an informal one made up of Bartók's Rumaninan Dances, Bridge Miniatures, a song by David, and Fauré's 'Après Un Rêve', the Kodály Intermezzo, a Bach Suite, Mozart Kontretänze and Stockhausen's Tierkreis, produces rather the same effect as we produced in Cheltenham last year; the audience claps and shouts for an encore.
