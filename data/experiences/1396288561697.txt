Six of us went to a concert in the town this evening, given by the 12th Division, and enjoyed it very much. An officer and one man came in from the trenches to sing, then went back. Some of the men were music-hall professionals in peacetime.... The hall was packed with officers and men and there were 12 of us sisters - so luckily only one song was at all risky.
