G. made it convenient to come in tonight for about two hours. He brought some more music for me to practise, he keeps me going with new songs. He let me fall over singing, asked me to sing again, I said I could not. He heard Elly and me singing on that Saturday night, he knew I was helping her, because he said Elly had not two voices.
