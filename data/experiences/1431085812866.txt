<p><em>Are there other pianists you listen to? Evidently you've heard Keith and Chick. </em></p>
<p>Well, I spend a lot of time listening to recordings, like Herbie Hancock's.</p>
<p><em>Hancock of the sixties?</em></p>
<p>All of Herbie Hancock. I have a feeling about Herbie. Although he's into another sphere right now, when you talk about soloists among the current pianists, he's the guy I'd vote for as the best among the current pianists. That is, he <em>could</em> play the best solo piano. I think he has the most equipment and the most creative incentive.&nbsp;</p>
