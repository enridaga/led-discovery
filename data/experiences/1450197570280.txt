He had Bottesini, the Paganini of the contrabass, and Koenig, the great cornetist of the day, who could play with wonderful expression, his rendition of the <em>Prima Donna Waltz</em> being really an artistic marvel. Then there was the oboist, Lavigne, playing with exquisite tone and fine technique, who could hold a tone (it was said) all the evening by breathing through his nostrils while playing. Then there was the necromantic flautist, Reichardt, the very fine clarinetist, Wuille, and an ophicleide- player, Mr. Hughes, who drew out of his instrument a wonderfully soft, large, and mellow tone, and played with great execution. Among the first violins were the brothers Mollenhauer, who were famous as players of duets, and who finally settled in this country. In fact so large an array of virtuosi has not visited the United States since Jullien&rsquo;s day</span></p>
