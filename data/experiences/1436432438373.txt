Lady Folkestone once arranged a performance 
of Romberg's Toy Symphony, and invited all the 
best-known musicians of the day to take part. 
It was given at a charity concert on May 14th, 
1880. We all chose instruments we had not 
played before. Charles Santley played the violin 
and I the viola. Benedict took the bells, and 
Arthur Sullivan amused us all with his imitation 
of the cuckoo. Henry Leslie wielded the baton 
with great skill.
