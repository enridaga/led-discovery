<p style="text-align: left;">Spring 1977 Khatchaturian conducting London Symphony Orchestra . I arrived the hall to find an Isreali peace demonstration- packed house- people approachin and askign to buy tickets. My new girlfriend did not arrive&nbsp; so I sold the ticket! 20 minutes into the perfromance she arrived!! managing to get into the hall. There were a coupke of seats empty near to my seat so we sat in them. I sat there hoping noone would show and she would find out i had sold the ticket. However, the real memory is&nbsp; the stellar perfromance of the London Symponey Orchestra and the wonderful melodies of the&nbsp; eadagio from Spartacus.</p>
