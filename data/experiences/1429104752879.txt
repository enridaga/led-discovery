<p>Many famous performers, both colored and white, who'd heard about the reputation I'd won in Harlem came to see me in Atlantic City. Bert Williams, the Negro star of Ziegfeld Follies, came three times because friends had told him I was a girl singer with his droll quality.

Miss Tucker paid me a little money to come to her hotel suite and sing there for her privately. She explained that she wanted to study my style of delivery.</p>
