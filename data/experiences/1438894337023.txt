<pre>Among the great prime donne who sang in Norwich during the "sixties" and <br />"seventies," none was more deservedly popular than Theresa Tietjens. Those of <br />my American readers who saw her when she appeared with Mr. Mapleson's troupe at 
the Academy of Music, New York, in 1876, cannot fail to have a vivid <br />recollection of her genius both as a singer and an actress. Then, however, she <br />was just approaching the tragical climax of her brilliant career. When I first <br />heard her, at one of the general rehearsals for the festival of 1866 (some eight <br />years after her d&eacute;but in England), her voice was not only fresh, powerful, and <br />penetrating, but it possessed in a greater degree than then that sympathetic <br />charm that curiously dramatic "human" quality which was perhaps its most <br />notable attribute. Her style was marked by the same rare individuality. Her <br />phrasing offered a curious blending of vigor and grace; and she had a trick of <br />employing the portamento when approaching a high note, which in any other singer <br />might have been thought almost ugly, but in Tietjens seemed both natural and <br />artistic. At the same time, her attack was superb. Never have I heard the <br />opening phrase of the "Inflammatus" in Rossini's "Stabat Mater" delivered with <br />such magnificent energy and such absolute purity of tone. To hear Tietjens in <br />those days sing "Let the bright Seraphim" (especially to the trumpet obbligato <br />of Tom Harper) was a treat never to be forgotten. </pre>
