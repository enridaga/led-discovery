We celebrated the seventieth anniversary of the R.A.M.'s foundation in a worthy fashion at a concert of which the programme consisted entirely of works by past students: Bennett, the two Macfarrens, Sullivan, Barnby, Goring Thomas, Maude V. White, Edward German and Corder. Not a few other names might have been included had time permitted.
