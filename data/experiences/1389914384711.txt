The great Wagner gave the first of a series of concerts in the Albert Hall. Bertha [Collier] & I went (price 15/-). I was much interested to see the old boy, the idol of so many hearts including Mr. Dannreuther’s [a well-known music master of the period]. He is about 60—short with a hooked nose, & thick short grey hair. He conducted—the cheered him immensely. The Modern School feel for him as their ancestors felt for Beethoven, a dangerous innovator & a surpassing genius. They played parts of Rienzi, Tannhäuser, & the Rhine Gold—this last I am free to confess was beyond me.
