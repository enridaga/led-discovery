<p>I recently heard excellent performances of my Violin Concerto by the young violinists M. Vaiman and Julian Sitkovetsky. / I think very highly of our Soviet performers, among whom there is a great deal of first-rate talent. I appreciate them not only as a listener, but also as a kind of &lsquo;client&rsquo;, who has the satisfaction of hearing his own music played well.</p>
