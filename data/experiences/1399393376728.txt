Dear Mr Salonen
I was present at the performance of Mahler's Resurrection Symphony at the Anvil, Basingstoke, on June 22.  I simply wanted to thank you, and the orchestra and soloists and choir, for such a magnificent performance it was hugely moving and powerful.
In all my life, and I have been attending concerts for many years, I have never seen the audience give a standing ovation such as we saw last night! It was truly well deserved and an evening to be remembered for all time.
