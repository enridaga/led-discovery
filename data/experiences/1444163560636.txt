<p>I have never known any " professional" gifted with so exhaustive a musical memory as&nbsp;that of Johann Herbeck...Whilst&nbsp;talking like this, in breaks, he would play through one&nbsp;motivo after another, exemplifying the methods of treatment, until he had more or less succinctly viscerated&nbsp;the entire work. Then, jerking his hair backwards and&nbsp;taking a pull at his cigar, he would continue, " What I&nbsp;consider to be a favourable specimen of Gurgebeisser's&nbsp;best manner is that Sonata of his, Opus 87, you know,&nbsp;for Tuba Mirabilis with harp accompaniments. Listen!"&nbsp;And off he would go into copious extracts from another&nbsp;long work, with which he probably possessed an unique&nbsp;acquaintance.&nbsp;</p>
