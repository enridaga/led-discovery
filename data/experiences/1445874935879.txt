<p>After dinner I had the Melancholy Office of attending Poor Ben Hunt to the Grave and reading the Service for him. They brought him to the Churchyard and sung before him for both his sons are among the Band of Singers at Church. They gave us a very Solemn, Pathetic Anthem and young Morle distinguished himself by a voice uncommonly soft and melodious. Ben had been a Singer too in his time but now he can sing no more among the Living.</p>
