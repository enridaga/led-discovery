<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Unfortunately, I had only one meeting with Benjamin Britten, whose opera <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Turn of the Screw </em>I heard performed by a London company in Edinburgh. Among the other touring companies, I would especially single out the Belgrade Opera, which put on Prokofiev&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Gambler</em>. I enjoyed this very much: this is the young Prokofiev, and music is very interesting, very fine&hellip; I think this work will be staged here too, sometime. </span></p>
