After losing our way in a labyrinth of corridors and antechambers we finally emerged in a large foyer in which we saw a small orchestra in uniformed jackets playing the Minuet by Bocherini. It sounded so nice, so inviting, that I could not resist following the music, with my arms around the cello, in a slow and graceful minuetto step. Bey [Emanuel Bey] joined me with equal elegance. It was not until I heard Bey’s voice that I felt alarmed. “For heaven’s sake,” he said, “stop dancing. Look behind you.” I saw the President, Mrs. Hoover, all the dignitaries and guests following us in a procession. We could not turn back. There were no exits and we had to enter the hall.
