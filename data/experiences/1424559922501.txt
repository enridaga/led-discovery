A few months later, I met Horszowski  in Italy. / He was brought to see me at the house of a friend after one of my concerts. I can vividly remember the occasion. He was very small- diminutive-and very shy, and he was dressed in a sailor suit with short trousers and a large white collar trimmed with lace. He looked about ten years old, though he tells me he was thirteen; and this must be right, because he is always extremely precise and meticulous. He played for me, and I was deeply impressed. I knew he had a great talent.
