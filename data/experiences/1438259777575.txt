The work had been much talked of since its revival, in revised form, at Bologna in 1875, and Mr. Mapleson took creditable pams to mount it in such fashion that there should be few looijholes for criticism. Truth to tell, it was an exceedingly good representation all round. Christine Nilsson's embodiment of the dual role of Margherita and Helen of Troy had much of poetry and charm; Trebelli was as fascinating and artistic as ever in the contralto parts; Campanini made an excellent Faust; and Nannetti lent rare sardonic color and alertness to the part of Mefistofele, Sir Michael Costa was still vigorous enough to conduct Boito's opera in his old resolute, vigilant manner; and very delighted he was over its success, which lent quite a special distinction to the season.</span></p>
