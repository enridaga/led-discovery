In consequence of this the parish was [obliged to]... look out for a new organist, on which occasion it was to be played for a few Sundays by such candidates as chose to enter the lists. This contest (so great was ever my attachment to musical sounds) engaged my attention as much as a general election, horse race or other trial of skill usually does politicians, gents of the turf etc. & I soon found out that the candidates were Mr Croom, an elderly professor of Greenwich, Mr Hudson (then or afterwards organist of Limehouse), a Mr Wheatley & Mr Relfe, organist of the Hospital Chapel. There were however in fact byt two candidates, as Croom & Relfe were to be in partnership, as were Hudson & Wheatly (sic). The first that play'd was Croom, who did not manifest any superior abilities either in point of style or execution; his voluntary before the first lesson both morning & afternoon being (as I well remember) simply a dry & stiff adagio upon the Diapasons, which stops he also confin'd himself to in giving out the psalms, without even using the Swell for the alternate lines, instead of which he made a little stop or pause at the end of each line. He however used the full organ with the voices & in his concluding voluntaries, which was all the variety he gave us. My wishes were therefore by no means in his favor, tho' Relfe was to be his partner, who having the chapel organ beside wo'd hardly ever I fear'd come himself to play at the church.
