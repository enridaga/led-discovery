<p style="text-align: justify;">I went to see the first appearance of my country- woman, Miss O'Neil, who made her entree at Covent Garden Theatre, on the 6th of October, 1814; and had the satisfaction of finding her received by the audience with the admiration and applause which she ever afterwards deservedly enjoyed until her retirement from the stage, on her marriage...In Dublin, she was not only a great favourite in tragedy, but also in many parts of genteel comedy. I have there seen her play "Letitia Hardy;" she danced very gracefully, and introduced my song, "In the rough blast heaves the billows," originally sung by Mrs. Jordan, at Drury Lane, which she sang so well, as to produce a general call for its repetition from the audience. She was, in private life, highly esteemed for her many amiable qualities. Her engagement in Dublin wafted Miss Walstein from Dublin, (where she had been for many years the heroine of Crow Street) to Drury Lane, where she made her appearance as Calista, in " The Fair Penitent," on the 13th of November, 1814, but only remained one season.</p>
