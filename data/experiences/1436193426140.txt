<p>My concert in 1874 was remarkable for the first appearance on any concert platform of the young Canadian soprano Mile Emma Albani. She sang the great scene and aria "Il dolce suono" from Lucia, and "O luce di quest'anima" from Linda di Chamounix, and received a great ovation. Another of the items on the programme was Gounod's "Ave Maria" on Bach's Prelude, sung by Mlle d'Angeri with violin obbligato by Signor Papini, piano by Sir Julius Benedict and harmonium by Signor Randegger a fine combination which pleased the audience greatly. Mr. Frederick Gye, director of Covent Garden, was present, as he was much interested in Mile Albani's platform debut and wanted to see how she got on at a London concert. His son Ernest afterwards became her husband.</p>
