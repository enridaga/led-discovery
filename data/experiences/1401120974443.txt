I will always remember the all-night dances which started after the evening concerts - it is a pity that they are no longer held - for they were great occasions.  I also remember a special Mahler concert with Bruno Walter and Fischer Dieskau (Songs of a Wayfaring Lad and Symphony No. 1) also Beecham Concerts - I still have programmes - and Otto Klemperer/Claudio Arrau (?) Beethoven Cycle in 1957 (I still have taped recordings).  I especially enjoyed Piano Concerto No.3 - the flute solo in the second movement - magic!
