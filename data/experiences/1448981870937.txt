<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">The song last noticed [&ldquo;O liberty&rdquo;] used to be sung by Mrs. Billington. I do not know whether it was composed for a &rsquo;soprano or a tenor voice: if the latter, it should have been allotted to a more forcible singer, for it was feebly performed. So were the three next pieces; a recitative by Vaughan; a trio, &ldquo;Disdainful of danger,&rdquo; sung in double choir by <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">six</em> men without one powerful or distinguished voice; three better gifted in that respect would have made more effect; and the duet and chorus, &ldquo; Oh! never, never bow me down,&rdquo; not ill sung by two of the fifteen. At last we were roused from all this insipidity by Braham in the song, &ldquo;Sound an alarm,&rdquo; a spirited air, which he gave with his usual energy. I shall make no further remarks on this part, except that the chorus, &ldquo;See the conquering hero comes,&rdquo; so familiar to every ear that every body can at least make an attempt to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">hum</em> it, was the worst performed of any throughout the festival. It was begun out of tune by the semi-chorus, and never got quite right.</p>
