Tho&rsquo; it was not a great festival, yet the band was better than ordinary, being the Day of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Pardons</em>. I wanted much to hear old <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Antonio Vandini</em> the famous violoncello, who they say plays and expresses <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a parlare</em> upon his instrument &ndash; and the famous oboe Matteo Bissiote, but neither had solo parts. However I&rsquo;ll give these 2 performers credit for great abilities, as they are highly extolled by their countrymen, who must by the frequent hearing of excellent performers of all kinds be good judges in spite of themselves. People accustomed to bad music, may be pleased with it, but those on the contrary, long used to good music and performances cannot.</span></p>
