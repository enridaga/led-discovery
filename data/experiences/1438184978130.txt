Frau Professor said this was impossible, that no young girl could go to a place like that by herself and she unfortunately could not take me [...] so I hit upon a plan which this capital old lady somewhat reluctantly fell in with. I hired grey corkscrew curls and a large pair of horn spectacles, borrowed her thickest veil and her gown, which, after I had swathed myself in newspapers tightly tied on with string, and added other contrivances, was a perfect fit. Having finally painted in appropriate wrinkles, I sallied forth to the Rosenthal, sat down with a piece of knitting (for show only) at a small table, and asked for beer and a "<em>Schinken Brodchen</em>" - that is a buttered roll with ham in the middle.</span></p>

[...] The Serenade, a charming piece of music by the by, and everything else I heard that night, enchanted me.<br /></span></p>
