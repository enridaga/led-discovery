<pre>Some time previous to my retirement from Drury Lane stage, I had made Madame <br />Catalani a promise to accompany her, for the second time, to Dublin. I set off <br />with them on the 1st of August, 1808; she was engaged by Mr. Jones, on similar <br />terms to those she received on her first engagement there; mine, too, were the <br />same. Signer Siboni and Signor Spagnoletti were also engaged. We had to perform <br />two grand serious operas, "La Mitridate," and "La Didone Abbandonata," in both <br />of which Madame Catalani exerted herself beyond her former efforts; but "La <br />Didone" was her triomphe, both as an actress and a singer. Siboni performed the <br />haughty larbas, the Moorish king; and I, the pious Eneas. After performing six <br />nights in Dublin, we proceeded to give six performances at Cork. The Cork <br />audience are passionately fond of music, and Catalani's reception was <br />enthusiastic; and I experienced the most hospitable reception from numerous <br />friends.
