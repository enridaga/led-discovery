<p>In the&nbsp;afternoon, the other guests having partly&nbsp;retired to their rooms, partly gone on excursions, Brahms played the accompaniments to&nbsp;some songs for me. Since our arrival this was&nbsp;the first time that he had touched the keyboard and that I had sung. I began with&nbsp;Brahms' "Mainacht," then came a Schubert&nbsp;song, and then Beethoven's cyclus " To the&nbsp;Absent Beloved." When we had ended we&nbsp;were surprised to find that all the adjoining&nbsp;rooms had filled with listeners. Mine host of&nbsp;the Fahrnberg was greatly touched, and thanked&nbsp;Brahms for the honour he had done to his&nbsp;house.&nbsp;</p>
