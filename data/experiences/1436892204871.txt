<pre>The great sums of money produced to the theatre by "Blue Beard," induced the <br />Drury Lane proprietors to prevail on Mr. Colman to write a musical afterpiece, <br />to vie with it in splendour. The piece was entitled, "Feudal Times ; or, The <br />Banquet Gallery." I composed the whole of the music for it. Although the scenery <br />was grand, and the piece well acted, it was not so successful as Blue Beard; 
although performed, in the course of the season, for many nights. It was brought <br />out in January 1799.
