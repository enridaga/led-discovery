There is [at the hospital] a television, a Spidola, a record player and a tape-recorder, and Irina brings me records. As I play them, I marvel at the extraordinary beauty of some works and the crassness of others. For sheer hideousness and tedium I would instance Franz Lisztâ€™s 'Via Crucis'- although, perhaps, I have not fully understood his work.
