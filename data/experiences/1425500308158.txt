The trio [The Pozniak Trio] had a busy schedule, but the concerts in bad halls and the repetitiousness of the programs were monotonous. One of our last performance was the Triple Concerto by Beethoven with an orchestra of amateurs. That such a tiny town had an orchestra was surprising in itself. Still more puzzling was the clean performance after a disastrous rehearsal. It made me believe in miracles, for what would be impossible for a soloist is sometimes possible en masse.
