<p>During the performance on the first day, many of the members of the societies wore their hats on the stage, directly in front of the audience, and some were seen standing gazing about not only with hats on, but with cigars in their mouths and actually smoking. This positively took place (we repeat it, for it will hardly be credited) during the public performance at the Dusseldorf festival.

Hats were worn on succeeding days, but the smoking disappeared.</p>
