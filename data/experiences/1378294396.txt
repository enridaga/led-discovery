The oratorio performances, in which [Johann Christian Bach] was engaged as one of the proprietors, in a great measure failed. He had composed for the occasion, and played between the acts, his second concerto. A modern piece was usual, but as it was to be heard on the organ, it was ill chosen, for, though beautiful in itself, it did not accord with the sacred performance, and Bach being no organ player the whole thing rather tended to detract from the success of the evening. About this time pianofortes were first introduced into this country. They had been in use for some little time in Germany, and were considered a very successful invention. Those instruments now known as `small pianofortes' were the first that made their appearance in England, and those of a square shape shortly followed, upright ones not being known till much later.
