 I have been at Baden since yesterday... I spent nearly the whole day yesterday with Berlioz; we went through the score of 'Armida,' and, from memory, the whole of 'Iphigenia,' and I learned many things that I was ignorant of and which he knows by tradition. He showed me effects that I should never have discovered by myself. I am therefore very pleased to have 
seen him.
