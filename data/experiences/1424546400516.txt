<p>We were most fortunate in our fellow-musicians who assisted at the service. The gentlemen of the Choir of St Pauls sang an unaccompanied anthem by Dr Ernest Walker, a setting of the words of Psalm 121: &lsquo;I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills&rsquo;- one of the finest quartet ensembles of voices we had ever heard. / Sir William McKie, the organist of Westminster Abbey, most kindly played the organ for us. During the signing of the register he performed, magnificently, Bach&rsquo;s Prelude and Fugue in B minor. This was followed by three duets for cello and viola which Lillian and I played. The first was the beautiful Psalm 23 &lsquo;Crimond&rsquo;, the second an &lsquo;Elizabethan Melody&rsquo; of John Dowland, and we ended with an anonymous fifteenth-century folk song with organ accompaniment. It was a unique procedure for bride and bridegroom to play in church at their own wedding, but one which we devoutly felt was an expression of our Thanksgiving to the Almighty.</p>
