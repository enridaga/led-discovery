<p>We travelled together, and arrived at Kings in time for tea. [...] Even though there was no excuse of dusk they were lighting the candles in chapel.&nbsp; The choir sang a capella a sixpart anthem of Teague's - <em>Let the peace of God</em>, the Farrant Mag and N.D. and Tallis Salvator mundi.&nbsp; They did this exquisitely, very poised above a very regular beat.&nbsp; Where a later composer less in the vocal tradition would have augmented the effect of a high note by going one higher in the next sentence, Tallis repeats the same note, knowing the augmentation will be put in by the increase of tone in the voices. Teague's piece is thirty five years old; in spite of that date, it might have been 305, for it is extremely serene and severe.&nbsp; The other thing I shall remember is the singing of the water of Babylon psalm: a dead pianissimo, wasted with misery; the dying away into the cursing verses really dramatic.&nbsp;</p>
