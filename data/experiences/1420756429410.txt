Return en masse to the White House State Dining Room where Marian Anderson tonelessly introduced Roberta Peters and praised American music (making no mention of me, or of any composer) and the Louisville Orchestra then played my Eleven Studies (cut version). On my right sat the president of the Indianapolis Symphony who talked to me all during the music; to his right, the First Lady in meditation; on my left, Catherine Drinker Bowen scribbling notes on how divine my piece sounded; on her left, George Kennan. And me, heart pounding, because the presumable cream of U.S. culture was obliged to presumable silence for twenty minutes by my presumable music... Concert over. Kennan leaned across to Mrs. Bowen to congratulate me, receptivity well marked upon his sad features.
