<pre>On account of the length of the operas and ballets, and never being able to get <br />the lady-singers ready to begin in time, the operas seldom finished till after <br />twelve o'clock on Saturdays. The Bishop of London sent to inform me, that if the 
curtain did not drop before the twelfth hour, the licence should be taken away, <br />and the house shut up. Against his fiat there was no appeal, and many nights have<br />I been obliged to order the dropping of the curtain in the midst of an <br />interesting scene in the ballet. </pre>
