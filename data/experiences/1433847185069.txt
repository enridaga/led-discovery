Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: 27th January, 1828 - 
I was glad this morning when the great crowd which filled Trinity church had left it to me, with fifteen communicants, and about as many more devout non-participators. The solemnity began with the chorale, ' Christ, Thou Lamb of God ;' then followed an address, according to the Liturgy of the Reformed Church, and all knelt during a prayer of self-offering, which in matter differs not from ours. During the words of consecration, the choir sung three passages- not the 'Holy, Holy,' &c., but something similar; and during the Communion chorales were sung. I had a great longing after the Lord's table ; but it was not clear to me that one could rightfully disregard the accustomed order of
preparation, and I participated only in spirit.
