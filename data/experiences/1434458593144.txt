<p>Letter from Mrs. Pendarves to Mrs. Ann Granville.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">13th Feb. 1738-9.</p>
<p>I was at the oratorio last Saturday with Lady Dysart, and (<em>oh wonderful</em>) Lord Carteret: he met with two patriot ladies that took up his attention more than the music, but it was triumph enough to <em>get him there</em>, and what will more increase your wonder, <em>he treated</em> his ladies with their tickets!</p>
