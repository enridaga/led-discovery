The first piece I met was the Tchaikovsky Path√©tique Symphony, with some of the loveliest legato clarinet writing in it. I couldn't play it --- I knew how to but the stupid old clarinet would not let me. Not legato, and not in tune. There was no help for me - it was back onto second clarinet for me...  A way out had to be found; and, incredibly, it was very simple, taking only one week to accomplish once I had decided I had to make the second and biggest change of instruments of my life.
