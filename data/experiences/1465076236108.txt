<p>Today Koussevitzky was also rehearsing Scriabin's Third Symphony. I cannot understand why in Paris today, urged on by Stravinsky and Diaghilev, Scriabin is so disregarded that any interest in him is considered as in poor taste. Granted Scriabin is often incoherent, granted his predeliction for programme music and philosophising often lends his works an alien quality, nevertheless I still consider that wholesale rejection of him is equally a purely fashionable response. Scriabin possesses a wonderful melodic gift and great flair for counterpoint, a raft of beautiful harmonies (but not when he becomes a slave to his own harmonic invention); put all of this together and he is a great composer deserving of greater respect than Stravinsky pays him. Today it was with extreme pleasure that I heard the&nbsp;<em>Divine Poem</em>.</p>
