Go with me to the Nicolai Church in Leipzig, and look down from the upper gallery upon a congregation of fifteen hundred or two thousand persons; see them with hymn books open, apparently unconscious of those around, listen to their rough and uncultivated voices, in time and tune, or out of time and tune, joining with the loud pealings of the deep diapasons, rolling through the arches of the great building, and filling the whole with a mighty chorus of sound; mark the movings of your own spirit, and you will not need an answer to the question from another.</p>
