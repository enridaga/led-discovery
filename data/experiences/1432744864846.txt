At the school we gave some important concerts, where for the first time in my life I had the opportunity of conducting an orchestra. We did "Elijah" and the "Hymn of Praise " more than once ; in connection with "Elijah" it may be
interesting to note that the part of the Prophet at one of the performances which I conducted was sung by no less a person than Hubert Parry, then at Eton. Our bass failed us at the last moment, and Hubert Parry kindly undertook to sing the part. The thing I remember most about the performance was the extraordinary speed at which he sang "Is not His word like a fire." Fortunately we had a good band, and although the conductor was, naturally, inexperienced, the players pulled him through very well.
