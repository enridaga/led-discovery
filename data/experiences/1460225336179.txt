<p>The concerts are over. I heard the last Lamoureux Concert &amp; must confess that as far as ensemble &amp; finesse are concerned the orchestra is far superior to Leipzig. I heard Parsifal Prelude, Tannh&auml;user Overture, Lohengrin Prelude to 1st Act, Women's March &amp; Prelude to 3rd Act, Dance Macabre Saint Saens, L'Arlesienne, Bizet &amp; something from Bizet's opera The Pearl Fishers, quite excellent.&nbsp;</p>
