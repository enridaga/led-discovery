Those thin, well shaped fingers are best suited for legato playing; they glide along imperceptibly from one key to the other, and whenever possible, avoid octave as well as staccato passages. Cramer sings on the piano in such a manner that he almost transforms a Mozart andante into a vocal piece, but I must resent the liberty he takes in introducing his own and frequently trivial embellishments. [...] His newly composed Sonata in D minor gives me great delight, and our friendly relationship is all the warmer from the sincere admiration I bestow on that work.
