Easter Sunday, 26 March, 1826.... On Wednesday in Passion Week Neukomm returned home with us from the Sixtine Chapel, and played to us in a manner that could give delight even after the Miserere. To give an idea of his playing, I must describe the course of my own feelings, - I was at first sorry for the arrangement to bring him home with us, not wishing to be disturbed, and only reconciled to it on the ground of giving pleasure to M. d'Olfers, who had known and valued Neukomm for years as a man as well as a musician; but from the moment he began to play, I was thankful to have the state of feeling protracted, which had originated in the Miserere. He played airs with variations of his own composition (amongst others 'See the Conquering Hero comes'), and afterwards gave an idea, as far as one pair of hands and a very feeble voice could give an idea, of passages in an oratorio which he has this winter composed, but has never yet been executed. The words are selected from Klopstock's Messiah, and the chorus he played to us is grounded on the passage in Isaiah, 'Who is He....that is glorious in His apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? - I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save!' - the whole to be performed by a choir in two divisions, answering each other in the manner of Handel's 'Who is the King of Glory? - The Lord of Hosts, He is the King of Glory!'
