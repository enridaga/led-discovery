<p>Listen to last Brit. Music Concts inc. J. Irelands new Legend for Pft (Helen Perkin - inadequate) &amp; Orch.* Seemed unsatisfactory &amp; meandering - &amp; rather reminiscent - tho' some nice things in it. Moeran's 2nd conventional folksongy Rhapsody** &amp; Belshazzer's feast of Walton. V. exhilerating in parts - but he looses too many opportunities &amp; workmanship is often too bad. I'm afraid there isn't quite enough left when the glitter &amp; icing is taken away.</p>
