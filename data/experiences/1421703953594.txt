<p>Evening with JH, to two-piano recital of Yvonne Loriod and Messiaen at Hunter College. An almost empty house. (How well Messiaen holds up, yet how unfashionable he's become with his honest bigger-than-life schmaltz and first-rate tunes!) Backstage to kiss Yvonne, no longer the slim genius I remember from Morocco in 1950, but the husbandly mate of the Great Man (greater by no less extraordinary than Yvonne herself) to whom she introduces us, and I'm intimidated for the first time in years.</p>
