<p>I was glad we went to the service on Thursday.&nbsp; It was a very hot summers day. And all very simple &amp; dignified.&nbsp; Music. Not a word spoken. We sat there, before the open doors that lead into the garden.&nbsp; Flowers &amp; strollers which Roger would have liked.&nbsp; He lay under an old brocade with two bunches of very bright many coloured flowers.&nbsp; It is a strong instinct to be with ones friends.&nbsp; I thought of him too, at intervals.&nbsp; Dignified &amp; honest &amp; large - "large sweet soul" - something ripe &amp; musical about him - &amp; then the fun &amp; the fact that he lived with such variety &amp; generosity &amp; curiosity...They played Bach.&nbsp; Then then coffin moved slowly through the doors. They shut.&nbsp; They played again - Anon, I think: old music.&nbsp; Yes I liked the wordlessness.</p>
