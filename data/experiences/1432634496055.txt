<p>I was living permanently in Jackson by 1956, rooming with a friend of mine, Johnny Temple. Johnny had lived in Chicago for about twenty-three years, where he was a big figure in the music field as a guitar player. He did a couple of recordings called "Big Boat Whistle" and "New Vicksburg Blues" for the Decca record people. His career extended on blues, and he played a lot of orchestration-type stuff, the big band arrangements. He'd strum chords with that, but he actually played a lot of lead guitar with his blues. He wasn't a big influence on me; I just loved working with him, and I liked the sound of his voice when he'd be singing. I never did any recordings with him, but I did do some gigs with him while he and I were with King Mose and the Royal Rockers.</p>
