<p>The Beaux Arts Trio, for whom&nbsp;<em>Spring Music</em>&nbsp;was written as a gift from Carnegie Hall, have had the music for close to a year without giving a sign of its receipt, much less of whether they like it. Since the premiere is tomorrow, I swallowed my pride last week and phoned the Trio. It hadn't occured to them that the composer might want to hear it. Rehearsal yesterday.</p>
<p><em>Spring Music</em>&nbsp;lasts 31 1/2 minutes - seven minutes longer than I'd projected - and I'm glad: Its imminent public failure will carry more weight.&nbsp;</p>
