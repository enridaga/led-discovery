How could I not be discouraged about librettos, at least for a while, after last month's ignominious failure of The Robbers? The production was an outrage, with the three actors looking less Chaucerian than like Jesse James, Leslie Howard and Harpo Marx. To add insult to injury, it was co-billed with Rieti's The Pet Shop (renamed "Amelia Goes to the Dogs" by Elliott Stein) which received all the praise from les petits amis. The damage of "charm" again, but for once I am not the sinner.
