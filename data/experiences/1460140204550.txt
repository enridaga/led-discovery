<p>At five o'clock I took part in a concert at the offices of the <em>Vossische Zeitung </em>newspaper. The audience was almost exclusively Jewish. Suvchinsky said his attempt to identify at least five Christians had not been successful. I played well and Suvchinsky, who had not heard me play since Russian times, complimented me on my pianism. Yuryevskaya sang well, although she did not hold the final notes of 'Butterfly' and 'Remember Me' quite long enough. Ranchev (a Bulgarian tenor with a nice, sweet voice) had not learnt any of my songs and so sang some by Rimsky-Korsakov, which was justified to the audience by the explanation that Rimsky had been my teacher. Photographs were taken and cartoonists made drawings of us.</p>
