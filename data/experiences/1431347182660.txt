After all, I like listening to music. That’s not the same as simply liking music. Naturally, it’s silly for me to say that I love music, that goes without saying. And I love all music- from Bach to Offenbach. But I love only good music, that is, what I consider good music at any given time. But I like listening to any music, including bad music. It’s a professional disease, an addiction to notes. The brain finds sustenance in any combination of sounds. It works constantly, performing various composerly operations. / When I listen to orchestral music, I transcribe it for piano in my mind. I listen, while my fingers try it out to see if it fits the hand. And when I listen to piano music, mentally I run it through in an orchestral version. It’s a disease, but a pleasant one. It’s like scratching when you itch.
