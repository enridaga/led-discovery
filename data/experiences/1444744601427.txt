<p>Some little scenes I meant to write down.</p>
<p>One was on the flats towards Ripe one blazing hot day. We stopped in a bye road about 3 in the afternoon, &amp; heard hymn singing.&nbsp; It was very lonely and desolate.&nbsp; Here were people singing to themselves, in the hot afternoon. I looked &amp; saw a middle class 'lady' in skirt &amp; coat &amp; ribboned hat, the cottage door.&nbsp; She was making the daughters of the agrcultural labourers sing; it was about three o'clock on a Tuesday perhaps. Later we passed the ladies house; it had a wooden griffin nailed above the door - presumably her crest.</p>
