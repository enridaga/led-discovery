Ingres was passionately fond of music a passion shared by nearly all the great painters with whom I have come in contact while amongst poets and literary men the devotees to music seem to form an exception...To play to him in his studio, whilst he was engaged upon one of his great canvases, was to me one of my greatest delights. The well-known picture of ' Christ tempted by Satan ' (Liszt sitting as a model for Satan) was commenced and finished with the accompaniment of my music.
