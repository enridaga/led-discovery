Each [officer cadet] company took upon itself to give a goodbye treat to the rest of the Battalion on its leaving.
    'C’ Company gave some excellent sports on the race course ices galore.
    'D’ Company gave a regatta on Fleet Canal.   
    ‘E’ Company got down some stars from town to give an open-air concert. They included Violet Loraine, Phyllis Monkman and Jack Buchanan.
    'A’ Company gave a torchlit tattoo and ‘B’ Company gave their celebrated revue entitled 'What ho, Pyramids!' in the big riding school.
    Two thousand people witnessed the revue which was written by the cadets themselves. The scenery was also painted by the cadets and the cast numbered nearly fifty. I took the part of Little Freddie.
