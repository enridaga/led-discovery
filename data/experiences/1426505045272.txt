What infuriated Eisner immensely was what he called Kalkbrenner 's audacity and arrogance in asking for a pencil to cross out a certain passage [in the E minor Concerto] when he had merely glanced at the score, never having heard the complete effect of the concerto with orchestra. He says that if Kalkbrenner had offered you some advice, as for instance, to try to write a shorter first movement [Allegro] in another concerto that would have been different. But to instruct you to strike out what was written, that he cannot forgive.
