<p>The Grosvenor where I stay full of eaters until 10.30. While at supper heard an old lady sing something minor in the street - went out but lost her - met one of our former students who gave me information about Swansea Chap[el]s and singing - the singer comes past again but it is Aberystwyth she sings - with top notes in completely diff[eren]t &amp; weak register so that from the hotel I only hear snatches of the lower region of the tune.</p>
