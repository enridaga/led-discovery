To HIS SISTER. 1st R.B. Transport,
2 miles behind the trenches.
Saturday April 8, 1916.

I have got my back up against a nice sunny bank, and the sun and violets and cowslips are grand. I've just been watching two huge guns doing this in an orchard close by:- 
'Whish', audible for 10 secs.
I'm going up to the trenches to-night. It's a lovely day; altogether, life isn't too bad. We've had a fine Band playing Carmen and Tipperary and Yeomen of the Guard', and 'all those beautiful things', in front of the church. The guns, going off 200 yards away during the music, suggested a School Sports' Day. We are not very far from the place where we were when the Battalion was in rest. I should like again to emphasise the scrumptiousness of the day.
