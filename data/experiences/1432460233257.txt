Goldschmidt played us a great deal of beautiful music; in Chopin's Concerto, Mendelssohn's 'Variations SÃ©rieuses,' a prelude by Bach and some drawing-room pieces, he proved himself a genuine artist, earnest and thoughtful, with no straining for show or effect I was so glad to be able to be of service to him, and to prove my great respect and esteem for him by lending him my Erard piano.
