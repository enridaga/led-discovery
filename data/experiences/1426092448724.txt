Szembek is very musical, an excellent violinist (he was once a pupil of Rode) and a confirmed admirer of Paganini hence a good type of musician. He ordered his band to perform. They had practised all the morning and I heard amazing things. Everything was played on the sort of trumpet they call bugles. Would you believe it, they performed chromatic scales with incredible speed, making diminuendi towards the lower notes. I had to single out for praise their soloist who, I see, won't 
be in the service much longer, poor fellow, for he looks consumptive although he is still quite young. It gave me something to think about, hearing the cavatina from Masaniello played on those trumpets with complete accuracy and fine shading. Szembek has a piano in his camp and when I played he somehow understood me, really and truly, without pretence. The Adagio [F minor Concerto] impressed him most, and he kept me playing until I was late for II Turco.
