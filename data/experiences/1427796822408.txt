Lord Dudley, that munificent patron of the arts, asked me if I could give the work [Gluck's Iphigenie en Tauride]  in his own noble gallery, with a small orchestra and chorus, and on my answering in the affirmative he left me carte blanche, stipulating only that the very best vocalists should be engaged, namely, Mme. Titiens, Messrs. Sims Reeves, Belletti, and Santley, and that the band should include Messrs. Sainton, Piatti, Lazarus, and others equally well known. I set to work at once, trained a small but efficient chorus 
from the Italian Opera, and after a few rehearsals one of the most exquisite performances that I have ever been privileged to listen to, took place. To my surprise Lord Dudley had invited but few friends, about forty, to share his pleasure ; but he was thoroughly satisfied ; said to me repeatedly that he had never had so fine a concert in his house, and requested me to call the next morning with the bill 
of costs.
