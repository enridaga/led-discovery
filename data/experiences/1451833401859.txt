<p>On one occasion he [Richard Wagner] wrote, in relation to this&nbsp;speciality of his illustrious father-in-law : "He who has&nbsp;enjoyed frequent opportunities, particularly in a small&nbsp;intimate circle, of hearing Liszt play &mdash; Beethoven's&nbsp;music, for example &mdash; must have realised the fact that&nbsp;the playing in question was not mere reproduction, but&nbsp;actual production. The real boundary- line between&nbsp;these two achievements is not so easily settled as most&nbsp;people believe; but this I have ascertained beyond&nbsp;dispute &mdash; that in order to reproduce Beethoven, one&nbsp;must be able to produce with him. It would be impossible to make this comprehensible to those who, as long&nbsp;as they have lived, have heard nothing but ordinary&nbsp;performances, and professional renderings of Beethoven's&nbsp;pianoforte works. In the course of time I have gained&nbsp;so melancholy an insight into the evolution and essence&nbsp;of such renderings that I had rather not wound anybody's feellngs by expressing myself more clearly with regard to them. On the other hand I would ask all&nbsp;musicians who have, for instance, heard Beethoven's Op. 106 or 111 played by Liszt to friends in private,&nbsp;what they previously knew about those compositions, and&nbsp;what they learned of them upon those occasions? If this&nbsp;was reproduction, assuredly it was worth much more&nbsp;than all the sonatas reproducing Beethoven which are 'produced' by our pianoforte composers in imitation of&nbsp;those imperfectly comprehended works. The peculiarity&nbsp;of Liszt's development as a musician was simply this &mdash;&nbsp;that he did at the piano what others do with pen and&nbsp;ink; and it is undeniable that even the most original&nbsp;composer, during his first period, does nothing but reproduce."&nbsp;</p>
