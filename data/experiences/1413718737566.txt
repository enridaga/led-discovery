I practise Vla. & pack a bit in morning; I can’t go to practise yet as my foot is still rather bad. I go to Victoria to take back Adrian Glynde after tea, only have to bus all the way. Listen to Contemporary Music concert, broadcast in evening. v. Schönbergian Suite op. 18 of Knipper; uninteresting. Some vague weird Jap. songs of Maklakievicz. An extraordinary unacc. Choral “Ame du peine” of Hare; best of all 3 choruses of Wellesz. Quite well sung by Wireless Singers. Ended by a Sinfonietta, of Halffter, amusing tho’ over-long.
