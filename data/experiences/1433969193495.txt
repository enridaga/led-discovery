As I was known to be a musical man, the choir gave me, in the course of the service, a specimen of their abilities by singing an anthem. The most prominent defect among village singers is their vulgar method of pronouncing the words, â€” a much greater offence to our ears than the tone or incorrect tune of their voices. The first words of this anthem, 'Shout! Shout for joy!' were most profanely delivered, and the last was more like joey than the fine open word joy.
