Our RQMS [Regimental Quartermaster Sergeant] has been on leave in Madras for the past week. He came to the Fort today and invited all East Lancs to a tea party at the bungalow in which he resides. We had a jolly good time and he spared no expense to make it a success. We had a ‘sing song’ after tea. He gave us his favourite ditty, ‘Down on the Yei Yei-o, or Yehio’. It is a river in China, I know, in which an old fellow named McDoodle and a lot of cows, pigs and goats figure prominently. On conclusion, he was tumultuously applauded. The song was very ancient, his voice slightly cracked, but still it was policy to applaud him.
