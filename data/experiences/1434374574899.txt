<p>The Palace, Berlin: early Thursday, 24th September, 1857 - I am just come from a fine solemnity&mdash;the consecration of the new Hall for devotional meeting belongings, to the Moravian Brethren. This day, 106 years ago, the old narrow and dark receptacle was consecrated&mdash;now they have a handsome, roomy, and well-lighted hall. The King was present and all the clergy of Berlin. The Pastor Wunsche and the Deacon Stobwasser had in the kindest manner invited me, and they received me on entering with much warmth. Count Groben met me on leaving the carriage, with the intelligence that I was to dine to-day with the King at Charlottenburg&mdash;and then the Master of the Household communicated the same, with the addition that my son was invited with me (an unusual distinction). Then we were directed to the seats on the King's left hand &mdash; the lowest of which I took, and George sat behind me. Presently an old man rose and stretched out his hand to me, with a kind look&mdash;it was Goschel, Schmieder's friend ; then came Krummacher and others ; at length the King entered (without the Queen) ; and an ancient hymn of the Bohemian Brethren (similar to that beginning, ' The Church of Christ ') was sung, with trombone-accompaniment.</p>
