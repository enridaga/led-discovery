At 8.30 this morning we sent the harmonium to the Church on the trucks with John and George and soon after 10 o'clock Fanny and I followed to see where it ought to be placed and hear how it sounded. Though a small instrument it quite filled the Church with sound. We placed it in the Baptistery close by the Font. This morning was an epoch in the history of Langley Church and the first sound of an instrument within the old walls an event and sensation not soon to be forgotten. How this innovation, necessary though it has become, will be received by the Squire no one can tell. He has forced us to do it himself and opened the way for the change by dismissing George Jefferies, the chief singer, from his post of leader of the Church singing, but we expect some violence of language at least.
