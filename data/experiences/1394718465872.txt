The modern symphony or overture with hautboy & horn parts instead of ripieno violins having been introduc'd not long before this time, Mr McArthur soon brought the two first setts of Bach & Abel to our meetings as a valuable addition & variation of style, which he used to lead with great spirit & rapidity. It was however some time before he could bring over any but Mr Chapman to his opinion, as Mr Ducket used to twist about in playing the 2d. fiddle & wanted to rest at the end of every quick movement. Little Wafer too grumbl'd at the reiterated quavers upon one note for several bars together, which not being used to, he co'd hardly manage to play at sight, & did not like quitting Corelli., Handel etc. most of which he was well acquainted with, the basses of which were also of much more consequence than those of the modern symphony.
