Yesterday after lunch I went with Thalberg to the Evangelical Church where Hesse, a young organist from Wroclaw, performed to a select Viennese audience all the cream, from Stradler, Kiesewetter, Mosel, Seyfried, Gyrowetz, etc., down to the beadle. The boy has talent and knows how to handle an organ.
