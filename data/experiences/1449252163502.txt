<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">There was a coach waiting outside my primary school(Brooklands in Finchley) on a Saturday morning to take us to the Festival Hall children's&nbsp; concert.&nbsp; None of my friends were interested so I bravely went alone. I will always remember the buzz of the building and the fantastic pieces of music so fascinatingly described and explained in a language I could understand. That was the start of my love affair with music which has sustained me throughout my life.</p>
