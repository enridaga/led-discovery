<p>It was so exciting, my cousin, a regular at the Royal Festival Hall, agreed to take me along.&nbsp; I had begged for the opportunity to attend a concert, which included a favourite, Ralph Vaughn Williams, Overture, "The Wasps".&nbsp; A sudden silence, as an announcement informed, that the composer was in the box above our heads.&nbsp; This was the occasion of his 80th birthday, I believe.&nbsp; The great man accepted graciously the ovation of the audience.&nbsp; The applause was thunderous.&nbsp; It made my first visit a memorable one.&nbsp;</p>
