<p>Towards the end of June, 1879, when,&nbsp;seated by Adelina Patti in her ground-tier box at Covent&nbsp;Garden, I witnessed the production of Massenef's <em>Roi de&nbsp;Lahore,</em>&nbsp;I could not help thinking that we English were getting on apace in the way of emancipation from old-fashioned prejudices and hallowed traditions; for the&nbsp;third act of that extremely remarkable work is also transacted in the celestial regions, its "leading business"&nbsp;being appropriately confided to the First Person of the&nbsp;Trinity, who promotes human souls to eternal bliss or&nbsp;condemns them to its converse in solemn strains (to the&nbsp;accompaniment obbligato of four trombones), seated on&nbsp;his throne and surrounded by his angels &mdash; cherubim and&nbsp;seraphim &mdash; who dance "ballets of rejoicing" whenever a&nbsp;virtuous spirit obtains advancement or a sinner's ghost&nbsp;is bundled off to the infernal regions.&nbsp;</p>
