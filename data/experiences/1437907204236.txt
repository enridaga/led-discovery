<p>Listen to wireless after dinner - Bernard Shaw speaking very finely &amp; beautifully in the 'Whither Britain' series; also Toni Brosa &amp; Max Piram in a recital. A really disgraceful perf. of Beethoven F maj. Sonata. T.B. plays some solos after - very beautifully; he is a superb fiddler which makes it more annoying that he is such an indifferent musician. Piram is, of course, a wash-out.&nbsp;</p>
