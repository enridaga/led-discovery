     Breakfast [was] at 9.00 am [followed by] a stroll around the city until noon, dinner, and more ‘doing the sights’. It was the first time I had a real good walk around Dublin.
     Leave for the docks at 6.00 pm, embark at 7.00 pm... Violins, mouth organs, concertinas, melodeons and other musical instruments enliven a calm six hours crossing. One would imagine that we were coming home after winning a war instead of going out to fight one.
