<p>We and the Schuncks had combined to celebrate Mendelssohn's birthday. The proceedings were opened with a capital comic scene between two lady's maids, acted, in the Frankfort dialect, by C&eacute;cile and her sister. Then came a charade on the word 'Gewandhaus.' Joachim, adorned with a fantastic wig, &agrave; la Paganini, played a hare-brained impromptu on the G string; the syllable 'Wand' was represented by the Pyramus and the wall-scene from the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'; [...] The whole word 'Gewandhaus' was illustrated by a full orchestra, Mendelssohn and my children playing on little drums and trumpets; Joachim leading with a toy violin, my Felix conducting &agrave; la Jullien. It was splendid.</p>
