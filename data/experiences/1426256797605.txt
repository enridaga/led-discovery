In the summers, of course, there were the Proms. Monday was Wagner night, Friday Beethoven; we went on Wednesday, Bach night, as it was my father's choice and he was paying. He used to insist on leaving at the interval because most of the second half consisted of vast quantities of "Boosey Ballads" to piano accompaniment. Contrary to what might be supposed these were not raucous drinking songs but simply all the popular drawing-room numbers of the day published by Boosey's who helped to finance the concerts. During this part of the programme the orchestra would repair to the " George" in Great Portland Street, christened the "Glue Pot" by Sir Henry Wood as it was so difficult to extricate the players when the time came for them to return to the platform for the finale which would be the overture to "Zampa" or "Mignon" or something equally jolly. I persuaded my father to stay once - he was deeply shocked.
