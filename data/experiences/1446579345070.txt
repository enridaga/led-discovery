<p>Dear Duke Ellington,</p>
<p>As I write this letter, there's a record playing.&nbsp; Not a CD, but a long-playing record. I bought it from a shop in 1954 and now it's a little worn and scratchy...It's the first record I ever bought...It's called <em>Ellington Masterpieces</em> (Columbia sx 1022). You probably remember it. It has your photograph on the sleeve.</p>
<p>The tune is called 'Mood Indigo' but you'd know that, since you wrote it -- in 1931 according to my big book of famous tunes. It's the first piece of your music I ever heard... Something about it made my ears tingle.&nbsp;</p>
