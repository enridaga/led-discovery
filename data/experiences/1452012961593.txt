<p>It was in one of these [Italian] theatres, thronged for the&nbsp;nonce, that I happened to be seated, hopeful of whiling&nbsp;away a long idle evening by the aid of the Trovatore &mdash;&nbsp;announced for performance by a galaxy of stars that&nbsp;professed to have sparkled in Royal Opera-houses without number &mdash; when the ire of the audience, justly&nbsp;aroused by the ladies of the robust tenor &mdash; let us continue&nbsp;to call him Signer Malandrino, in recognition of his&nbsp;vocal turpitude &mdash; broke all bounds, and gave rise to an&nbsp;episode of riot and clamour compared to which Irving's&nbsp;version of the Brocken orgies might rank as a mild and orderly Sunday-school entertainment of the bun and&nbsp;sky-blue order. Malandrino was a comely and stalwart&nbsp;artist; when he first "came on" his appearance so far&nbsp;prepossessed the public in his favour that he was&nbsp;received with a round of polite applause. But he had&nbsp;not terminated the introductory phrase of his opening&nbsp;recitative, when an apprehensive shudder ran through&nbsp;the house, and a few sonorous voices were heard exclaiming "Non stuonar!" (Don't sing out of tune !). As he&nbsp;proceeded, however, regardless of this timely prohibition,&nbsp;to sing flatter and flatter, the outcries grew louder, more&nbsp;general, and, I regret to say, more objurgatory in their&nbsp;character. Amongst the uncomplimentary epithets&nbsp;hurled at the wretched Malandrino were "Bestial,"&nbsp;" Asinaccio!" "Infame!" and others (the Italian popular vocabulary teems with such amenities) less fit&nbsp;for publication; one sustained high note of peculiar&nbsp;atrocity elicited a terrific yell of "Boja!" (executioner),&nbsp;a term of dire reproach throughout the Realm of the&nbsp;Boot. No sooner had the curtain dropped than the&nbsp;occupants of the pit and gallery vanished from the&nbsp;auditorium with extraordinary rapidity.</p>
