Macbeth was splendidly got up, the costume appropriately preserved; the choruses were finely executed with all the strength of the company. I had the direction and getting up of the delightful music, and suggested a change which has been ever since adopted, and I think with good effect. It had been the custom for one witch only to sing "He must he will he shall, Spill much more blood." My alteration was 
FIRST WITCH. He must ! 
SECOND WITCH. He will ! 
THIRD WITCH He SHALL ! 
Spill much more blood ! laying great stress upon the climax, " He shall." The alteration was much approved of. There was another novelty in the witchery, 
at the words " Mingle, mingle ye, that mingle may," a great number of little boys came on as spirits; I must confess it produced something like laughter; they were, however, persisted in, for several nights, but at last discontinued, for there was no keeping the little boys in order ; they made such a terrible noise behind the scenes : one little urchin used to play all kinds of tricks; and that one, odd enough to say, was my ci-devant Cupid, Edmund Kean, and, on his account, Kemble dismissed the whole tribe of phantoms. The play was powerfully cast: Macbeth, Kemble; Macduff, John Palmer; Banquo, Bensley ; 
Malcolm, Charles Kemble, who, on that night, made his first appearance before a London audience; Charles Bannister was the Hecate, and admirable 
he was in it; Mrs. Siddons was Lady Macbeth ; and Parsons, Moody, and Baddely, the speaking witches.
