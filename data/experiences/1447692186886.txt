<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In about 1954 when I was six years old I was taken to the Royal Festival Hall to hear an Earnest Read Childrens' Concert.&nbsp; I'm told I was overwhelmed by the hall and the music, but what I remember is the ice-cream.&nbsp; It was vanilla, in a little tub with pink icing round the edge and the RFH Lyre in the centre.&nbsp; I went to many more childrens' concerts and a lifetime of adult ones but I've never seen such an ice-cream again.</p>
