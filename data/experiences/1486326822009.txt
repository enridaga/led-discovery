<p>Stravinsky is in Hollywood but we are not able to see him much. Hollywood and San Francisco are about as far apart as Paris and Marseilles. He came here with Vera for three days. He gave a lecture at the College and, with Nadia [Boulanger], played his new Sonata for two pianos, which is delightful, a&nbsp;<em>Scherzo &aacute; la russe&nbsp;</em>(very&nbsp;<em>Petrushka</em> 1944) and his Polka for the elephants of Barnum Circus, which I do not like.&nbsp;</p>
