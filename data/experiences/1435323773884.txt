I get tickets from B.B.C. for Broadcasting House Chamber concert at 8.0, to which I take Grace Williams. Stravinsky & Dushkin. Pergolesi transcripts. Duo Concertante (2ce performed) & some incredible arrangements from the Ballets - all for Vln & Pft.* Dushkin is a fine fiddler, but I am not so impressed with Stravinsky as pianist.
