<p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: Courier; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Courier;">At Cambridge, in the year 1861, I heard Beethoven's Septet for the first time, and on my return mentioned the fact to Sir Frederick, who immediately went to the piano and commenced the work, pointing out each instrument that had any prominent part. He played on for twenty minutes and then only stopped from fatigue. I told him that I wondered that I had never heard him play it before. He said that he had never done so&mdash;had not seen it in print, and only heard it once in his life, ten years before at Rome.</span></p>
