<p><span lang="EN-GB">[&hellip;] I happened to be improvising as usual, instead of studying Bach. He [unnamed young man] said to me, in such a pleasant voice, &ldquo;Continuez, continuez, Mademoiselle; je vous en prie, ne vous d&eacute;rangez pas,&rdquo; that I decided to go on. Unlike Op. 1 and Op. 2 of Heidelberg fame, which firmly refused to budge outside the limits of a single octave, this new inspiration lied from top to bottom of the piano, like a hunted hare with a pack of hounds in full pursuit. I believe I really didn&rsquo;t play at all badly for a little girl whose skirts hardly reached below her knees&mdash; anyhow, the nice-looking young man was quite impressed. He cried, &ldquo;Brava! bis! Mais comme vous jouez bien&mdash; c&rsquo;est &eacute;tonnant, c&rsquo;est vraiment &eacute;tonnant!&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t look round, but I was &ldquo;tickled to death,&rdquo; as my American schoolfellows would have said, at so unexpected and warm a tribute to my performance.</span></p>
