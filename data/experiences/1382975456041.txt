In the quadrangle of Trinity we met Mr. Whewell, whom I like very much and who conducted us most kindly till he was called away, and then Mr. Flint brought us to evening service at King's College Chapel. There Mr. Townley had offered to bespeak an anthem such as we should admire, and the choice fell upon Haydn's 'Let there be Light,' with the succeeding air and chorus - a singular and most unsuitable selection as a part of church-service, though in itself beautiful, and sung by very fine voices, accompanied by an exquisite organ.
