<p>Now for a piece of news! I was paying my French teacher, Mademoiselle D., a call one evening last week, and I played for her and for a friend of hers who is very musical, and who gives lessons herself. She at once said very decidedly that I "ought to be heard in concert." Her brother is the director of the Philharmonic Society in a place called Frankfurt-an-der-Oder - a littile city not far form here. What should she do but write to her brother about me, and what should <em>he</em> do but immediately write up for me to come down and play in a Philharmonic concert there the first week in May.</p>
