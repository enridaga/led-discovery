Most of the recordings I made in the early days were with Beecham but I once had to play for Sir Hamilton Harty in the Bax "Picaresque Comedy Overture". We did it all in one session; I was still a very new boy and discovered to my horror that I suddenly had several bars all on my own. On hearing the play-back Sir Hamilton commented in his gentle Irish voice that the bass clarinet seemed to have had "rather a bumpy ride". This was one occasion when I was devoutly thankful to know that the wax would now be destroyed, obliterating my shame while I concentrated on getting it right next time.
