The most strenuous part of the week was the children's concerts. The first one, the Trip to the Zoo, proved much too elegant and innocent for the ruffians who came determined to heckle and disrupt. We kept going manfully, but the kids got more and more out of control...

On the second occasion, a few days later, we used up a tremendous amount of energy in the morning by worrying about what would happen during the afternoon's children's concert... In the event, of course, a perfectly docile audience of small children and willing parents turned up and enjoyed every minute of it, and such was the smoothness of transition from one item to another that the show was actually too short - the first such occasion ever in the dome. Krysia's parents were there, and said that there was not enough concert music, so it seemed that our compromise had been too radical.
