I go to College at 10.0 & have v. nice lesson with Ireland - he is quite pleased with my Credo. I practise 2.15-3.30 then go to College to get ticket written for concert tomorrow - as Ireland said I must go, although all the tickets were gone! I go to the combined concert of the Kensington Festival.* Quite well attended, & not at all bad of it's sort. R.V.W conducts. The best of the evening was Mothers singing of Bonny Lighter boy - marvellous rhythm, words & everything. R.V.W. Xmas Fantasia thrilling to sing & I should think to listen to. V. Beautiful. Back 11.0
