Get my time table from the College in morning. I am with J. Ireland & A. Benjamin. Shop with Mummy in morning, and go to college at 12.0. I have no lessons to-day. See Mummy off at the bus for the 3.10 home. Oh, God, I wish she were here. Practice Pft after that, & after tea go for a drive with Miss May Prior, & a German man. Go to Queenâ€™s Hall Prom. with Howard Ferguson Mozart concerto (K.Long) delicious & Mahler 4th. Much too long, but beautiful in pts.
