<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have been listening this week to the recorded piano music of a composer now widely esteemed for his ability to stay an hour or so ahead of his time. But I find the alternation of note-clumps and silences of which it consists impossibly monotonous, and I long for the leverage of Beethoven&rsquo;s timing, to say nothing of harmonic and other leverages. The <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">matter</em> of the music is so limited in effect, too, and so solemn, that I was sustained only by the hope, during each longer silence, that finally the pianist might have &lsquo;had it&rsquo; too and shot himself. </span></p>
