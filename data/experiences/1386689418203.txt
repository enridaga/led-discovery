When Playing the Gramophone after Choir & Orch. practice with Whittow, the spring unaccountably gave way, & the wretched instrument refuses to work. We told Gog on Sunday (10th) but as it wasn't our fault he doesn't seem to mind much, as there is a chance of us having a new one. The old one was a terrible old thing. (Monday.) The gramophone is now as good as it was on Sat. Some poor wretched person has mended it.
