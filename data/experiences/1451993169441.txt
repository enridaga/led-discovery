<p>Some years&nbsp;ago I underwent the sorrow of hearing the noblest opera&nbsp;of modern times, Gounod's "Faust," so carved, clipped,&nbsp;and mangled as to be almost unrecognisable. It was, in&nbsp;fact, a mere abridgment of the original work &mdash; not only&nbsp;were whole scenes left out, and others amalgamated or&nbsp;fused down into one another, to the utter destruction of&nbsp;the unities, but Niemann (Faust) cut out the second&nbsp;part of " Salve dimora," and Mdlle. Baumgarten (Marguerite) omitted more than half of the jewel song, and a&nbsp;whole verse of the " R&eacute; di Thule." For such whole-sale and unscrupulous barbarism I was altogether&nbsp;unprepared in Berlin, which is ever being vaunted by&nbsp;its inhabitants as "die Hauptstadt der Intelligenz."&nbsp;</p>
