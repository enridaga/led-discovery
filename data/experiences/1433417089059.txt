<p>We used to come to work or go to parades in big horse-drawn trucks, and when two trucks met, there would be a "cutting contest". One day we caught Buddy (Petit) drunk, and our band really wore them out. The following Sunday we drove up and saw Buddy sitting there with his head hanging down and his hands flopping, so we got set to go after them again. And then somebody sneaked around and chained the wheel of out truck to theirs so we couldn't get away, and Buddy jumped to his feet and that day they really wore <em>us&nbsp;</em>out!</p>
