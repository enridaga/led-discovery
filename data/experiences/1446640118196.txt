But her knowledge of music was equal to any thing, and she could sing well in every style, as was proved by her performances in Westminster Abbey, where she sung with the best effect: in my opinion she rarely appeared to greater advantage, for in that space the harsh part of her voice was lost, while its power and clearness filled the whole of it.</span></p>
