Christmas was a great day. We were serenaded, of course, and we serenaded the C.O. in revenge. He was delighted and made a speech in pyjamas on his doorstep, and we killed a pig for the Company and ordered up certain barrels and smokes which livened up things considerably, especially during a terrific concert we had later. There was, as far as I could hear, practically no firing 
on Christmas Day. I think the Hun is rather susceptible there, very rightly.

What a dull letter, though! Sorry. It's the gas attack which has caused it all.
