<p>I was detained in prison for three days, and was only liberated through great interest. I returned to my master, who received me with his usual kindness, and applauded my spirit for not receiving a blow without returning it. The termination of his engagement approached, when he proposed returning to Naples. He called me to him one morning, and after hearing me sing half a dozen songs, in which he had taken great pains in my instruction, said, " The time of our separation is approaching ; your talent will now procure you an engagement in any theatre in Europe. I have written to Campigli, the manager of the Pergola theatre in Florence (he was also a sort of agent, and was, at that time, in correspondence with, and furnished every Italian opera in Europe with singers, dancers, composers, &amp;c.) ; he will be glad to see you, and under his care and patronage you cannot fail of success, because you have the peculiar distinction of being the only public scholar I ever taught. A Syracusan polacre will sail in a few days for Leghorn, in which I will procure you a passage, and will give you several letters of recommendation; and so, God bless you, my good boy !"</p>
