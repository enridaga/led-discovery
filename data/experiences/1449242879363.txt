<p><span lang="EN-GB">My last recollection of Heidelberg is a concert given by the celebrated violinist Joachim. I was taken to it as a great treat, and wore a new silk dress for the occasion. I also wore a grand little opera-cloak trimmed with swansdown. To tell the truth, I was so taken up with the unusual splendour of my appearance that I hardly listened to the music. It is an awful confession, but I am obliged to make it.</span></p>
