<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Soon after joining the Metropolitan Police in 1959 I attended a concert at the Festival Hall given by the Met Police Band and the Police male voice choir (consisting almost entirely of Welshmen.)&nbsp; Although I cannot remember much of the programme, I recall a solo given by a police officer with a magnificent baritone voice.&nbsp; He began a rendering of the best known setting of Kipling's poem, 'The Road to Mandalay' and was well into his stride when he stopped singing and the band and chorus stuttered to a halt.&nbsp; Then, in a broad Welsh accent, and without any apparent embarassment, he announced, "Sorry ladies and gentlemen, I seem to have forgotten the words!"&nbsp; After a hasty consultation with the conductor, who showed him his lines, the song was resumed without further mishap.&nbsp; The point of this is that the hearts of the entire audience went out to him and the aplause at the end was long and rapturous.</p>
