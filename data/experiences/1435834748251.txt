Through a glass screen in an elaborate studio we watch - listen to - the recording session of a brass piece by a Hungarian composer and conductor unknown to me. Over there two trombones fart dryly, back here a horn farts in reply, then three trumpets fart and are answered by a low fart on the tuba. Then they all fart together, but can't seem really to let loose. Don't true artists grandly shit?
