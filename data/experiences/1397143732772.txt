In the evening we went to a performance at the cinema, which was quite amusing. It was packed with Tommies and officers, and a few of the men had brought French children, or women with them. They seemed highly amused at it all. The piano was being played all the time, and every time a well-known tune came up the whole house whistled or sang to it - it was fine.
