The New Zealand government borrowed
100 mln stg on the Eurosterling market to refinance a loan of
the same amount maturing in June, Finance Minister Roger
Douglas said in a statement.
    The coupon rate is 9.62 pct and the loan life is eight
years.
    Douglas said the coupon rate is the lowest obtained by the
government on a sterling loan since 1971.
