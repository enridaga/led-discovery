An explosive device blew up in the
Philippine Congress building early on Tuesday, a congressional
security official said.
    He said no-one was injured in the blast which damaged a
telephone booth on the second floor at about 0825 local time
(0025 GMT).
    Captain Rosalo Ylagan, head of congressional security, said
the device could have been a home-made bomb or a large
firecracker. The explosion was being investigated, he added.
    No congressmen were in the building at the time.
