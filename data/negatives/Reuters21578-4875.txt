Los Angeles Securities Group said
the &lt;National Association of Securities Dealers> has decided
not to delist its securities from the NASDAQ system for now, as
it had threatened.
    The company said the NASD has granted it an undetermined
period of time to resolve issues raised by the NASD on
market-making in its own common stock.
