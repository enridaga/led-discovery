The Soviet Union's first official
observer at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said he came away
from this week's ADB annual meeting with a favourable
impression but that no decision has been made on whether the
Soviet Union should join as a full member.
    Yurij V. Ponomarev, international managing director of the
State Bank, said he will file a formal report when he returns
to Moscow, but it will not contain any recommendation on
membership. "We haven't started any process with a view toward
membership," he said.
    Ponomarev downplayed the significance of his attendance,
saying it only signalled a slight change in attitude by Moscow.
Although this is the first time Moscow has attended the ADB's
annual meeting as an observer, Soviet bankers have come to
meetings in the past as guests, he said.
    Delegates here saw the Soviet move as part of an overall
strategy to strengthen ties with Asia and improve the
functioning of the Soviet economy.
    Ponomarev declined to comment on remarks yesterday by a
senior U.S. Official, who warned that Soviet membership in the
ADB would cause serious operational problems.
    "How would the ADB, for instance, use the (Soviet) rouble as
a basis for expanding its capital?" asked the U.S. Official, who
declined to be identified.
    Ponomarev said: "It is far too premature to speculate on the
potential difficulties that might be involved if we applied for
membership."
    In order to become a member, Moscow would have to gain the
backing of two-thirds of the board of governors representing
three-quarters of the voting power of member countries.
Washington has just over a 12 pct voting share.
