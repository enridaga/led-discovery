ALZA Corp said it has notified
the State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board of
a plan to remedy groundwater and soil contamination it detected
at a site in Stanford Research Park.
    A preliminary water sample showed water apparently
contaminated some years ago with the industrial solvent
chloroform. The company said the contamination does not affect
drinking water or water used its operations on the site.
    The plan is expected to cost a maximum of 750,000 dlrs, the
company said.
