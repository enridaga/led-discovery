The Palo Verde Unit 1 nuclear
power plant returned to service today following an automatic
shutdown early Saturday morning, the Arizona Nuclear Power
Project said.
    The shutdown came during a weekly test of feedwater pumps
leading to the steam generators on the non-nuclear side of the
plant, a Power Project spokesman said. A defective electrical
relay caused a feedwater pump to stop operating, leading to an
automatic shutdown of the plant, he said.
    Palo Verde Unit 1 was restarted Sunday following repairs
and surveillance testing. Unit 1 was operating at 40 pct power
Monday and is expected to return to full power, about 1300
megawatts, Tuesday, the spokesman said.
    Palo Verde Unit 2 continues to operate at full power,
generating 1347 gross megawatts, he said.
    The Arizona Nuclear Power Project is a consortium including
AZP Group's &lt;AZP> Arizona Public Service, El Paso Electric
&lt;ELPA>, Public Service of New Mexico &lt;PNM> and Southern
California Edison &lt;SCE>.
