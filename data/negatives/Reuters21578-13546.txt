The state-owned People's Construction
Bank of China is making its first foreign borrowing, 300 mln
dlrs to finance a large ethylene plant in Shanghai, the
People's Daily said.
    The newspaper's overseas edition said the plant will
produce 300,000 tonnes of ethylene a year.
    It said the bank last year started foreign exchange
services for the first time on an experimental basis in
Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Xiamen, but it gave no more details.
