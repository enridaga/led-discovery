Firestone Tire and Rubber Co said
Chairman John Nevin entered into a new employment agreement
allowing him to continue as an executive or consultant with the
company until he becomes 65 years old in February 1992.
    Firestone said Nevin has agreed to remain as chief
executive officer until its board elects a successor. The
company was not immediately available for comment.
   In the release, Firestone said while Nevin serves as chief
executive, he will be paid his current salary and will continue
to be eligible for supplemental compensation.
    Firestone said Nevin will serve as a consultant to the
company after a new chief executive is found and until Nevin
becomes 65. Firestone said it agreed that during this period,
Nevin will be paid a fee not less than the pension which he
would have been entitled to if he retired.
    It also said Nevin agreed not to engage in a competitive
business until he becomes 67.
    On February 17, Firestone granted Nevin an option to buy
100,000 shares of the company's common at 34.19 dlrs a share.
