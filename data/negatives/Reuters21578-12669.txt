The board of directors of Manhattan
National Corp said it has named Charles Hinckley chairman and
chief executive officer of the life insurance holding company,
replacing Wilmot Wheeler Jr, who returns to his former position
of vice chairman.
    Hinckley is also president and chief executive officer of
&lt;Union Central Life Insurance Co>, a mutual insurer that on
March 31 acquired 3.6 mln shares of Manhattan National's common
stock for 43.2 mln dlrs, or 12 dlrs a share, a spokesman for
Manhattan National said.
    The spokesman said the purchase, coupled with the 900,096
Manhattan National shares Union Central already owned, brought
Union Central's Manhattan National stake up to 52.2 pct of the
outstanding common shares.
    Manhattan National said it also named five others from
Union Central to its board of directors.
    The spokesman said Union Central now holds seven of
Manhattan National's thirteen seats on the board of directors.
    The company also said it named Paul Aniskovich Jr president
and chief executive officer of its Manhattan Life Insurance Co
and Manhattan National Life Insurance Co units.
    Aniskovich, who fills a vacancy at the units, formerly was
executive vice president of Union Central Life.
