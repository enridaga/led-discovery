Confessed spy Jonathan Pollard was
sentenced today to life in prison for passing thousands of
pages of top-secret U.S. military documents to Israel.
    Pollard, a former Navy intelligence analyst, was sentenced
for his role in what prosecutors described as one of the most
serious breaches of security in U.S. history.
    Pollard, a 32-year-old American Jew, claimed he was acting
out of concern for Israel's safety and the belief that U.S.
officials were withholding intelligence from Israel.
