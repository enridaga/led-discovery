The French parliament has approved a
substantial increase in defence spending to modernise the
country's nuclear and conventional forces.
    The bill provides 474 billion francs for defence
expenditure over a five-year period starting next year, with 32
pct allocated to modernise the country's nuclear weapons
systems.
    The budget represents a six pct annual increase, starting
next year, well above the 3.5 pct NATO recommends for members
of its military command. France is a member of NATO but does
not belong to its integrated military command.
    The budget will help finance three new types of nuclear
weapons, a military reconnaissance satellite, a nuclear powered
aircraft carrier, the AMX Leclerc tank and the possible
development of chemical weapons.
    The program also includes funds for design work on nuclear
missile submarines and the M-5 submarine-launched missile.
