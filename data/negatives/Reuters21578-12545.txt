N.Y. coffee futures were marginally
firmer midmorning, trading in ranges of no more than 0.50 cent.
    May was up 0.16 cent at 102.20 cents at 1052 hrs EST, in a
range of 102.00 to 102.50 cents. July was up 0.15 at 104.15
cents in a 35-point range.
    Traders said reports that the U.S. State Department does
not forsee a meeting with Brazil prior to the next
International Coffee Organization session in September did not
affect the market as the news was expected.
    Operators are watching the cash market for indications of
roaster interest or producer selling.
