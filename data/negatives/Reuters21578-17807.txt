Canon Inc &lt;CANN.T> said it will stop making
Japanese language word processors with retail prices below
50,000 yen and consign production instead to &lt;Kyushu Matsushita
Electronic Co Ltd>, a 51.75-pct owned unit of Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.
    A Canon spokesman said the move reflects intense price
competition as Canon, Casio Computer Co Ltd &lt;CACT.T> and others
compete in the growing market for low-end processors.
    Canon will focus production on more expensive and
sophisticated models which have more generous profit margins,
he said.
