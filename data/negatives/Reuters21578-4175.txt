Invacare Corp said the Canadian
Federal Court ruled in favor of it in a patent infringement
action filed against Everest and Jennings Canadian Ltd.
    The court ordered that Everest respond in an undisclosed
amount of damages to Invacare for its actions.
    A corresponding case is currently pending in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
