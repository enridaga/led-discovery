Shopsmith Inc said its board has
released Joseph DiGaicomo Jr. as president, but he will remain
on the board.
    The company said the post of president will not be filled
at present.
    "With very disappointing sales results during the quarter
just ended, adjustments are appropriate," the company quoted
chairman John R. Folkerth as saying.
