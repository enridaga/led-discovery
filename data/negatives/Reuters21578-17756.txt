Bell Canada, owned by Bell Canada
Enterprises Inc, said it will reduce long distance rates in
Canada by an average of between two and eight pct, in line with
a ruling by Canadian regulators.
    The company said it does not expect any change to net
revenues.
    The company said it will cut rates for calls within 
Ontario, Quebec and parts of the Northwest Territories by an
average of between two and three pct and by an average eight
pct for other parts of Canada, effective Wednesday.
   
    The changes will decrease the charges for longer distances
and increase shorter distance rates, Bell Canada said.
    The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission ordered Bell Canada to reduce its phone rates
because it said the company, which has a monopoly in certain
areas, was making more than the allowable rate of return.
