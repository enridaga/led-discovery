Taiwan and the U.S. Have revised and
extended their textile export agreement after negotiations in
Washington this week, a spokesman for the Taiwan Textile
Federation said.
    Charles Chen told Reuters the original three year accord
has been extended by one year to the end of 1989. The U.S. Has
agreed to raise the limit on annual growth of Taiwan's textile
and apparel exports to one pct from 0.5 pct for calendar 1989,
he said. "The new accord is more fair and gives breathing space
to our textile makers (so they can) diversify their exports to
other nations," he added.
    Chen said the revised agreement puts Taiwan on similar
textile exporting terms to Hong Kong and South Korea. But
despite the changes, Taiwanese firms have lost orders to rivals
in Hong Kong and South Korea because of the strong Taiwan
dollar, he said. The Taiwan currency has risen 17 pct against
the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 while the Korean won rose
by some six pct and the Hong Kong dollar was stable.
    Taiwan's textile exports to the U.S. Amounted to 2.8
billion U.S. Dlrs last year out of total exports to the U.S. Of
7.8 billion. Textile exports are expected to remain the same
this year, Chen said.
