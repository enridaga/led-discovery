Finance Minister Roger Douglas said
the government would introduce a full tax imputation system on
dividends effective from the 1988/89 income year.
    Confirming the government's timetable for the imputation
system, which had been announced in earlier budgets, Douglas
said in a statement that the system would substantially reduce
the influence of the tax system on companies' financial
policies and investment strategies.
