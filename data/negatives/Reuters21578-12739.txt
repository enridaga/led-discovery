CBT soyproduct futures continued to
trade higher in light midsession trade, with deferred months up
most, supported by the strong tone in the nearby soybean pit,
traders said.
    Soymeal held gains of 0.70 dlr to 2.00 dlrs per tonne, with
steadiness in Rotterdam meals and U.S. cash soymeal basis
values this morning, plus trade-talk of additional processor
down-time in the U.S over the next few weeks, adding to the
positive tone in meal futures, they said.
    Merrill Lynch and E.F. Hutton were the featured outright
buyers of May soymeal, with Cargill spreading May/July at 0.20
dlr premium May, pit brokers said.
    Soyoil futures were up 0.11 to 0.15 cent per lb, supported
by steady commercial buying.
