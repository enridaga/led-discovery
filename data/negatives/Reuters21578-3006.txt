Utilization of offshore mobile rigs in
the Gulf of Mexico was unchanged at 35.6 pct during the past
week, a level that has remained relatively steady since January
due largely to a reduction of nine rigs in the Gulf fleet,
Offshore Data Services said.
    The total number of working rigs was 83 for the week,
compared to 83 last week and 129 rigs one year ago.
    Offshore Data Services said the worldwide utilization rate
fell 0.3 pct to 53.9 pct with a total of 335 idled rigs. The
number of rigs contracted worldwide was 392.
    In the European-Mediterranean area, rig utilization also
remained unchanged at 41.3 pct during the past week with 64 of
155 rigs contracted.
