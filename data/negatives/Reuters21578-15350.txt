The 22nd annual meeting of the Asian
Development Bank will be held in Peking in 1989, a senior bank
official told Reuters.
    China, which was admitted as the bank's 47th member in
March 1986, will take a place on the ADB board at the current
meeting here, he said.
    Peking's representatives have been attending board meetings
over the past year as observers with no voting rights, he
added.
    He said China, the bank's third-largest shareholder after
Japan and the United States, will take the seat on the
12-member board currently occupied by a grouping of Sri Lanka,
Vietnam, the Maldives, Laos and Afghanistan.
    He also said the U.S., Whose nominee on the board, Joe O.
Rogers, resigned in September 1986, has named Victor Frank as
his replacement.
    Frank, a private-sector appointee, is awaiting Senate
approval and will take up his post later this year, he added.
