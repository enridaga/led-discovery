Most Americans feel that hostile
corporate takeovers do more harm than good, according to a
public opinion poll by Louis Harris and Assoc Inc.
    The poll of 1,751 U.S. adults and 682 top business
executives found that 58 pct believe hostile takeovers do more
harm than good, while only eight pct say they do more good than
harm.
    Among those holding stock, a 60 pct majority find takeovers
harmful, the poll found. Shareholder benefit is the most
commonly cited advantage of such takeovers.
    "People are saying that (those engineering hostile
takeovers) might talk about getting the stockholders a better
break, but they are really not interested in that as much as
they are realizing gains for themselves," concluded the poll,
conducted for the University of North Carolina's Institute of
Private Enterprise.
    The poll said 78 pct believe most takeovers are engineered
by groups interested only in making a profit for themselves and
who don't care about the impact on employees or the economy as
a whole.
