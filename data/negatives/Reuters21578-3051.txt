Chrysler Corp said over the next two
years it will phase out production at its Indianapolis
Electrical Plant, which currently employs 975 hourly hourly and
salaried workers.
    The company said that its recently concluded study
indicated the plant, now operating at less than 50 pct
capacity, could not be competitive in an increasingly
competitive automotive market in the production of
electro-mechanical automotive components.
