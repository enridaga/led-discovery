Sri Lanka's external debts rose to
83.84 billion rupees in November from 83.23 billion in the
previous month and 67.28 billion in November 1985, the Central
Bank said in its monthly bulletin said.
    The rise was due mainly to increases in commodity loans
from aid donor countries to 27.39 billion from 26.96 billion
and 22.34 billion in the previous corresponding months.
    International reserves fell to 9.99 billion rupees in
November from 10.29 billion and 12.59 billion.
