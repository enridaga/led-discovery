Pan Am Corp's Pan Am World Airways said
it began hiring pilots and flight engineers for the first time
in 19 years.
    The need for about 130 to 150 new pilots has been created
by the Pan AM shuttle, it said.
    Processing of applicants began March 30 and the first class
of new-hire pilots will begin training on APril 15.
    Pan Am said it also completed the recall of more than 250
pilots. Most of the new hires will begin as flight engineers,
but as many as 50 will move directly into the first officer
position, it said.
