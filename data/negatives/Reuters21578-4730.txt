Yugoslav trade union leaders are
touring the country in an attempt to quell a wave of strikes
following a partial wages freeze, official sources said.
    Eyewitnesses in the northern city of Zagreb reported far
more police on the streets than normal after the city and areas
nearby experienced the biggest wave of strikes in the country
in recent memory.
    National newspapers in Belgrade have given few details of
the strikes. But Zagreb papers said thousands of workers went
on strike and thousands more were threatening action over pay
cuts.
    Official sources said there were also strikes at a Belgrade
medical centre, a food factory in Sambor, and enterprises in
Nis, Leskovac and Kraljevo, as well as other towns.
    They said national union officials were travelling
throughout the country to speak to meetings in an attempt to
restore calm.
    But trade union leaders were avoiding making statements to
the press and had not made their stand on the strikes clear.
    Western diplomats said the strikes appeared to be
spontaneous and without any unified orchestration.
