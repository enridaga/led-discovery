U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said the U.S. opposes Soviet membership of the World Bank or
the International Monetary Fund.
    Baker told a House foreign affairs subcommittee, "I think
our position is absolutely clear on that ... We do not support
and will not support Soviet membership in the World Bank or the
IMF."
    Baker said the U.S. position was "unqualified and
unconditional."
    Baker was responding to a questioner who noted that World
Bank President Barber Conable has in the past suggested future
Soviet membership could take place.
