The government-owned &lt;Kowloon-Canton
Railway Corp> is planning a new line to link up the existing
railroad with the new light rail system now under construction,
a company spokeswoman said.
    She said the 14.9-kilometre link will connect the two
independent lines in the northern part of the suburban area
near the China border. It is not yet decided whether a light
rail system or a conventional system will be used for the link.
    The link, which will take about 3-1/2 years to complete, is
expected to cost 1.26 billion H.K. Dlrs, she said.
    The spokeswoman said the final decision on the link is up
to the government, depending on the government's overall
transport and development policy.
    She said consultancy studies commissioned by the company
show that by 1996 the new link will carry 137,100 passengers
daily and generate an additional 50,000 passengers in the
conventional railway system.
