The Zeebrugge ferry disaster, in which
around 200 people drowned seven weeks ago, was almost certainly
caused by the ship leaving port with its bow doors wide open, a
British government inquiry was told.
    Lawyer David Steel, representing the government, told the
opening session of a public inquiry into the March 6 tragedy
that this was "the only tenable explanation."
    The ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, is owned by
Townsend Thoresen, part of P and O's &lt;PORL.L> subsidiary
European Ferries Group.
    Steel, commissioner of wrecks for England and Wales, said
the inquiry would probably conclude that the ferry capsized in
calm seas and fair weather a mile outside the Belgian port when
water poured into the car deck.
    "We think you will also conclude that the immediate cause of
that was that the doors were open, he said.
    Steel told the tribunal it appeared no attempt was made to
close either the inner or outer bow doors prior to what should
have been a routine voyage to the English port of Dover,
despite a provision in the ship's "Stability Booklet" that the
doors were to be closed and kept closed.
