Provincially-owned Hydro-Quebec said
it had no obligation to supply electricity to other Canadian
provinces if it could sell it at a higher price to Americans.
    The utility told a National Energy Board hearing that U.S.
utilities generally offer higher prices for electricity than
those in Canada because the Americans want firm energy
supplies.
    Hydro-Quebec is seeking regulatory approval to sell 70
billion kilowatt hours of firm power a year to the New England
power pool over 10 years starting in 1990. Utilities in
Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland oppose the sale.
