The U.S. Treasury said it will sell
12.8 billion dlrs of three and six-month bills at its regular
auction next week.
    The March 30 sale, to be evenly divided between the three
and six month issues, will result in a paydown of 1.2 billion
dlrs as maturing bills total 13.99 billion dlrs.
    The bills will be issued April 2.
