Dun and Bradstreet Corp said business
failures in February increased 10.8 pct, to 5,390, from 4,864
in February 1986.
    "The national level of business failures continues to be
driven upward by substantial increases in the oil and
agricultural states," Dun said.
    Dun said that of the nine U.S. Bureau of the Census
regions, three reported a decrease in the number of failures
and two had gains of less than 3.0 pct.
    The largest increase was reported in the West South Central
states, Dun said, with business failures rising 47.8 pct, to
1,218.
    The East South Central states posted a 44 pct rise, to 298,
Dun said, while the West North Central states recorded a 27.3
pct gain, to 489.
    The greatest decline, Dun reported, was registered by the
Middle Atlantic states, down 8.2 pct in February, to 324.
    The Pacific states also reported a large decline in failing
businesses, off 6.8 pct, to 1,028, Dun said.
    In the smokestack region of the East North Central states,
there was a negligible decline of 0.6 pct, to 794, Dun said.
    Dun said the Mountain states recorded a gain in business
failures of 1.5 pct, to 530.
    Business failures in the New England states rose 23.5 pct,
to 105.
    By industry segment, Dun said the largest gain was recorded
by the agricultural, forestry and fishing sector, up 62.7 pct,
to 345.
    Year to date, Dun said business failures rose to 11,004, an
increase of 5.3 pct over 1986.
