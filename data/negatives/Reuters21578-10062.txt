A seven-year credit facility for Salomon
SA, the French ski bindings and boots maker, will have a
facility fee of 7.5 basis point, banking sources said.
    The financing involves a 75 mln dlr euro-commercial paper
program which will be supported by a 75 mln dlr committed
syndicated revolving credit. Morgan Guaranty Ltd is the
arranger.
    Drawings on the revolving credit will be at a margin of 10
basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
Banks are being invited to join at 7.5 mln dlrs for 10 basis
points and at five mln dlrs for eight basis points.
