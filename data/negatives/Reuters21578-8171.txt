Showboat Inc said the play
money opening of gambling at its Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat
Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center has been delayed pending the
receipt of regulatory approvals.
    Gambling with play money was to have started tomorrow. A
company spokesman said Showboat must still receive its
certificate of occupancy, after which the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission needs about 48 hours to set up for the
trial-run gambling. After the trial run, Showboat is required
by commission regulations to run at least one day of low-limit
betting.
    The spokesman said, however, that Showboat still expects to
start normal gaming operations on April 3 as scheduled.
