Negotiations between mining
companies and the National Union of Mineworkers are foundering
and mines could face a May Day work stoppage, the Chamber of
Mines said.
    It said the union had called off talks on a specific issue,
the introduction of a Labour Day on May 1.
    The union refused a request to give advance notification of
the names of workers who would be working on May 1 rather than
taking the option of a paid holiday, the Chamber said.
    It said mining companies wanted advance notice in order to
plan their operations.
    "The union is adamant only employees who wish to work on
Labour Day should notify management," the Chamber said.
    "This raises the prospect that the mines will once again
face stay-away action on May 1 and that the employees who do
not work will once again forfeit pay."
    It said the union accepted all the proposals except giving
advance notification for May 1.
    It said miners had been offered a full paid holiday on May
1 or a premium of six pct of their basic monthly pay for
working that day.
