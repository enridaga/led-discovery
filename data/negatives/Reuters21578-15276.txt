Taiwan's unemployment rate fell to 2.03
pct of the labour force in March from 2.37 pct in February and
2.79 pct in March 1986, the government statistics department
said.
    A department official said the decline was due to rising
employment in the manufacturing sector, including textiles and
footwear.
    The unemployed totalled 163,000 in March against 193,000 in
February and 216,000 in March 1986.
