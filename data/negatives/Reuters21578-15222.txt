Molecular Genetics Inc said
it has held preliminary discussions with a privately-held
company convening a possible acquisition.
    "No agreement in principle has been reached, and serious
negotiations on material terms have not begun," said Robert
Auritt, acting co-chief executive officer and co-president.
    Molecular said it would have no further comment on the
matter until an agreement in principle is reached or
discussions are terminated.
