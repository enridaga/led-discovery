Hyundai Auto Canada Inc, wholly owned
by the South Korean concern, said it recalled 126,524 cars for
inspection of a mechanism that may cause the hood to open
without warning while the vehicle is in motion.
    The company said the voluntary recall affects Hyundai Pony
cars sold in Canada and produced before Dec 4, 1986.
    Hyundai models sold in the United States and other
countries are not affected by the recall.
