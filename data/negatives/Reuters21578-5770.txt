Harley-Davidson Inc said it is
petitioning the International Trade Commission to lift import
taxes on Japanese motorcycle manufacturers.
    Harley-Davidson said it no longer needed tariff relief to
compete with the Japanese. It said President Reagan imposed the
tariff in April 1983 after Harley-Davidson convinced the
administration the Japanese were eroding the U.S. motorcycle
industry by flooding the market with its own models.
    Harley-Davidson said it has increased its market share of
the heavyweight motorcycle to 19.4 pct in 1986 from a record
low 12.5 pct in 1983.
