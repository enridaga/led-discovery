Technimed Corp said it has received
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market its
proprietary whole blood glucose test.
    The company said the test is the first home diagnostic
glucose test to be approved by the FDA that uses simpler
no-wipe technology. It is designed for use by diabetics in
managing insulin therapy.
    Technimed said it has entered into talks with "several
major pharmaceutical companies" on the marketing of the test.
