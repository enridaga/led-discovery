Den Danske Bank of Denmark is raising
200 mln dlrs through a programme of short and medium term
euro-certificates of deposit, arranger London-based Salomon
Brothers International Ltd said in a statement received here.
    Signing takes place today and the first issuance, of
maturities from seven days to five years, should take place
later this month. Denominations would be 500,000 and one mln
dlrs, and similar amounts in sterling and other currencies.
    Aside from the London branch of Den Danske and the
arranger, other dealers in the programme would be the Swiss
Bank Corp International and S.G. Warburg and Co Ltd.
    Salomon said the principal paying agent for the CDs would
be Bankers Trust Co.
    Den Danske's U.S. Domestic commercial paper program is
rated A1 by Standard and Poor's, and P-1 by Moody's rating
agency, Salomon said.
