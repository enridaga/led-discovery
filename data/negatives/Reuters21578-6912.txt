President Reagan accused the Soviet
Union of exceeding a traditional restrictive reading of the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty, but said the U.S. Saw no
reason yet to follow suit.
    "We believe that the Soviet Union has been going even beyond
a liberal interpretation of the treaty," he said at a news
conference.
    There has been speculation the U.S. Administration was
moving toward a looser reading of the treaty in order to permit
the development of the "Star Wars" anti-missile system, but
Reagan said no decision has yet been made.
