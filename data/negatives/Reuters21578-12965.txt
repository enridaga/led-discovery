Lac Minerals Ltd's exploration spending
will rise this year to 25 mln dlrs from 16.3 mln dlrs last
year, the company said in its annual report.
    The 1987 budget involves 16 mln dlrs for advanced
exploration on a tin project in New Brunswick, Bousquet mine
number two in Quebec and the Ortiz property in New Mexico, and
nine mln dlrs for pure exploration.
    Total capital and exploration spending will rise to about
130 mln dlrs from 98 mln dlrs last year, with 77 mln dlrs of
the 1987 amount set for the Page-Williams mine in Hemlo,
Ontario, Lac said.
    Lac's total 1986 gold production rose to 478,394 ounces
from 265,925 ounces the previous year. Production excluding
Page-Williams eased to 245,232 from 255,556 ounces in 1985.
