Finance Minister Dilson Funaro,
currently on a global tour to seek governmental support for his
efforts to solve Brazil's 108 billion dlrs foreign debt crisis,
said creditors have expressed willingness to help.
    In an interview with the Globo television network,
transmitted from Rome, Funaro said he had proposed a "four-year
plan" to the creditors, which would include a rescaling of the
commitments derived from its debt.
    After visiting the U.S., England, France, West Germany,
Italy and Switzerland, Funaro is now on his way to Tokyo, where
he is to arrive on Sunday for talks with Japanese government
officials as well as private bankers.
