Vista Chemical Co said it plans to file
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in early covering the sale of about 4.5 mln shares
of its common stock to the public.
    The shares will be sold by institutional investors who
partially financed the company upon its formation in 1984 and
by the trustee of its savings and investment plan on behalf of
employee participants.
    None of the shares will be sold by the company, it said.
