President Francesco Cossiga meets political
leaders to discuss how to form a new government following the
resignation of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.
    Craxi's Socialist Party has said it will not serve under
Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been prime minister
five times previously and whom the majority Christian
Democratic Party has said it wants to take on the job again.
    The Socialist Party, the second biggest in the outgoing
five-party coalition, said it would accept only Ciriaco De
Mita, Christian Democratic Party secretary, or the party's
president, Arnaldo Forlani, for the job of prime minister.
    Political sources said talks are likely to be difficult and
could take several days due to rivalry between the two leading
parties. In Craxi's 3-1/2 years as prime minister, the
Christian Democrats have become increasingly irritated at being
denied the prime minister's job. The sources said early general
elections are likely unless agreement can be reached.
    Cossiga is due to meet former presidents before holding
talks with party leaders, including the opposition Communists
and the junior coalition members -- Republicans, Liberals and
Social Democrats.  After the consultations, Cossiga will name a
prime minister-designate who will try to form a government.
