U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz said the Marines spy case had cast a "heavy shadow" over
his scheduled talks in Moscow next week.
    "Unfortunately, as is so often the case when we are in the
midst of potentially promising discussions with the Soviets,
the discussions take place in a difficult environment generated
by their actions, and these things cast a heavy shadow on our
discussions," he told reporters.
