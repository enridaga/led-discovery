Gulf States Utilities Co said it
asked the Public Utility Commission of Texas to remove a
condition that it secure a line of credit before the emergency
rates can be put into effect in the Texas service area.
    The commission granted it a 39.9 mln dlrs interim rate
increase February five, contingent upon Gulf States obtaining a
250 mln dlr line of credit.
    A motion for rehearing will be considered at as commission
meeting on March 11, it said. Gulf States said it is concerned
the credit line requirement will give potential lenders an
advantage that would be damaging to the company.
