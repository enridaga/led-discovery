World sugar futures tumbled early when
sell stops were triggered at 6.60 and 6.55 cents basis the spot
contract, traders said.
    Spot May dropped 0.27 cent to 6.52 cents a lb. It opened at
6.72 cents.
    Trade houses worked both sides of the market, analysts
said.
    The decline may have been a continued reaction to the
market's inability yesterday to breach resistance around 6.93
cents basis May, which unsettled traders, analysts said.
    The market should draw support from buying tenders slated
for tomorrow and Saturday, they said.
