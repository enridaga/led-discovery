The White House called a compromise
budget hammered out by congressional Democratic leaders a
"pickpocket" spending plan, but barred negotiations on changing
it until budget reforms are in place.
    Noting that the trillion dollar budget would raise taxes by
65 billion dlrs over the next three years while scaling back
President Reagan's military spending proposals, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, "The president isn't buying it and
neither will the American people.
    "The Democrats refer to tax increases as deficit reduction
-- a pickpocket way to lift your wallet to pay for your dinner,"
Fitzwater said.
    The White House official, in an apparent retreat from an
earlier administration stance, also said negotiations on a
budget acceptable to Reagan and the Democratic-led Congress
could not begin until budget reforms are adopted.
    The White House has previously said it would not negotiate
on a budget until the congressional Democrats were able to
agree among themselves. Democratic leaders have called for a
"summit" conference with the White House on the budget.
    "If we had a budget reform package that ensured a sound,
enforceable negotiating process, we would be interested in
pursuing it, Fitzwater said.
