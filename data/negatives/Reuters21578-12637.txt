Oils and oilseeds traded quietly this
afternoon and price movements were marginally mixed.
    Dutch soyoil showed small gains with support coming from
early mark-ups in Chicago soyoil futures.
    Firm Argentine markets maintained levels in the
sunflowerseed oil section but palm oil tended to move off early
highs due to lack of buying support and the reported rejection
of rbd oil offers by Pakistan at its tender today.
    Demand for coconut oil and palm kernel oil faded and here
again early gains were pared.
    Dutch soyoil traded at 65.50 guilders for May, rising to 71
for Nov/Jan deliveries ex-mill while any origin sunflowerseed
oil sold at 346.50 dlrs for May/Jul and 357.50 for Aug/Oct call
ex-tank Rotterdam.
    No fresh trade was reported for coconut oil or palm kernel
oil and palm oil also met an idle afternoon.
    Among oilseeds, April deliveries of U.K. Rapeseed traded to
Boston, U.K. East coast, at 297 stg per tonne.
