The Soviet Union conducted an underground
nuclear test aimed at perfecting military technology, the
official news agency Tass reported.
    Tass said the test was carried out at 0120 gmt at the
Semipalatinsk testing ground in Kazakhstan, Soviet Central
Asia.
    It was the third Soviet underground blast since Moscow
halted an 18-month nuclear test moratorium last February,
saying Washington's refusal to join the ban had forced it to
resume testing.
