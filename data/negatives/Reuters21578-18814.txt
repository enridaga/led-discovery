Anchor Glass Container Corp said it
expects fourth quarter profits to exceed the 4.7 mln dlrs
reported for the third quarter and net income for the full year
will be about equal to or slightly exceed 1986's profit before
extraordinary items of 20.6 mln dlrs.
    For the first nine months, Anchor reported operating
profits of 16.2 mln dlrs, down from 17.8 mln dlrs in 1986.
    It said third quarter profits, which dropped from 8.3 mln
dlrs a year earlier, "were on target with management's earlier
expectations".
    The company had previously said it expected the August 13
purchase of Diamond-Bathurst Inc to reduce third quarter
earnings.
    It said third quarter earnings were also reduced by about
800,000 dlrs, or six cents a share, by a year-to-date revision
in the estimated annual effective tax rate as a result of the
acquisition.
