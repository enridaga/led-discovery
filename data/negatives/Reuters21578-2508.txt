Chief Soviet arms negotiator Yuli
Vorontsov said Soviet-American talks on cutting medium-range
nuclear missiles had made a breakthrough.
    Vorontsov said he expected a treaty would be ready for
signing within three to four months following the latest talks
in Geneva.
    He told a news conference here "all the elements point to
optimism" and only technical work on treaty language remained
outstanding.
