The Argentine government will ask
congress to declare a state of siege following a rebellion by
army officers objecting to human rights trials, official
sources said.
    Earlier, Army Chief of Staff Hector Rios Erenu said he
would use all the means at his disposal to put down the
rebellion. He relieved from their commands two colonels, one of
them at an airborne infantry regiment in Cordoba, centre of the
uprising.
    Argentine Army Chief of Staff Hector Rios Erenu said he
would begin moving troops for a possible military operation to
put down the almost three-day old rebellion.
    Interior Minister Antonio Troccoli said the government
would seek parliamentary approval of the state of siege "unless
there is something unexpected that justifies more urgent
treatment."
