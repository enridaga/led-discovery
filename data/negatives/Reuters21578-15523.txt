&lt;British Airport Services Ltd> (BAS) has
concluded an 18 mln yen contract with the &lt;Kansai International
Airport Co Ltd> for consulting work on the terminal at a new
airport to be built in western Japan, the airport company said
in a statement.
    The contract is the first to be awarded to a British
company and follows the award of a 200,000 dlr consultancy
contract to a division of the U.S-based &lt;Bechtel International
Corp> in consortium with six Japanese companies, a company
spokesman told Reuters. BAS is a subsidiary of &lt;BAA Plc>, the
former British Airports Authority.
    The six-billion dlr project to build the airport has been a
major source of friction with the U.S. And the European
Community who have put pressure on Japan to allow foreign
companies to compete with domestic firms in building it.
