Jefferson Bank said it plans to
offer shareholders the right to purchase additional common
shares at 80 pct of the closing bid price per share on the date
the offering starts, subject to a minimum of 9.25 dlrs per

by principal shareholder State Bancshares Inc.  Both the
investment and the rights offering are subject to State's
arrangement of financing and participation in the rights
offering.
