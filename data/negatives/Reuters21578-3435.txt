    The issue will be sold in denominations of 1,000 and 10,000

warrants which can be converted into 500 dlrs each at an
exchange rate of 1.86 marks. The exercise period runs from
April 8, 1987 until March 6, 1989.
    Fees total two pct, with 1-1/4 pct for selling and 3/8 pct

    Each 10,000 mark bond carries two warrants which can be

warrants for the 1,000 mark bonds, Deutsche said.
    The bond pays interest annually on March 25 and matures on
the same date in 1992. Payment date is also March 25.
