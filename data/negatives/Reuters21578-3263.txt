Los Angeles Securities Group said
the National Association of Securities Dealers intends to
delist its securities effective tomorrow because the NASD
believes that market-making sales of the company's securities
by its Los Angeles Securities brokerage subsidiary are not
being made under an effective registration statement.
    The company said it must demonstrate compliance with the
Securities Act of 1933, which requiresd the registration
statement, to avoid delisting.  It said it believes that the
NASD action is without merit and that an effective registation
stateement is in place.
    Los Angeles Securities said it is asking the NASD to stay
the delisting pending a review of the matter, consultation with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and a potential hearing
on the merits.  It said pending resolution of the matter, it
has ceased making a market in its own securities.
    The NASD has instituted similar actions against other
holding companies for broker/dealers that are quoted on its
NASDAQ system.
