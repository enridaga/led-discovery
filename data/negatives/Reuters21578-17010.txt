The South Korean government will shortly
issue a statement warning it will take unspecified emergency
measures if widespread protest demonstrations continue, state
radio said.
    Yesterday tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the
streets of Seoul and other cities, battling riot police and
demanding the resignation of President Chun Doo Hwan.
