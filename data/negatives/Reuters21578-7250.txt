The U.S. budget was in deficit 28.37
billion dlrs in February, up from a deficit of 24.58 billion
dlrs in February, 1986, the Treasury Department said.
    Last month's deficit compared with a January deficit of
2.17 billion dlrs. For the fiscal year to date, the budget was
in deficit by 93.92 billion dlrs, compared with 106.2 billion
dlrs in the previous fiscal year, the Treasury said.
    Outlays last month totaled 83.83 billion dlrs, more than
the 77.95 billion dlrs of outlays in February a year ago but
slightly down from 83.94 billion dlrs in January, the Treasury
said.
    Receipts were 55.46 billion dlrs last month, up from 53.37
billion dlrs in February, 1986, but down from 81.77 billion
dlrs in January.
