ICO Inc said its common stock
will be removed from trading on the American Stock Exchange
because it failed to meet certain exchange guidelines,
including net worth requirements.
    The company, which has been unprofitable for three out of
the last four years, said its stock will be delisted from the
AMEX on March 13 and will begin trading on the Boston Stock
Exchange on March 16.
