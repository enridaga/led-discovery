Unisys Corp introduced two new
mainframe computers, new workstations, and other products.
    The company said the V510 and V530 large-scale computers
offer up to a four-fold increase in performance over existing V
series.
    Customer deliveries of the new models, aimed at business,
government and financial markets, are planned for the fourth
quarter of 1987 and the first quarter of 1988.
    Base price of the V510 system is 950,000 dlrs and the V530
system is based priced at 1,775,000 dlrs, the company said.
    Speaking at a press conference, Joseph Kroger, Unisys vice
chairman, said the new product introductions are the first
concrete examples of the increased resources of the merged
Burroughs and Sperry.
    He said the company had exceeded its goal of cutting costs
by 150 mln dlrs in the first year after the merger, and reduced
debt by nearly two billion dlrs, more than the originally
expected 1.5 billion dlrs.
    In addition to the mainframes, Unisys introduced an
addition to its B25 family of desktop computer systems. The new
system, the B38, will make greater use of its Intel Corp &lt;INTC>
microprocessor using available software.
    The B38 is available for immediate delivery with a base
configuration price of 8,375 dlrs.
    The company also introduced new software products,
interconnect capabilities, and a laser printer.
