Logicon Inc said it received a
three-mln-dlr modification to its contract to develop cruise
missile simulation systems for the U.S. Air Force.
    The company said the modification brings the contract to
12.6 mln dlrs.
    In addition, a separate 500,000-dlr option may be exercised
after the basic simulation systems and software simulation are
delivered in September, 1988, it said.
