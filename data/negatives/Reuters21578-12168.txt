European Community unemployment fell
slightly in February to just under 17 mln from 17.1 mln in
January, the EC statistic's agency Eurostat said.
    It said the fall came despite a bad winter in most of the
EC when seasonal factors could be expected to have had a more
adverse effect.
    However, the agency added, the long-term trend was
virtually unchanged stating that compared to February 1986 the
number of registered unemployed increased by 222,000.
