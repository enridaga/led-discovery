A severe drought has affected 170,560
hectares of farmlands in six eastern and northeastern
provinces, Interior Permanent Secretary Pisarn Mulasartsathorn
said.
    He told reporters some 178,790 farming families in 45
districts in Chaiyaphum, Korat, Phrae, Chainat, Rayong and Trat
provinces were seeking relief water from the government.
    The official did not say what crops have been damaged.
    Senior Interior Ministry officials said this week the worse
than average drought this year has affected 14 provinces and
may last until early May.
