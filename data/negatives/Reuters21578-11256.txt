General Motors Corp will idle six of its
car assembly plants next week, temporarily laying off 21,600
workers, according to spokespersons for the company's groups.
    The automaker will shut three plants each in its two
groups--the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group and the
Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada group.
    The plants will be closed for a week starting August six
for inventory adjustment.
    Five of the plants are located in the United States. The
sixth is in Canada.
    The three Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac plants that will be
idled are located at Wentsville, Mo. (4,900 workers), the
Hamtramck plant in Detroit (3,000 workers) and the body
assembly plant in Flint, Mich. (2,500 workers).
    The Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada facilities to be shut
temporarily are located in North Tarrytown, N.Y. (3,500
workers), Pontiac, Mich. (1,600 workers) and Oshawa, Ont.
(6,100 workers).
    All of General Motors' truck and bus plants will be
operating next week, a spokesman for the truck and bus group
said.
