President Amin Gemayel named Sunni Moslem
Education Minister Selim Hoss as acting prime minister
following the assassination of Premier Rashid Karami, a
presidential palace statement said.
    "After consultations by President Amin Gemayel with
political and religious leaders the president decided to name
Selim Hoss as acting prime minister," said the statement
broadcast on local radio stations.
    Moslem leaders proposed Hoss, a former premier, as acting
prime minister after Karami died of injuries from a bomb that
exploded aboard his helicopter.
