Finance minister Manuel Azpurua said he
will visit Japan in mid-May to seek new credits for planned
expansion in Venezuela's state-owned aluminum, steel and
petrochemical industries.
    Azpurua told reporters he will be accompanied by central
bank president Hernan Anzola and director of public finance
Jorge Marcano.
    "The idea is to hold meetings with Japanese economic and
financial authorities, with the banks which have business and
credits in Venezuela and with some of the Japanese companies
already active here," Azpurua said.
    Azpurua said he was optimistic about the trip, in light of
Japan's recent announcement it will disburse 30 billion dlrs in
new credit to Latin American countries.
    "I think this trip is being taken at an opportune time and
will allow us to reveal the potencial which this country holds
for the Japanese economic community," Azpurua said.
    He would not say how much Venezuela will seek in credits
from Japan.
