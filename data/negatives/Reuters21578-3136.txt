New Zealand's total foreign debt
fell to 32.94 billion N.Z. Dlrs in the quarter end December 31
against 33.42 billion in the quarter end September 30, revised
from 33.12 billion dlrs, and 24.61 billion in the quarter end
March 1985, the statistics department said.
    The department began releasing quarterly figures in June
1986.
    It said in a statement Government Corporation foreign debt
in the December quarter fell to 5.86 billion against a 6.78
billion in the September quarter, revised from 6.63 billion and
5.25 billion in March quarter 1985.
    Private sector foreign debt fell to 5.75 billion dlrs from
5.89 billion, revised from 5.74 billion, and 5.45 billion in
March 1985.
    Government departments and Reserve Bank foreign debt rose
to 21.32 billion against 20.75 billion and 13.92 billion.
    Contributing to the total fall of 0.48 billion dlrs were
2.11 billion in net realised and unrealised exchange gains, a
result of an appreciation of the New Zealand dollar against
other currencies, the department said.
    The U.S. Dollar remained the predominant borrowing currency
for all three sectors in the economy at December 31.
