Algeria's Finance Minister Abdelaziz
Khelaf said no rescheduling of his country's foreign debt is
envisaged.
    Khelaf, who came to Geneva for a meeting organised by the
World Economic Forum, told Reuters Algerian debt amounted to
about one third of the country's Gross National Product of 55
billion dlrs.
    France and Algeria yesterday finalised two agreements
giving Algeria a total 580 mln dlrs in credits to finance trade
and projects.
