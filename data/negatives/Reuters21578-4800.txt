World Bank Vice-President David
Knox said the bank was eager to finance Argentine plans to
stimulate growth and that he was urging private banks to grant
new loans to the country.
    Knox said in an interview with the local daily La Nacion
yesterday that Argentina's current economic policies contained
key elements to stimulate growth and the World Bank was very
interested in financing its growth.
    "We are encouraging creditor banks to grant new loans to
make Argentine growth possible," said Knox, who arrived in
Argentina last Thursday.
