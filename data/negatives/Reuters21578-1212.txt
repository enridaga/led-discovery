The U.S. Treasury said it will sell
13.2 billion dlrs of three and six-month bills at its regular
auction next week.
    The March 9 sale, to be evenly divided between the three
and six month issues, will result in a paydown of 2.45 billion
dlrs as maturing bills total 15.65 billion dlrs.
    The bills will be issued March 12.
