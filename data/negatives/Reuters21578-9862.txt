United Auto Workers members
voted overwhelmingly to ratify a settlement in a four-day
strike against General Motors Corp's &lt;GM> truck and bus complex
here, a UAW official said.
    Workers agreed to a settlement that provided for a 1.3 mln
dlrs payment to workers by the No. 1 carmaker for an alleged
violation of a 1984 contract and for the rehiring of about 20
workers who were idled when their jobs went to subcontractors.
    Some 9,000 workers walked off their jobs at the bus and
truck plant on Thursday.
    Members of UAW Local 594 voted 1314 to 25 to accept the
settlement.
    Local president Donny Douglas said of the settlement, "We
got compensation for everything that went out."
    Workers alleged GM violated their contract by assigning
work traditionally done by the union to outside companies.
Local officials also said GM violated contract provisions on
health and safety issues, work rules, seniority and job
classifications.
    The local also said that GM had violated contract language
on work rules, seniority, job classification and health and
safety issues.
    A spokesman for GM's Truck and Bus Group said there would
be no company comment on the settlement's details, but said GM
was pleased that workers would be back on the job.
