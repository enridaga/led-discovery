A former account executive and
registered representative at Merrill Lynch Co Inc was charged
by a federal grand jury with diverting 8,400 dlrs of the
company's funds for his own use, according to court papers.
    Bentley Whitfield, 31, was accused by the Grand Jury of
mail fraud stemming from a scheme in which he deposited a check
payable to Merrill Lynch into a trading account that he opened
under a ficticious name.
    The grand jury found he withdrew 8,400 dlrs from the
account and used the money in a real estate deal. He faces a
maximum five years in jail and 1,000 dlr fine.
