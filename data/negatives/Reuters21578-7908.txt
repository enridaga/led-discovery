India launched its first
intercontinental-range rocket, the Press Trust of India
reported.
    The rocket blasted off from Sriharikota near Madras and 406
seconds later placed a 145 kg satellite in a 400 km earth
orbit. The satellite will carry out scientific missions.
    India put its first satellite launch vehicle into space in
1980. But this and a second rocket launched in 1983 were
classed in the below-intermediate range.
