NASA launched an Indonesian
communications satellite aboard a Delta rocket, marking the
first international payload to be put into orbit since the
Challenger disaster more than a year ago.
    The 43 mln dlr satellite, the Palapa B2-P, was launched as
the result of an agreement reached last year between President
Ronald Reagan and Indonesia's President Suharto when they met
on Bali.
