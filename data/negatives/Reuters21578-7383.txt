Malawi will impose a 15 pct "border tax" on
some overseas remittances and a five pct profit tax for local
branches of foreign firms to boost revenue and meet a projected
1987/88 budget deficit of 303 mln kwacha, the Malawi news
agency reported.
    Finance Minister Dalton Katopola, presenting the new
budget, said other measures would include raising surtax on
goods and services by five points to 35 pct and imposing duty
on luxury goods and tax on statutory bodies such as the Water
Board.
    Malawi's economy was expected to grow 2.3 pct this year, he
said.
