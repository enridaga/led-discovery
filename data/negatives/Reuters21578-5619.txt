Southwest Forest Industries Inc
said 344 members of the United Paperworkers International Union
went out on strike at the company's Snowflake, Ariz., paper
mill, temporarily halting operations at the newsprint and
linerboard facility.
    The mill, which employs 525 people, has an annual capacity
of 282,000 tons of newsprint and 159,000 tons of linerboard,
the company said.
    Southwest Forest also said it is continuing to negotiate
with the Internatinal Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whose
65 members are honoring the paperworkers' picket lines.
    The company said it intends to resume mill operations as
quickly as possible using salaried employees, union workers who
elect to work, contractors and newly hired replacements for the
striking workers.
