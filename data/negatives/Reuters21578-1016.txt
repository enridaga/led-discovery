American Telephone and
Telegraph Co said small businesses can win up to a 10 pct
discount on telephone equipment under a new program.
    According to the America's Choice Bonus Program, customers
that rent certain phone systems can earn credits each time they
pay their monthly or fixed term lease bills.
    The credits can be used in the purchase of ATT products,
including communications systems and the System 25 PBX, a
telephone switch for voice and data communications. Customers
will receive a 50 dlrs initial credit, and additions to their
account equivalent to 10 pct of their rental payments.
