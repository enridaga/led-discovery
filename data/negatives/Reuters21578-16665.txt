Aid donors to Indonesia pledged a
total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a
statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter
Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.
    The funds compare with 2.6 billion dlrs allocated at last
year's meeting and exceed the World Bank's recommendation for
the coming year, the statement said.
    "The Group commended Indonesia for having taken effective
steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," it said.
    The statement said Indonesia must take further steps toward
economic growth to create employment and called for policies
supporting growth of agriculture.
