China and Israel, which have no
diplomatic relations, discussed Middle East peace prospects and
related matters at a meeting in New York city, an Israeli
spokesman said.
    Taking part in the talks at an undisclosed location were
China's U.N. Representative, Ambassador Li Luye, and the
director-general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Abraham
Tamir.
    "It was in a U.N. Context rather than a bilateral context,
and one of a series of meetings being held with members of the
Security Council," Israeli U.N. Spokesman Eyal Arad said.
    The meeting, which dealt with "the peace process and related
matters," was held at Israel's initiative and was arranged by
the two countries' U.N. Missions, he added.
    While in New York, Tamir has conferred with a number of
U.N. Diplomats, including the representative of the Soviet
Union, with which Israel also has no diplomatic relations.
    Increasing attention has been focused in recent months on
prospects for a U.N.-sponsored Middle East peace conference
that would include the five permanent members of the Security
Council -- China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain
and France.
