Feeder Cattle futures advanced 0.20 to
0.30 cent at the start and posted new season's highs in April
through August and October before slipping to trade 0.10 cent
lower to 0.20 higher in latest trade.
    Futures ran up to new highs at the start on general demand
prompted by continued strong cattle fundamentals. Posting of
another 10 cent gain in the latest reported average feeder
steer price added to support, traders said.
    However, prices retreated on profit-taking following the
lead of other meat pits. Stotler notably sold April on the
decline, they said.
