Iraqi warplanes attacked and hit a
large "naval target" -- Baghdad's term for a tanker or merchant
vessel -- in the Gulf today, an Iraqi military spokesman said.
    He said the raid took place off the Iranian coast at 0600
gmt and all aircraft returned safely to base.
    Lloyds Shipping Intelligence earlier today said the Greek
bulk carrier Pamit, 84,137 tonnes dw, was attacked and hit in
the engine room this morning in the northern Gulf.
    It said all the crew were safe and tugs were heading to aid
the ship.
