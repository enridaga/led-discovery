Hybritech Inc said the U.S.
Supreme Court denied a petition by Monoclonal Antibodies Inc
asking the court to review the validity of a Hybritech patent.
    The patent covers a method of using monoclonal antibodies
in certain immunoassay tests to detect and monitor conditions
such as pregnancy, cancer and infectious disease.
    Hybritech sued Monoclonal in March 1984 for infringement of
its patent.
