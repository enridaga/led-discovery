421.50/422.00, dealers said.
    The market opened little changed at 421.90/422.40 but eased
during the morning as dealers traded on the gold/silver ratio,
selling gold and buying silver.
    Business was fairly light as trading in gold was
overshadowed by interest in silver.

on last night's close of 564.50/565.50.
