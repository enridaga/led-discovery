Xerox Corp has decided to stop selling
personal computers as standalone products, a company spokesman
said.
    The spokesman said "As a first priority, we're selling PC's
as part of preconfigured systems, mostly desktop publishing
systems, and not by themselves anymore."
    He said Xerox does not expect to take any material charge
from changing its marketing of personal computers.  He said for
the past five years, Xerox has sold most of its PC's as
components of larger systems.
    Another Xerox spokesman said the company actually stopped
selling personal computers alone on February 16 but never
announced the move.
