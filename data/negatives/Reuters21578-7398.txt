The French government said it would sign
a contract with &lt;Walt Disney Co> on Tuesday for the
construction of Europe's first Disneyland amusement park.
    A statement from the office of Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac said the project, which will cost some 12 billion
francs, would create up to 30,000 jobs and be built outside
Paris.
    Funding will be provided by a combination of bank loans,
preferential financing by the French state and private
investment. France has also agreed to invest two billion francs
to extend rail and road links.
