Whittaker Corp chairman and chief
executive officer Joseph Alibrandi said the company expects to
report operating profits in fiscal 1987 that exceed 1986
results of 41.5 mln dlrs.
    "We continue to expect fiscal 1987 operating profits for
the chemicals and technology segments to exceed the results
reported for 1986," Alibrandi said. Whittaker reported fiscal
1986 operating earnings for its chemical segment of 18.0 mln
dlrs, and for its technology segment of 23.4 mln dlrs.
    The company's fiscal year ends October 31.
    Earlier, Whittaker reported profits of 3.1 mln dlrs, or 37
cts a share, for the second quarter ended April 30, versus a
loss of 4.5 mln dlrs, or 35 cts a share in the same period last
