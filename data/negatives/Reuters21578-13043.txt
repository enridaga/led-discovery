Bangladesh is expected to draw up a 47
billion taka development plan for the 1987/88 fiscal year
beginning July 1, Finance Ministry officials said.
    This is a rise of six pct over the current year. They said
86.5 pct of the funds would come from foreign sources.
    Bangladesh will seek nearly two billion dlrs to be used for
development projects and imports in 1987/88 at a donors'
meeting in Paris later this month, the officials said.
