Alexander's Inc said that although no
proposal has been received, the company has been served with
several shareholder complaints challenging the 47-dlr-a-share
acquisition price under consideration by Donald Trump and
Interstate Properties.
    Alexander's chairman Robin Farks said that an announcement
made earlier this month indicated that no assurance could be
given that Trump and Interstate would reach any agreement
regarding an acquisition of the company, or what price might be
offered.
