Royale Airlines Inc said its
load factor for February was 42.9 pct, up from 42.6 pct the
same period last year.
    Royale said it recorded 4,180,000 revenue passenger miles
compared to 5,681,000 the same period the year before.
    Royale said it cut its available capacity 26 pct in
response to regional weaknesses, which resulted in a slightly
higher load factor this past month.
