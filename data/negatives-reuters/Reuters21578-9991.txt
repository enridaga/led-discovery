Martin Marietta Corp said it
signed an exclusive agreement with McDonnell Douglas Corp's
Tymnet Co for Tymnet to provide data communications services as
a member of its team bidding on the federal government's FTS
2000 telecommunications system.
    Tymnet is a unit of McDonnell's Information Systems Group.
    The government's FTS 2000 system will replace the current
one operated for federal agencies by the General Services
Administration. The GSA issued a request for proposals in
January, with responses due in June and selection of a
contractor scheduled by year end.
