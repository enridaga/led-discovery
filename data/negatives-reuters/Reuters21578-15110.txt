President Suharto's ruling Golkar party
appears to have made substantial gains with over 75 pct of the
votes counted in Indonesia's national elections.
    Figures released by the election commission showed Golkar
on target to take 70 pct of the vote.
    Provisional figures indicate that with results of 68.9 mln
ballots announced, Golkar had won 50.29 mln, the Moslem-based
United Development Party 10.93 mln and the nationalist
Democratic Party 7.69 mln.
    The total electorate is 94 mln and officials said they
thought about 90 pct of the votes had been counted.
