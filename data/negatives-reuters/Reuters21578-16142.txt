Rep. Jack Kemp, a conservative
Republican from New York, praised Federal Reserve Board
chairman-designate Alan Greenspan's calls for international
monetary reform.
    "Alan Greenspan has called for a fundamental reform of the
international monetary system, which is long overdue. The
challenge facing Mr Greenspan is to combine a commitment to
monetary reform with a policy for economic growth," Kemp said in
a statement.
    However, Kemp said he was disappointed Fed vice-chairman
Manuel Johnson was not to succeed Fed chief Paul Volcker.
