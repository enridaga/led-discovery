Forest fires in north-east China had
flared again, threatening settlements and virgin forests so far
untouched by the blaze, the official press said.
    The New China News Agency said eight new fires had been
discovered in the Inner Mongolia region and were rapidly
spreading north and west. It said rain forecast for the region
was expected to help contain them.
    The China Daily said fires near the town of Tahe to the
east had re-kindled and were moving towards nearby logging
camps. Soldiers have been called in to fight the blaze.
    The fires which began on May 6 have killed 191 people.
