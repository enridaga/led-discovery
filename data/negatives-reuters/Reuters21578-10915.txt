Tanzania will need about 1.2
billion dlrs of hard currency investment to support its
1987-1992 five-year plan which begins in July, Minister of
State for Finance Damas Mbogoro said.
    He told an economic planning seminar in the northern town
of Arusha yesterday that the new plan would concentrate on
rehabilitating Tanzania's existing infrastructure, with a
minimum of investment in new development projects.
    The aim is to boost agricultural production by five pct a
year and industrial output by 6.4 pct, he said.
