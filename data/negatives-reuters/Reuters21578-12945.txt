FOB U.S. gulf corn values were
slightly firmer as active gulf interest boosted gulf FOB and
CIF values today, exporters said.
    Loading programs and relatively slow country movement kept
gulf interest lively. There were indications that 50,000 tonnes
traded for August shipment at 20 cents over September, that
50,000 tonnes traded yesterday for June at 20-1/2 cents over
July, and that 25,000 tonnes of number three corn traded
yesterday off the Atlantic at 23 over May for May 1-20.
    Hard wheat offers were firm amid tight pipeline supplies.
    Dealers quoted the following afternoon FOB U.S. gulf
values, basis Chicago futures, except hard red winter wheat
basis Kansas City. (In cents per bushel)
