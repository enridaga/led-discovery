Data General Corp said it introduced
several new hardware and software products that link
International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM> and IBM-compatible
personal computers into mainframe and minicomputer systems.
    Data General said the products include three local area
networks that conform to industry standards. It said it is now
offering a Starlan network, which was originally introduced by
American telephone and Telegraph Co &lt;t>, a thin Ethernet and a
PC interface for the standard Ethernet.
   
    In addition, Data General said it will offer several
software packages for PC networks, including MS Net, a product
developed by Microsoft Corp &lt;MSFT.O> that allows PCs to share
printers, data files and other peripherals.
    The company said it also introduced a PC version of its
popular CEO office automation software.
    Data General said the new products allow computer users to
divide work among a collection of PCs and larger computers.
   
    "Data General is the first vendor to offer three different
local area networks for personal computer integration," said
Colin Crook, senior vice president of the company's
communications systems group.
    "We're really giving users freedom of choice with industry
standard products," added J. David Lyons, vice president of
group marketing.
    In addition to the new products, which were expected, Data
General announced a joint product development agreement with
&lt;Gold Hill Computers>, a Cambridge, Mass.,-based artificial
intelligence software company.
   
    The company also announced the formation of a new network
services group that will help customers plan and design
computer networks.
    The group will also provide service and maintenance for
Data General and other vendors' equipment, the company said.
