May Department Stores Co said sales
for March rose 3.5 pct to 885.4 mln dlrs from 855.2 mln dlrs
for the five-week period ended April 4.
    It said a major factor in March was the absence of Easter
sales, which will be three weeks later this year than last
year.
    For the first two months of fiscal 1987 sales were 1.52
billion dlrs, up eight pct from 1.40 billion dlrs a year ago.
