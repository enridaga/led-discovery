India plans to export about 280 mln
kilos of tea a year by 1990, up from estimates of 202 mln in
1986 and 220 mln in 1985, Minister of State for Commerce Priya
Ranjan Dasmunsi told Parliament.
    Bad weather reduced domestic tea output in 1986 causing a
shortfall in exports. To boost exports the government recently
introduced higher cash compensatory support on packet tea,
excise tax rebate of 50 paise per kilo of bulk tea, full rebate
of excise duty on packet tea exports and exemption of customs
duty on filter paper used in making tea bags, he said.
