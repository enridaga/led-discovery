USX Corp said its USS division and
Inland Steel Corp are continuing to pursue plans to construct a
plant devoted to the continuous pre-painting of steel coils.
    The company said the proposed facility will primarily serve
the appliance market and will have a capacity of 250,000 to
300,000 tons yearly.
