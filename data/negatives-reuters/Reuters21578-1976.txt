Best Products Inc said sales for
the four weeks ended February 28 were off 12.7 pct to 111.3 mln
dlrs from 127.6 mln dlrs a year before, excluding sales from
catalog stores and Ashby's Ltd outlets that were closed or sold
last year.
    The company said in an effort to improve gross margins, it
significantly cut promotional activity in February from a year
earlier.  In addition, it said it distributed its spring
catalog nationwide in February last year and will distribute it
in March this year.
