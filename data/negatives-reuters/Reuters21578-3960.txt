The financial institutions
subcommittee of the House Banking Committee postponed
indefinitely a session to draft legislation on the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp, FSLIC.
    The mark-up session was postponed after Democrats on the
subcommittee failed in a caucus to agree on several issues,
including the size of a financial rescue package for FSLIC, a
committee staff member said.
    On Tuesday, the Senate Banking Committee passed a bill to
recapitalize FSLIC at 7.5 billion dlrs over two years.
