North Central Laboratories Inc said
it has had preliminary discussions with MikroMed Inc about
providing laboratory testing services to screen the presence of
the AIDS virus.
    It said MikroMed is developing a kit which it would
distribute to its customers and which would be used by its
customers to draw samples of their own blood. These samples
would be mailed to a laboratory facility for AIDS screening.
