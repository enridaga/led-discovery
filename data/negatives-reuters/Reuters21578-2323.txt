The Reagan administration issued a
formal statement to Congress designed to free the remaining 40
mln dlrs in 1987 aid for the U.S.-backed "Contra" rebels in
Nicaragua.
    The aid is the last instalment of 100 mln dlrs voted by
Congress for the Contras, and is to be spent on major military
equipment. Congress now has 15 days to disapprove of the 40 mln
dlrs.
    White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: "We think the
prospects for approval are very good."
    The long-awaited administration move followed by one day
President Reagan's speech to the nation on a report on the
secret Iran arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to the
contras.
    In the House of Representatives earlier today, Rep. David
Bonior, a Michigan Democrat, told reporters Democratic leaders
in the House had decided to push for a 180-day moratorium on
further aid. He said the House would vote next Wednesday.
