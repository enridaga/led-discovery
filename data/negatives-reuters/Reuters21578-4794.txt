Finns cast their final votes in
two-day general elections today with opinion polls predicting a
swing to the right which would bring the conservatives back
into government after 21 years in the political wilderness.
    Turnout on the first day yesterday, about five pct lower
than in 1983 polls, was lowest in leftist strongholds around
the capital Helsinki, electoral officials said today.
    Finnish media said this supported pre-election opinion
polls predicting falling among voters for the Social Democratic
Party of Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa. Several days of
inter-party bargaining are expected before a new government
emerges.
