Le Matin, the French-language tabloid
launched here in February, said it is shutting down its
operations because it can no longer get financing.
    The paper, launched by private investors, was Montreal's
fourth French-language newspaper and was aimed at readers with
above average incomes and educations. It had a daily
circulation of about 20,000 copies.
    Le Matin was printed and distributed by (Southam Inc)'s
Montreal Gazette newspaper. A Gazette spokesman said his
newspaper is Le Matin's biggest creditor but he declined to
reveal the amount of debt
    Acting publisher Jean-Pierre Bordua said the newspaper's
bank blocked its lines of credit after three of the paper's
senior managers resigned Friday.
