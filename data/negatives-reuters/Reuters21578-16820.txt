received a 10 mln dlr credit facility from Manufacturers and
Traders Trust Co of Buffalo, N.Y.
    It said the new credit would replace an existing 4.4 mln
dlr line with Barclays PLC &lt;BCS.L>, and due to more favorable
interest rates, borrowing costs should be significantly

acquisition, possibly outside its plasma and serum field, by
year-end.
