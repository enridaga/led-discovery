Qatar will today take over the franchise of
Cable and Wireless Plc (CAWL.L) in the emirate through the
newly-created Qatar General Telecommunications Corporation
(QTELC).
    Cable and Wireless, which has operated in Qatar since 1951,
will second expert staff and provide technical and computer
services under agreements signed with QTELC.
    Cable and Wireless manager Colin Davies told Reuters
"Basically we have been here in a franchise situation for the
last 36 years and the government has now decided they want to
have a bigger role and that is, of course, a sovereign right."
