National Semiconductor
Corp's National Advanced Systems unit said it is accelerating
the delivery schedule for the two most powerful models of its
AS/XL series mainframe processors because of growing customer
demand.
    The company said the AS/XL 90 and AS/XL 100, which had been
scheduled for general availability in the third quarter, will
now be available in the second quarter.
    National Advanced Systems also announced a new 7480
cartridge tape subsystem which uses 18 track compact tape
cartridges.
