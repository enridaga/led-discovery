Platinum futures were higher at
midsession as the precious metal continued to mirror the action
in the nearby silver pit, analysts said.
    Silver was trading in the upper end of the day's wide
range, bolstered by speculative buying on a belief that it
would continue to rise toward seven dlrs an ounce basis May.
    The key July platinum delivery traded at 571.50 dlrs an
ounce, up 2.90 dlrs but under a session high of 577.50 dlrs.
Other months were 3.70 to 7.30 dlrs higher.
    However, trading was thin as many participants watched the
foreign exchange and U.S. stock and bond markets.
    Meanwhile, palladium was up 70 cts to 2.20 dlrs in
sympathetic buying to platinum.
