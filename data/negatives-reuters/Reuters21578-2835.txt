A Stockholm court today appointed a
bailiff to find the founder of troubled Swedish biotech group
Fermenta AB &lt;FRMS.ST>, who is being sued for 30 million crowns
by a disgruntled shareholder.
    The court heard that Refaat el-Sayed, sacked from the
Fermenta board after losing his principal shareholding to
creditors, had failed to reply to an official court notice
about the action which was sent to him two weeks ago.
    The bailiff was appointed to find el-Sayed and gain an
official response to the court notice within the next
fortnight.
