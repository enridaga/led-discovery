Gleason Corp's subsidiary,
Gleason Power Systems, said its Torsen torque-sensing
differential will be supplied as standard equipment in the new
Audi 90 Quattro four-wheel drive vehicle.
    Initial Torsen differential production for the new Audi 90
will not affect earnings in 1987, Gleason said.
    The Audi Quattros 80 and 90 models will be introduced in
the U.S. in late 1987, the company said.
