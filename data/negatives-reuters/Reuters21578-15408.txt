Occidental Petroleum Corp said a
group in which it is a participant discovered oil in the
offshore Norwegian North Sea Block 9/2-1 exploratory well.
    The well tested at a maximum rate of 6,800 barrels of 39
degree API gravity oil and 918 thousand cubic feet of gas
through a 3/4 inch choke. The well, the first to be drilled on
the block, was drilled in about 320 feet of water to a total
depth of 12,228 feet subsea.
    Occidental has a 10-pct stake in the 136,067-acre block
operated by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which
holds a 50 pct interest.
