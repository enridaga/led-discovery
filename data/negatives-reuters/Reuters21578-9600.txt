Oakite Products Inc said
it intends to sell its personal care and beauty product
business, Paula Payne Inc.
    Oakite said it plans to retain Paula Payne's warehousing
and production facilities in Charlotte, N.C., for use by its
Mlaire Manufacturing subsidiary. Paula Payne was acquired from
Riegel Textile in 1985 to expand Oakite's aerosol manufacturing
and warehousing capabilities into the Southeast.
