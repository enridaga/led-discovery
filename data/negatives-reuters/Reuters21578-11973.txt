Nissan Motor Corp said it is
raising the suggested retail price for its cars and trucks sold
in the United States by 1.9 pct, or an average 212 dlrs per
vehicle, effective April 6.
    The company said the increase is the result of the
continued strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S.
dollar.
