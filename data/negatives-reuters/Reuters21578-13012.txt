Simex currency futures eased in early
dealings, after a higher opening in quiet and cautious trading,
dealers said.
    They said operators were unwilling to take large positions
ahead of the expected group of seven ministers meeting in
Washington today.
    Participants also were cautious because of persistent Bank
of Japan dollar buying intervention, with dollar supportive
comments by Federal Reserve chairman and Japan's Finance
Minister having little impact, dealers said.
    June mark eased to around 0.5500 dlrs from a 0.5510 opening
and Chicago's 0.00501 and yen to 0.006910 against 0.006920 and
0.006913. About 200 lots of mark and 65 lots of yen were
traded.
    June Sterling was indicated at 1.6075/85 dlrs against
Chicago's 1.6080 with no business seen in the first trading
hour.
    Speculative buying helped Nikkei Stock Average Index
futures to firm in early trading, after a lower opening
following weaker New York stock market. June firmed  to 22,920
from a 22,550 low and 22,895 here yesterday with about 400 lots
exchanged.
    Gold futures remained idle. REUTER
