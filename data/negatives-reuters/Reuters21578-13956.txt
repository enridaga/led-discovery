The House of Seagram, Seagram Co Ltd's
U.S. marketing arm for Joseph E. Seagram and Son's distilled
spirits and wine coolers, said it is replacing its four current
national spirits companies with a single sales force, one
marketing unit and a centralized finance and administrative
function.
    Effective May four, House of Seagram said its sales force
will operate nationally through seven, equal-sized regions,
five in open states and two in control states, Seagram said.
    The change reflects a more aggressive marketing and sales
focus on the local level, the company said.
    A vice president-general manager will head each region,
reporting to Jerome Mann, executive vice president, Seagram
said, adding that Sales, Seagram Distillers, 375 Spirits,
Perennial Sales and Summit Sales will cease to exist as
companies.
    "We will no longer have individual spirits companies, the
resulting internal competition for distributor and retailer
attention or centalized decision making on virtually all
issues," Edgar Bronfman, House of Seagram president, said.
    Seagram said the group that markets Seagram's line of wine
coolers, the be caled the Seagram Beverage Co, will not be
affected by the reorganization.
    The company added that Seagram Beverage will remain inside
the House of Seagram, but separate from the spirits unit.
