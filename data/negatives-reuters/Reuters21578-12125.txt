The White House denied a report that
the United States was continuing to ship arms or
weapons-related equipment to Iran, but an administration
official said there had been non-weapons sales to Tehran
through commercial channels.
    "To the best of our knowledge, there have been no illegal
sales from the forbidden munitions list," a White House
spokesman said.
    The Defence Department also denied any military supplies
had been sent to Iran since an administration ban late last
year.
    NBC television, quoting U.S. And foreign intelligence
sources, reported that the United States had been shipping
weapons-related equipment to Iran as recently as last month.
    The administration official, who asked not to be named,
told Reuters there had been commercial sales of products
licensed by the Commerce Department, which maintains a list of
products that can be exported without hurting national
security.
    President Reagan banned arms shipments to Tehran after the
Iran arms scandal broke last November.
    In January Secretary of State George Shultz told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee there would be "no more transfers of
U.S.-origin military equipment to Iran, either directly or
through third parties."
    The NBC report said the Pentagon was coordinating shipments
of anti-aircraft command and control equipment used to direct
fire of weapons systems.
    It said some shipments labelled "machine parts" had moved
through Ostend, Belgium,on aircraft of the Santa Lucia Airways,
which it identified as operated by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA). The CIA refused to comment.
    NBC said the equipment was flown to Pakistan and then on to
Iran by Pakistani civilian and military aircraft.
    Later, State Department spokeswoman Sondra McCarty said: "We
categorically deny that the United States is selling and/or
sending any weapons to Iran." She added that Washington was "not
doing anything in connection with the government of Iran which
is not consistent with U.S. Laws or trade policy."
    Another administration official, who asked not to be
identified, told Reuters the United States had licensed
commercial sales of low-technology computer equipment to Iran,
amounting to about 60 mln dlrs over the last three years.
