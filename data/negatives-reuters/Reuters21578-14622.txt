World Airways said it laid off
an additional 103 employees in its contract maintenance
operation at Oakland.
    Over the past five weeks, the company previously laid off
274 maintenance employees.
    The layoffs resulted from declines in current and projected
maintenance work, which the company provides principally for
other air carriers.
    World Airways said it cannot rule out additional layoffs,
as it explores a range of alternative for its contract
maintenance operation.
