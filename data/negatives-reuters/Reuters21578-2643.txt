Airgas Inc said chairman and
chief executive officer C Perkins resigned but agreed to serve
as a consultant on acquisitions and foreign sales.
    The company said Perkins, under a five year consulting
contract, will work closely with his designated successor,
president Peter McCausland. McCausland is expected to be
appointed chairman at a board meeting in May, it added.
