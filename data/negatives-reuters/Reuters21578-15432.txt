China's total wage bill for state
employees grew too fast in the first quarter, because of
excessive bonuses, allowances and overtime pay, the official
Economic Information newspaper said.
    It said the total wage bill in the period was 38.7 billion
yuan, an increase of 16.7 pct over the first quarter of 1986,
when the bill grew a year-on-year 16.3 pct. The increase
accounted for 39.6 pct of planned wage rises in all of 1987.
    It said bonus payments rose a 42.6 pct, far in excess of
growth in productivity. Industrial output grew a 14.1 pct in
the period.
    The newspaper said state allowances rose in the period by
20 pct over the corresponding 1986 quarter, with some areas and
work units increasing coal and electricity allowances on their
own without proper authorisation.
    It said overtime pay rose a year-on-year 32 pct, with some
enterprises ignoring official regulations in their payments.
