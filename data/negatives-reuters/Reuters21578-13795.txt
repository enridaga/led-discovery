The Democratic-run House of
Representatives defeated on a 394 to 27 vote President Reagan's
1988 budget and planned to vote later on one written by House
Budget Committee Democrats.
    The defeat was expected. Republicans as well as Democrats
abandoned Reagan's budget for containing what they said were
unrealistic assumptions.
    Democratic leaders said they expected to pass the
committee's budget after considering two other alternatives,
but committee sources said the voting could be close.
