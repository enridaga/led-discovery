Gandalf Technologies Inc said it
introduced two new products, one of which allows its private
automatic computer exchange networking systems to connect
directly to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC>'s Unibus-equipped
computers.
    The company said its new VGS 2518 communications gateway
server provides a high capacity pathway for high speed
asynchronous data transfer between Unibus systems and Gandalf's
PACX 200 and PACX 2000 systems. Gandalf said it is the first in
a series of high bandwidth gateway servers it plans to
introduce this year.
    Gandalf said its other new product is the MUX 2000
multiplexing system, which offers a mix of voice and data
capabilities and allows users to select from among four Gandalf
multiplexing elements.
    The company said this flexibility will be attractive to
large users. "The larger the network, the more likely that
flexible multiplexing solutions are required," a Gandalf
statement said.
