Turnover in the U.K. Government bond
(gilt) market in February slipped to 81.25 billion stg from
January's 83.37 billion, although it was 165 pct higher than
the 30.63 billion in February 1986, the Stock Exchange said.
    The Stock Exchange noted, however, that turnover between
bond market-makers through the inter-dealer broker (IDB) screen
system, as distinct from business with outside clients, has
only been included from October 1986, meaning that prior data
is not strictly comparable with recent figures.
    The contribution to overall February, 1987 volume from IDB
 business was 43.10 billion stg, against 43.19 in January.
    In the 20 trading days of February, the average daily
volume of business was 4.06 billion stg, against an average of
3.97 billion in January, which had 21 trading days.
    Total Stock Exchange turnover for the month was 116.73
billion stg, marginally higher than the 116.65 billion recorded
in January but 129 pct more than the 50.92 billion of February
1986.
