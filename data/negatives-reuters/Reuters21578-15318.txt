The Bank of Japan intervened in the
market, buying a moderate amount of dollars around 137.80-85
yen, dealers said.
    Some dealers noted talk that the Bundesbank intervened here
directly buying dollars against marks, after reports that it
intervened through the Bank of Japan in the morning.
    The dollar moved up on short-covering aided by the central
bank intervention, they said.
