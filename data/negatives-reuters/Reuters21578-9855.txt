York Research Corp said it has
completed the arrangement of 11 mln dlrs of common stock to
European investors.
    York said it will use the 11 mln dlrs as a construction
pool to initially fund a series of cogeneration projects which
it willk design, build, partially own and operate, with six
projects already committed.  Gross revenues from the first six
projects are expected to exceed 500 mln dlrs over their life
cycle, York said, with revenue and income expected to start
flowing in 1988.  Each project consists of a 20-year energy
sale agreement, it said.
