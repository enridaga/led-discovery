Egypt has agreed to build two housing
estates and two new roads in Uganda worth a total of 295
million dollars, Egyptian commercial attache Muhammud el Tahan
said.
    He said Egyptian companies will build 8,000 housing units
in Kampala and reconstruct the roads between Fort Portal and
Bundibugyo near the Zaire border in western Uganda and between
Kapchorwa and Swam near Mount Elgon in the east of the country.
Uganda would repay 70 per cent of the Egyptian Government
credit to finance the projects in the form of barter goods and
30 per cent in hard currency, Tahan said.
