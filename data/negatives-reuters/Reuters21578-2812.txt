British Caledonian Airways said it has
filed an application with the British Civil Aviation Authority
for a license to operate between San Diego's Lindbergh Field
and London's Gatwick Airport.
    It said it would extend its existing Los Angeles/London
nonstop service to San Diego and would initially offer three
roundtrips weekly.
