Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called on
Americans to pressure Congress in the fight against acid rain
in what some observers said may represent a shift in Canada's
lobbying strategy with the United States.
    Mulroney told delegates to a North American wildlife
conference that he has not been pleased with the U.S.
administration's lack of speed in acting on the question, which
Canada sees, he said, "as a test of our relationship" with the
U.S.
    Mulroney and President Reagan endorsed a report by
specially appointed acid rain envoys last year. Last week, the
White  House asked Congress for 2.50 billion U.S. dlrs to fund
the acid rain fight.
    Mulroney described the commitment as "significant," but noted
it was a long time in coming.
    "We are geared up, tanked up and raring to go," Mulroney
said. "But I must tell you we were not happy with the pace with
which the U.S. administration moved to implement the
president's acceptance of the envoy report."
    The prime minister urged his mostly American audience to
help Canada take the fight to Congress, saying his government
is determined to fight on more than one front.
    "The campaign does not involve either or choices between the
administration on one hand and Capitol Hill on the other," he
said.
    The Canadian Coalition on Acid Rain hailed Mulroney's call
to take the battle to Congress.
    "It is clear that he has an understanding now that Congress
must be emphasized as equally as the administration," said
spokesman Michael Perley.
