The prospect of a dominant alliance of
socialists and environmentalists ended as the Social Democrats
became the biggest losers in Swiss parliamentary elections.
    Projections by Swiss radio show the ruling centre-right
alliance of Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social
Democrats and the People Party will likely hold on to power.
    Less than 48 pct of voters cast a ballot, a record low
turnout. The moderate left-of-centre Social Democrats lost six
of its previous 47 seats. The Green Party of Switzerland won 11
seats in the 200-seat lower house, a rise of eight. But the
Green Alliance and other green groupings lost one seat.
    The Radical Democrats, Christian Democrats, Social
Democrats and People Party are forecast to hold 159 seats, down
seven from the last election in 1983, and 42 of the 46 seats in
the upper house, down one.
    The projections showed the centre-right Radical Democrats
dropping four seats to 50 in the lower house, although they
would remain the largest party.
    The conservative Christian Democrats were seen losing one
seat to 41, while the right-wing People's Party, despite
forecast losses, added four to their previous 23 seats.
