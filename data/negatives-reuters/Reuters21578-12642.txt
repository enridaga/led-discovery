Midwest cash soybean meal basis values
were steady, with more active trade beginning to emerge, soy
product dealers said.
    With crush margins at unfavorable levels, processors in
Indiana, South Carolina and Tennessee are cutting back
operations and preparing to take downtime, they said.
    Demand from the eastern market was steady following the
increase that emerged after the weekend snowstorm, while the
export market appeared to be cooling off, they said.
    Soyoil trade continued in the doldrums, with offers
unchanged, but could turn active if crushers continue taking
substantial downtime, dealers said.
