&lt;Scandinavian Airline System> said it
has cut the price of its peak-season Super Apex fares from New
York to Scandinavia about 150 dlrs.
    The airline said there will be comparable savings from
other U.S. gateways. The new fares, which are subject to
government approval, were introduced so SAS can remain
competitive with all scheduled carriers from the United States
to Scandinavia, it said.
    SAS said the price of a round-trip Super Apex ticket from
New York to Copenhagen, Oslo, Bergen and Gothenburg during the
shoulder season -- the month of May and from mid-August to
mid-September -- will be 644 dlrs midweek and 694 dlrs on
weekends with Stockholm 50 dlrs higher.
