Weakness in the dollar and a subsequent
easing of bond prices underscored Wall Street's lingering
anxiety with interest rates and inflation, prompting investors
to take profits. The decline, though mild, was broad based.
    The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which recorded its 33rd
record high of the year yesterday, when it passed the 2400
level for the first time, fell 10 points to 2396 this morning.
Declines led advances three to two on volume of 19 mln shares.
Bellsouth led the actives with a loss of 1/4 to 39-1/4. IBM
fell 1/4 to 149-1/8.
