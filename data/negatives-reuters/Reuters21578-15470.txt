Iran's navy commander warned that Iran
would close off the Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf, if
there was any disruption to its shipping or sea-bound trade,
Tehran radio said.
    Commodore Mohammed Hoseyn Malekzadegan told a news
conference Iran was ready to maintain security in the Gulf.
    But he added "If there is any disruption in the movement of
our ships and our imports and exports, this waterway would not
be left open for any country."
    The radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corporation, quoted Malekzadegan as saying Iran's navy now had
the most advanced defensive equipment, including long-range
shore- to-sea missiles and a range of sea-to-sea missiles.
    He said it had also expanded operations to cover the whole
region "from the most northerly point in the Persian Gulf to the
most southerly part of the Sea of Oman."
    Referring to U.S. fleet movements in and near the Gulf,
Malekzadegan said they had so far not been directed against
Iran's interests.
    "Their movements have been on the basis of international
regulations and in the open seas," the radio quoted him as
saying. "However, if any movement or action is carried out
against the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in
whatever context, we shall decisively confront that move."
