Carling O'Keefe Ltd, 50.1 pct owned by
&lt;Elders IXL Ltd>, said it agreed to contribute 5.0 mln Canadian
dlrs towards the 245 mln dlr cost of building a dome stadium in

the Canadian Football League signed a 10 year lease, including
an option for an additional five year term, to play its games

    It did not disclose financial terms of the lease, but said
it was a "very competitive lease" compared to an existing
agreement with the Canadian National Exhibition stadium.
    Carling O'Keefe said its 5.0 mln dlr contribution to
Ontario Stadium Corp, which is undertaking construction and
fundraising for the dome stadium, includes a 3.5 mln dlr

advertising space and feature its products at events that the
company sponsors, Carling O'Keefe said.
