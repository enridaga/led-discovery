Generale Occidentale, Paris, has
mandated Orion Royal Bank Ltd to arrange a 100 mln dlr
revolving credit facility, Orion said.
    Borrowings under the seven-year facility can be in dollars
or other currencies where available. Drawings will be at 3/8
pct over the London interbank offered rate for one, three or
six months or at 1/8 pct over Royal Bank of Canada's U.S. Prime
rate for periods of one to 30 days.
    There will be a commitment fee of 1/4 pct per annum on the
unutilised available amount and 1/8 pct on the amount
designated as unavailable.
    Proceeds from the facility will be used to refinance an
existing loan facility and provide a flexible source of finance
for general corporate purposes.
    Generale Occidentale, a rare borrower in the international
capital markets, is engaged in food distribution, forestry, oil
production and media activities with interests in Europe and
North America.
