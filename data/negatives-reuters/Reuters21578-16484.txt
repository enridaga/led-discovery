Tehran Radio said all but one Iranian
diplomat in London would return home within two weeks.
    The report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp,
followed an announcement by the Foreign Office in London that
Britain had withdrawn four of its six remaining diplomats in
Tehran.
    They were the latest moves in a diplomatic row between the
two countries that started with the arrest of an Iranian
consular official in England followed by the abduction of a
British envoy in Tehran, who was later freed.
