U.N. Chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is
proposing a simultaneous ceasefire and inquiry into who started
the Iran-Iraq war under a revised peace plan, an Arab newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
    The United Arab Emirates daily al-Khaleej published what it
said was the text of his nine-point peace plan.
    The Al-Khaleej text referred to a ceasefire date as D-day
and stipulated, "On D-day, or another date to be agreed upon, an
impartial body to enquire into responsibility for the conflict
would start work." A choice could be made among existing bodies
or an ad hoc body could be established, the text said.
    The text also envisaged setting a deadline for the body to
complete its work.
