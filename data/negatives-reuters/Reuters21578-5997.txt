International Business Machines Corp
has released software programing standards that will eventually
make it possible to link the company's computers of all sizes,
a spokeswoman said.
    She said standards were contained in a programing
announcement IBM sent to its sales representatives and some
customers. The new standards, known as Systems Application
Architecture, do not constitute a new product. But they provide
the framework for development of saftware to be used in future
computers.
