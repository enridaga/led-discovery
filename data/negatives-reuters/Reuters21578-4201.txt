General Electric said its
unducted fan jet engine lived up to expectations in recently
completed tests on a Boeing Co &lt;BA> 727 airplane.
    The engine, which contains two sets of counter-rotating fan
blades, marks an advance over conventional engines built with
ultra high bypass ducted fans. The testing was a joint effort
of GE and Boeing, using technical and financial support from
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the
company said.
    The company said the engine has fuel savings of 40 to 70
pct over those used in aircraft used today.
