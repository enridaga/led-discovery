The United States, responding to the
kidnapping of American journalist Charles Glass, today insisted
it would not yield to terrorist blackmail.
    "While much remains unclear, we assume this is another
terrorist attempt to manipulate the United States through our
concern for our citizens," the State Department said in a
statement.
    "While we are deeply concerned for the well-being of Mr.
Glass, Mr. (Ali) Usayran and all hostages, American and
foreign, and extend our sympathy to their families and friends,
we repeat that we will not yield to terrorist blackmail," it
said.
    The State Department said its embassy in Beirut had learned
that Glass, a journalist on leave from his job with ABC
television, and Usayran, the son of the Lebanese defense
minister, were kidnapped on the Awaz'i Road in the southern
suburbs of Beirut north of Beirut International Airport on June
17.
    "We know of no claims of responsibility," the department
said.
    "We hold the kidnappers responsible for the safety of their
victims and call for the immediate and unconditional release of
all those held hostages," it added.
