General Electric Co's RCA Global
Communications said it now offers RCA THRUFAX, a service that
delivers telex messages to facsimile terminals.
    No special equipment or extra cost is required to receive
telex messages, but the facsimile terminal must be registered -
without charge - with RCA, the company said.
    The company said through the service, every telex terminal
in the world will be able to reach RCA-registered facsimile
terminals in the U.S., of which there are approximately
500,000.
