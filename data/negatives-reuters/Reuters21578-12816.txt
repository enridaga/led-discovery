CBT soyproduct futures closed higher in
sympathy with strength in new crop soybeans, with soymeal up
1.30 to 3.00 dlrs per ton and soyoil 0.19 to 0.15 cent per lb
higher. May soymeal settled at 146.60 dlrs, with soyoil at
15.61 cents.
    Steadiness in Rotterdam meals and U.S. cash soymeal basis
values this morning, plus trade talk of additional processor
down-time in the U.S. over the next few weeks, added to the
positive tone in meal futures, they said.
    A local house bought over 600 contracts of July soymeal,
with C and D Commodities, Dean Witter, E.F. Hutton and Merrill
Lynch buying small amounts of nearbys, pit brokers said.
    Commercials were the featured buyers in soyoil, with
sellers scattered and small-lot.
