Unisys Corp said shipments will begin
in July 1987 of its new security software package to prevent
unauthorized access to its A series mainframe computers used by
commercial customers and for government installations.
    The Infoguard software security module extends the security
facilities already available on A series computers, it said.
    Infoguard may be licensed through a five year extended term
purchase or on a monthly license basis.  The five year ETP
ranges from 8,450 dlrs on an A 2 mainframe to 34,300 dlrs on an
A 15 mainframe, it said.
