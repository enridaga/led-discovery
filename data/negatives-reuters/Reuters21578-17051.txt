The wet, cold weather which has shrouded
northern Europe recently is not a real problem for farmers yet,
a spokeswoman for France's largest farm union, FNSEA, said.
    The bad weather has only affected the northern part of
France while the Mediterranean region needs more moisture.
    Sugar beet producers said the climatic conditions are not
causing them any difficulties yet although there could be
problems if there is a lack of sun in the next few weeks.
    The only real problem is for fruit producers in the north
as people are consuming less fresh fruit and excessive rain
rots the crop, she said.
