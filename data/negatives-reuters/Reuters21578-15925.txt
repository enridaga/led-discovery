Nationale-Nederlanden NV &lt;NTNN.AS>, the
largest Dutch insurance company, reported a four-pct rise in
first quarter profits. The announcement represented a break
with the company's past practice of giving annual results only.
    The company said it expects its 1987 net profit will at
least equal the 1986 figure of 635.5 guilders.
    Nationale-Nederlanden said the lower exchange rates for the
U.S. Dollar, Australian dollar and sterling had brought the
increase in the quarter's net profit down from 6.3 pct.
    Premium income from damage and life insurances pushed
turnover in the Netherlands up by eight pct.
