Intertan Inc said it plans to
close its 17 company-owned retail stores in Germany and
anticipates this will result in a 6.5 mln dlr charge against
third quarter, ended February 28, results.
    The company took over Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> international
retail operations last September and was spun off to Tandy
holders of record December 31.
    As a result of the proposed Germany closings, Intertan
said, about 57 German employees and 40 support personnel in
Belgium are expected to be discharged.
   
    Intertan said it expects a small staff will be retained in
Germany to service the company's 27 remaining German dealers.
    The company said its German operations had a fiscal 1986
loss of 4.0 mln dlrs on sales of 6.2 mln dlrs. For the first
nine months of fiscal 1987, it had a pre-tax loss of 1.5 mln
dlrs on revenues of 5.4 mln dlrs.
