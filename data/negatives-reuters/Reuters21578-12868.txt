The U.S. Treasury said it will sell
13.2 billion dlrs of three and six-month bills at its regular
auction next week.
    The April 13 sale, to be evenly divided between the three
and six month issues, will result in a paydown of 12.35 billion
dlrs as maturing bills total 25.55 billion dlrs including the
9-day cash management bills issued April 7 in the amount of
11.01 billion dlrs.
    The bills will be issued April 16.
