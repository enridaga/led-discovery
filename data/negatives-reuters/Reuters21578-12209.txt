Rubber futures closed 0.2 to 0.9 yen per
kilo down except nearby June which was unchanged at 125.2,
despite a higher Singapore market this morning, dealers said.
    Prices maintained their decline all day after opening
easier on sporadic stoploss selling due to the dollar's slight
drop against the yen but nearby and mid-term months recovered
slightly at the second afternoon session on small-lot buying in
thin trading.
