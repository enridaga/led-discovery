Merck and Co Inc said a combination
heart drug is available by prescription in the U.S.
    The drug is Vaseretic, a once-a-day medication combining an
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) and a diuretic to
treat high blood pressure. The inhibitor is a new class of
antihypertensive drugs. Last year Merck introduced Vasotec, an
ACE inhibitor.
    The new drug combined Vasotec and HydroDiuril, a frequently
prescribed diuretic.
