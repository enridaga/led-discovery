The Senate voted to sustain President
Reagan's veto of an 88 billion dlr highway and mass transit
funding bill, but Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West
Virginia called for a second vote to reconsider the outcome.
    The first vote ended with 65 Senators voting for the bill
and 35 voting to sustain the veto, two short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override. One of those voting to sustain the
veto was North Carolina Democrat Terry Sanford.
