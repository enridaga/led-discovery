Adm. John Poindexter, a former
National Security Adviser who resigned over the Iran arms
scandal, refused to testify before a House committee probing a
recent expansion of White House and military control over
unclassified information.
    "On advice of counsel, I decline to answer that question
pursuant to my constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment,"
Poindexter said four times in response to questions from House
Government Operations Committee chairman Rep. Jack Brooks.
