The Federal Reserve Board has no
news conference or announcement planned for today, a Fed
spokesman said, dispelling market rumors that a statement was
pending.
    "No such event is scheduled or planned," said spokesman Bob
Moore.
    Rumors of a pending Fed announcement or news conference
circulated in financial markets, following a government report
