The American Stock Exchange said
effective March Three it started allowing specialists to accept
both stop orders and stop limit orders in which the stop price
and limit price are not identical.
    Previously, specialists were only allowed to accept stop
order and stop limit orders in which the stop and limit prices
were identical.  The Amex said floor officials may still
prohibit specialists from accepting stop and stop limit orders
that would be detrimental to the market.
