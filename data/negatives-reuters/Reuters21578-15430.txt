The Central Bank issued 5.68 billion
Taiwan dlrs' worth of certificates of deposit (cd's), bringing
issues so far this year to 180.16 billion dlrs against 40
billion issued a year earlier, a bank spokesman said.
    The new cd's, with maturities of six months, one and two
years, bear interest of 4.03 to 5.12 pct.
    The issues are intended to help curb the growth of m-1b
money supply resulting from large foreign exchange reserves
which the bank said today had reached a record 56 billion U.S.
Dlrs.
