About 10,000 people marched through the
Sudanese capital Monday in protest against price increases and
devaluation of the Sudanese pound.
    The march was aimed at measures agreed with the
International Monetary Fund, including devaluation of the
Sudanese pound by 44 pct and a rise in sugar and petrol prices.
    The devaluation was announced on October 3. Sudan's foreign
debt costs an estimated one billion dlrs a year to service.
