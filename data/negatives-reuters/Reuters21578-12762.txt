FilmTec Corp, a subsidiary of Dow
Chemical Co, said the Food and Drug Administration willpermit
the FilmTec FT30 reverse osmosis membrane to be used in food
processing and purifying water for food applications.
    The company said the development opens "a potentially huge
market for FilmTec." It said food processors will be able to
concentrate juice and other food streams with reverse osmosis
rather than with evaporation techniques.
