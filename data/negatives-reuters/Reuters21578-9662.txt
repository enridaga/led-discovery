Millipore Corp said it agreed to pay a
192,500 dlrs penalty to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency and the State of New Hampshire for discharging
pollutants from 1972 and 1985 from its Jaffrey, N.H. plant to
navigable waters without a permit.
    As part of the settlement, Millipore will undertake a study
to see if groundwater contamination exists in the waters. It
also is prohibited from discharging pollutants except in
accordance with wastewater discharge permits which were issued
after the lawsuit was filed.
    Millipore officials were not available for comment.
