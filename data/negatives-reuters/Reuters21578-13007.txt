Yen-denominated gold futures opened mostly
firmer, with contracts unchanged to eight yen per gram higher,
after falls yesterday, dealers said.
    Gold closed stronger and near the day's highs in New York
yesterday, underpinned by a buoyant silver market, they noted.
    This generated sporadic buying at the opening here but
investors continue to focus interest on the silver market, they
said.
    International bullion firmed to 423.00/423.50 dlrs an ounce
from 422.25/3.25 in New York.
