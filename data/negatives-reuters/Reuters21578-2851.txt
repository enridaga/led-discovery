Frank B. Hall and Co Inc said the
superintendent of insurance of New York, as liquidator of Union
Capital Indemnity Insurance Co of New York, has filed a lawsuit
against the company, Touche Ross and Co, a group of Hall units,
and former officers and directors of Union Indemnity seeking
damages of 140 mln dlrs in connection with Union's insolvency.
    Union Indemnity was a unit of Hall prior to being placed
into liquidation by the New York Insurance Department in July
1985.
    Hall said it intends to oppose this action vigorously.
