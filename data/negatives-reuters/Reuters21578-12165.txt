A top Japanese businessman said the
country's four largest economic organizations will soon present
to the government a set of proposals to expand domestic demand.
    Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren), told a news conference the
government should draw up a package of economic measures
totalling more than 5,000 billion yen.
    Saito said the government's package should include plans to
remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products
and to lift tariffs on industrial products.
    Leading industrialised countries should also step up
concerted market intervention to stabilize exchange rates,
Saito said.
    The measures will be presented to Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone as a joint proposal of Keidanren, the Japan Federation
of Employers' Association, the Japan Committee for Economic
Development and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
    Saito said Japan should stop paying only lip service to its
pledges to open its markets.
    The proposed measures should be undertaken by increased
fiscal spending, he added.
