Diamond-Bathurst Inc said an
explosion yesterday during a furnace rebuild at its Antioch,
Calif., facility completely destroyed the furnace.
    The glassmaker said the rest of the facility was undamaged
and there were no serious injuries.  It said it believes it is
fully covered by insurance.
    The company said it cannot yet determine the impact on the
plant's operations.
