Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded Potomac Electric Power Co's preferred stock to AA-1
from AAA and it continues to review the utility's AAA bond
rating for downgrade. Some 1.3 billion dlrs is affected.
    The prime-1 commercial paper rating is not under review.
    Moody's said it expects Potomac Electric's credit quality
to undergo a degree of erosion because of recent rate
