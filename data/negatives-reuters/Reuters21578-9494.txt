Electricite de France is issuing 100 mln
Swiss francs of 3-3/8 pct notes with warrants issued by Credit
Suisse attached to buy gold, lead manager Credit Suisse said.
    Each eight-year note of a 50,000-franc face value has 15
warrants, two of which entitle the holder to acquire 100 grams
of gold at a price of 2,350 francs. The strike price represents
a premium of about 15 pct over the current market price of
gold.
    The warrants may be exercised from April 30, 1987, to April
30, 1990. The notes, callable starting 1992 at 101.50, have a
final maturity on April 30, 1995.
