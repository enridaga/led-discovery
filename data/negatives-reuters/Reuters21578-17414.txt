South Korea's ruling party will seek a
direct presidential election to solve an acute political crisis
in the country, a party spokesman said.
    The Democratic Justice Party will ask President Chun Doo
Hwan to accept opposition demands for a direct poll to end the
current social turmoil, he said.
    The party will also urge Chun to allow an amnesty for top
dissident Kim Dae-jung and an immediate release of most
political prisoners. -
