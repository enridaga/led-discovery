K Mart Corp will sell 26 billion
dlrs worth of goods in 1987, up from 23.8 billion dlrs in sales
in 1986, chairman Bernard M. Fauber predicted.
    The K Mart official also said the company is committed to
"retail automation," and will equip all K Mart stores with slot
scanning point of sale register systems. Some 400 systems are
already in place.
    Fauber said each K Mart costs five mln dlrs, including
land, building, fixtures, equipment and inventory. Each store
serves an average 90,000 customers, he said.
