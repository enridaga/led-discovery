Consolidated Oil and Gas Inc said the
exercise price of its Oil Indexed Common Stock Purchase
Warrants Series 1900 &lt;CGS.WS.P> will remain three dlrs a share
for the six month period July one to December 31.
    The warrant exercise price is based on the average price of
West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil reported for the trading
month of May. For the month, the average price was less than 20
dlrs per barrel, the first index point above which there would
be a change in the exercise price of the warrants.
