Jefferies and Co said it is making a
market in Allegis Corp at 67 to 68.
    The New York Stock Exchange halted the stock before the
close at 75 for an order imbalance.
    A Jefferies official said the firm, which specializes in
third market trading, is staying open tonight "to accomodate
our customers."
