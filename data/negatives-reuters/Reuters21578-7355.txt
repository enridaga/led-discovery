World Bank President Barber Conable
said he believed Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt
interest payments is temporary.
    Conable in a wide-ranging television interview to be shown
on public broadcasting tomorrow said Brazil now has the
attention of its creditors and must come up with a plan
designed to reform its economy.
    "I think the Brazilians have the attention of many of their
creditors, but they must come up with a plan that will persuade
people that the Brazilian economy is going to be put on a
course that will result in some growth."
    Turning to Japan, Conable said the role of that country has
been increasing in the World Bank and is expected to continue
to do so.
    He said that Japan had made an additional 450 mln dlr
pledge to the International Development Association, an
indication that it agrees that it must provide more help in
line with its economic position.
    Conable said there was no indication that the Soviet Union
was serious about joining the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank. He said they would have to get convertible currency
and open their books and the Soviets "don't usually do that."
