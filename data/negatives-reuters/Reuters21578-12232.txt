The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said it
had approved two loans amounting to 75.7 mln dollars for
agricultural projects in Bangladesh and Nepal.
    It said both loans are repayable over 40 years, including a
10-year grace, and carry a service charge of one pct a year.
    The bank said it approved 51.7 mln for an agricultural
inputs program for Bangladesh aimed at sustaining foodgrain
production.
    It said the loan will cover the entire foreign exchange
component of the project's total cost of 65 mln.
    The ADB said it approved 24 mln dlrs to support an
agricultural credit project in Nepal.
    The loan will benefit Nepal by increasing foodgrain output,
augmenting production of milk and other dairy products and
expanding energy generation in rural areas, it said.
