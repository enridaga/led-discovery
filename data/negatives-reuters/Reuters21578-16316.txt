Ford Motor Co praised President Reagan's
nomination of Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve Board chairman,
saying the conservative economist has a "sound record to fill
the void of (Paul) Volker's departure."
    The number two U.S. auto maker said in a statement that
Volker "took office...at the beginning of a critical time for
the auto industry" and had had "a very positive impact on the
U.S. economy."
