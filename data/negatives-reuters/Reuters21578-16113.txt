Finance Minster Gerhard Stoltenberg praised
the excellent leadership of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker whom the White House said will not be standing for a
third term when his current period in office expires.
    "Paul Volcker will go down in U.S. History as one of the
important chairmen of the Federal Reserve Board. By his
excellent leadership he has also won our great respect,"
Stoltenberg said in a Finance Ministry statement.
    The minister described Volcker's successor, economist Alan
Greenspan, as an experienced and capable man and wished him all
the best in his new role.
