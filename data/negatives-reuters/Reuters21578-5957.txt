LTV Corp said it has received a contract
worth more than 500 mln dlrs from Boeing Co to produce major
sections for Boeing 767, 757 and 747 airliners, including the
new 747-400.
    The company said the contract covers continuing production
through mid-1990.  LTV makes aft body sections and horizontal
and vertical stabilizers for 747 and 757's and horizontal
stabilizers for 767's.
    It said as part of the contract it will build a new type of
horizontal stabilizer for the 747-400 containing tanks capable
of holding 3,300 gallons of fuel.
    The added fuel capacity will allow the 747-400 to fly about
1,000 miles further than the 747-300, LTV said.
    The company said it will start making the 747-400 shipsets
in June and the first aircraft is scheduled for completion in
early 1988.  It is to be delivered to NWA Inc &lt;NWA> in December
1988.
