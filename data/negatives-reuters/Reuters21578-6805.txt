The OPEC Fund for International
Development approved 100,000 dlrs in aid for Ecuador, which was
struck recently by an earthquake.
    The Fund, which was set up by the 13 OPEC (Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries) member states to help Third
World development, said in a statement the money would be used
to provide medical supplies for the earthquake victims.
    Ecuador, itself a member of OPEC, suffered a major blow to
its economy when the earthquake damaged a pipeline carrying
crude oil, its chief export earner.
