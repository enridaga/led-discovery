Zenith Electronics Corp said its
computer subsidiary signed an agreement under which Micro D Inc
will market the new Zenith Data Systems monitor, which uses the
flat tension mask color video display.
    The monitor offers more than 50 pct greater brightness and
contrast performance than conventional high-revolution computer
monitors, Zenith said. It is compatible with the new IBM
Personal System/2 computers and will be available later this
summer.
