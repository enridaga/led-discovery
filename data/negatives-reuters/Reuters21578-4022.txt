Zenith Electronics Corp asked
the U.S. Supreme Court to consider its anti-dumping case
against Japanese television manufacturers.
    In a complex case that dates to 1974, Zenith has charged a
group of Japanese companies with violations of U.S. antitrust
and anti-dumping laws.
    The U.S. electronics company today said it asked the high
court to review a 1986 lower court ruling that dismissed both
the antitrust and anti-dumping portions of the case.
