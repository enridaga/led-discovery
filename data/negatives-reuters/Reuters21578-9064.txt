Warner-Lambert Co said it
has filed suit in U.S. District Court in New Jersey against
&lt;Mason Distributors Inc>, alleging unfair competition.
    It said the suit results from Mason's distribution of
children's allergy medicine in packages allegedly resembling
those of Warner-Lambert's Benadryl capsules and elixir.
