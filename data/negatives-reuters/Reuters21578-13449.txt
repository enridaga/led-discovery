the Peruvian government decreed that a wide
range of firms would have to earmark between 20 and 30 pct of
their 1986 net profits to buy treasury bonds this year.
    A presidential decree said that banking, financial and
insurance firms as well as bottling and tobacco industries with
1986 sales of more than 1.6 mln intis would have to earmark 30
pct of their net profits from last year to buy the bonds.
    The bonds would be redeemed over the next two years and
their interest rate would be set by the central bank. Textile,
commercial and fishing canneries with sales over 1.24 mln intis
would have to buy bonds equal to 20 pct of profits.
    The firms would have to buy the bonds between April and
December 1987.
   The decree said the government adopted the move to obtain
financing for high-priority investment projects, which it did
not specify.
    The economy ministry says it aims to keep the public
sector's budget deficit to between five and six pct of the
gross domestic product (gdp).
    Last year, the deficit was six pct of gdp, according to the
central bank.
