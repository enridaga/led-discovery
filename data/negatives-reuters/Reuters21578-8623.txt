Unisys Corp vice chairman Joseph
Kroger said the company's new series 1100 mainframe computer
products will not be available for at least a year.
    At a press conference introducing new products in the V500
computer series, Kroger said Unisys's new Super 90 and Mercury
computers will not be available until after March 1988. The
products are being developed for addition to the 1100 series.
    No specific time frame had been set for introduction of the
Super 90, which will be based on the existing 1190 mainframe,
or the Mercury, which will be a new computer, a Unisys
spokesman said.
    "There is a lot of pent-up customer demand for the
products," Kroger told Reuters. But Unisys has not lost any
customers currently using its 1190 mainframes because of the
wait for the new products, he said.
    At the press conference, Kroger said Unisys is not
developing a one-megabit computer memory chip but will probably
buy them when appropriate from Japanese suppliers.     In
response to a question, Kroger indicated first quarter orders
should be up from a year ago, with international business good
and the U.S. market still "difficult."
