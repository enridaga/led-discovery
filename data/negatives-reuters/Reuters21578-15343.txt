The Soviet Union will present a draft
treaty today calling for elimination of all U.S.-Soviet
medium-range missiles in Europe, an official source in the
Soviet arms negotiating team told Reuters.
    The draft treaty will be handed over to the American team
negotiating on medium-range missiles during talks at the U.S.
Diplomatic mission in Geneva this afternoon, the source said.
    The United States presented its draft treaty, which would
also scrap the so-called "Euromissiles," during a previous round
of negotiations in early March.
