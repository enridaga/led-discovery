Police arrested two Polish citizens for
trying to steal Japanese computer technology, local media
reports said today.
    The reports said the two had worked at a computer-related
company in Tokyo and visited Japanese computer makers several
times after coming to Japan on tourist visas last October.
    One report said they were computer specialists at a Polish
technology institute, and that the company they worked for was
managed by a naturalised Japanese from Poland who was a
graduate of the institute.
    Police officials declined to comment on the reports.
