NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS> said it had agreed with
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T> and Nippon Gakki
Co Ltd &lt;NGAK.T> of Japan to jointly produce the components of
the newly developed laser audio-video player.
    Philips last month announced it and Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> had
developed a world standard for the new combi-player.
    The player will be able to take the three sizes of new
compact disk videos (CDV), which give near perfect sound and
image production, as well as the traditional audio laser discs.
    Yamaha will develop the laser technology, Matsushita the
video specifications and Philips will work on rendering the
player compatible with existing European 50-hertz television
standards, Philips spokeswoman Marijke van Hooren said.
    Each company will assemble and market the product under its
own label, and it is hoped other hardware companies will join
in the marketing of the new product, she said.
    She said there were around 160 companies which hold
licences for the manufacture of CD players.
