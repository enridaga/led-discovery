The Japanese Embassy said in a
statement it was "deeply disappointed" by the tariffs announced
by President Reagan in retaliation for Japan's not honoring its
semiconductor agreement with the United States.
    It said Japan had been fully implementing the pact to end
dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its home
market to U.S. goods and the results were starting to show.
    The embassy said Japan would complain to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as it said it would, and seek
new talks with Washington to resolve the issue as soon as
possible.
