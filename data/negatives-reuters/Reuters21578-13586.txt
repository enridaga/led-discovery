Brazil's three most powerful state
governors have joined forces to seek the removal of Finance
Minister Dilson Funaro.
    The governors of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais
told a news conference they want changes in the cabinet and in
the shaping of economic policy, with Funaro singled out for
criticism by Sao Paulo governor Orestes Quercia.
    They made their call while Funaro is in Washington holding
talks with creditors on rescheduling Brazil's 111 billion dlr
foreign debt.
