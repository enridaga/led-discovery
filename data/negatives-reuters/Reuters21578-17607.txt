Moody's Investors Service said it
affirmed Greyhound Corp's Baa-2 subordinated debt rating and
Prime-2 commercial paper rating. Some 160 mln dlrs of long-term
debt is affected.
    Moody's said Greyhound's debt had been under review for
possible downgrade since May, when it agreed to acquire the
in-flight catering and airport terminal concession businesses
of Carson Pirie Scott and Co for about 390 mln dlrs.
    Moody's said it expects Greyhound to experience generally
improved results over the next several years due to recent
strategic acquisitions. It has reduced debt via asset sales.
