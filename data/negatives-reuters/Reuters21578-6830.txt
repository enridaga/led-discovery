The federal environment
department said it charged Gulf Canada Corp with eight counts
of waste dumping into the Beaufort Sea.
    The dumping is alleged to have occurred September 23-30,
1986, and Gulf faces a maximum 50,000 dlr fine on each count,
according to the department.
    The department said Gulf allegedly dumped tons of powdered
cement and drilling mud containing mercury and trace metals
into the Beaufort at its Amauligak drilling site.
     Gulf Canada spokesman Ash Bhasin said the company has been
advised of the charges, but cannot comment further.
