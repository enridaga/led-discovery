Texas Air Corp's Eastern Airlines
subsidiary said it will cut 259 jobs for mechanics and related
employees in Miami and Boston, effective around May One.
    The company said part of the staff cuts result from the
proposed sale of five Boeing Co &lt;BA> 727-100's and two Lockheed
Corp &lt;LK> L-1011's, as well as the previously announced
transfer of six &lt;Airbus Industrie> A300's to Continental
Airlines, another Texas Air subsidiary.
