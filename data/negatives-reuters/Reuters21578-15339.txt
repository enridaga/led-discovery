Strikers at the Caterpillar Inc tractor
plant near Glasgow, due to be closed by the U.S.-owned firm,
voted to end their occupation of the factory after more than
three months.
    A meeting attended by 700 of the plant's 1,200 workers
approved an agreement reached with management on Thursday after
four days of talks. Production will resume today.
    The agreement calls for the establishment of a working
group of representatives from both sides, which has been given
until October 16 to find a new buyer for the factory.
    The company has promised that there will be no job losses
before that date. Workers began their occupation on January 14
after Caterpillar said it planned to close the plant and lay
off the entire work force.
