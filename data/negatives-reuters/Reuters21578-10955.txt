Genetics Institute Inc and
Wellcome PLC, a British-based pharmaceutical company, jointly
announced the selection of a site for their joint venture,
WelGen Manufacturing Inc, formed last September.
    The companies said they choose a 77-acre site in West
Greenwich R.I. for the venture's manufacturing facility, which
will make biotechnology-based pharmaceuticals. The plant should
be completed in 1989, and will employ about 200 people.
