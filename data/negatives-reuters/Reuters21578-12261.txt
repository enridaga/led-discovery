Malaysian crude palm oil futures
closed off the day's highs on late speculative selling
following talk that Pakistan passed on its tender for another
6,000 tonnes of RBD palm oil for second half April shipment
after buying the same amount yesterday, dealers said.
    A higher overnight Chicago soyoil futures close had
supported prices earlier, they said.
    June and July closed seven ringgit firmer at 746 and 742
ringgit per tonne respectively, while April and May were six
and five ringgit higher at 747.
    Turnover rose to 448 lots from 135 yesterday.
