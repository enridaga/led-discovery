Procter and Gamble Co said it
appointed the New York ad agency of Wells, Rich, Greene, Inc to
handle its Duncan Hines Ready-to-Serve Cookies, effective
immediately.
    The account was previously handled by Grey Advertising Inc
of New York.
    The company declined to discuss the reason for the change
in accounts, nor would it dislose its advertising expenditures
for the brand.
    Procter and Gamble said Grey will continue to handle many
of its brands, including Crisco, Bold, Joy, Downy and Puritan
Oil, Monchel and Jif.
    Wells, Rich, Green handles Procter's Pringle's, Gain,
Safeguard, Spic and Span, Prell, Sure Banner, and Oil of Olay
brands.
