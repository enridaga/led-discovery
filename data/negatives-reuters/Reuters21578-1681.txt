The Senate Agriculture Committee
approved a bill that would extend for one year the life of the
National Commission on Dairy Policy.
    The dairy commission, mandated by the 1985 farm bill, is
set to expire at the end of the month. The bill would extend
the date by which the commission must submit its report on
dairy policy to March 31, 1988.
    Congress charged the commission with examining the federal
price support program for milk and alternatives to the program.
