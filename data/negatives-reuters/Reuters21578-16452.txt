Parliament passed a law allowing
state-owned industrial companies to sell 49 pct of their shares
to staff and private investors, the official BSS news agency
said.
    Under the new law, passed yesterday, 51 pct of shares in
the affected companies will be held by the government, 34 pct
by the public and 15 pct by staff. The law also allows workers
to nominate a member to the board of directors if they buy at
least 12 pct of a company's shares.
    Bangladesh has returned more than 500 industrial companies
to private ownership since March 1982.
