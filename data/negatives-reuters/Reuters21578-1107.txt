Sun Microsystems Inc said it has agreed
to cooperate with Philips Corporate Group Home Interactive
Systems, a Dutch electronics firm, to develop a multi-media

utilities and software to enable Comact Disc Interactive
application developers to design, assemble and test
interactive, multi-media applications in entertainment,
education and information for consumer and institutions.
