Dominion Resources Inc said it
has asked the Virginia Corporation commission to approve fuel
cost and base rate adjustments that would raise typical
residential bills 1.4 pct, effective May One.
    It said it is seeking a one-year base rate reduction of
26.7 mln dlrs due to tax savings and a 67.5 mln dlr increase in
fuel charges, for a net increase of 40.9 mln dlrs.
