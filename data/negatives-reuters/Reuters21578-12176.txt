The Kuala Lumpur tin price closed
unchanged from yesterday's 16.65 ringgit per kilo close after a
very brief trading session, dealers said.
    Buyers and sellers were evenly matched at the opening level
of 16.65 ringgit, and total turnover was 103 tonnes against 135
yesterday, they added.
    Buying at this level was mainly noted from the Japan, local
and Europe, again influenced by steady currency factors,
despite an easier European spot market.
    Some cash-strapped miners continued to sell, they said.
