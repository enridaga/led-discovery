G. Heileman Brewing Co Inc said
it agreed to acquire the trademarks of Philadelphia-based C.
Schmidt which produces a line of malt beverage products,
including Schmidt, Rheingold, Duquesne and Ortlieb.
    In 1986, Schmidt sold about 1.6 mln barrels.
    Under terms of the proposed agreement, Heileman said it
will enter a trademark transfer agreement which provides for
royalties to be paid to Schmidt over a specified period of time
on beverage products produced under the C. Schmidt labels.
