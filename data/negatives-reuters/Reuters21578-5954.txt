AA Gage, a manufacturer of
rotary indexers and test systems for the aerospace and machine
tool industries, said it was awarded an initial subcontract of
2.2 mln dlrs by Singer Co's Kearfott Guidance and Navigation
Division.
    It said the subcontract is to produce computerized two-axis
test stand systems and other support services for the U.S. Air
Force Adints (Automatic Depot Inertial Navigation Test Systems)
program.
    Depending on Air Force requirements, the subcontract will
result in AA Gage shipments between 5.0 and 10 mln dlrs over
five years.
