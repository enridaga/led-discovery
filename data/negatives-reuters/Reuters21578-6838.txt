The Securities and Exchange Commission
is continuing an investigation of the practice of "parking"
stocks, said Richard Murphy, a lawyer with the SEC enforcement
division.
    Earlier, the SEC settled civil charges against Boyd
Jefferies and Jefferies Group Inc, which allege market
manipulation and the parking of stocks, a practice where stock
is held by one person or firm while it is actually under the
control of someone else.
    Murphy told reporters others are being investigated for
parking stocks.
