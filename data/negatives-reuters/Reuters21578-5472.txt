Massey Combines Corp, 45 pct
owned by Varity Corp, said it shipped 48 large conventional
combines valued at nearly five mln Canadian dlrs to its Saudi
Arabian distributor, located in Riyadh.
    Massey Combines said the combines shipment is the company's
first major sale in Saudi Arabia since the sharp drop in world
oil prices forced many oil-producing countries to curb
machinery imports.
    Massey Combines, formerly Varity's combines division,
became an independent business during a company restructuring
completed last year.
