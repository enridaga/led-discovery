Texaco Inc said it has been asked by
a committee of shareholders about the possibility of the
company paying a preferred stock dividend to shareholders.
    The company said the inquiry, from the Equity Security
Holders Committee, outlines the committee's ideas on how such a
dividend might be paid.
    Texaco said it would explore the committee's outline, as
well as other options that would support shareholders'
interests and assets.
