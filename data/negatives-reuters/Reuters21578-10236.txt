About 40,000 passengers were stranded as
Spanish airlines ground staff staged their second 24-hour
strike for wage rises in five days, the airlines spokesmen
said.
    They said the state-owned airline Iberia cancelled 300
domestic and international flights, and Aviaco maintained 10 of
about 80 scheduled flights.
    A spokesman for Madrid's Barajas airport said foreign
airlines were operating normally.
    Airlines ground staff have announced more strikes for April
10 and 15 to coincide with stoppages by railways workers and
drivers of petrol tankers.
