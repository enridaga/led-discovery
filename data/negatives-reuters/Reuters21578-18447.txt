Standard and Poor's Corp said it is
reviewing for downgrade United Artists Communications Inc's
single-B rating on 490 mln dlrs of outstanding and
shelf-registered subordinated debt.
    Placed under review with positive implications were United
Cable Television Corp's B-minus rating on 250 mln dlrs of
outstanding subordinated debt and preliminary B-plus senior and
B-minus subordinated ratings on 200 mln dlrs of
shelf-registered debt.
    S and P said the reviews reflect its perception of the
implications of a proposed merger involving the two firms.
