Advanced Micro Devices said
it plans to build the first of a new generation of 32-bit CMOS
microprocessors designed to operate three to five times faster
than the 32-bit devices currently built.
    The new microprocessor is capable of sustained performance
of 17 mln instructions per second and has a peak of 25 mln
instructions per second, the company said.
    It said the new device is suitable for engineering
workstations, super-minicomputers, laser printer controllers
and other high-performance applications.
