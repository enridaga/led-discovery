Sharp price hikes for food and fuel
planned by the government could provoke an open confrontation
with workers and endanger Poland's fragile post-Solidarity
stability, a government trade union leader has warned.
    Romuald Sosnowski, deputy chairman of the national trade
union alliance OPZZ, said the unions' strong rejection of the
increases yesterday was prompted by the hostility of lower-paid
workers.
    The authorities told the OPZZ on Tuesday that food prices
would rise by an average of 13 pct but ncreases for fuels --
including electricity and gas -- would be much higher.
    They said wage increases would be limited to 12 pct in 1987
and that employers who breached the ceiling would be punished
through additional taxes.
