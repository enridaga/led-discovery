mexico's minister of energy and
mines, alfredo del mazo, has yet to reply to a peruvian
invitation for ministerial-level talks on bilateral cooperation
in silver marketing, a ministry spokesman said.
    Peruvian officials said they extended the invitation
earlier this week and that it was possible the talks could be
held within the next 15 days.
    Meanwhile, a banco de mexico spokesman confirmed that
mexican central bank head miguel mancera aguayo held private
talks here yesterday with the president of the peruvian central
bank leonel figueroa.
