&lt;Bralorne Resources Ltd> said
it reached agreement in principle with its long term lenders
for a debt rescheduling plan.
    When the agreements are finalized, Bralorne's debt
structure will be modified so that debt servicing requirements
match available cash flow for each of the next three years.
    During that period, principal payments will be deferred, if
necessary, and interest will be capitalized on a portion of the
long term debt, it said.
    Bralorne said it expects these agreements will enable the
company to operate within its cash flows and provide a stable
financial environment until the energy industry recovers.
