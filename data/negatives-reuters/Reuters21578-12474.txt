Early gulf cash soybean basis levels
were slightly firmer in moderate trading as slow country
movement lent support, dealers said.
    Lower barge freight rates lent some support, but slow
export dealings limited gains. Soybean export inspections were
below trade expectations at 10.8 mln bushels.
    April and May traded late yesterday at 25 cents over May,
and July traded down to 24 over July.
    Gulf cash corn values were firm amid very strong export
inspections of 46.7 mln bushels. Hard wheat gulf values were
firm nearby amid ongoing export dealings and slow movement.
