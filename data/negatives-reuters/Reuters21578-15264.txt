The Bundesbank intervened in the Tokyo
foreign exchange market to buy a small amount of dollars
against marks through the Bank of Japan, dealers said.
    The West German central bank bought dollars when the dollar
was at about 1.7770-80 marks. Dealers' estimates of the
intervention amount varied from 100 mln to one billion dlrs.
    Some dealers said the Bank of Japan appeared to have
undertaken small-lot mark-selling intervention on its own
account.
