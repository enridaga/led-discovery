Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar has proposed an impartial inquiry into the causes of
the Gulf war while Iran and Iraq observe a ceasefire,
diplomatic sources said on Tuesday.
    His nine-point plan, a refinement of proposals he took to
Tehran and Baghdad last month, was delivered to the two sides
last week with a request that they let him have their initial
views before October 30.
    The proposals appeared to counter Iran's earlier offer of
an undeclared cessation of hostilities if an inquiry into
responsibility for the war was begun.
    Iraq insisted on a formal unconditional ceasefire, Perez de
Cuellar told the Security Council on his return to New York on
September 16.
    As in his original proposals, the revised plan termed D-day
a specific date to be agreed upon for the observance of a
ceasefire, diplomats said.
    On a specific date after that, which would have to be
agreed, the withdrawal of all forces to internationally
recognized boundaries would begin and be completed within an
agreed time frame, according to the account of his proposals.
