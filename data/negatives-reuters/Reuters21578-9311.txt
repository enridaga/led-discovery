International Business Machines Corp
said scientists at its Zurich research laboratory have taken a
key step toward developing a method of testing computer chips
with a laser.
    The technique is important, IBM said, because it could lead
to the development of tools that can determine the quality of
microscopic-sized computer chips without damaging them.
    IBM said chip makers will need such advanced testing
methods to aid them in developing the next generation of
semiconductors.
    These chips will be smaller than today's chips but will be
able to store vastly greater amounts of information.
    IBM said its technique uses a laser light for "contactless"
measuring of electrical signals on metal lines similar to the
kind found in computer chip circuitry.
    It said that using commercially available lasers, the
method should permit measurements of circuits with a width of
one micrometer or less.
    A micrometer is about 80 times smaller than the thickness
of a sheet of paper.
