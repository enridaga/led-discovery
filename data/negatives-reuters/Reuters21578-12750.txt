Michael Davidoff, head trader for
Ivan Boesky's Seemala Corp, consented to Securities and
Exchange Commission penalities and agreed to help in its
continuing investigation of insider trading, the SEC said.
    Davidoff recently pleaded guilty in federal court to
violating the net capital requirements governing brokers and
traders.
    The SEC had filed similar charges and it said Davidoff had
consented to a final judgement enjoing him from future stock
trading violations.
    The SEC said Davidoff consented to its order without
admitting or denying the allegations that he aided and abetted
violations by a broker and dealer.
    It also said Davidoff consented to a planned SEC order to
bar him from future securities dealings.
