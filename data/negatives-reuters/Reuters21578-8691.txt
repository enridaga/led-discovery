Treasury Secretary James Baker said
the meeting last month in Paris in which finance ministers
agreed to keep the dollar at current levels showed that the
economic cooperation process was working.
    He said that at that meeting the surplus countries
committed themselves to strengthening their growth prospects,
while the deficit countries agreed to reduce their domestic
imbalances.
    For its part, he said the United States must press forward
with reductions in the federal budget deficit and must continue
to oppose protectionist pressures.
