Portugal has contracted a six-year, 150
mln ECU loan from a group of foreign banks led by Daiwa Europe
Ltd to finance investment projects, the finance ministry said.
    Interest of 7.75 pct is to be paid in annual instalments
starting in 1988, ministry spokesman Luis Vilhena de Cunha
said.
    The loan will first be in the form of a temporary global
note and be replaced later by subscriptions of 1,000 and 10,000
ECUs. The issue price was set at 101.75 pct.
    Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA will act as listing agent
and fiscal agent, the spokesman added.
