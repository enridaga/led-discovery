The U.S. drilling rig count rose by four
last week to a total of 752, against 987 working rigs one year
ago, Hughes Tool Co said.
    In Canada, the rig count continued falling last week
because of the government's annual springtime ban prohibiting
heavy equipment from being transported over rain-softened
highways. A total of 85 rigs were working in Canada, down 46
from the previous week, Hughes said. At this time last year, a
total of 109 rigs were working in Canada.
    Among individual states, Louisiana and New Mexico each
reported drilling declines of 10 rigs and Kansas was down by
seven. Gains were reported in Oklahoma, Wyoming and Texas which
increased by 20, seven and one, respectively.
    Hughes said the total of 752 working rigs in the United
States included 17 in inland waters, 74 in offshore waters and
661 on land.
