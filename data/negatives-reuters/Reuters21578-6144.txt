Unisys Corp said that UNIX OS-based
computer systems previously offered by Sperry and Burroughs
have been merged into a single family of products.
    It said completeness of product line, brand recognition and
commitment to customers and original equipment manufacturer
vendors prompted the move.
    Unisys UNIX OS products consist of compatible software
packages, terminals and printers for use in such applications
as small business accounting systems to networking requirements
of distributed processing.
