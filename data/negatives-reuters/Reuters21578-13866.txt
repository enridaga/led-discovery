Analysts who follow Sears, Roebuck and
Co said the company's 4.2 pct sales gain in March by its
Merchandise Group reflects more competitive pricing and
continues a pattern of growth started in late 1986.
    Sears said sales for the five weeks ended April 4 rose to
2.62 billion dlrs from 2.51 billion dlrs a year earlier.
    Linda Kristiansen of Paine Webber Inc called the numbers
"impressive," and said she looks for a full-year sales gain of
five pct for the nation's largest retailer.
