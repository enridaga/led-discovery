A textile mill with an annual production
capacity of 52 mln square metres of knitted fabric has been
opened officially near Havana, Granma, the official Cuban
newspaper, said.
    The mill, inaugurated yesterday, is equipped with looms and
other machinery from East Germany. A single production line, in
operation since last year, has already produced over seven mln
square metres of fabric.
    President Fidel Castro and vice-president Carlos Rafael
Rodriguez were present at the ceremony.
