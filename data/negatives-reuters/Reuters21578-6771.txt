Allegheny International Inc said a
consortium of banks which entered into long term and short term
secured revolving credit agreements with the company last year
has agreed to extend a previously granted waiver of certain
financial net worth covenants to April 29 from March 18.
    The company said last week it was seeking such a waiver.
    AI is currently engaged in discussions with the consortium
to extend the short term agreement beyond April 29 and expects
such an extension will be obtained.
