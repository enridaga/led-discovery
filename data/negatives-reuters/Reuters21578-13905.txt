USAir Group Inc said it is reducing
coach fares up to 62 pct between Atlanta and 21 destinations
for travel April 12 through June 15.
    The fares are non-refundable and applicable to roundtrip
flights. Reservations must be made at least two days in advance
and tickets purchased within 24 hours after reservations are
made, the company said.
    Roundtrip fares between Atlanta and Pittsburgh, for
example, would be 178 dlrs instead of 478 dlrs, USAir said.
