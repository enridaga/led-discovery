Panhanele Eastern Corp said its two
interstate pipeline subsidiaries will extend the availability
of self-implementing transportation service beyond the
scheduled May one termination of the program set by federal
regulators.
    The company explained that Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co
and Trunkline Gas Co are engaged in renegotiating their basic
utility service agreements to provide both traditional tariff
sales and transportation service. Because this process requires
considerable time, the continuity of transport service is being
preserved, it added.
