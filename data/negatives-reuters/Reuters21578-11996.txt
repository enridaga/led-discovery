Synergen Inc said it plans to
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell about
1.5 mln shares of common stock.
    Proceeds would be used to fund research and development,
for product testing, working capital and general purposes.
    The offering will be made through underwriters and only by
means of a prospectus, the biotechnology firm said.
