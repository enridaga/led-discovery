Gulf States Utilities Co said it
filed a 266 mln dlr financing plan with Texas regulators and
asked for quick approval so that it can implement a previously
approved 39.9 mln dlr interim rate increase.
    In the filing with the Texas Public Utilities Commission,
Gulf States said it listed six sources of funding that it
believes meet the commission's requirement that it obtain 250
mln dlrs in credit and other financing before it can institute
the interim rate hike.
