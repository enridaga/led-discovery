The Bank of China will become a
card-issuing member of &lt;Visa International> this year, Visa's
chief general manager for Asia, Carl Pascarella, said in a
statement.
    Visa is designing a card for China, where international
credit cards are accepted but not yet issued.
    He said Visa was developing training programs for the bank
on card issuance and processing procedures. A Chinese group
will visit Visa's San Francisco headquarters next month to
discuss future cooperation, he said.
