A bomb blast at the Philippine Military
Academy killed at least one person and wounded about 40 during
rehearsals for a weekend visit by President Corazon Aquino,
military and hospital officials said.
    Reporters at the scene told Reuters the death toll was
likely to rise, but there was no official confirmation.
    Military sources at first suggested the bomb might have
been planted by communist rebels, but no group immediately
claimed responsibility.
