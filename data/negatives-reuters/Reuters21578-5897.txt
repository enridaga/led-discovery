Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp said
George A. Ferris, 70, has resigned as vice chairman and chief
executive officer.
    The company also said Lloyd C. Lubensky, 64, its largest
shareholder, has been named chairman.  Lubensky is president of
Ryder System Inc's &lt;RDR> American Jet Industries subsidiary. 
In early January Allan E. Paulson sold his 34.2 pct stake in
Wheeling-Pittsburgh to Lubensky and resigned as chairman.  No
successor was named at the time.  Ferris, Lubensky and director
John P. Innes made up an executive committee formed last month
to operate Wheeling-Pittsburgh.
