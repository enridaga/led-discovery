Microsoft Corp said a Federal
District judge has honored its request for a preliminary
injunction prohibiting four companies from copying, importing,
disseminating or distributing the software package, "Flacon
MS-DOS".
    The companies involved include Taiwan-based Very
Competitive Computer Products Corp, Evergood Computer
International Corp and Favorlon Enterprises, and U.S.-based
Wetex International Corp, which the Taiwan companies were
believed to be importing the software through.
