posted along the central Atlantic Coast.
    Cold temperatures and rain mixed with snow caused the

through the morning.
    Rain continued over central Texas into the morning hours.
Rain also extended over the Oregon coast, near San Francisco
Bay, California and over northwest Montana.
    Snow was scattered over northwest Texas, as well as from
