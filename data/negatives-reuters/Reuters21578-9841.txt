Automobiles Citroen, a division of
private car group Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.PA>, plans to close its
Levallois plant outside Paris in the first half of 1988,
halting production of the 2-CV small car in France, a
spokeswoman said.
    The 2-CV, France's oldest popular car, was introduced in
1949. It will continue to be produced at Citroen's Portuguese
plant at Mangualde, the spokeswoman said.
    Measures for the 1,090 workers employed at the plant will
include offers of other jobs in the company, help in finding
jobs outside it and financial incentives to return home for
North African workers who make up about half of the workforce.
    "We have always said that when the Levallois plant, which
was built in 1893, could no longer produce cars profitably, we
would close it," the spokeswoman said.
    Sales in France dropped to about 14,008 last year from
26,221 in 1983.
