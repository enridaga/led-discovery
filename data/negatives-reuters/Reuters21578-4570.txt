The U.S. Agriculture Department's
Export Enhancement Program, EEP, contributed to the recent
agreement to include farm subsidies in the new round of global
trade talks, according to the General Accounting Office.
    GAO Senior Associate Director Allan Mendelowitz told a
Senate Agriculture subcommittee that the EEP has increased the
cost of the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy.
    However, there is little reason to believe that once EEP
expires, gains in U.S. farm exports attributable to the program
will be sustained in targeted markets, he said.
    Mendelowitz said broadening the EEP by making it
across-the-board would eliminate charges of discrimination by
traditional buyers and increase pressure on the EC, but
antagonize non-subsidizing exporters.
