South Korea's energy consumption rose nine
pct to 61.07 mln tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) in 1986 from
56.0 mln in 1985, energy ministry officials told Reuters.
    They said oil accounted for 46.7 pct of energy consumption
in 1986 against 48.5 pct in 1985. Anthracite accounted for 21.0
pct against 21.5 pct, bituminous coal 16.5 pct against 17.3 pct
and nuclear power 11.6 pct against 7.5 pct.
    The amount spent on energy imports in 1986 was 4.53 billion
dlrs against 6.54 billion dlrs in 1985, they said, with much of
the difference between the two years due to changes in the
price of oil.
