Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed about 100 mln dlrs of B-minus subordinated debt of
Intelogic Trace Inc.
    S and P cited the end of an attempted takeover of
Burlington Industries Inc by an Asher Edelman-led group in
which Intelogic was used as a financing vehicle. About 78 pct
of Burlington's common shares were tendered to Morgan Stanley
Group Inc, it added.
    S and P said Intelogic's problems expanding its computer
maintenence activities have led to drops in revenues, but
financial resources should remain supportive.
