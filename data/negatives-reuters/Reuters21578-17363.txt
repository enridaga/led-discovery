offer, said it would raise its planned rights issue to raise
213 mln stg instead of 177 mln to finance the deal.

after WPP raised its cash price to 55.5 dlrs a share from 45.0
dlrs, valuing JWT at 566 mln dlrs.
    Under the new rights proposals, WPP shareholders could
apply for new ordinary shares at 875p each on a two-for-one

purchase price would come from a loan facility of up to 260 mln

conditional on the approval of shareholders.

of five new shares for every three held. The revised version
would involve the issue of up to 24.3 mln new shares,
representing 65 pct on the enlarged fully diluted share
capital.
