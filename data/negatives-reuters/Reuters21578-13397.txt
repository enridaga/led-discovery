A British opinion poll showed the ruling
Conservative party was still ahead of Labour and the
Liberal-Social Democratic Alliance, but support appeared to be
declining, raising the spectre of an inconclusive election
result.
    The Marplan poll, to be published in tomorrow's Guardian
newspaper, showed support for the Conservative party stood at
38 pct against 32 pct for Labour and 27 pct for the Alliance.
