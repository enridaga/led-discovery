U.S. Video Vending Corp said it may
have to file for protection under bankruptcy laws if &lt;Hill
International Inc> does not grant U.S. Video's request not to
call a loan due.
    The company said it has asked Hill for forebearance over
the weekend and again this morning, and if its request is not
granted, it expects to make the bankruptcy filing today.
    U.S. Video also said it has reached a preliminary agreement
to acquire Texas Automatic Sprinkler Corp from Mills-Jennings
Co &lt;JKPT> for an undisclosed amount of stock, subject to
approval by U.S. Video shareholders and Hill agreeing not to
call the loan by 1100 EST today.
    Texas Sprinkler had sales of about 15 mln dlrs for the year
ended November 30.
