Audio/Video Affiliates Inc said it
has authorized the purchase of up to 2.5 mln shares of its
common stock, in market transactions, from time to time.
    The company said the purchases were authorized because it
believes the market price of the stock is less than its
underlying value. Audio/Video said general funds of the company
will be used to purchase the shares, and all shares will be
held in the company's treasury, for possible future use.
