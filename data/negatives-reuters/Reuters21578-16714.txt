Zenith Laboratories Inc said it is
discusssing with Squibb Corp's SquibbMark division a three-year
agreement to supply some products to Squibb to sell under a
SquibbMark label.
    Zenith said the deal includes products it already markets
and some that are pending marketing approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
    Zenith also said the proposed agreement is still in
negotiation and subject to approval by senior managements of
Squibb and Zenith.
