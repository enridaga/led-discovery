India's first intercontinental-range
rocket fell into the Bay of Bengal two minutes after launch
yesterday.
    "Disaster struck the Indian space program today," the Press
Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported of the failure of the
rocket at Sriharikota in south India.
    Earlier, the news agency had reported that 460 seconds
after the blast-off the launch vehicle had placed a 145 kg
satellite payload in a 400 km earth orbit.
