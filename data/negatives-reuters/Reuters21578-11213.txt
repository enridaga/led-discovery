The Energy Department issued an
invitation for site proposals from states or others for its 4.4
billion dlr Super Conducting Supercollider atom smasher.
    Department officials said there is expected to be tough
competition for the planned facility, which is being considered
a major scientific plum for the winning community.
    The department said proposals must be in by August three,
under guidelines published in the Federal Register, including
the provision of 16,000 acres of land without charge.
    Among the states already waging campaigns are California,
Colorado, Illinois, Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington.
    A "preferred" site will be selected by July 1988 and the
final site decision made in January 1989.
    Congress has not yet appropriated money for the project,
but if it accepts President Reagan's plan, construction would
begin later in 1989 at a spending rate of about 600 mln dlrs a
year.
    The project is expected to be completed in seven years.
    Department officials said the Supercollider would help man
understand the fundamental nature of matter and energy.
