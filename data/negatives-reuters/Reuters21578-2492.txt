Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
lowered the ratings on about 489 mln dlrs of debt of MCorp and
its subsidiaries.
    Moody's said the change reflects the effect that the
company's difficult operating environment will have on its
asset quality, core earnings and equity base. It said the
firm's asset quality problems are considerable and centered in
its loans to energy and real estate sectors.
    Ratings lowered include MCorp's senior debt to BA-3 from
BAA-2, subordinated debt to B-1 from BAA-3 and preferred stock
to B-2 from BA-1.
