Quantum Corp said it agreed to
settle a suit which charged NEC Corp and its NEC Information
Systems Inc subsidiary with infringing on a Quantum patent for
a disk drive architecture.
    The company said the settlement agreement calls for NEC and
NEC Information to pay a total of 2,975,000 dlrs.
    It said the arrangement follows a recent court order that
granted Quantum's motion for summary judgment and ruled that
NEC infringed on the Quantum patent.
