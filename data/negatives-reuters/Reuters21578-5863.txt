West German new car
registrations in February increased by 31 pct over January's
figure but trailed the February 1986 total by 2.9 pct, the
Federal Motor Office said.
    February new car registrations totalled 190,175 compared
with the year ago figure of 195,852 and last month's 145,122.
    New car registrations in January had fallen 41.6 pct
against December, reflecting the end of tax incentives aimed at
encouraging West Germans to buy cars with catalytic converters.
    The office said total February new vehicle registrations,
including those for trucks and buses, fell to 205,376 from
210,084 in February 1986 but were well above January's 157,357.
