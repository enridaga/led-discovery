Morton Thiokol Inc said it has a
tentative agreement to sell its downtown headquarters to
Tishman Midwest Management Corp for undisclosed terms.
    Thomas Russell, company spokesman, said the proceeds,
representing a non-operating asset, will be reinvested into the
operating part of its business.
    The company will move 700 of its employees to a new
location at the new Northwestern Atrium late this summer. Some
450 employees will move from the headquarters at 110 N. Wacker
Drive and the other 250 will leave another downtown location.
