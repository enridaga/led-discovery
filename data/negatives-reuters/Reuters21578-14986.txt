Rebellious troops in the central
city of Cordoba called off an uprising against President Raul
Alfonsin's government, the army command said.
    Congressional leaders said that it would probably not be
necessary therefore to declare a state of siege.
     Military officers earlier said army units in Buenos Aires
and Misiones provinces had supported the Cordoba regiment, the
focal point of the uprising. The troops were objecting to human
rights trials.
