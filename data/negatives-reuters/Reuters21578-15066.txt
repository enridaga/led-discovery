Ahed Corp said it began discussions
with an investment dealer about issuing an additional one mln
treasury shares in the near future.
    Ahed also said it believes recent increases in its stock
price could be attributable to a published report describing
the activities of the company.
    Ahed said no other events are known to have taken place
which would cause these recent price increases.
