The World Bank said it has loaned
Turkey 325 mln dlrs to help support an energy sector reform
program.
    The loan-supported program hopes to reduce the extensive
public sector involvement in the country's energy production
and supply, the bank said.
    The loan is for 17 years, including four years of grace,
with a variable interest rate, currently 7.92 pct, the bank
said.
