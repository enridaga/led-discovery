Standard and Poor's Corp said it
affirmed at A-1-plus commercial paper of Perkin-Elmer Corp.
    S and P cited expectations of the firm to show sustained
long-term profit improvement after a recent restructuring.
    After two years of lackluster profitability and cuts in
operations, activities concentrated in promising product lines
and reduced the firm's overall cost base, S and P noted.
    It added that cash flow should strengthen due to
anticipated improvement in asset management. Balance sheet
strength should continue with substantial liquidity and debt to
total capital at 22 pct as of July 31, S and P said.
