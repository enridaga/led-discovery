Italian President Francesco Cossiga asked
veteran Christian Democrat politician Giulio Andreotti to try
to form a new government, officials said.
    They said Andreotti had reserved his reply on whether to
accept the mandate, normal procedure until he has ascertained
whether he can form a government.
    Cossiga nominated Andreotti, sole candidate of the majority
Christian Democrats, despite stiff opposition from the
Socialists of outgoing Prime Minister Bettino Craxi.
