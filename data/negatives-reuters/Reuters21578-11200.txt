The Democratic-controlled House
Budget Committee neared approval, over Republican objections,
of a trillion dlr budget plan for 1988.
    Committee Chairman William Gray said he wanted approval
later today of the Democratic-written document, which would
produce a deficit of about 133 billion dlrs using Congressional
Budget Office estimates.
    However, Gray said using President Reagan's economic
assumptions, the plan would show a deficit of 108 billion dlrs
to meet the Gramm-Rudman budget law target. Republicans
protested they had not seen the plan until today.
