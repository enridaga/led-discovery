Some 60 pct of 6,300 employees at
Spain's 27 major ports have supported a strike since Monday in
support of wage negotiations, a spokesman for the Public Works
Ministry said.
    He said, however, that the stoppage has had no effect in
Barcelona, Bilbao, Las Palmas and Pasajes and that mandatory
minimum services in other ports allowed perishable goods to be
handled.
    The strike is due to continue tomorrow with work resuming
on Friday.
