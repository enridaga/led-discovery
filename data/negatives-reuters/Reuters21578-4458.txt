Lanesborough Corp is raising 50 mln
dlrs via an offering of senior subordinated notes due 1997 with
a 12-3/8 pct coupon and par pricing, said sole manager First
Boston Corp.
    Non-callable for five years, the debt is rated Caa by
Moody's Investors Service Inc and B-minus by Standard and
Poor's Corp.
    The issue was increased from an initial offering of 40 mln
dlrs because of investor demand for high-yield securities.
