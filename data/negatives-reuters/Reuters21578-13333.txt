Public Service Co of Colorado said it has
reached a preliminary agreement to resolve a territorial
dispute with Union Rural Electric Association of Brighton,
Colo.
    The company said, "The tentative agreement protects Union's
boundaries and also would set in motion a vote of Union's
membership, which could lead to acquisition of Union by Public
Service Co."
    Union provides electrical service to about 14,000 members
in cities and rural areas north of Denver.
    The company said the settlement, which is pending before
the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, is under review by
the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, which
supplies power to Union, and is subject to approval by the
Public Service Colorado board and Union's membership. It also
will be discussed with the Colorado Rural Electric Association.
    It said legislation that would halt the acquisition of
electric utility service territories by annexation will remain
active in the Colorado House of Representatives until Union and
Public Service assure legislators they are in agreement.
