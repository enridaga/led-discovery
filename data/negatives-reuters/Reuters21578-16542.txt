Robert Salomon, managing director of
Salomon Inc, said the company's second quarter is "likely to be
comfotrably in the black, but down from the comparable year-ago
quarter," when Salomon earned 117 mln dlrs or 78 cts a share on
a primary basis.
    "Its been a difficult quarter," Salomon told Reuters,
adding that financial analysts today lowered their second
quarter earnings estimate for the company to 30 cts to 50 cts
per share from a range of 75 cts to 80 cts a share.
    Salomon's stock closed at 34-3/4, off one, on heavy
trading.
   
    Salomon said he was deluged with calls from analysts after
yesterday's announcement by First Boston Inc &lt;FBC> that it will
report a loss for the second quarter due to steep losses in the
bond market during April.
    Salomon acknowledged that the quarter was "difficult" but
said the company will report a profit for the period.
