Worsening drought conditions in Peking
may force the authorities to ration water for industry and
farming this summer, the New China news Agency said.
    The agency quoted city officials as saying rainfall last
year was 75 millimetres lower than in 1985, and its two main
reservoirs are now only one-quarter full.
    Peking's underground water level is 60 centimetres lower
than last year, reducing daily supplies by 50,000 tons.
    The officials said daily water supplies in urban Peking
will fall 160,000 to 260,000 tons short of demand during the
hottest days this summer.
    They called for stricter control of water consumption and
greater recycling of water, adding that there was no hope of
alleviating the shortage until a new water mill starts up in
one year's time.
