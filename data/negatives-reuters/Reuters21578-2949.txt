Holiday Corp said its Holiday Inn
Hotel Group will soon introduce a chain of limited-service
hotels in international markets.
    The company said the chain, which will be launched
initially in Western Europe, will usually feature 60 to 150
guest rooms and a small restuarant/lounge area, but will offer
fewer services and amenities than typical Holiday Inn hotels.
    It said the new hotels will cater to commercial travelers
in smaller cities and suburbs.
