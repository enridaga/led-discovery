Portugal's minority centre-right
government was ousted in a parliamentary censure vote backed by
three left-wing opposition parties.
    President Mario Soares, who returns from a visit to Brazil
on Sunday, now faces the task of either forming a new
government or calling an early general election.
    The Socialist Party, Democratic Renewal Party and Communist
Party, with 140 of the 250 parliamentary seats, voted for the
motion against the ruling Social Democratic Party and its
Christian Democrat allies.
