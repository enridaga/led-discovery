U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng, reacting to recent criticism of U.S. meat inspection,
defended the program saying the United States has the best
inspection system in the world.
    Speaking to representatives of the U.S. National
Cattlemen's Association, NCA, Lyng attacked what he called
recent "terribly biased" press reports critical of USDA poultry
inspection. He cited a report on CBS "60 Minutes" which
criticized USDA salmonella detection in poultry.
    "I know we have the finest meat and poultry inspection
system in the world," Lyng told the cattlemen.
    Lyng said USDA makes every effort to minimize the levels of
salmonella in poultry, but added "the total elimination of
harmful bacteria is virtually impossible in this world."
