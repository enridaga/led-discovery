McDonnell Douglas said it will open a
regional office in New York, occupying 38,366 square feet in
midtown Manhattan.
    It said the office will bring together about 100  employees
in its Information Systems Group who currently work at three
separate New York offices. The group had 1986 sales of 1.2
billion dlrs.
    McDonnell said the move follows a series of similar
consolidations in San Jose and San Francisco, Calif., Atlanta,
and Denver to reduce costs and consolidate the group's
operations in major metropolitan areas.
