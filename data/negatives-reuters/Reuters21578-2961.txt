Oglethorpe Power Corp said it does not
plan to raise its electric rates to cover higher construction
costs at the Alvin W. Vogtle Nuclear Plant, in which Oglethorpe
holds a 30 pct interest.
    Earlier today, Southern Co's &lt;SO> Georgia Power Co said it
raised the estimated cost of building the plant by nearly six
pct, to roughly 8.87 billion dlrs.
    Oglethope said its share of the increased costs amounts to
about 147.5 mln dlrs. "We do not plan to raise rates to the 39
Electric Membership Corporations we serve in 1987 as a result
of this budget increase," the company said.
