International Cablecasting Technologies
Inc, said it introduced its proprietary new technology that can
broadcast compact disk-quality digital sound into the home.
    The company said the new technology, called digital
modulation, permits noise-free, undistorted transmission of 10
channels of pure digital sound or data via satellite and cable
into subscribers' homes, all on a single video channel.
   
    According to the company, the first consumer service to be
offered by International via the new technology will be
SuperSound, a package of eight 24-hour commercial-free digital
uninterrupted music channels to subscribers.
    International said the SuperSound service is expected to be
launched in late 1987 and generally available by early 1988.
