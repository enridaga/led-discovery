The British Broadcasting Corporation
declined comment on rumours circulating in the London Stock
Exchange that it would release an opinion poll tonight showing
the Conservative and Labour parties running level in marginal
seats. The general election is set for June 11.
    The rumour was cited by several market dealers as a factor
contributing to this afternoon's slide in share prices. The
FTSE 100 share index in late afternoon was down 7.4 points at
2,220.7, having earlier touched a new record of 2,248.8.
    Nationally, most polls put the Conservatives nine to 10
points ahead, enough for a comfortable election victory
