The World Bank, citing Pakistan"s progress
in its economic performance and fiscal policy reforms, said it
had agreed a 2.4 billion dlr aid programme for 1988.
    The bank said in a statement "substantial increases" had been
approved to help fund support for refugees from neighbouring
Afghanistan.
    But the bank said it had expressed serious concern at
Pakistan"s budget. "This year"s overall budget deficit is expected
to be larger than either either last year"s outcome or the
amount originally budgeted (for 1987)," it added.
