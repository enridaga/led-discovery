U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
Yeutter said he doubted Japan could avoid the April 17
imposition of U.S. tariffs on its semiconductor products.
    The three high-level Japanese government representatives
who would be coming here in the next few days to discuss the
issue would probably be unable to show evidence of continued
compliance with the semiconductor trade agreement, Yeutter told
reporters.
    "It would be impossible to provide evidence of compliance
with the agreement" based on sales of only a few days time, he
said.
    Asked by reporters if the sanctions were 100 pct certain
for April 17, he said, "One could never foreclose all options.
We have an obligation to listen to the arguments our trading
partners make."
    He said the length of the sanctions will be determined by
Japan and Japanese semiconductor firms.
    "They would be lifted only when persuasive evidence provided
demonstrates compliance," he said.
    "Whether a few weeks or a few months depends on their
actions," Yeutter added.
