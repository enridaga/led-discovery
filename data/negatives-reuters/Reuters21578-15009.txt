The Belgian National Bank said it cut
its one, two and three month treasury certificate rates
effective immediately.
    It said in a telex message the key three month rate was
reduced by 0.05 points to 7.25 pct, the two month rate by 0.10
points to 7.20 pct and the one month rate by 0.15 points to
7.15 pct.
    The Bank last adjusted its short-term treasury certificate
rates on April 3, when all three rates were cut by 0.10 points.
    It has made regular small reductions in rates after
hoisting the three month rate 0.50 points to 7.90 pct and the
other rates to eight pct on January 6 ahead of the realignment
of the European Monetary System.
    The National Bank bought more than 7.91 billion francs of
foreign currency in the week ended April 13, a National Bank
spokesman said last week. Foreign exchange analysts noted this
reflects the current strength of the Belgian franc.
