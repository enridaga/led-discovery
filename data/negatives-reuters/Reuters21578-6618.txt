A coupon of 1/2 pct, equal to the lowest
ever in the Swiss franc market, has been set for Sumitomo
Corp's 200 mln franc convertible notes due September 30, 1992,
lead manager Swiss Bank Corp said.
     The conversion price has been set at 1,004 yen, a 3.93 pct
premium over today's 966 yen close. The exchange rate has been
set at 99.78 yen to the franc.
    The issue, whose coupon was indicated at 5/8 pct, carries a
put option after three years at 103 pct. Payment date is March
30.
