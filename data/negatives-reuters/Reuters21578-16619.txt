Aid donors to Indonesia pledged a
total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a
statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter
Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.
    This compares with 2.6 billion dlrs allocated at last
year's meeting, the statement said. It is also well above the
World Bank's recommendation of 2.5 billion guilders in aid for
the coming year.
    "The Group commended Indonesia for having taken effective
steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," the
statement said.
    The statement said Indonesia must take further steps to set
the stage for resumed economic growth that could create
employment for the country's rapidly growing labour force.
    "These measures include additional significant trade and
industrial deregulation," the statement said.
    It also called for policies supporting efficient and
diversified growth of agriculture, and said Jakarta should give
more room to the private sector. It called on Indonesia to
mobilise more domestic resources to finance development
programs.
