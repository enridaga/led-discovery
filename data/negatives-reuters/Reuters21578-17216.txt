Gynex Laboratories Inc said it
signed an agreement under which Warner-Lambert Co's Chilcott
Laboratories division will market Gynex's line of generic oral
contraceptives.
    Gynex Labs is a 50/50 joint venture owned by Gynex and
Watson Laboratories Inc, a privately-held pharmaceutical
company bnased on Corona, California.
    Marketing by Warner Chilcott is currently scheduled to
begin during the third quarter of 1987, it said.
    Gynex signed a similar marketing agreement with Monsanto
Co's &lt;MTC> G.D. Searle and Co subsidiary in February 1986,
which was terminated last April following a recall of the oral
contraceptives due to packaging problems.
