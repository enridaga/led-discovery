The former chairman of Peoples National
Bank of Rockland County, N.Y., pleaded guilty to charges of
bribery and income tax evasion.
    Leonard Slutsky, 41, faces up to five years in prison on
each of two counts of bank bribery and tax evasion. He could
also be fined up to 745,000 dlrs.
    In his guilty plea before Judge Charles Brieant of the
White Plains, N.Y. branch of U.S. District Court, Slutsky
admitted accepting payments from a tax shelter promoter.
Peoples had lent money to investors in the tax shelter. The
bank was declared insolvent in September, 1984.
    Another former official of the bank, Samuel Yonnone, 37,
pled guilty today to conspiring to accept money from a broker
to make false entries in the bank's books. Yonnone, who was
senior vice president of the bank, faces five years in jail and
a 250,000 dlr fine.
    The 41-year-old Slutksy admitted accepting 165,000 dlrs in
bribes.
