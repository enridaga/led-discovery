The Reserve Bank said it has
cancelled the regular weekly treasury bill tender scheduled for
March 17.
    It said in a statement that forecasts show a net cash
withdrawal from the system. Cash flows, which include
half-yearly provisional and terminal tax payments, are expected
to more than offset cash injections.
    Cash balances should fluctuate around 30 mln N.Z. Dlrs over
the week after open market operations, it added.
