Westphalia is raising 1.2 billion marks through a 10-year
domestic bond with a coupon of 6-1/8 pct and priced at 100.20,
lead manager Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, WestLB,
said.
    The bonds yield 6.10 pct at issue, and will be sold from
April 2 to 7. Payment date is April 17, and the bond matures on
the same date in 1997. Some one billion marks will be issued
for immediate sale, and the remaining 200 mln marks will be set
aside for market regulation.
    Listing will be on all eight West German exchanges.
