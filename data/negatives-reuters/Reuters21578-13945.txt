Delta Air Lines said it filed with the
U.S. Department of Transportation its application for one-stop
service from Portland, Ore, to Seoul, Korea, via Tokyo.
    If all government approvals are given promptly, Delta said
service could begin by July One, 1987.
    Delta said it started service from Portland to Tokyo on
March two and operates five weekly round trips. It will
increase service to six flights on June One, and plans daily
service by 1988, Delta said.
