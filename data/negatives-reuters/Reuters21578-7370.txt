U.S. arms negotiator Max Kampelman
suffered a mild heart attack, an aide said.
    Nancy Tackett, Kampleman's staff assistant, told Reuters
Kampelman was doing well and was expected to leave George
Washington Hospital in about a week.
    "A full recovery is expected," she said.
    Kampelman did not feel well yesterday and may have
sufffered the heart attack then, Tackett said. He had a
regularly-scheduled physical this morning and entered the
hospital after that, on his doctor's advice, she said.
      A hospital spokesman confirmed that Kampelman was a
patient in the coronary care unit.
