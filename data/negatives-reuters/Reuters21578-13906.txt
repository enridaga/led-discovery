Nutmeg Industries Inc said it has
agreed in principle on a license deal with United Media/United
Feature Syndicate Inc under which it would have the right to
sell a line of men's spectator sportswear bearing the
likenesses of characters from Charles M. Schulz' "Peanuts"
comic strip.
    The company said the license runs through December 1988 and
has renewal options for two more years.
