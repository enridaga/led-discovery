American Petrofina Inc said its auditor,
Peat Marwick Mitchell and Co, has qualified its opinion of the
company's annual report because of the unknown impact of the
U.S. Energy Department's investigation into crude oil trading
activities which occurred during the 1979-1981 period.
    American Petrofina, which is controled by &lt;Petrofina SA>,
said it believes it has good and meritorious defenses to any
possible claim resulting from the ongoing investigation.
