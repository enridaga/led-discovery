General Electric Co said it and
Alsthom of France are developing a 200 megawatt gas turbine
that will be the most powerful combustion turbine in the world,
the MS9001F.
    The company said when used in a combined cycle application,
the power plant efficiency will exceed 50 pct.
    The company said it will offer the turbine exclusively for
50 hertz electrical system markets.  Most of the world, except
the U.S. and several other countries, use the 50 hertz system,
it said.  It said Alsthom, its licensee in France, is
codeveloper and comanufacturer of the first unit.
    GE said the first of the turbines will be installed for
Electricite de France's grid.
