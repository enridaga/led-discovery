Senate Banking committee chairman
William Proxmire, D-Wis, said no date had been set for Alan
Greenspan's confirmation hearing as Federal Reserve chairman
because the White House had not formally sent his nomination to
the Senate.
    Proxmire said in an interview that as soon as the White
House completed its clearence procedures and sent Greenspan's
name to the Senate, he would schedule a hearing on the
replacement for Paul Volcker. The committee and the full Senate
must confirm Greenspan.
    Volcker's term expires in August.
