Combustion Engineering Inc said
the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand has exercised
an option to purchase a 300 megawatt coal-fired steam generator
from CEMAR, a consortium of Combustion Engineering Canada Inc
and Japan's Marubeni Corp.
    Combustion Engineering said the project is valued at about
30 mln dlrs.
    The new steam generator, which will burn local lignite,
will be manufactured in Canada and installed as Unit Nine at
the Mae Moh power station in Lampang, Thailand. The unit is
expected to go into commercial operation in 1990.
