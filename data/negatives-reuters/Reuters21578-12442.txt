Comex silver futures opened 15 to 18
cents higher and then retreated slightly as followthrough
buying slowed.
    May was up 12.5 cents at 6.705 dlrs from a high of 6.75
dlrs. July was up 13.1 cents at 6.785 dlrs from 6.84 dlrs.
    Traders said large commission houses were buyers on the
open but encountered profit-taking and a slowdown in orders.
    Some traders said the market is starting to look overbought
technically and vulnerable to a correction.
    But they added that speculators continue to view the market
as a good buy relative to gold.
