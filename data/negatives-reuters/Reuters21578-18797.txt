Two congressmen urged President Reagan
to to call congressional leaders to a domestic economic summit
to settle budget and trade matters they said contributed to the
stock market fall.
    Noting the nosediving New York Stock Exchange, Rep David
Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat and former chairman of the
Congressional Economic Committee, said "for the last five years
this economic recovery has been running on borrowed money and
borrowed time."
    In another House speech, Democrat Donald Pease of Ohio said
a domestic economic summit was "desperately needed."
