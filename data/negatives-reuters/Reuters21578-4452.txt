West Germany and Sierra Leone signed an
agreement to reschedule 26 mln marks of principal and interest
payments on loans, the West German Foreign Ministry said.
    A statement said the agreement related to interest and
principle and obligations from previous reschedulings due
between July 1, 1986 and November 13, 1987 as well as arrears
from the period up to June 30, 1986.
    The statement said the payments were rescheduled for 1992
to 1996 under the accord, which followed a multilateral
rescheduling pact agreed by "Paris Club" creditor nations on
November 19, 1986.
