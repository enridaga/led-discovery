CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> said it will sell its
head office group of five buildings in central Sydney as part
of plans to decentralise.
    The 2,750 square metre site will be repurchased under
existing lease-back agreements and then sold by public tender,
it said in a statement.
    CSR's sugar and oil divisions have already moved to
Brisbane and the company said it plans further moves from
central Sydney to reduce its head office staff to about 100
from 550.
