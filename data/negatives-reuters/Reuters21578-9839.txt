Yugoslav banks said they will raise
interest rates sharply on savings accounts from April 1.
    The Association of Yugoslav Banks said interest rates on
six month deposit accounts will be raised to 81 pct from 51
pct, 12 month deposits to 84 pct from 61 pct, two year deposits
to 86 from 64 pct and three years to 88 from 66 pct.
    The increase is in line with Prime Minister Branko
Mikulic's policy of bringing interest rates closer to the rate
of inflation which is approaching 100 pct.
