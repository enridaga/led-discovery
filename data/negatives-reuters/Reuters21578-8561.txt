&lt;Rolls-Royce Ltd> said it signed an
agreement with the Boeing Company &lt;BA.N> to install its RB
211-524 D4D engine on the B767 family of aircraft.
    The engine, currently under development, will be ready for
service by early 1990, the company said in a statement.
    Boeing 747s are also powered with the engine, and its use
in B767 craft too could bring significant operating benefits,
Rolls-Royce said.
