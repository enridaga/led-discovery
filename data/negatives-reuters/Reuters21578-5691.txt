MacMillan Bloedel
Ltd said it increased its current newsprint list price for
customers in the United States by 30 U.S. dlrs a tonne,
effective July 1, 1987.
    Standard white 30 pound newsprint sold through sales unit
Powell River-Alberni Sales Corp will increase to 600 U.S.dlrs a
tonne from 570 U.S. dlrs a ton, MacMillan Bloedel said.
    It also said a five pct temporary competitive allowance
introduced on Dec 1, 1985, will be reduced to three pct, while
a five pct contract performance incentive program introduced
July 1, 1983 will remain in effect.
    MacMillan Bloedel said customers who annually purchase 100
pct against their contract will receive the five pct discount
under the contract performance incentive program plus the three
pct discount under the temporary competitive allowance, against
the new 600 U.S. dlr a tonne newsprint price.
    The company said it is restoring margins on newsprint and
groundwood printing papers so it can continue expanding and
upgrading its pulp and paper facilities.
