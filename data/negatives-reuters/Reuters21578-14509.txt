BankEast Corp &lt;BENH> said a state
Superior Court enjoined &lt;Suncook Bank> from delivering any
notices of shareholder meetings until it produces a shareholder
list.
    The order effectively prevents Suncook from holding any
shareholder meetings until BankEast has a copy of its
shareholder list, BankEast said.
    The order also gives BankEast, which is eyeing a takeover
of the bank, 30 days to communicate with its shareholders of
Suncook, it said.
    BankEast, which said it is a substantial stockholder in
Suncook Bank, said the order came from the Merrimack County
Superior Court.
    At the same time, it said the Bank of New Hampshire Corp's 
&lt;BNHC> Bank of New Hampshire also has made a bid for Suncook
Bank.
