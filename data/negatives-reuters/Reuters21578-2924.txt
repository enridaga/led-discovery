RLR Financial Serivces Inc said
the National Association of Securities Dealers intends to
delist it because the NASD beleieves market sales of RLR's
broker/dealer subsidiary, RLR Securities Group Inc, are not
being made under an effective registration statement, as
required by the Securities Act of 1933.
    RLR said the NASD intends to delist it on March 12 unless
RLR demonstrates compliance with the law.
    RLR said it believes the action is without merit because
there is an effective registration statement for the RLR
Financial securities involved, and it intends to defend itself
in the matter.
    RLR said it has asked the NASD to stay any deletion of its
securities from NASDAQ pending its continuous review of the
matter and a possibility of a hearing on the merits.
    RLR said it has stopped market making in its own securities
pending resolution of the matter.  It said a delisting from
NASDAQ could have an adverse effect on the market and prices
for its securities.
