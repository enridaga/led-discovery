House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
the House would vote by a substantial margin to block 40 mln
dlrs in aid to the Nicaraguan "contra" rebels until President
Reagan has accounted for previous assistance.
    Wright, a Texas Democrat, conceded Congress ultimately will
be unable to stop the money but said the House vote expected
later today will tell the White House its contra program -- one
of Reagan's pet projects -- is in trouble.
    "The adminstration must face reality and focus on other ways
to find peace," Wright said.
    The House is voting on legislation that would block for six
months 40 mln dlrs appropriated last year. The administration
has said it intends to start using the money next month to
provide arms and equipment to the rebels.
    "We expect to win by a substantial margin," Wright said.
    The legislation calls on Reagan to account for all previous
aid, including money diverted to the contras from the secret
U.S. arms sales to Iran. The scandal over the arms sales and
the diversion of profits to the contras has plunged the Reagan
administration into its deepest crisis.
    The legislation also demands an accounting of 27 mln dlr in
humanitarian aid appropriated by Congress in 1985 and all funds
given to the contras by foreign governments or private
individuals at the urging of the Reagan administration.
