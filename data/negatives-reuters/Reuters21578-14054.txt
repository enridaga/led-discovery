Diana Corp said it organized the
Stockholders Protective Committee of Freedom Federal Savings
Bank to nominate two candidates for election to the Freedom
board at the April 20 annual meeting.
    It said the committee's nominees, Richard Fisher, Diana
chairman and Harold Sampson, a Diana director, will oppose
nominees of the present board of directors.
    Diana, which is 60 pct owned by Farm House Foods Corp
&lt;FHFC>, owns 105,554 shares of Freedom Federal common stock.
    Diana noted that Freedom Federal's board recently declared
a distribution of Preferred Stock Purchase Rights "with the aid
of which such directors might disapprove, and perhaps prevent,
possible acquisition offers or substantial stock accumulations,
regardless of how beneficial they might be to the
stockholders."
    The company said "we want to increase the responsiveness of
the (Freedom Federal) board to stockholder concerns."
