Bobbie Brooks Inc said its board
approved a defensive common stock purchase rights plan.
    Under the plan, shareholders will receive one common shares
purchase right March 31 on each outstanding share of record on
that date.
    Each right entitles shareholders to buy one share of common
stock at an exercise price of 4.50 dlrs. The rights are
exercisable only if a person acquires 20 pct or more of the
company's common stock.
    Bobbie Brooks said the rights are not being distributed in
response to any specific takeover effort.
