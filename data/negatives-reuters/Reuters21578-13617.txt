Galaxy Oil Co said its
common stock and nine pct convertible subordinated debentures
due 1994 are being delisted from the &lt;American Stock Exchange>
because the company no longer meets listing criteria.
    Galaxy filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on April Six.
    The company said trading in both issues will be suspended
by the Amex at the close on May One but is expected to start
elsewhere on May Four.
