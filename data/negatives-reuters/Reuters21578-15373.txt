White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater declined to comment on the continuing slide of the
dollar against the Japanese yen, but said Treasury Secretary
James Baker was watching developments.
    "Jim Baker is monitoring that at the Treasury Department,
but at this point we don't have any comment to make on the
dollar," Fitzwater told reporters.
    He was asked at a briefing whether the White House was
concerned about the continuing decline in the dollar's value.
