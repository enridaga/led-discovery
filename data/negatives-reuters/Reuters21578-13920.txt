Endotronics Inc said Richard
Sakowicz has been named president, chief executive officer and
a director, effective April 13.
    Sakowicz, recently vice president at Control Data Corp
&lt;CDA>, succeeds John Wright who will be resigning, it said.
    In other action, the company said that Burton Merical has
been retained as a consultant to provide management and
financial advisory services and to act as chief financial
officer.  Merical has provided consulting services to companies
who have successfully reorganized under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings, Endotronics noted.
    In late March, Endotronics reported that its auditing firm
said its opinion for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1986
"should no longer be relied upon." The company also reported at
the time, that it was the subject of a formal private
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
