Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis,
a newcomer to national politics, ended weeks of speculation
with the announcement he plans to seek the 1988 Democratic
presidential nomination.
    Dukakis said he had authorized the formation of a
presidential campaign committee and would make a formal
announcement of candidacy in Boston on May 4.
    The 53-year-old Dukakis is serving his third term as
governor. He was reelected with 67 per cent of the vote last
November.
