Endotronics Inc said because of its
decisions to discontinue development of health care products,
reorganize under Chapter 11 and establish adequate allowances
for uncollectible receivables, it expects to establish reserves
totaling about 11 mln dlrs in the March 31 second quarter.
    The company said it plans to seek buyers for health care
technologies including proprietary rights to a Hepatitis B
Vaccine and technologies related to LAK cell cancer
immunotherapy.
