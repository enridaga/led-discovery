NYNEX Corp will urge the U.S.
District Court to approve Justice Department recommendations
easing restrictions on offering new services by regional
telephone firms, chairman Delbert Staley said.
    "While NYNEX would have prefered the unqualified lifting of
all of the Modified Final Judgement restrictions, we intend to
urge Judge (Harold) Greene to act as quickly as possible to
approve the recommendations," Staley told a news conference.
    NYNEX will file its comments with the U.S. District Court
on Friday, he said.
    Staley referred to Justice Department recommendations to
Greene last month that restrictions on manufacturing,
information services and out-of-region, long-distance service
be eliminated.
    Referring to information services, Staley said, "That
certainly is one area we would quickly move into."
    Electronic mail, voice mail and videotext are some of the
services NYNEX could offer, he added.
    NYNEX disagreed with the department's recommendation to
retain restrictions on long-distance service within a local
service region, Staley said.
    The company would like to have the option of providing
long-distance service within and outside its region, he said.
    "Our entry in long-distance would further stimulate
competition," Staley said.
    "We believe it would put downward pressure on consumer
costs."
