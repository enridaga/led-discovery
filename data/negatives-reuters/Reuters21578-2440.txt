Standard and Poor's Corp said it raised
to BBB-plus from BBB Public Service Co of Indiana's first
mortgage bonds.

company has one billion dlrs of debt outstanding.
    S and P cited continuing improvement in earnings protection
measures because of a 1986 emergency rate increase.
    While various writeoffs related to the abandoned Marble

retention of all common earnings until at least 1989 will help
restore capital structure balance fairly quickly, S/P said.
