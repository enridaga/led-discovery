The U.S. Treasury said it will
auction 25 billion dlrs of two, four and seven-year notes next
week to raise a total of 9.275 billion dlrs of new cash.
    The financing will begin with the monthly auction on
Tuesday, March 24 of 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes. That
will be followed on Wednesday and Thursday by respective
quarterly sales of 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes and
7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes to refund 15.72 billion
dlrs of two-year and four-year notes maturing March 31.
    The two-year notes mature March 31, 1989. The four-years
mature March 31, 1991 with the seven-years due April 15, 1994.
    The two-year notes will be issued in minimum denominations
of 5,000 dlrs and the four- and seven-year notes will be in
minimum denominations of 1,000 dlrs.
    The two-year notes and the four-year notes will be issued
March 31 and the seven-year notes April 1.
    The Treasury said non-competitive bids will be accepted for
all three issues.
