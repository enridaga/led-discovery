Gabelli Equity Trust Inc said it
intends to repurchase up to one mln shares of its common in the
open market or in privately negotiated transactions as its
shares are trading at a discount of more than 10 pct from net
asset value.
    There are currently 44.0 mln shares outstanding.
    Gabelli's board had previously granted authority for the
stock repurchase.
