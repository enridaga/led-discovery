Teleglobe Canada Inc, owned by Memotec
Data Inc (MDI.M), said it received an order from Credit
Lyonnais Canada for a direct satellite link between Canada and
France that will be the first private satellite network between
the two countries.
    Value of the contract was undisclosed.
    Teleglobe said the connection will provide the bank with a
permanent link to the digital phone switch at its parent
company's Paris headquarters and connect it with Credit
Lyonnais' network in France and the rest of the world.
