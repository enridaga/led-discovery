Business leaders' confidence in the U.S.
economy has improved slightly, but many top executives express
concern about prospects for the second half of this year, the
Conference Board said.
    The board's measure of business confidence closed at 55 in
the 1987 first quarter, up from 51 in the 1986 fourth quarter.
    However, the Board said virtually all of the gain reflected
optimism about current conditions rather than prospects for the
last half of 1987. The survey covers over 1,000 chief
executives and other top-level executives, representing a wide
cross section of business.
