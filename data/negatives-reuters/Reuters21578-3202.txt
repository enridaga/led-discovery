Lending by the World Bank and its soft
loan arm, the International Development Agency (IDA), to China
is expected to almost double to about two billion dlrs by
1989/90 from the levels of 1984 to 1986, foreign bankers told
Reuters.
    They said approved lending in 1986/87 (July-June) is
expected to total 1.4 billion dlrs, of which 550 mln will come
from the IDA and 850 mln from the World Bank.
    World Bank figures show approved lending to China by the
two bodies amounted to 1.137 billion in 1985/86, 1.102 billion
in 1984/85 and 1.04 billion in 1983/84.
    The bankers said that 1.2 billion dlrs had been disbursed
by the end of 1986 and China's disbursement record compares
very favourably with that of other countries.
    They said Japan has so far been the main source of
bilateral concessional assistance for China, followed by West
Germany, Canada, Italy, Australia and Britain.
    But China will probably find that such funds will not
increase, except for those from Japan and the World Bank, given
other claims, particularly from sub-Saharan African countries
which cannot raise commercial credits, they added.
