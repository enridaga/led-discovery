Sealed Power Corp, an automotive parts
producer and distributor, said its Kent-Moore Group has signed
a memorandum of understanding with General Motors which would
allow the group to distribute and market GM's Dealer Equipment
service.
    Sealed Power said the GM Dealer Equipment service evaluates
various types of equipment for GM dealerships, authorizes
suppliers to produce certain GM-branded items, merchandises GM
and other selected equipment to dealers and consults with
dealers on their service systems requirements.
    "Kent-Moore will assume responsibility for the advertised
dealer contact number...providing 'one stop shopping' for both
special tools and state-of-the-art service equipment," Robert
Bishop, Sealed Power group vice president, said.
    GM Dealer Equipment will continue to evaluate and select
the major service equipment items and the "GM Dealer Equipment"
logo will still be used on specified service equipment, Sealed
Power said.
