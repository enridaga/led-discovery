FPL Group Inc shut down a nuclear reactor
at its Turkey Point power plant after engineers discovered a
tiny leak of radioactive water from the pressure vessel
surrounding the reactor core, a company spokeswoman said.
    FPL spokeswoman Stacey Shaw said FPL shut down Turkey Point
Unit Four voluntarily to repair the leak, which she described
as "a tablespoon full of water that never posed any danger to
the plant or the public."
    The nuclear reactor -- one of two at the site south of
Miami -- was already partially shut down for the repair of a
leaky pressure valve discovered on Wednesday.
    Shaw said the reactor was expected to be back on line in
about a week.
