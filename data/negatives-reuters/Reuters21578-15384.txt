Brunswick Corp said its first-quarter
sales and profits hit records despite an after-tax charge of
about 10 mln dlrs from its new boat-building units.
    The 10 mln dlrs charge, or 22 cts a share, was for
amortization of intangible assets at Bayliner and Sea Ray, two
boatmakers acquired in December, a spokesman told Reuters.
    Earlier it said net profits for the period were 34.7 mln or
78 cts a share versus 23.8 mln or 57 cts a share a year ago.
Its Mercury unit's first-quarter sales increased 26 pct and
operating earnings rose 19 pct, while its industrial products
unit operated at a slight loss, it said.
