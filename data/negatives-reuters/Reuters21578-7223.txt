Banco di Roma (London branch) has
arranged a 200 mln dlr nominal Euro-commercial paper program,
Swiss Bank Corporation International Ltd said as sold dealer.
    The borrower will be able to issue paper with maturities of
seven to 365 days in other avialable currencies, such as
European Currency Units. However, it could not issue sterling
commercial paper because Bank of England rules prohibit an
issuer of certificates of deposit to issue paper denominated in
stg. Banco di Roma (London branch) has a certificate of deposit
program in the market under which the securities are traded.
The program will be aimed at end investor placement.
