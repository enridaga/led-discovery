Bausch and Lomb said it plans to
launch a new line of soft contact lens care products in the
United States.
    The company said the line will be marketed under the ReNu
tradename, and will involve fomulations which will
enhance the convenience of contact lens cleaning and
disinfecting.
    Bausch and Lomb said the two products, which are scheduled
for shipment in late July, are ReNu Multi-Action Disinfecting
Solution and ReNu Sterile Preserved Saline.
   
    According to the company, the ReNu disinfecting solution is
a single-step product for cold disinfection and the ReNu saline
solution contains a new preservative with very low potential
for eye irritation.
    The company said another product in this line, ReNu
Enzymatic Tablets, was introduced in December.
    Additionally, the company said patents are currently
pending on all three ReNu products, and that other solutions
will be added to the ReNu line following Food and Drug
Administration approval.
