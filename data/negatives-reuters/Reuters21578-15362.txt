An explosion rocked a building at the
U.S. military office in Manila but there were no immediate
reports of casualties, a police spokesman said tonight.
    He said investigators were still looking into the explosion
inside the motor pool building of the Joint United States
Military Assistance Group (JUSMAG) in a Manila suburb.
    Home-made bombs were thrown into the JUSMAG compound last
July causing minor damage.
