LME zinc was quiet throughout the morning
with very little dealing after some light trade selling on the
pre-market, dealers said.
    Three months delivery ended official ring dealings quoted
at 454.50/455 stg a tonne, down around two stg from yesterday
afternoon's kerb close.
    The pre-market dollar based trade selling pushed three
months down to a 730 dlrs equivalent but attracted no follow
through selling and the price held at that level for the rest
of the morning.
