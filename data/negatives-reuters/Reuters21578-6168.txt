Scott Paper Co said it will spend
70 mln dlrs to upgrade pulping facilities at its paper plant in
Westbrook, Me.
    The company said the effort is part of its plan to reduce
costs by increasing the integration of its pulping facilities
with its papermaking operations.
    Construction is expected to start in early April with
completion of the entire project scheduled for the end of 1988,
the company said.
