Henley Group said it has not hired
Bear Stearns and Co in connection with Santa Fe Southern
Pacific Corp &lt;SFX>, a Henley spokesman said.
    Traders have said in the past two sessions that it seems
Bear Stearns was restricted in both Santa Fe Southern and
Henley, implying that Bear Stearns may be helping Henley
examine the possibility of taking over Santa Fe.
    "We don't have them looking into anything, including Santa
Fe," a spokesman said, in response to questions from Reuters.
    Bear Stearns has declined comment.
    Traders said there was also speculation that Henley was a
buyer of Santa Fe stock in the last two days.
    Henley said it does not comment on whether it is buying or
selling stock in a company.
    Separately, Wall Street sources said the reports of Henley
acquiring Santa Fe stock in recent sessions are untrue. Henley
has told the securities and exchange commission that it bought
about five pct of Santa Fe stock last year.
    Santa Fe was up earlier by more than two points. It was
trading at 42, up 1/8.
