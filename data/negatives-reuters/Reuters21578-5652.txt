The Citizens Utility Board said it will
file a class action suit Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court
against Commonwealth Edison Co, seeking refunds of 150 dlrs a
customer for consumers who have been paying what it calls "the
wrong monthly customer charge" for the past two years.
    The suit comes in the wake of an Illinois Commerce
Commission decision dismissing a class action complaint
Citizens Utility Board filed with the commission in September
on behalf of consumers who had been overcharged.
    It said the overcharges stem from Edison's monthly customer
charge, which is supposed to be 11.24 dlrs for those who live
in single family homes or buildings with two units and 5.65
dlrs for people living in buildings with three or more units.
