HCC Industries said its board has
authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 150,000
shares of the company's common stock.
    Currently, HCC has about 1,775,000 shares outstanding.
    The company said although the purchases will reduce working
capital, it believes its liquidity will not be impaired.
