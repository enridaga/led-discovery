Cummins Engine Co said it will
temporarily recall about 150 production workers at its
Columbus-area plants because it sees a moderate upturn in North
American demand for heavy-duty truck engines.
    The company said the recalls will begin March 30.
    Production rates for Cummins' heavy-duty truck engines have
increased about 10 pct over fourth-quarter levels and should
stay at these levels through the first half of 1987, Cummins
said.
    The company also reported some upswing in demand for its
components and service parts.
