Iraq said its troops repelled an
overnight Iranian attack east of the southern port city of
Basra, scene of several Iranian Gulf war thrusts in the past
two months.
    A high command communique said "the attackers were met by
heavy barrages of artillery, tank and mortar fire with the
support of helicopter gunship raids."
    Iran said it had made fresh gains in the attack southwest
of the man-made Fish lake, some 10 km (six miles) from Basra.
