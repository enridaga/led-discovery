An attorney was named today in a
24-count federal indictment alleging he initiated an insider

nearly 1.5 mln dlrs in illegal profits on non-public knowledge
of a corporate restructuring.

for the New York firm of Kramer, Levin, Nessen and Kamin,

three individuals whom he alerted to purchase 1,006 colt call
options for 33,938 dlrs.
    July 21, the day after the Colt recapitalization was
announced, its common stock rose almost 27 points. The options
increased to a value of about 1.5 mln dlrs, according to
Rudolph Giuliani, U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, who announced the
indictment today.
