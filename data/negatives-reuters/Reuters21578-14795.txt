President Reagan's chief of staff
said a decision on a new U.S.-Soviet summit could emerge from
Secretary of State George Shultz' Moscow talks with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
    Chief of Staff Howard Baker noted Reagan's invitation to
Kremlin chief Mikhail Gorbachev to visit the United States,
made at their first summit in Geneva in November, 1985, was
still on the table.
    "I would not be surprised to see that subject discussed by
the secretary of state and the Soviet Foreign Minister," Baker
told reporters.
    "I would not be surprised to see some sort of decision
result from those conversations."
