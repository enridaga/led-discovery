The General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT) will begin a probe on May 7-8 on the legality of
Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products, Agriculture
Ministry officials said.
    The investigation, which will take place in Geneva, follows
a U.S. Complaint last year that the restrictions violated GATT
rules prohibiting import quotas.
    The products involved include fruit juice, peanuts and
tomato juice.
