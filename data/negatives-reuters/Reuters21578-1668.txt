tranches, said lead manager Morgan Stanley and Co Inc.
    A 250 mln dlr issue of bonds due 1997 was given a 7-5/8 pct
coupon and was priced at 99.25 to yield 7.73 pct, or 60.5 basis
points more than comparable Treasury securities.

    Both tranches are non-callable for life. Moody's rates the
bonds Aa-1 and S and P rates them AA-plus.
