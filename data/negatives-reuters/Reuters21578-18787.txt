Perry Drug Stores Inc said Donald
Fox has resigned from the board of directors, effective
immediately.
    Fox, a board director since 1971, said he was resigning
because of new business interests, the company reported. Fox

and was recently appointed president of Beauty Brands Group, a
distributor based in Southfield, Mich., the company said.
