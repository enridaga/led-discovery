First Boston Corp, acting as sole
manager, said it placed 29.4 mln dlrs of taxable power revenue
bonds due 2005 of Platte River Power Authority of Colorado.
    First Boston won the bonds in competitive bidding. It bid
them at an 8-3/8 pct coupon. As the bonds will not be publicly
offered, First Boston declined to give their price and yield.
    The bonds have an average life of 11.5 years and are rated
A-1 by Moody's and A by S/P. Underwriters said 22 firms bid for
them, far more than the number of managers who typically bid
for corporate debt as Wall Street houses are trying to boost
their share of the young taxable municipal debt market.
