De Laurentiis Film Partners LP said
it will pay an initial quarterly dividend of 37.3 cts per unit
to holders of record on June 30, payable within 90 days of that
date.
    The partnership said De Laurentiis Entertainment Group Inc
&lt;DEG>, which owns one third of its shares, will defer its share
of the payout to maximize funds available to the partnership
for future film investments.
