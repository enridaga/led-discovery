Consolidated Rail Corp said it and
CSX Corp's CSX Transportation Corp subsidiary have reduced
rates on boxcar shipments of manufactured products moving
between CSX points in the South and Conrail points in the
Northeast and Midwest.
    Conrail said the prices, which were effective March one,
are expected to meet or beat comparable truck transportation
prices in virtually all target markets.
    It said the reduced prices also represent a simplification
of the prvious tariff-based rate structure, which used price
and milage scales to determine rates. The new prices are
constructed from a single table of origin and destination Zip
Codes.
