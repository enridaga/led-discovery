NMS Pharmaceuticals Inc
said it has begun developing a home test kit for detecting an
antibody to the AIDS virus.
    The company said its Animial Biotech Corp subdiary, which
will develop the test, recently completed development of a
simlar technology for a home test kit for feline leukemia virus
in cats that exhibits similar properties to the AIDS virus,
HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus.
   
    NMS is the first firm to annouce the development of a home
test kit for AIDS. The company said it should have a working
model ready in the first quarter of 1988.
    Abbott Laboratories &lt;ABT>, based in Chicago, is the
worldwide leader in the 60 mln dlrs AIDS test market with about
a 50 pct share. Abbott also recently applied to the Food and
Drug Administration to market a new test that will be ablet to
detect early infection with the AIDS virus and help monitor the
progress of therapy.
   
    NMS said its home AIDS test would use proprietary
technologies and advanced genetic engineering techniques for
the home test kitS. NMS said the test would use a drop of blood
from a finger prick to detect the AIDS virus.
    The company stressed that there is no assurance it will
succeed in develop ths test, nor in obtaining government
approval for marketing such as test.
