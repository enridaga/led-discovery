The Soviet Union displayed spying
equipment it said had been placed by American agents in five
different Soviet buildings in the United States.
    A Foreign Ministry spokesman told a news conference the
equipment demonstrated "the widespread, illegal activities
against Soviet people and missions in the United States by
American special services."
    Diagrams and photographs displayed at the news conference
showed devices allegedly found in the Soviet embassy in
Washington, the consulate in San Francisco and in other
locations.
