Canadian gross domestic product should
grow at a real rate of 3.3 pct this year before easing to a 3.0
pct growth rate next year when U.S. economic growth is expected
to decline, Royal Bank of Canada, Canada's largest bank, said
in its monthly economic forecast.
    The forecast is from fourth quarter to fourth quarter. The
bank did not give Canada's real rate of growth for 1986. The
bank said it expects the Canadian dollar to remain at the 75
U.S. ct level for the next few months as major economic
fundamentals have not improved enough to return the currency to
a higher level in the absence of a wider interest rate spread.
