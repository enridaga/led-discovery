Fighting broke out between Palestinian
guerrillas and Shi'ite Moslem Amal militiamen near camps in
south lebanon as Syria prepared to extend its military presence
at Beirut's settlements.
    Security sources in the southern port of Sidon said the
clashes erupted in villages to the southeast between Amal and
guerrillas loyal to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
    Syria stepped in yesterday to halt battles at two Beirut
refugee camps but Amal said it would only lift its siege after
Arafat withdrew his men from the villages near Sidon.
