Israeli jets bombed Palestinian targets
east of the south Lebanese port town of Sidon, in the first
such attack this month, local radio stations said.
    They said the planes attacked Palestinian targets in the
Darb al-Sim area, a few km (miles) east of Sidon, and smoke was
seen billowing over the area.
    Details were not immediately available.
