Helene Curtis Industries Inc said due to
increased expenditures budgeted to promote its new Salon
Sectives brand, the company will likely produce a loss for the
second quarter ending August 31.
    In the 1986 second quarter it earned 1,947,000 or 53 cts a
share.
    Earlier the cosmetics company posted first-quarter net of
139,000 or four cts a share versus a loss in the year-ago
period of 799,000 or 22 cts a share.
