<p>I have omitted to mention one important point in the use of the organ, both at the parish church and at the cathedral in Worcester. It was this, viz.: the closing voluntary, in both cases, consisted of an introduction and fugue played in excellent style. How noble and elevating is the fugue; this most learned and most interesting style of music is admirably adapted to the organ, and no person ought to be regarded as an organist who cannot play with a clear and distinct articulation, a strict fugue &mdash; yea, even a Bach!</p>
