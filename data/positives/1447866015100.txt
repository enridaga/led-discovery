<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I attended a concert in the 1950s as a child of nine or ten. One piece in the programme was Dvorak's ninth symphony - soon after, this was used as the theme music for a series on Children's Television. I was hooked on classical music! Now in my 60's and living in Peterborough, I travel to the South Bank at least once a month to attend a concert and to view all the exhibitions at the Hayward. I am an S.B.C. member and also a Hayward Gallery member.</p>
