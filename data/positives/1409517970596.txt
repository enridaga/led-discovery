<p>Our stay at Hamburgh lasted until June 6. Herr Dussek who was commissioned to arrange the concert at a festival with which the English living at Hamburgh were about to celebrate the 4th of June, in honour of their King, engaged Herr Eck to perform a violin concerto. It was not until the rehearsal which took place on the evening of June 3, at nine o&rsquo;clock, that Herr Eck discovered that the concert was to be given in the open air, which, until then, had never been mentioned. A tent had been erected, in which the orchestra, about one hundred strong, was disposed on a terrace &ndash; like platform. Herr Dussek first tried a Cantata, composed by him for the occasion, and which, had an uncommon effect upon me; for not only was it well written and thoroughly well studied, but from the accompainment of a large organ which had been erected in the back ground of the orchestra and &ldquo;from its being executed in the silence of the night, it partook of so solemn a character that I was quite charmed by it.&rdquo; [from Spohr's diary, 6 June 1802.]</p>
