At Symphony Space, a most affecting marathon memorial for William Kapell. Every pianist we know performed: Shirley, Jerry, a dozen more, and, perhaps most extraordinarily, Billy Masselos, who agreed to play the Copland "Fantasy" on the condition that a stand-in could lurk in the wings. For years, Billy's been queasy about playing, even in private, because of his Parkinson's, or whatever it is. And his apparition on stage was unreassuring. From the moment he sat down, placed his left hand like a focusing vise over his right and, extending the central finger, whammed it like a spike into the lone E-flat that opens the piece, we knew that all was more than well for the next half hour.
