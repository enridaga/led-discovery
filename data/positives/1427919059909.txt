Glazunov liked to recount how he ‘penetrated’ Wagner. ‘I listened to The 'Valkyrie' the first time, understood absolutely nothing, and didn’t like it at all. I went a second time. Nothing again. And a third- the same. How many times do you think I went to hear that opera before I understood it? Nine times. On the tenth, finally, I understood it all. And I liked it very much.’
