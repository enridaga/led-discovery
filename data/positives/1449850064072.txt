<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: medium;">Isn&rsquo;t it a wonderful experience to conduct an orchestra which responds exactly to what one wants! / The effect on the audience was much the same as that of the waltz in Budapest. Two camps; hisses on the one side, a storm of enthusiastic applause on the other, and I had 5 curtain calls. Oskar Fried was there, too, and he says he would like to perform the entire <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Suite</em>. We&rsquo;re going to talk about it today. / The orchestra is splendid; everything sounded wonderful. </span></span></p>
