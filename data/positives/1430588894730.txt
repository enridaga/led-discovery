At one of Madame Marcello's concerts, I had the pleasure of hearing the greatest reputed dilettante singer in Europe, La Signora Teresa de Petris. Nor was her reputation higher than her merits ; she had one of the finest voices I ever heard, combined with great science and expression : in addition to this, she was very beautiful, and had about her all the Venetian fascination.
