<p>Liszt has returned from his trip, and I have played to him twice this week, and am to go again on Monday. He praised me very much on Tuesday, and said I played admirably. I knew he was pleased, because whenever he corrected me he would say, "<em>Nein, Kindchen</em>" in such a gentle way! "<em>Kind</em>" is the German for child, and "<em>Kindchen</em>" is a diminutive, and whenever he calls you that you can tell he has a leaning toward you.</p>
