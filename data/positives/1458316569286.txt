<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">In 1965 I travelled widely in the Soviet Union. I took part in the Leningrad Spring Music Festival, and in November, when the Leningraders came to Moscow, I again had a chance to hear interesting works both by young composers and by the established composers of the older generation. I tried not to miss a single concert. In the summer I attended a ten-day festival of Russian art in Armenia and took part in a plenary session of the Composers&rsquo; Union at Ioshkar-Ola. </span></span></p>
