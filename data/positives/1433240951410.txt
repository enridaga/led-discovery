<p>Miss Edith Wynne and Miss Severn sang the two solos from 'Mount Carmel' with artistic taste ; the air, ' Mine eye runneth down' for contralto, having a beautiful melody, with an elegant clarionet obligato part played by Mr. Webb, and the airs from the oratorio, ' The Resurrection and Ascension' were brilliantly sung by Mr. Cummings. These airs are beautiful specimens of thoughtful writing, and bear evidence of the well used skill of the musician.</p>
