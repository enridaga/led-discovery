<p>At 9.0 p.m. 1st Int. Soc Orchestral concert under Scherchen at Teatro Comunale - Honneger Symph mov. no. 3 (v. fine) - Ravel Lefthand pft. Concerto (not Revel at his best, but very charming in sports - Witgensten plays it) - Bartoks amusing 1st Rhapsody (Szigeti) - Markeievitch Salmo (which causes a bit of a scene, but is not really so important - interesting &amp; original in spots) &amp; Schrechter's Turkamenia [<em>Turkmenia</em> - suite for orchestra] - highly coloured but rather cheap underneath.&nbsp;</p>
