<p>[W]e drove to the Chapel Royal, and, by a back staircase that winds through one of the turrets in that ancient pile, we arrived at a secret door, and, gently tapping, were let into the organ-loft, where Sir George Smart was presiding. This is a gallery jutting a little way into the chapel, from which you have a complete view of the royal family.... The Earl of Wilton was playing an elaborate fugue upon the organ, and I asked Sir George if he was as clever at that as he was at <em>fugueing</em> after a fox in Leicestershire, in which diversion he is pre-eminent, and considered one of the foremost in the field. The anthem was '<em>Ascribe unto the Lord</em>,' by Travers, a composition not much known.</p>
