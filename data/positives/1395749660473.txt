At night the Comedie Italienne where there was a Harlequin piece, in which 2 thirds of the characters spoke Italian which I was glad to find I understood full as well as the French. Carlin the Harlequin wonderfully comic and entertaining - the rest, who sung now and then, but too French for me, Italian airs I could not much relish. This was succeeded by a new piece called [illegible in original MS]. One of these pieces was new and meant as a comic opera in all its modern French form of Italian music (that is music composed in the Italian Stile) to French words: no recitative, all the dialogue and narrative part being spoken, and this piece was as thoroughly dâ€”d as ever piece was here. I used to imagine that a French audience durst not hiss to the degree I found they did tonight, indeed quite as much mixt with horse laughs as ever I heard at Drury Lane or Convent Garden. In short it was condemned in all the English terms except breaking the forms and the actors heads-instead of hissssssss-hishshsh. The author of the words, luckily for him or rather judiciously by him, lay concealed, but the composer M. de St Amant, is very much to be pitied, for a great deal of real good music was thrown away upon bad words and upon an audience not at all disposed, especially in the two last acts (there were 3,) to hear anything fairly. I never saw a house filled with better dressed people.
