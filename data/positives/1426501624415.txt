Next morning I was awakened by an invitation to dinner at Mme Elkan's, the Polish wife of a banker. I got up, played a little in a gloomy mood. Then Nidecki came with Leidenfrost and Steinkeller and when we separated I went off to dine with Malfatti...Wild, the famous and indeed the leading German tenor of the day, came after dinner, I accompanied him from memory in an aria from Otello which he sang in masterly fashion. He and Heinefetter are the mainstays of the opera here, which is moreover so wretched that it is no credit to Vienna.
