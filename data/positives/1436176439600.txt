<p>The wife of Ignaz Moscheles, the celebrated pianist and composer, used also to give musical receptions at her house in Chester Place, Regent's Park. I remember hearing from my father that Madame Moscheles told him, on one occasion, that she was expecting Mendelssohn to come on a certain evening and asked him, as a great favour, to allow the chorus of the German Opera, of which he was the conductor, to come to her house and sing the choruses from Mendelssohn's oratorio 'Edipus in Colonos' as a surprise for the composer when he arrived. My father and the chorus stood in the inner hall of the house, and when Mendelssohn arrived they greeted him with the strains of his own lovely music. He was naturally very pleased with the kind attention of Madame Moscheles, and thanked her most warmly.</p>
