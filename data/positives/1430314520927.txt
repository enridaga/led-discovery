Reggie Lucas, the guitarist, was an enigma to me. He was essentially a rhythm guitarist, and rarely played the flashy leads that I was used to hearing from John McLaughlin or Sonny Sharrock. When the spirit moved him, he could scream on his axe, but he usually laid back--which drove me crazy: If I had his chops in that situation, I would have been all over the place. One explanation for his reluctance to solo may be the fact that Miles [Davis] kept a close rein on Reggie on stage, using hand signals to quiet him down.
