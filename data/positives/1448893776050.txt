<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">When the Festival Hall opened, those who still remember the Queens Hall and having suffered the echo of the Albert Hall, at last had a hall which allowed us to hear music as it should be heard. We were thrilled by Toscanini conducting the Brahms Symphonies with the Philharmonia Orchestra, the visit of the Vienna State Opera giving a performance of Don Giovanni, with artists like Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, Anton Dermota, Paul Schoffler, Ludwig Weber, Hilda Konetzki, Erich Kung, Furtwangler, Otto Klemperer, etc.&nbsp; The recitals by artists like Boris Christoff, Schnabel, Menuhin all enriched by love of music which continues to the present day.&nbsp; We miss it at present and wait for the day when we can continue our 50 year love affair.</p>
