Letter from Bunsen to a Friend, Charlottenberg: 12th November, 1856 -
Yesterday afternoon I read to my family circle the history of the Exodus in the thirty months, from the going out of Egypt to the arrival at Hassa Sarad in the land east of Jordan ; and in the evening we amused ourselves with Gothe's representation in the ' West-Oeshliche Divan '(fourth volume of the collective works, ' Israel in the Wilderness '). In spite of many errors and much unseemliness he has yet been the first to perceive the reality. Then we
closed with choral-singing, accompanied on your organ.
