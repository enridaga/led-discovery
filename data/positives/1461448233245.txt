<p>Well! the first two performances have been and the result is tremendous, they hissed and had a real demonstration against the piece and especially against the&nbsp;<em>music</em>. But more than half applauded. So you can imagine the row: the left political party is furious. I have been ordered out of the hotel where I lived -&nbsp;<em>just fancy -&nbsp;</em>the second night there was more applause than hissing and the piece will be a success I think, every place was sold. All artists were for me and all the other bourgeois were furious - they thought I wanted to make fun of their national song. But all I care about understood at once. It was a furious evening. I have sent you some of the papers - other will follow.&nbsp;</p>
