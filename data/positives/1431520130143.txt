<p>Although we were accustomed to devote Saturdays to rest, we decided to give one Saturday to Eton College. When we arrived at Windsor Station we were met by Mr. Studd and Mr. Graham, and taken to the home of a merchant. As there was so much excitement in the town because of our coming, it was decided that it would be best to hold the meetings in this gentleman's garden, where Mr.Graham gathered about fifty of the students under a large apple tree. There Mr. Moody gave a short address on John iii. i6, and I sang a number of solos, including " Pass me not, O gentle Saviour." We also distributed copies of " Sacred Songs and Solos " among the students, who took an enthusiastic part in the singing. Mr. Studd's son, who afterwards became known as one of the chief cricketers of England, was converted at this meeting.</p>
