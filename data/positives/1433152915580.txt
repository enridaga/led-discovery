" Truly do I myself feel the loss of Sir George, for whom I have cherished an almost lifelong affection. I shall never forget my first introduction to him, and can never cease to feel deeply grateful for all his kindness to me. It was in February, 1847, that I first came under his influence. I was tutor to the sons of Lord Wriothesley Russell, who was then in residence, and had frequent opportunities of hearing the Doctor's beautiful organ accompaniments at the services in St. George's.
