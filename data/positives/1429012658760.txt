The only memory I have of Leeds Festival of a work by Lennox Berkeley - "Jonah", I think, -  with a large section for unaccompanied voices. The choir were wavering about more and more until by the end of the rehearsal the only person still in tune was the soloist, Parry Jones, who had perfect pitch. Finally a few horns were cued in from time to time to keep everyone in tune.
