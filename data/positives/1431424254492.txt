The children were differently occupied, we have a novelty more interesting to them than Christmas trees - I mean Jullien's new Promenade Concerts. Drury Lane Theatre is converted into a large room, in which the 'one shilling' public freely circulates, regardless of the music; the boxes are filled by the 'haute vol√©e.' Jullien directs a good orchestra, sometimes with a baton, sometimes playing: a 'flauto piccolo,' which with its shrill tones marks the rhythm. After each piece he throws himself back as if he were exhausted, on a red velvet arm chair his dress-coat discovers half a mile of white waistcoat; his dance tunes, strongly spiced with drum, bassoon, and trumpet, are attractive to all, but specially to the schoolboy, who would not think it Christmas if he did not go to Jullien's concerts.
