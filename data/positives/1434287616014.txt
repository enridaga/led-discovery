Go at dinner with Bridges & then to Northampton Polytechnic institute (Clarkenwell)* for concert for poor people by Audrey Chapman Orchestra cond. by F.B. Amateur strings (marvellous) & pro. wind (quite good). They play Brahms Tragic ov. Schubert B min. Simp.** Dvorak Serenade for strings (rubbish) & Tchaikovsky's adorable Romeo & Juliet. Harold William's sing Non piu Andrai (Figaro)*** not too well, but Song of the Flea (Mussorgsky)**** marvellously so that it has to be repeated. The orch is magnificent althro', & F.B. of course superb. The performance of Tchaikovsky drives me potty.
