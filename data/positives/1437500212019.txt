<pre>On Wednesday, 1st December, 1813, an Ode was performed at Freemasons' Hall, <br />for the Installation of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent and Strathern, as <br />Grand Master of Masons in England, according to the old institution. The Ode <br />recited by brother Pope; the music composed by brother Kelly. The military <br />band of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, who were Masons, attended; <br />together with several eminent professional singers; and the whole formed a <br />grand coup d'oeil. Brother Bellamy sang the following song with great animation,<br />and it was received with unanimous applause: <br />"Mountains may fall, and rocks decay, <br />And isle on isle be swept away, <br />But Masonry's primeval truth, <br />Unbroke by force, unchanged by time, <br />Shall bloom in renovated youth, <br />And energy sublime." </pre>
<pre>The following duet met with the same meal of approbation : </pre>
<pre>"For see! from Heaven the peaceful dove <br />With olive branch descend; <br />Augustus shall with Edward join, <br />All rivalry to end; <br />And taught by their fraternal love, <br />Our arms, our hearts shall intertwine. <br />The union to approve, <br /><br />"Then Edward and Augustus hail ! <br />For now beneath the Brunswick line,<br />One system shall prevail ; <br />O'er all the earth, with truths divine, <br />Shall Masonry extend its sway, <br />Till time itself shall pass away <br />In unity to shine." </pre>
<pre>FULL CHORUS. </pre>
<pre>"Then, brothers, hail the kind decree <br />That gave them both to Masonry." </pre>
