[W]e headed to the Grammy Awards ready to kick ass. This wasn't just a regular Grammy show, but the 25th Annual Grammy Awards--which meant the producers were bending over backwards to gather an all-star lineup. John Denver was hosting the production, and musical representatives from classical, pop, old rock, new rock, and country had been signed to performâ€¦

There are many images that come to mind when I think of that show. Among the biggest hits was one of the newest acts, Men at Work, an Aussie band. The players and crew in this band were great--they were outgoing and friendly, with none of the cooler-than-thou attitude so often found in L.A. The band kicked butt, earning a well-deserved standing ovation. Linda Ronstadt also scored a big hit with "You're No Good." When the L.A. session guys behind her cranked up the volume during their intro, I thought she'd be drowned out--but she opened up and sang. What a set of pipes!
