Go at 2.0 to the dress rehearsal of Christmas Rose. It is a darling little work - but it is being done execrably (chorus & orchestra especially - Miriam however being very good.) If well done it would come off admirably on the stage. Mrs. Bridge & Miss Fass are also there, & I go home to tea with them & Mr. Bridge.
