I finish the slow movement & finish also a fast movement of the Quartet pieces. I don't know yet if I like it, as there is still everso much to do to it. I am still out of school, but I hope to return to-morrow to my labours. I can do no writing from Dinner until prep. & consequently [Britten crosses this out] because of the incessant din of gramophones & so I do some copying of Hist, notes that I have missed, & also finish Father Brown, it is a very "innocent" book, but quite amusing.
