<p>In Rome a ballet of this description used to run &mdash; and probably still does so &mdash; through&nbsp;a whole season, filling the Tordinone every night, and&nbsp;hummed, more or less loudly, by the entire audience.&nbsp;Italians will not be deterred from giving tongue to their&nbsp;likes and dislikes with a freedom unknown to us frigid&nbsp;islanders ; and, sitting in the Apollo stalls amongst the&nbsp;principini, I used to hear the airs of Brahma (the ballet&nbsp;of that &OElig;cumenical winter) chanted all around me by&nbsp;dandies of the first water, very seldom under their breath.&nbsp;</p>
