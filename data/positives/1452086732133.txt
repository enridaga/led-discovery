<p>Hundreds of gracefully designed and picturesquely&nbsp;equipped sleighs are being driven at little short of&nbsp;racing speed up and down the road, paved for the nonce&nbsp;with a smooth superficies of hardened snow, over which&nbsp;the trackers glide, and the horses' hoofs trample noiselessly. There is no lack of gay sound, however, upon&nbsp;the Chaussee. That element of vivacity is supplied by&nbsp;countless tinkling sledge-bells, and by the high-pitched&nbsp;shouts with which the Birjai and Lipovani urge on their&nbsp;fiery little steeds to the top of their pace. Many of the&nbsp;sledges are quaint and beautiful objects, shaped like&nbsp;swans, couchant lions, shells, boats, and flowers. For&nbsp;the most part their occupants are dark-eyed Roumanian&nbsp;dames and damsels, enveloped to their dimpled chins in&nbsp;costly furs, and manifestly exhilarated by the swiftness of motion and sharpness of the cold. Their joyons&nbsp;laughter rings out clearly through the thin pure air,&nbsp;and blends harmoniously with the " tintinnabulation of&nbsp;the bells, bells, bells." On the whole, the cheeriest of Roumanian Christmas celebrations is, perhaps, a sleigh-race on the Chaussee, terminating in a deep draught of&nbsp;<em>vinu caldu</em> at the pavilion near the Rond Point.&nbsp;</p>
