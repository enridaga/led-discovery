A very much more cultured musician than some of those who dubbed him "Prima Donna" were capable of judging, his favourite recreation was chamber music and quartet playing; but, aware of limitations and his own metier, these pleasures were mostly reserved for private enjoyment. In my opinion, Sarasate left a deeper mark upon violin playing than any other performer of his day. The more laboured style of the North German school at times provoked gentle ridicule from one whose outstanding qualities were an entire absence of effort, a fascinating natural grace, and unfailing certitude of intonation.
