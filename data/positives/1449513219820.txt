<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I attended concerts from the opening of the Hall, although, I was unable to get tickets for the first concerts. The most memorable early one was given by Victor de Sabata with an all Ravel programme, including l'enfant et les sortileges, a work which was rarely, if ever performed in this country&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Perhaps the most momentous occasion though, was the concert when Stravinsky received the medal from the Royal Philarmonic Society and then conducted a programme of his own works. This was the first time my future wife and I went out together. Two happy events. We both continued to go to concerts, never missing a Beecham event. Could anyone who was there forget his performance of Scheherezade.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
