<p>In the evening Dukelsky unexpectedly appeared. He is just in from London, where he has spent the winter composing operettas and revues and earning tidy sums of money. For some operetta or other he now earns a 'pension' of &pound;15 a week. New suits, ties and erotic adventures, which he recounts to me with naive brazenness. He also played me the beginning of his new, 'serious' ballet. It was interesting. It defeats my understanding how he can combine composing foxtrots with real music, and good music at that!</p>
