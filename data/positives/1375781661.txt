This morning I went up-stairs to count what children I had left! Then your father came, and when our remnant was all collected, I proposed singing the hymn “Wie schön leucht uns den Morgenstern”—which I was surprised by your father’s desiring to change for the hymn “Wer weiss wie nahe mir mein Ende ”—and after two verses of that, he desired to have four verses of “O wie selig seid ihr doch, ihr Frommen.” Then we read the 90th Psalm, and he prayed—having told us that he had received intelligence of your Aunt Christiana’s death! She went to her rest on the Wednesday in Passion week, and was buried on Good Friday, but your Father would not tell us till the festival was over.
