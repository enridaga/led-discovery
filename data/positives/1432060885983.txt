<p>At the time when I met Jack Long, I was in the highest spirits ; I had played Lionel, and been received with all the kindness and indulgence with which a British audience invariably encourages a new performer, and I had been successful beyond my warmest hopes. On the folio wing Tuesday, (the 24th,) I remember I went to the Opera House to see my friend Signora Storace make her first appearance, and was much gratified at her enthusiastic reception. The opera was Paesiello's " Schiavi per Amore." The whole of the music of this charming opera buffa is delightful. The opening of it is a masterpiece of harmony, and was warmly applauded by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who honoured the theatre with his presence, and was in the house before the commencement of the opera. Amongst the audience were the late Duke of Cumberland (in the pit), and the Duchess (in her box,) with the present Marquis of Conyngham. The " Schiavi per Amore" was a great favourite for the remainder of the season.</p>
