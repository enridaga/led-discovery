Bennie Moten's band played a two-beat rhythm such as one-and-three. Walter Page's band [The Blue Devils] played a two-and-four. It wasn't that they would stop to accent the beat, it was sort of like a bouncing ball, and when those rhythms met in the Basie band there was an even flow--one, two, three, four--like a bouncing ball.
