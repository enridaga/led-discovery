<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I will always be grateful to my parents who took me, at the age of six to my first concert. I remember every detail to this day (some 50 years later). The thrill of walking into the Festival Hall, the beautiful colour of the wood, the carpets; I had never seen such a grand, sytlish building. I remember listening to the music which was perfect for a little girl: Sherezade [Sheherazade] and Grieg's A minor piano concerto. Many happy times were spent subsequent to that first concert sitting in our favourite choir seats. It has also given me a love of music for the rest of my life.</p>
