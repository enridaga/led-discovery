[O]n December 5, 1837, I went with him to the Hotel des Invalides to witness 
the first performance of his ' Requiem,' and was, therefore, an eye-witness of what took place on that occasion. Habeneck, after Berlioz the most accomplished chef d'orchestre in Paris, conducted by rights, and Berlioz sat in a chair near him. Habeneck, who conducted not only the Grand Opera but also the 'Concerts du Conservatoire,' had the habit of now and then putting his conducting stick down and listening complacently to the performance of his orchestra. It was, therefore, perhaps force of habit that made him discard the baton at the commencement of the' Tuba mirum,' this time not to listen, but leisurely to take a pinch of snuff! To my amazement I suddenly saw Berlioz standing in Habeneck's place and wielding the baton to the end of the movement. The moment had been a most critical one, four groups of brass instruments, stationed at the four corners of the large orchestra, which with the chorus was placed under the dome in the centre of the building, having 
to enter successively, and, without Berlioz's determination, disaster must have ensued, thanks to the unfortunate pinch of snuff. Habeneck, after the performance, thanked Berlioz profusely for his timely aid, and admitted that his own thoughtlessness might have caused a break-down, but Berlioz remained 
persuaded that there had been no thoughtlessness, and that the break-down was intended. I could not believe this, for the simple reason that when such a 
thing occurs it is always the conductor on whose shoulders the blame of the break-down is laid, and most deservedly so ; it is, therefore, most unlikely 
that he should himself try to provoke one.
