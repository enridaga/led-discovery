On the first night the loud speaker broke down just before their entry and all John Matheson could do was count and hope it would work out all right - which it did. The press had become very enthusiastic about the Dido, an American called Blanche Thebom.

She was not a particularly memorable singer; the touching song of the young sailor, Hylas, longing for his homeland, sung by Dermot Troy who died tragically young, is perhaps what lingered longest in my mind.
