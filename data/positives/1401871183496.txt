Lord! What a march! The men are still straggling in. About three-quarters of the company arrived with the column this morning, and I honestly believe half my platoon would have dropped out if it hadn’t been for Jackson, who simply wouldn’t let them stop singing. That little man is a marvel. I have never seen such pluck.
