The great day arrived and dear Sir Henry Wood gave up practically the whole rehearsal to the Elgar Concerto which went better than I expected. Then came the concert. I think Sir Edward was very anxious. / I kept thinking of Lady Elgar who had just passed away. I thought so much of her kind words when we recorded at Hayes and I felt strongly that she was near the cello helping to make the work appreciated. Sir Edward conducted wonderfully and the orchestra received a tremendous ovation, and since has become one of the most loved cello works.
