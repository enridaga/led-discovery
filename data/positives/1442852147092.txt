<p>I have attended concerts at the RFH for the past 50 years and look forward to next year to continue to do so. So many wonderful memories - Tommy Beecham and his Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and 90% of the audience waiting for the 'Lolly top' [presumably lollipop] to be announced. My great love is and always has been the Philharmonia - have been privileged to see: Toscanini, Giulini, Canteli, Furtw&auml;ngler, the up and coming Karajan, Klemperer, Muti amongst many other conductors and wonderful artists. As a point of interest, most of the concerts in the early years, I paid the princely sum of 2/6 and 3/6 for standing, having obtained the tickets on my way to work on the morning of the concert.</p>
