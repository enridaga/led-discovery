Mummy returns home by bus from Charing X at 10.5. Stay in bed for breakfast, owing to v. bad night with pains. Have caster oil & suffer for it for the rest of the day. Don’t go out but get up at 12.0 (consquently missing Pft. lesson). Do some copying out. Listen to B.B.C. concert on Miss Prior’s Wireless (I had my ticket but sold it). Rossini Semeramide ov. & Dvorak’s sentimental vlc (B min) concerto sentimentally played by Suggia, & Morning Heroes. I cannot say much about the last, because it came over v. badly, the choral writing sounding confused, & I had no score. There seem to be some fine bits in the work (2nd movement) & some terribly ordinary bits.
