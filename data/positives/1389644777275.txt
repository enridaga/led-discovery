For several days I was employed in the officers’ mess. When the officers were out I improved my musical education on their gramophone. Mendelssohn’s Midsummer Night’s Dream was my favourite, and his Spring Song and Wedding March tied for second place. A very good third was Melody in F by Rubinstein. I loved that gramophone.
