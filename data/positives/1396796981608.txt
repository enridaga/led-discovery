I walked in to Rouen to see the cathedral which is beautiful, especially the little chapel behind the altar. I saw the place to advantage, standing at the western end and looking up the long aisle and chancel, where a dear old priest in magnificent robes was conducting a service. The organ was playing some soft chant, and there were little choirboys in their scarlet, with the sun shining on them from the side windows - it was really beautiful.
