I had brought with me, after an excursion to Germany, the book of songs by Mendelssohn, in which the first is the setting of Heine's ' Auf Flugeln des Gesanges.' I spoke of it with enthusiasm to Heine, who came the same evening with Heller to the Eue Lafitte, most eager to hear this version of his poem. I had a feeble, but not altogether disagreeable tenor voice, and sang the ' Lied ' to him with all the expression I was capable of, and certainly correctly as regards the music. Great was my astonishment, and Heller's also, when at the conclusion he said in a disappointed tone, ' There is no melody in it.'
