During this exhibition the Cologne Choir were in England ; they came to Windsor and sang some German Lieder in the nave of St. George's, under the direction of Herr Lindpaintner, Dr. Elvey interspersing the vocal pieces with selections on the organ. Their singing was magnificent, and the crescendos and diminuendos came in waves of sound up the nave from the west end with remarkable effect, which made an impression never to be forgotten upon those who had the privilege of hearing it.
