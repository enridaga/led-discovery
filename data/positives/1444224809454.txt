<p>Last night I was prodigiously well entertained by being admitted by means of Mr. Edwards, <em>into</em> the conservatorio of the Mendicanti, where I <em>saw</em> as well as <em>heard</em> a charming concert performed in all its parts by females. After this I went with the same gentleman and D. Flaminio Tomj, who sings with more taste than any man I ever heard in my life, except Palma, to Signor Grimani&rsquo;s &ndash; accompanied him in 3 or 4 songs and then played 2 or 3 hours to a great deal of company who made a great fuss about very little matter, God knows. I am too old and knowing to become vain now, or I should have has my head turned with the applause I received last night, both here and at the Mendicanti, where I likewise played a great deal.</p>
