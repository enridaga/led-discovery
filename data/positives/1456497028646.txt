<p class="MsoNormal">The room I worked in at the university had an upright piano, it is true, but as it and the room itself were used by other students as well, I didn&rsquo;t get much privacy.&nbsp; However, there was a fairly mature student who didn&rsquo;t belong to the university.&nbsp; She rejoiced in the name of Eurydice Draconi.&nbsp; She was a fine pianist and a pupil of George Woodhouse.&nbsp; She specialized in Scriabin, so I often retreated to where she lodged in Kings Road, and listened to her playing of his Fourth and Fifth Sonatas.</p>
