<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I heard a cimbalom for the first time in a Geneva caf&eacute; with Ansermet one evening in January 1915, and decided it could be used as a substitute for the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">guzla</em>. The cimbalomist, a Mr Racz, kindly helped me find an instrument, which I purchased and kept with me troghout my Swiss and French years. I learned to play it, and to love it, and I composed <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Renard</em> &lsquo;on&rsquo; it (as I normally compose &lsquo;on&rsquo; a piano), with two sticks in my hand, writing down as I composed. </span></p>
