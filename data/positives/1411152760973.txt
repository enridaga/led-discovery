<p>My best memory... of the Festival Hall is the official celebration of Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s 80th birthday on 18 July 1998, particularly Hugh Masekela&rsquo;s performance. One person went down to the front of the auditorium and started to dance. Within minutes everyone was up and dancing &ndash; the atmosphere was electric; I will never forget it.</p>
