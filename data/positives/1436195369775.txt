<p>I first knew Joachim when I was a boy of sixteen; I met him at a soiree given by Balfe at his house in Bruton Street. I remember that, on one occasion, when he played the "Kreutzer Sonata" with Anton Rubinstein, at one of Ella's Musical Union Matinees, he was very angry with Rubinstein for taking the last movement at such a terrific rate, and said he would never play it with him again. I was present at the time, and I think Joachim was quite right. Rubinstein was of such an exuberant disposition that he really could not help himself, and was carried away by his enthusiasm.</p>
