Formes as 'Leporello' the other night was very humorous and powerful, but I was annoyed at his exclaiming in the churchyard scene, 'This sounds like trombones.' The public liked it,but the public, when applauding that kind of thing, is like a will-o'-the-wisp - it leads artists astray. Rietz took several of the 'Tempi' too slowly, which surprised me in a modern Kapellmeister.
