<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Saturday morning youth concerts for school children with the best conductors (Sir Thomas Beecham, Sir Malcolm Sargent, etc) explaining the musical works being played. Since the late 1950s I have been to many excellent concerts over the years. More recently the musicals presented in the summer months have been very entertaining.&nbsp;</p>
