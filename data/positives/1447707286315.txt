<p>I think it was during the season of 1853 that I first&nbsp;heard Arabella Goddard, who came before the public as&nbsp;a slight, quiet-looking girl of fifteen, with works at her&nbsp;fingers' ends that had &mdash;at least, so it was said at the&nbsp;time &mdash; never theretofore been performed in a London&nbsp;concert room... I heard her&nbsp;play the Posthumous Sonata without book. Her tempi&nbsp;and execution were as a rule faultless, even then &mdash; too&nbsp;faultless, perhaps; for over-conscientious attention to&nbsp;the countless details of such colossal compositions as&nbsp;those above referred to, left her no spare intellectual&nbsp;force wherewith to investigate the Master's true meaning.</p>
