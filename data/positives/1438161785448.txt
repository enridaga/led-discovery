The first of these (May 4, 1872) took place at Drury Lane, and was remarkable not only for the exceptional beauty and grandeur of Tietjens's assumption, but because on that night Italo Campanini made his debut in London as Gennaro, and was forthwith hailed (somewhat prematurely, however) as the successor of Mario and Giuglini. The cast further included Faure as the Duke and the ever-delightful Zelia Trebelli as Maffio Orsini, while Sir Michael Costa was the conductor. That was a night of triumphs.</span></p>
