<p>Went with Ptashka to Paris. Leya Lyuboshitz played my Violin Concerto, Wolff conducting. We were in a box: Ptashka, Maria Viktorovna, Fatma Hanum and I. The performance was really rather good; I listened with the closest attention. Of course, the opening of the Concerto can still not be heard, and the passage with a tremolo background hangs in the air, with nothing to support it in the bass. The tremolo lower voices need to be much stronger. The performance enjoyed a great success. There was an attempt to call me out, but I concealed myself behind the box.</p>
