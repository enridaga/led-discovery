<p>In the course of four months I only went to the opera once, to hear Meistersinger, otherwise there were only two Walk&uuml;re performances. The rest of the programme was Oberon, Tannh&auml;user and Lohengrin, and not much else. B&uuml;low did not have a particularly interesting programme. Only once was I very taken with a symphonic poem "Tod und Verkl&auml;rung" by Richard Strauss. That was grand. I will not even mention his technique of instrumentation etc., but he had great ideas and an astounding ability to give his ideas form. That impressed me.&nbsp;</p>
