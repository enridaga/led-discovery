Yudina saw Mussorgsky as a purely religious composer. But Mussorgsky isn’t Bach, after all, and it’s a rather controversial reading, I think. And then there was the business of reading poetry at her concerts. Either you play or you read poetry, not both. I realize that she read Pasternak, and at a time when he was banned. But nonetheless, the whole thing reminded me of a ventriloquist’s act. And naturally they result of the famous readings – between Bach and Beethoven, I think – was another huge scandal in the series of Yudina’s scandals.
