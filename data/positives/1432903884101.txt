<p>Elvey's next important composition was an Ode on the Birth of the Prince of Wales. On Monday evening, December 14th, the Queen ordered a performance of this at the Castle, and a little before nine o'clock she entered the music room, leaning on the arm of Prince Albert. The Duchess of Kent and a large party of guests were already assembled. 'The ode was admirably performed by Her Majesty's private band, the choir of St. George's Chapel, and some members of the Exeter Hall Musical Society, conducted by Dr. Elvey. After all was over, the Queen told Dr. Elvey how delighted she was with the music, and also expressed great pleasure at the way in which it was performed. Prince Albert also afterwards sent for him, and in a very gracious manner thanked him for the performance.</p>
