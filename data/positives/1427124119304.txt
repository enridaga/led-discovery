When I stepped off the train in Greensville it wasn't long 'fore I was wrapped up in Mama's arms. It felt good all over. I didn't realize how homesick I had been [at the Blind School] till I actually set foot back in my own stomping grounds…

Naturally I went to the Red Wing Café whenever I pleased. That was my hot spot in town. I was always asking Mr. Pit to show me something new on his piano, and he never refused.
Sometimes I heard a piano being played in someone's house. But I'd never ask if I could play. I was raised to wait until someone asked me to play. And even then, I'd have to turn to Mama or Mary Jane--whoever was with me--and say, "Is it okay if I play for the people?" Judging by most folks' reactions, I must have been sounding pretty good, 'cause they kept on asking me.
Confidence was building in me....
