In the light of what he was telling me, the dancing I had seen not so long ago in Madrid’s Teatro Pavon took on a new meaning. There I had seen dancing in its pure forms, without the titillating overtones that we have come to associate with it; some of the dancing done by mistresses of the art who were anything but glamorous – heavy-set women some of them, long past the first bloom of youth, dancing in front of the simplest of backdrops, while some middle-aged guitar player in a nondescript gray ready-made suit sat on a cane chair on the stage, providing the music. My accompanist and I were about the only foreign visitors in that audience of 'aficionados', whose discrimination was evident in the subtle differences in the applause, and the exclamations that rewarded some particularly outstanding dance or flamenco song.
