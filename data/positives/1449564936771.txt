<p>Visits from the Seguin Opera Company were a delight to me. The performances were up to a very creditable standard, the singing being in English of course. The list included most of the operas by Balfe, Wallace, Donizetti, Bellini, Auber, Adam, and Boieldieu; such as <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Masaniello</em>, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Fra Diavolo</em>, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Crown Diamonds</em>, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">La Bayadere, La Sonnambula, The Stranger, Norma, The Pirate, I Puritani, Lucrezia, Lucia, The Daughter of the Regiment, and La Dame Blanche</em>. The only operas with a comic admixture were The Barber and the Elixir of Love.</p>
