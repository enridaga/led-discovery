<p>In the evening I attended the premiere of <em>Siegfried </em>in the box of the Director of the Conservatoire. The theatre is not particularly big and the sets were bad, the singers mediocre, but some of the acting was not bad and the audience well dressed. The Polish language, with all its hissing, buzzing consonants, is quite expressive in dramatic and comic scenes (Mime), but less effective in lyrical passages. After the performance a whole group of us including the prima ballerina - a very pretty woman - went to dine in a night club, the Oasis, with dancing and entertainment, where we stayed until three o'clock. The ballerina's fianc&eacute; paid the whole bill and would not let any of us make a contribution.</p>
