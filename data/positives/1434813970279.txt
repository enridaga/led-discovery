In the course of this Diaghileff season at the Théatre des Champs-Elysées I at last had an opportunity of seeing 'Parade', the work of Cocteau, Satie, and Picasso, the production of which in 1917 had been the subject of so much discussion. Although I had played the music on the piano, seen photographs of the scenery and costumes, and was intimately acquainted with the scenario, the performance gave me the impression of freshness and real originality. 'Parade' confirmed me still further in my conviction of Satie’s merit in the part he had played in French music by opposing to the vagueness of a decrepit impressionism a precise and firm language stripped of all pictorial embellishments.
