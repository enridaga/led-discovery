<p>To the Editor of the Tenby Observer.</p>
<p>SIR, - The other day, struck by the grievous aspect of a wobegone adult sweltering upon a crag affording a notchy seat upon the South Sands, I neared the spot, and was pained to hear the accompanying dirge trolled forth in monotonous accents so uninterruptedly from beginning to end, over and over again, that I was able to catch the burden by heart. I offer it to you for insertion in your columns, since it may interest both your sea-side visitors and the powers that be, whose notions of the use and abuse of Tenby's beams and breezes may perhaps be made to harmonize through a little healthful ventilation.</p>
<p>Your obedient Servant, Quis.</p>

<p>POOR CRIPPLED MAN: A DIRGE.</p>
<p>Air "Poor Mary Ann"</p>
<p>Here, beneath the huge cliffs sitting,<br />Poor crippled man!<br />Under scorching sun-beams fritting,<br />Poor crippled man!<br />When you ask why he sits pining,<br />Or "on yonder rock reclining,"<br />While the Castle Hill stands shining,<br />Poor crippled man!</p>
<p>Sadly, then, he shakes his noddle,<br />Poor crippled man!<br />Points to legs which cannot toddle,<br />Poor crippled man!<br />Wofully he vows, he ponders<br />On that Castle Hill, and wonders,<br />Why he's stopped when there he wanders,<br />Poor crippled man!</p>
<p>Once or twice when sun-beams courted,<br />Poor crippled man!<br />On that hill his frame he sported,<br />Poor crippled man!<br />To and fro a Bath-chair carried<br />Helpless limbs; while there he tarried,<br />Cooling breezes sunbeams parried,<br />Poor crippled man!</p>
<p>Now, alas! there's no more roaming,<br />Poor crippled man!<br />Up that hill by morn or gloaming<br />Poor crippled man!<br />No Bath chairs may mount that acclivity,<br />Sternly preserved for robust activity,<br />The Prince looks down on the cripple's proclivity<br />Poor crippled man!</p>
