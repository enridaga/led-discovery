It was a really sensational evening, for a hitherto quite unknown man emerged from it, as one of the first order. R&oacute;zsav&ouml;lgyi immediately tried to get his quartet and piano pieces. (It&rsquo;s a notable event in this county when 2 quartets appear within a year.) Another interesting piece of news: my rhapsody for orchestra and Kod&aacute;ly&rsquo;s quartet have been accepted by the Allgem. Deutscher Musikverein for its <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Musikfest </em>in Zurich. / The generally expressed view is that Kod&aacute;ly&rsquo;s music is much more gentle and humane than my own. The Waldbauers played beautifully, like a first-class string quartet. </span></span></p>
