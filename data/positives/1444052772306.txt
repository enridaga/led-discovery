<p>We went to a concert at the Queens Hall, in the afternoon. Considering that my ears have been pure music for some weeks, I think that patriotism is a base emotion.&nbsp; By this I mean (I am writing in haste, expecting Flora to dinner) that they played a national Anthem &amp; a Hymn &amp; all I could feel was the entire absence of emotion in myself &amp; everyone else.</p>
