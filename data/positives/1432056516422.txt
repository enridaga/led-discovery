At the time of my debut [in London], my friend Jack Johnstone was engaged at Covent Garden as first singer. I saw him play Young Meadows, in " Love in a Village;" he acted the part, well, and sang the songs with good taste, and a peculiarly fine falsetto voice. Mrs. Billington was the Rosetta. I thought her an angel in beauty, and the Saint Cecilia of song.
