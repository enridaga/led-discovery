<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">One of the most delightful evenings my husband ever spent was at a Christmas production of the Nutcracker - when we introduced our 7 year old niece to the delights of the ballet. The whole evening was magical, not least because of the party like atmosphere and the many little girls dressed up as for a party and so full of excitement and anticipation. My second memory is sadder but nevertheless special to the Festival Hall.&nbsp; My husband and I had enjoyed visits for 4 decades but in December 2003 we paid our last visit together as my husband died in January 2004 but it was a happy evening and one I will always remember.&nbsp;</p>
