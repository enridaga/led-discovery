<p>MONSIEUR JULLIEN was the director of the English Opera at Drury Lane when I arrived with my father in 1848, and my father often took me there. Hector Berlioz, the celebrated French composer, was the conductor. I heard many operas there in English, including Mozart's<em> Le Nozze di Figaro</em>, the night after my arrival, in which Miss Charlotte Ann Birch was the Susanna. She had a very fine soprano voice. Miss Miran, who had a lovely mezzo-soprano voice, sang "Cherubino"; unhappily she died while still young. Sims Reeves and many other well-known artists also appeared.</p>
