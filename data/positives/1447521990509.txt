<p>I have just returned from a visit to Laurensville, where the dear girls of the Senior class were graduating. They made excellent speeches especially Eliza English, Lou Gregg, Emma Watts and Emma Zimmerman. At night I also attended the concert and walked home at night with a friend. Memento: August nineteenth. I could not believe it as she leaned so gently and affectionately upon my arm. Iacovie cave! Cave! Ne in pericula curres.</p>
