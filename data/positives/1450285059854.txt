<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I met Prokofiev in St Petersburg in the winter of 1906-7. He was a teenager at the time, but he had been given part of a concert in Walter Nouvel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Evenings of Contemporary Music&rsquo; in which to play a group of his piano pieces. His performance was remarkable &ndash; I have always liked his music when he played it &ndash; and the music had personality. </span></p>
