The soiree at the Rothschilds this evening was brilliant in every respect: Lablache, Grisi, Mario, Pauline Viardot, Chopin and Karl were the artists and the boy had a fabulous success. He again played Chopin's concerto on two pianos with Chopin and was literally smothered with caresses by several ladies among the assembly of about five hundred persons.
