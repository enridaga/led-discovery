<p>During Liszt's second visit to St. Petersburg, the Czar&nbsp;Nicholas invited him to a soir&eacute;e at the Winter Palace,&nbsp;and in the course of the evening personally asked him&nbsp;to play. An imperial request being equivalent to a&nbsp;command, Liszt sat down to the piano and commenced&nbsp;one of his brilliant Hungarian Rhapsodies. The Czar,&nbsp;instead of bestowing that exclusive attention upon the&nbsp;performance to which Liszt was accustomed, and which,&nbsp;in fact, he exacted from his audiences in private as well&nbsp;as in public &mdash; no matter of what exalted elements they&nbsp;might happen to be composed&mdash; entered into an animated&nbsp;conversation with one of his generals, talking in his&nbsp;usual and by no means subdued tone of voice. Liszt&nbsp;went on playing for a minute or so, at the expiration of&nbsp;which time, seeing that the Emperor was not listening&nbsp;to him, he suddenly came to a full stop, and rose from his&nbsp;seat at the instrument. Tableau! Although he had paid no heed to Liszt's performance, Nicholas Alexandreivich&nbsp;missed the sound of the piano, and sent one of his chamberlains to ask the artist why he had ceased playing &mdash;&nbsp;whether he was indisposed or the piano had not been&nbsp;properly tuned. Liszt's steely grey eyes flashed with&nbsp;righteous indignation as he replied: "The Czar well&nbsp;knows that whilst he is speaking every other voice&mdash; even&nbsp;that of music &mdash; is bound to be mute!" So saying, he&nbsp;turned his back on the astounded official, and abruptly&nbsp;left the room. Everybody present expected that the&nbsp;maestro would receive his passport the first thing on the&nbsp;following morning, with the peremptory order on the&nbsp;part of the Minister of Police to quit Russian territory&nbsp;within four-and-twenty hours. To the surprise of the&nbsp;Court, however, Czar Nicholas took in good part the&nbsp;severe reproof administered to him by the fearless pianist,&nbsp;to whom he sent a costly gift the next day; and ever&nbsp;after, when Liszt's name was mentioned in his presence,&nbsp;spoke of him with cordial admiration as a musician who&nbsp;not only respected himself but had the courage to insist,&nbsp;upon respect being paid to his art, "even" (as the Czar&nbsp;was wont to observe) "by ignorant persons like myself,&nbsp;who know so little about music that they do not deserve&nbsp;that great artists should &nbsp;waste their time and talents in&nbsp;trying to amuse them."&nbsp;</p>
