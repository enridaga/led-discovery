<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">I remember distinctly hearing my cousins at St. James&rsquo;s Hall when they sang in Verdi&rsquo;s Requiem. Their voices blended quite beautifully in the lovely &ldquo;Agnus Dei&rdquo;; the opening phrase sung in octaves by the soprano and contralto affected me strongly. I did not know it at all at that time, and well though I know it now, that &ldquo;Agnus Dei&rdquo; always touches me by its purity and simplicity and strong religious feeling.</p>
