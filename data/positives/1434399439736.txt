Go (Area) to B.B.C. concert at 8.15, Queen's Hall. Henry Wood. Mozart Flute (typical up-to-date Mozart - presto & fff). Strauss's Master-piece of Characterization Don Quixote.* Cassordo (Cassadò) solo 'cello. Quite good but not perfect. This work is too diff. for performance under modern conditions. 20 rehearsals are needed. Hindemith's Konzertmusic (Brass & Strings).** Some magnificent stuff & lovely scoring, quite well played. In 1st 1/2, Maggie Teyte sang Ravel's Schererazarde marvellously - gems of songs as they are. to end Concerto in G. min (Wood-Handel(!)) - Marcel Dupré. I suppose his playing was good.
