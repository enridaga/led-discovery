<p>Diaghilev has left. I saw Kokhno, who promised to sing me some&nbsp;<em>chastushki&nbsp;</em>from the early days of the Revolution. He was quick to mention that he had a concept for the ballet, and in point of fact had been saving up these very&nbsp;<em>chastushki&nbsp;</em>for that purpose. I had no interest whatsoever for his concept and only wanted him to sing the&nbsp;<em>chastushki&nbsp;</em> so as to get an idea of the sort of thing that was in the air and being sung in Russia at the start of the Bolshevik era; the point was not to write them down and make use of them. Kokhno has a good memory for this kind of thing and sang me a dozen or so. There were some quite lovely rural ones, the urban ones, however, mostly sentimental rubbish. The new regime brought a new vocabulary, but not new tunes.</p>
