Let any concert-goer of the 1920s who heard Burmester, Kubelik, and Marteau (still playing in public at that time, Burmester having died in 1933, Kubelik in 1940, and Marteau in 1934) compare his impressions of these players with those of Kreisler, Elman, Heifetz, and Thibaud. He would certainly find that these two groups of players were unmistakably on opposite sides of this imaginary line. In spite of the disparity in the ages of Ysa√øe, Kreisler, Elman, Heifetz, and other contemporary players, and in spite of their stylistic individualities, there is a common denominator in their playing, something that proclaims it as of our time.
