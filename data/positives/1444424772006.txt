<p>Your last letter to Penny gave us great joy, from the good account it brought of your being so well, which I hope will continue and increase by the sweet air of the Cotswold, when we shall have the happiness of meeting you there, which Penny and I extremely long for, notwithstanding the allurements of the operas, ridottos, etc. Music is certainly a pleasure that may be reckoned intellectual, and we shall never again have it in the perfection it is this year, because Mr. Handel will not compose any more! Oratorios begin next week, to my great joy, for they are the highest entertainment to me.</p>
