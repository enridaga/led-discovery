<p>After dinner we go to Falstaff at the opera, &amp; I am more thrilled than I have been for ages - &amp; so was the audience. 1st perf. at opera and the applause lasted for nearly 1/4 hr. Clemens Krauss conducts splendidly, &amp; the orch. was simply a miracle of perfection - Falstaff was played by Jaro Prohaska, who was a great singer, &amp; gave a delightful character study. The whole cast sang &amp; acted splendidly, esp. Mrs Quickly (Fr. Anday). The scenery &amp; ballet at the end were enchanting. But the greatest honours go to great old Verdi - for his glorious score - humour, tenderness abounding, &amp; the glorious fugue to end. Hats off, Genlemen!!</p>
