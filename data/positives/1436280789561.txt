<p>The First Cycle at Bayreuth commenced on August 13th, and the third, which I attended, was given from the 27th to the 30th. I had a very nice lodging in the house of the verger, just behind the church, and I was most comfortable there. On the first evening, in Das Rheingold, the following singers appeared: Betz, from Berlin, as Wotan he was a native of Mainz, where I was born Frau Griin Sadler as Fricka, Schloesser as Mimi, Herr Gura from Munich as Donner, Vogl as Loge, Hill from Schwerin as Alberich. Fraulein Johanna Wagner, a niece of Wag- ner, took the part of Erda. She was a rather tall woman, with a resonant contralto voice. Fasolt and Fafner were taken by Eiler and Von Reichenberg.</p>
