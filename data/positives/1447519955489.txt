<p>Today at the request of Brother Otts I went up to Tekoa, a mission station on the Charlotte road to preach. Just after breakfast I hurried over to the depot and got on some cars which were about to leave. I found soon, however, that I had not got on the passenger train but on one carrying up soldiers. I knew, however, when I reached Tekoa by Killian's millpond and though the cars were at full speed I had had no intention of going up to Charlotte so I jumped off "flying squirrel" fashion and down I came full length. I jumped up however and found that my neck was not broken and went over to the church. I conducted the Sunday School and got on very successfully until the very close when the choir leader who was singing "Old Hundred" gave out and I was obliged to sing alone the last two lines though I had never sung a line unaided before in my life. I believe I changed the time completely before I got to the end.</p>
