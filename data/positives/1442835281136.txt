<p>I remember so clearly, shortly after the opening of the Festival Hall, I was playing in the company at the reopened Old Vic just across the Waterloo Road. On one of my off nights I got myself a ticket for what was probably the first performance in London of the Monteverdi Vespers of 1610 conducted by Walter Goehr. Unforgettable, it has been one of my great musical loves ever since.</p>
