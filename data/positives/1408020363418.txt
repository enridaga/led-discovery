My Dear Mother,
    Just a line as I am travelling down to Folkestone - so please excuse the writing. I saw Uncle Hugh last night and had drinks with him and Uncle Harry at the [Caledonian] Club [St James’s Square, London] - they were both very jovial. Afterwards Uncle Harry and I went to the Prince of Wales’s [Theatre] and saw 'Mr Manhattan’ - a very good piece indeed with, of course, lots of beauties in it.
