<p>In 1874 the turn was Cologne's, and with no little pride and hardly less anxiety I saw my&nbsp;name announced for the first time in a list of&nbsp;soloists comprising some of the most renowned of&nbsp;the day. But above all, Brahms was to be there. For weeks beforehand my mind was occupied&nbsp;with the thought of seeing face to face the&nbsp;great composer whose name was then on every&nbsp;musician's lips as that of the man whose genius&nbsp;Robert Schumann had publicly proclaimed in the&nbsp;glowing language of an inspired prophet. And&nbsp;I well remember my embarrassment, and the&nbsp;sensation it gave me, when at last I was permitted&nbsp;to shake hands with him after the rehearsal&nbsp;of Handel's Samson, in which oratorio I had&nbsp;been engaged to sing the part of " Harapha."&nbsp;A few kind and encouraging words soon put&nbsp;me at my ease, and I could give myself up to&nbsp;scrutinising Brahms' personal appearance.</p>
