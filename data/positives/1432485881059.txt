Ernst Pauer is here, a star in our musical firmament; with his light touch and light heart, he is very sympathetic to us. His stay of eight-and-forty hours was much too short for us; but how can a great London professional devote more time to an appearance at the Gewandhaus? In Beethoven's 'Concerto in G,' he developed his full technical powers, and I was much interested to find that Haslinger has allowed him to copy the original Manuscript Cadenzas by Beethoven which he had lent me on a former occasion, although he would never publish them. I do not think them up to the exalted level of the grand Concerto, and discard them in consequence. Pauer played one, without making any marked effect with it, not a soul asked who wrote it; in fact the Cadenzas do not bear the stamp of Beethoven's genius.
