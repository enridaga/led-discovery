<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Now retired and living in Rotterdam Holland. I have many great memories of the RFH. The most memorable ev [event] of all was a concert by Beecham on Dec 6 1958 an all Wagner evening. This led me to become a fan of Sir Thomas now for over 40 years.&nbsp; Yours faithfully A R Cornwell</p>
