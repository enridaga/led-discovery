<p>Another theatre, called Il Teatro del Fondo, had closed before my arrival in Naples. It is considerably larger than the two of which I have just spoken - the principal buffo, named Buonaveri, was an excellent actor as well as singer. He had lately returned from Russia, where he had amassed a large fortune. The tenor singer was Signor Mengozzi, a sweet voice, replete with science and great taste. But the delight of the Lazzaroni, and the common people in general, was Jean Cole, the famous Pulcinella. He performed twice a day in a little theatre called Saint Carlino, on the Largo di Castello. The house was always crowded ; and even the King and Court frequented it, to enjoy his comic powers.</p>
