<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I went to some of the opening concerts. I thought it was the most beautiful building, especially as it was there with buildings even more exciting like the Dome of Discovery and Skylon. My father had a small carpet shop and I was particularly fond of the grey and white carpet. My reaction to hearing about the refurbishment was to wonder why such a modern new building needed refurbishing - but then remembered I was a teenager then, and now I also need a bit of refurbishment.&nbsp;</p>
