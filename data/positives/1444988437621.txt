I subscribed to his quartettos 2 or 3 of which were played after the company was gone and pleased me much more than his sinfonies which are too furious and noisy for a room or indeed any other place. He made me a present of his duo, which I heard and liked much the first night I saw him. There was a young man Signor <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Ruma</em>, who played the violin in a very delicate and pleasing manner.</span></p>
