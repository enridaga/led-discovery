<p>I remember once when Louis [Armstrong] came to Lincoln Park in New Orleans to listen to the Kid Ory Band. I was playing trumpet with the Kid then and I let Louis sit in on my chair. Now, at that time, I was the "Blues King" of New Orleans, and when Louis played that day he played more blues than I ever heard in my life. It never did strike my mind that blues could be interpreted in so many different ways. Every time he played a chorus it was different and you knew it was the blues-- yes, it was all blues, what I mean.</p>

<p>Louis makes you feel the number and that's what counts. A man who does something from the heart, and makes you feel it, is great. You see, Louis does that for everything. And one thing, Louis never rehearsed a blues number; he played them just as he felt at the time he was up there on the stand.</p>
