Another musical experience is one for which I am always thankful. Learning that Wesley was opening an organ in London at the great Agricultural Hall, and never having heard him play, I determined not to miss the opportunity of doing so. I attended the recital, when he played his Andante in G and an extempore Fugue
on a very fine subject. I remember how much annoyed I was by the way the people would talk as in these days through the quieter parts of the Andante. This
was the only time I had the opportunity of hearing Wesley.
