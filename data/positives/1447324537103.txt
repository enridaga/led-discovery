<p>As a schoolgirl I was useless as far as the choir was concerned - I was "tone deaf". This I translated as meaning that the world of music was not for me. Happily an elderly friend of the family, not knowing of my "problem", took me to a RFH concert in the Hall's earliest days. It was immediately obvious to me that tone deaf I might be but the music I heard that night opened a door to so much subsequent joy in the decades since.</p>
