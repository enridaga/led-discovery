<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">One of the most vivid experiences I had in Germany was my visit on 30 March to the Berlin Staatsoper, where I saw a wonderful, exciting production of Beethoven&rsquo;s opera <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Fidelio</em>. Listening to this truly great opera, I was at a loss to understand the commonly held opinion that the work does not stage well, that its libretto lacks drama, and so on. In Berlin <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Fidelio </em>was produced by Werner Kelch and conducted by Hermann Abendroth, and their production was certainly thrilling not only because of the brilliant music but also on account of the dramatic action. I hope that before long <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Fidelio </em>will take up the place it deserves in the repertoire of Soviet theatres. </span></p>
