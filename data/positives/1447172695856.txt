<p>[The Jazz Record Society] asked me to give a talk and I chose the subject 'Humour in Jazz'.&nbsp; Among the pieces I played were Clark Terry's 'Mumbles' and a lovely track, drawn to my attention by jazz critic and writer, Bruce Crowther, where Memphis Slim sings 'Beer Drinking Woman' and Madeleine Gautier does a line-by-line translation into French: 'Elle&nbsp;&eacute;tait une grande buveure du bi&egrave;re...' It's bliss, if you can find it.</p>
<p>For the grand finale I chose Carla Bley's band playing 'Star Spangled Banner Minor and Other Patriotic Themes.&nbsp; This is an extended piece - a kind of fantasia on national anthems - and lurches into some very wild free blowing before getting back on to the rails just in time for a big and funny finish.</p>
<p>The band was at its loudest and wildest when I heard someone in the audience murmur to the bloke next to her: 'You're the president - can't you stop it?'</p>
