D'Orsay, who was a Liberal, assured her, laughingly, that this fall in the midst of her Legitimist song was de tres mauvais augure, and a bad prognostic for the success of the party to which she belonged. He did not at the time believe his own prophecy, so firmly did the Bourbons appear to be established; but before the end of the month Charles X. had left France, and was followed by the fair Duchess and her husband, the most faithful friends and adherents of the fallen monarch, and as true to him in adversity as when he shone forth as one of the most powerful sovereigns of Europe. </span></p>
