<p>Stravinsky gave me a lot. It was interesting to listen to him and it was interesting to look at the scores. I liked Mavra, I remember, and L&rsquo;Histoire du Soldat, particularly the first part; it&rsquo;s too boring to listen to the work in its entirety. It&rsquo;s fashionable now to speak disparagingly of Stravinsky&rsquo;s opera, The Rake&rsquo;s Progress, and that&rsquo;s a shame. The work is deeper than a first glance would lead you to believe. But we&rsquo;ve become lazy and lack curiosity.</p>
