<p>I have already mentioned Jenny Lind's appearance at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1848, when I heard her in her incomparable performances. The late Mr. John Mitchell arranged a Concert Tour for her, of several weeks, in 1856, through the principal cities in England, Scotland, and Wales, and engaged me as accompanist. [...] The concerts on this tour were always crowded; the prices of the tickets were one guinea and half a guinea. In those days there were only a few big concert-halls; the Free Trade Hall at Manchester did not then exist, and Jenny Lind was obliged to sing in the small town-hall there. Perhaps the greatest enthusiasm was shown in the Potteries. The concert took place in the Market Hall, Hanley, before an enormous audience of about 5,000 people. I heard that 2,000 factory hands had paid 2s. 6d. each to hear Jenny Lind. Their applause was tremendous, and at the end they gave three cheers, upon which she waved her handkerchief and kissed her hand.</p>
