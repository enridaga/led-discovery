<p>Letter from Bunsen to a Son, Osbourne House: 22nd July, 1857, five a.m. - With a heated head and overclouded spirit I accomplished the journey. The spectacle of the sea refreshed me. The noble fleet at Spithead saluted the royal flag of Prussia with far-echoing thunder; the musical bands of the five vessels of the line, as we glided past, played alternately ' God save the Queen,' and the ' Landesvater ' (which I had introduced in England in 1842), and the whole did me good. Seeing Prince Albert and the Queen, in their beautiful tranquillity, in the isle of the south, overlooking the sea, rejoiced me. I am heartily devoted to them both, and they showed me all their accustomed kindness.</p>
