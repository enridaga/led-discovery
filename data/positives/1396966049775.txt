Practise & write as usual. [Albert] Sammons is practising & writing in the room next to mine in the afternoon. I go to Queen's Hall to get tickets, & Augeners to get my Brahms picture framed after tea. Practise viola after supper, & then as I settle down to write, I notice in Radio Times that Brahms quartet 3 is going to be broadcast by Hungarian S.Q. So I borrow Miss Prior's Wireless, & have marvellous 1/2 hr listening to the purest music in the purest of possible forms. What a marvellous craze for the viola Brahms had! What a humorous theme the last movement has!
