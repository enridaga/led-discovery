We've been listening ten times a day to Ralph Kirkpatrick's "long playing" versions of Falla's masterpiece. Years ago I had the composer's own recording, and it seemed more savage and raw, a kind of Spanish Kafka in music. Ralph is slicker, but the harpsichord doesn't make enough noise... It's funny how one knows that certain masterpieces must have been totally conceived in a single day. These three movements overflow into each: it had to be written quickly so as not to spill on the floor and disappear.
