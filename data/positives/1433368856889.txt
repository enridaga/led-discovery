<p>At David Diamond's invitation I conducted a seminar at Julliard this afternoon. The assembly consisted of David, Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter, and twenty of their pupils. Printed copies of <em>Ariel</em> were handed out, the record of it was played, and the next seventy-five minutes were consumed in discussion mostly of word-setting.</p>
