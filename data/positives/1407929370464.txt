So took coach and to Windsor to the guarter, and thither sent for Dr. Childe - who came to us, and carried us to St. George’s Chappell and there placed us among the Knights’ Stalls (and pretty the observation, that no man, but a woman, may sit in a Knight’s place where any brasse-plates are set). And hither comes cushions to us, and a young singing-boy to bring us a copy of the Anthemne to be sung. And here, for our sakes, had this anthem and the great service sung extraordinary, only to entertain us. It is a noble place endeed, and good Quire of voices.
