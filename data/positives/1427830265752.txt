I hear many mediocre musicians. A great many. But they have the right to live. Itâ€™s only song and dance ensembles like the Red Army chorus that drive me mad. If I were suddenly to become minister of culture, I would immediately disband all these ensembles. That would be my first order. I would naturally be arrested immediately for sabotage, but they would never reorganize the scattered ensembles.
