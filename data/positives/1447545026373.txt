<p>Another curious musical reminiscence of Belgrade&nbsp;dates from the year of the great Servian rebellion (1876),&nbsp;during the greater portion of which it was my duty to&nbsp;abide in the Principality as a chronicler of current&nbsp;events. Whilst in Belgrade, awaiting permission to&nbsp;join the Russo-Servian headquarters at Parachin, I became acquainted with all the members of the Diplomatic&nbsp;Body, which had undergone a complete change of personnel since my last previous visit, and was no less surprised than delighted to find amongst them one of the&nbsp;finest amateur pianists and ablest sight-readers in Europe.&nbsp;This was Count Joannini, the chief of the Italian Mission, a pupil and worshipper of Franz Liszt, whose compositions he played with great facility and infinite relish.&nbsp;Upon paying my first visit to this accomplished musician&nbsp;&mdash; whom I had hitherto only known by reputation as a&nbsp;particularly well-informed diplomatist &mdash; I found him&nbsp;seated at one of two grand-pianos, arranged head and tail in the approved concert "form,"...&nbsp;I&nbsp;have seldom seen anybody look so pleasurably astonished&nbsp;as he did when I mentioned that "il suonare a prima&nbsp;vista " was a favourite musical recreation of mine. Two&nbsp;minutes later we were both " in position," with a thick&nbsp;cahier of Liszt's Symphonic Poems facing us ; and, before&nbsp;we parted that afternoon, had worked our way through&nbsp;<em>Tasso, Mazeppa, Hamlet</em> and the <em>Todtentunz</em>. He was,&nbsp;indeed &mdash; alas! that I should have to speak of him in the&nbsp;past tense &mdash; a brilliantly intelligent pianist, gifted with&nbsp;that quick perception of a composer's meaning which is&nbsp;only exhibited by elect musical natures, and deeply&nbsp;versed in all the most approved methods of dealing with&nbsp;technical difficulties.</p>
