<p>From my previous letter you learnt, my dearest parents, that I had allowed myself to be persuaded to give a concert; and so yesterday, Tuesday, at seven o'clock in the evening I made my bow on the stage of the Royal and Imperial Opera House! The sort of performance that took place yesterday in this theatre is called here a "Musical Academy". Since I got nothing out of it, and did not try to get anything, Count Gallenberg put it on quickly and arranged the programme thus: A Beethoven Overture; My Variations; Song by [Miss] Veltheim; My Rondo [and] then another song after which the evening ended with a short ballet. The orchestral accompaniment went so badly at rehearsal that I substituted a Free Fantasia for the Rondo. As soon as I appeared on the stage they started clapping; and the applause was so great after each variation that I could not hear the orchestral tuttis. [Chopin was on the stage, the orchestra down in the pit.] At the end they applauded so loudly that I had to come back twice and bow. Although my Free Fantasia did not turn out particularly well they clapped still louder and I had to take another bow. I came out the more willingly since the appreciation of these Germans is worth something. Thus Wurfel had brought to a successful conclusion on Tuesday a project that had only been thought of on Sunday: I am very much indebted to him.</p>
