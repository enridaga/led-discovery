The Teatro Radegonda has a second-rate theatre band, and singers for the most part rough and untrained; the prompter, not hidden as elsewhere, occasionally joins in the fray, the good voices are often shipwrecked in the howling storm of the finales, but at that certain passage where the prima donna steps forward with outstretched arms and rolling eyes, the public applauds vehemently. The opera was 'Luisa Miller' by Verdi; it has no overture, only some hackneyed ideas, screaming noise, and here and there one or two good vocal effects, which barely sufficed to keep me awake.
