<p>There were two chairs brought in for the Duchess of Portland and myself to sit on, (by order of their Majesties,) which were easier chairs than those belonging to the room. We were seated near the door that opened to the concert-room. The King directed them to play Handel and Geminiani's music, which he was graciously pleased to say was to gratify me. These are flattering honours, and I should not indulge so much upon this subject, but that I depend upon your believing it proceeds more from gratitude than vanity. The 3 eldest Princesses came into the room in about half an hour after we were seated. All the royal family were dressed in a uniform for the demi-saison, of a violet blue armozine, with gauze aprons, &amp;c, &amp;c. The Queen had the addition of a great many fine pearls. When the concert of music was over, the young Princess Amelia, nine weeks old, was sent for, and brought in by her nurse and attendants.</p>
