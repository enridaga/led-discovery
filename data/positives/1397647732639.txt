The first great performance of Stainer's ‘Crucifixion’, as rendered by Tréport Garrison Choral Society, took place this evening to an audience of men from the convalescent camp. To be truthful, I don’t think it was very brilliant performance. Still, it certainly went better than at dress rehearsal last Tuesday. We made a false start at the beginning and there followed various shaky and uncertain leads. Capt. Brown was not at his best, being mostly out of tune and rather reedy. The other soloists rendered their items very well. The anthem seemed to go quite well as far as one could tell, being in the choir.
