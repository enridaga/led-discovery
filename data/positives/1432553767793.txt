In spite of the pouring rain, the concert last night was crammed, and our success very great. Wilma played beautifully, and, thank God, the exertion has had no ill effect [on Wilma's hurt finger]. So we hope we may now go on without further interruption. The two sonatas of Beethoven's seemed to please most last night ; they were certainly listened to with breathless attention and vehemently applauded.
