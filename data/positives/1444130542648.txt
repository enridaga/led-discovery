Fritz, a famous performer on the violin here and a good composer whom I have many years wished to hear. [&hellip;] I prevailed on him to go into another [room] and play me a solo, which he did most admirably, tho&rsquo; I am certain he must be near 70 - a thin sensible looking old man &ndash; but I never heard more spirit in a young man of 20, and his solo was good.</span></p>
