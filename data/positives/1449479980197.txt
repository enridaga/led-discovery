<p class="MsoNormal">We sailed to Adelaide, capital of South Australia, two days distant. It is a charming city with a population of fifty thousand. We gave about ten concerts, with fair success. [...]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Returning to Melbourne, we had a splendid farewell concert in the grand City Hall. We were honored by the attendance of all the city dignitaries, in their regal robes. After the concert, the Club and the assisting artists were treated to a supper in the mayor&rsquo;s room.</p>
