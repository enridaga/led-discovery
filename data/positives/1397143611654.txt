We have stayed at Tournai all night, so have had a lovely undisturbed sleep. In the afternoon yesterday, Mr Lowery, our American MO, took us out again, and we visited the cathedral and stayed to a service. The music was glorious, and the pageant very magnificent, but we didnâ€™t understand it. I thought the cathedral quite the most beautiful I have seen in France - no tawdry decorations and the stonework and sculpture are very good. The windows are beautiful old stained glass and the organ a great joy.
