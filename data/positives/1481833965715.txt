<p>In Paris nothing much is going on. There were the Wi&eacute;ner concerts. The first one was entirely Stravinsky and included the Octet, which I had not heard before. The second was devoted to Milhaud and Falla, with&nbsp;<em>Le Retable</em> and two new things by Milhaud, one of which, his&nbsp;<em>Symphony with Voices</em>, sounded just like a 'first draft' of&nbsp;<em>La Cr&eacute;ation&nbsp;</em>(one of the themes is there almost in its entirety). This symphony is in fact very fine - I liked it a lot. The oboe is used to clever advantage and sounds most effective. As for the Octet, I was not as 'carried away' as I would have expected to be. It is true that I had Koechlin next to me curbing and restraining my enthusiasm. I nevertheless did have the feeling of something 'very good' and I am sure it is a marvellous work. Apart from that, there are no musical events worth going out of one's way for.&nbsp;</p>
