On Christmas Day in the evening I remember I went, for the first time to the chapel, which was then handsomely lighted up (according to annual custom on that evening in consequence of a legacy for that purpose). - As this was now to be our place of residence, I was of course in hopes I sho'd find an organ in the chapel, w'ch however I was afraid to ask about beforehand for fear of a disappointment, but on approaching the chapel in the evening was glad to hear the sound of it, it being on that occasion played before the service began..... The organist also (Mr Wafer) used to take that opportunity of shewing off, so that not being then acquainted with his usual style of play, I thought him a capital player & more equal to Mr Wheatly  at Greenwich.
