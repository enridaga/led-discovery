We have now had three days of rain in this place. Rowley decided yesterday that something must be done to cheer the fellows up; so we had an impromptu concert in a large outhouse, big enough to hold most of the men. As a concert it was not a success. We had no piano, and our stock of choruses soon ran out. Before the evening was half over, every officer, and then every humorist of the company, had taken his turn at speech- making, and finally we fell back upon the inevitable improper story. Even that didnâ€™t raise much merriment... Still, we had beer, a full barrel of it, and all the cigarettes we could lay hands on; and certainly we wished each other well. I suppose I am a rank idealist, but Lord! how far this was from what one would wish to give these men.
