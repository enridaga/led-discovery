Our stay [Tertis and Lillian Warmington] in Cape Town lasted for three months. Among our professional engagements was a recital which Lillian was asked to give for the Cape Town University. Others were a performance of Flos Campi when I was fortunate in the conductor â€“ Charles Mackerras, who gave a splendid interpretation of the work.
