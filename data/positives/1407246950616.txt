[I]n a closet we had a very good dinner by Mr. Pinkny's courtesy. And after dinner we had pretty good singing and one Hazard sung alone after the old fashion, which was very much cried up; but I did not like it. Thence we went to the Greene Dragon on Lambeth hill, both the Mr. Pinknys, Smith, Harrison, Morrice that sang the bass, Sheply and I, and there we sang of all sorts of things and I ventured with good success upon things at first sight and after that played on my flagelette; and stayed there till 9-a-clock, very merry and drawn on with one song after another till it came to be so late.
