While in London I had the opportunity of hearing a very beautiful concert of the works of Manuel de Falla. With a decision and crispness meriting high praise, he conducted his remarkable ‘El Retablo de Maese Pedro’, in which he had the valuable assistance of Mme Vera Janacopoulos. I also greatly enjoyed hearing his concerto for harpsichord or piano, which he himself played on the latter instrument. In my opinion these two works give proof of incontestable progress in the development of his great talent. He has, in them, deliberately emancipated himself from the folklorist influence under which he was in danger of stultifying himself.
