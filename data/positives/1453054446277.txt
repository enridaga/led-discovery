<p>During my subsequent visits to Petrograd I&nbsp;chiefly gave recitals of songs, many of them by&nbsp;Russian composers, which I sang in the original.&nbsp;I learned the meaning of every word of a&nbsp;song, and a very nice young lawyer, Ivan&nbsp;Ivanovitch, coached me in the pronunciation,&nbsp;which, owing not unlikely to the portion of&nbsp;Polish blood in my veins, came comparatively&nbsp;easy to me. I had been told of the generous&nbsp;enthusiasm of Petrograd audiences, and how&nbsp;it often materializes in the shape of a valuable&nbsp;present, so that, for instance, it is not at all&nbsp;unusual for officers of a " crack " regiment&nbsp;to club together and throw to a foreign prima&nbsp;donna, singing at the opera house as a guest,&nbsp;and who may have been fortunate enough to&nbsp;captivate their ears and hearts, a diamond&nbsp;bracelet or some other precious piece of&nbsp;jewellery, hidden in a bouquet of flowers, across&nbsp;the footlights. And sure enough, when I returned to&nbsp;Germany after my second visit, my valise&nbsp;was considerably the heavier for containing&nbsp;several silver and gold cigarette-cases and&nbsp;match-boxes, a silver tankard, a silver bowl,&nbsp;a scarfpin, and other presents given to me by&nbsp;people I hardly knew.</p>
