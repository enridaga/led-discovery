<p>Thursday [28th] evening I went to see Boris Goudonov. Chaliapin with a bad Italian company. Chaliapin a more terrific actor than ever.&nbsp; Just as the curtain fell at the end of the fit scene I saw him turn his head - still watching that ghost in case it should pounce again. This was superb.</p>
