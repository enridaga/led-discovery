<p>Lohengrin at 6.0 It is a lovely work - but not Wagner at his height of course, &amp; there are some dull &amp; bad patches. But alot of it is first rate stuff - most, perhaps. A good show - Orch. not too good &amp; conductor (Fischer) ditto. A very lovely Elsa [BB leaves gap], and a disappointing Lohengrin [BB leaves gap]. The others are all good tho' not super. Staging very fine, and most of the acting good - tho' the duets not convincing.&nbsp;</p>
