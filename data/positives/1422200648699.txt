So in 1933 it was an important event, this first try-out with orchestra at college of a work I was slowly beginning to realize I could play at a reasonable tempo after all. It was also an event which almost failed to happen. It was Tuesday, and on Monday I had gone to see Freddie Haggis to excuse myself, my right hand in a sling. It was the thumb that was damaged. The Saturday previously I had been playing as a second-row forward against 'Z' division of the Metropolitan Police, and had unwisely tried to tackle one of the larger minions of the law as he propelled himself, head down, towards our line.... That didn't help my concerto, though, and Mr Haggis was emphatic. 'You can either play rugby or the clarinet,' he said, 'not both, for long!' But again, since I had no professional intentions, both it certainly had to be and come Tuesday the sling was off, and I was able to stagger through the concerto by the grace of a very tight band of Elastoplast in a sort of alpha shape around the base of the thumb.
