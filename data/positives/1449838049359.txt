On these occasions, after the third course, the toasts and speeches are given out between the succeeding courses ; the favourite toasts are responded to musically in a manner, I must own, very superior to our &ldquo; Hip, hip, hurrah,&rdquo; and &ldquo; For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow.&rdquo; All the guests sang in perfect time and tune, most of them being, as I ascertained, members of various choral and other associations for the practice of vocal part music.</span></p>
