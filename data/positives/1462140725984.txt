<p>'last Friday I had a jolly evening. Mother &amp; I went and hear F. Delius "Appalachia" performed at the Queen's Hall. I do so wish you could have heard it. I dont say it's a perfect work&nbsp;<em>at all</em>, or even a work of pure genius; but it did strike me as poetic, &amp; individual &amp; genuine, &amp;&nbsp;<em>most corageously experimental</em>. The new things he tried for seemed to me really pluckly &amp; of vital interest &amp; not the usual dull commonplace (&amp; usually perfectly "safe") wheezes of so much so called "modern" stuff. Then such a lot of it was piano &amp; tender-colored, &amp; that is such a elief &amp; refreshingness (original in the Bergen Public Library).'&nbsp;</p>
