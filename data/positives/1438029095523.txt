<p style="text-align: left;">Listen to Stravinsky contemp. concert under Ansermet from B.B.C. at 9.0.* Mavra, comic opera, very intersting &amp; quite amusing, tho' not very satisfactory for broadcasting - neither was Les Noces, which followed, tho' one couldn't help being thrilled by much of it especially the exciting rhythms, and colours; splendid architecture &amp; the beautiful end. A great work.&nbsp;</p>
