I must have seen the little Clara, afterwards the famous Clara Schumann at her father's, Mr. Wieck, and little did I think then what intense pleasure she would give me in after-years, and how her execution of my own G minor concerto in the Gewandhaus would delight me. No better reading and execution of the work can be heard; I could not myself play it more to my own satisfaction. It is just as if she had composed it herself.
