<p>Reverting for a moment to his [Tausig]&nbsp;characteristics as a performer, I may add that he produced&nbsp;a broader tone than any other Berlin pianist of his day&nbsp;&mdash; that his lightness of touch in rendering the fanciful&nbsp;and elaborate ornamentations of Chopin and Liszt, as&nbsp;simply exquisite, and that he was especially remarkable&nbsp;for the <em>verve</em> and <em>ton</em> with which he executed those&nbsp;amazing <em>tours de force</em> invented by himself as well as by&nbsp;the mighty Hungarian ecclesiastic, which are the terror&nbsp;of ninety-nine expert pianists in every hundred. No&nbsp;one who ever listened to his feats in this direction will&nbsp;bo likely to forget what a wealth of sound and complexity of combinations his deft fingers extracted from&nbsp;the key-board. In him were combined the more salient&nbsp;excellences of the old and new schools of pianism.</p>
