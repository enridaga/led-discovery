<p>I could not find anything to say to you last night to express my enthusiasm. I feel it will be the same tonight. Yet I desperately want you to know into what state of&nbsp;<em>superior</em> emotion I was plunged last night. Your art has reached such a height that it would need the language of Sophocles himself to describe it. Heavens, how beautiful it is! Allow me to embrace you. Which is a rare honour for me.&nbsp;</p>
