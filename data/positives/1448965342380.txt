<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was single and able to indulge myself by going to concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, then the Festival Hall was built and I was able to book for several of the inaugural concerts, so my love was born and it had to be the Royal Festival Hall from then until the present time. I am in receipt of the diary having been a member from many years ago. There were so many new experiences of music I didn't know much about and orchestras from all parts of the world, never to forget the first time hearing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra playing Mahler's First Symphony, Georg Shulty [Solti] conducting - and 8 horn players standing for the final movement. Hope all can be understood, age is wearying at times - now 86+.</p>
