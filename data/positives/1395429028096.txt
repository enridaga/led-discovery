Driving into Chippenham with Fanny this morning we saw the headquarters of the 13th Hussars who had just marched in, band playing. They were on their way up from Dartmoor to Colchester. They had been taking part in disastrous manoeuvres. Horses and men looked thin, worn, weak, dirty and jaded and as if the best manoeuvres they could accomplish would be a manoeuvre into their barracks.
