<p>This morning, first rehearsal of <em>Winter Pages</em> (at least, the first to which I was invited, and I brought JH) seemed rough. But this afternoon on the stage things went smoother. Each of the five players - Gervase De Peyer (clarinet), Loren Glickman (bassoon), Jamie Buswell (violin), Leslie Parnas (cello), and Charles Wadsworth (piano) - is separately super, but they know how to meld, too, like a deck of cards, or rather like frantic amoebas.</p>
