<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I remember my first visit to the RFH on June 12th 1951. We sat right at the back of the Grand Tier. The programme (which I sill have) consisted of Elgar - The Music Makers and Dypan (?) The Canterbury Pilgrims and I wonder how many times the Dypan has been performed since. The most memorable concert in the early days was the Shostakovich Symphony No. 8 played by the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mravinoky (?) on September 23rd 1960. This time I sat near the front of the stalls and the performance and the sound was shattering - never to be forgotten!</p>
