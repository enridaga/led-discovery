<p>An extract from Contemporary Notices from Diaries, 31st October, 1852 - About half-past eleven parts of the procession began to drop in; about one o'clock the clergy filed off, with the Bishop of London and Dean Milman at their head, to meet the bier, and, after some delay, returned with it&mdash;the Choir in front singing, ' I am the Resurrection and the Life,' without any organ accompaniment,&mdash;both sight and sound were grand : but the most striking moment was when the coffin was lowered by invisible machinery into the vault, and all the Generals, contemporaries of the Duke, stood round, holding the banners in a circle about it, and following with a last look all that was mortal of him who had stood first among them, as the receptacle slowly vanished from sight&mdash; and most affecting it was to see so many men of iron mould shedding tears.</p>
