Have just had a very delightful evening. We have got the Transport Officer of another battalion messing with us at present. He is a very charming man and rather a friend of mine, but his greatest asset is that he possesses a very good gramophone. This I insisted he should produce tonight. It did me a lot of good as mental refreshment. Among other records he had two that Edward used to play, Raff’s Cavatina and Saint-Saens’ Le Cygne. What a number of things have happened since the days when he used to condescend to fiddle at my Saturday afternoon Entertainments in the Schoolroom at Uppingham!
