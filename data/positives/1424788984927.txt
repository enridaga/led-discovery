Dear Tertis, I have only just heard my 2nd Violin Sonata played by you for the ‘Columbia’. It is marvellously beautiful, and I am overjoyed. I cannot imagine it better played. You have got so inside the music, and I never thought the viola could sound so lovely. What a great artist you are! The Hassan Serenade is also quite beautiful…Please also thank Mr Reeves for his excellent collaboration.
