I have at this moment (10 p.m.) arrived from Windsor, and I will relate my adventures before going to bed. I arrived there at two o'clock; Ruland had an excellent luncheon ready in his room, during which he told me that we should go up to the Rubens room afterwards (where there are two pianos) to make a little music, and that we should perhaps receive a visit from the Princess of Wales, who had known for the last two days, through Lady Augusta Bruce, that I was expected to-day. A little after three o'clock we went upstairs and began to play duets....After another quarter of an hour Lady Augusta Bruce came in and was graciousness itself ; she is a very amiable lady, passionately fond of music. I had to play a sonata of Schubert's, one of Beethoven's, and heaven knows how many little pieces by Bach, Mendelssohn, Heller, &c. She only left us at past six o'clock, and then we went back to Ruland's room.
