<p>On Saturday, April 18th, 1874, the first con- cert took place at St. James's Hall. I conducted the overture to Weber's<em> Euryanthe</em>, the C minor pianoforte concerto of Beethoven played by Mlle Marie Krebs (she was the daughter of Kapellmeister Krebs, of the Dresden Opera, and a very fine player), and the "Friedensfeier" overture by Reinecke, the conductor of the famous Gewandhaus Concerts at Leipzig, besides conducting the charming vocal pieces by Mlle Marimon and Mlle Scalchi, both from Covent Garden. Dr. Wylde conducted one of Beethoven's symphonies. Everything went without a hitch and I received kind congratulations from everybody, and was more than glad of the opportunity of conducting such a fine band of musicians.</p>
