<p>Letter from Bunsen to Mrs Waddington - The contrast in passing from the Catholic Jura to Protestant Neufchatel was great : it was Sunday&mdash;on the French side the roads (in a horrible condition) were crowded with wheeled conveyances for enormous trees, perhaps fifty or sixty in number, accompanied by loud swearing and quarrelling drivers ; on the side of Switzerland, in the same tract of country (a brook forming the boundary), the same race to the eye, the same language to the ear, but all quietness, peace, mildness, and cleanliness ; bells were ringing, and the population going to church. How thankful I felt that we had to wait at the post station, because the postillions were gone to church ! I was ashamed of our travelling, and yet so glad of the visible proof of being in a really free and Christian country.</p>
