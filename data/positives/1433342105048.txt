<p>It was the greatest thrill of a kid to hold and watch a musician's instrument whom he idolised. The most miserable feeling a youngster in New Orleans can experience is to be in a classroom in school, studying, and hearing a brass band approaching, swinging like crazy, then pass the school, and fade off into the distance. You will witness a lot of sad expressions in that room. Now if it happens to be lunch hour, recess twelve to one, when the bell rings at one p.m., a lot of seats will be vacant. Now that's an honest fact, as this observer was guilty three or four times himself. The music would excite and move you to such an extent that when you would realize it, you had "second-lined" maybe ten or twenty blocks from school...</p>
