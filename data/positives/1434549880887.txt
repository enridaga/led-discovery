Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 8th Nov. 1750 -
We have been so much taken up, that we have not either gone out or engaged company at home, that we should have no inters, only on Wednesday, night we went to the Philharmonic concert, which was agreeable enough, and we design to go to the first good comedy that is acted, and then I think I shall have done with public places for the winter season, till February is over.
