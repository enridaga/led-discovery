Our next stop is Kuala Lumpur, and a map is really necessary to appreciate the distances we are covering... We stay at a Chinese hotel which didn't have a suite until our embassy people took a wall out and had a doorway made between two rooms--especially for me! Evidently the news that I am a suite connoisseur has gone ahead of me. The corn soup and shrimp with rice are truly memorable here. So is a young clarinetist presented by a high government official, who wants to know if the boy should persist with his musical career.

"Go pack your bag," I say jesting, after he has played a while. "We leave at nine in the morning."

I have him meet the five clarinet players in the band. They all get together with their axes, and they endorse him as a great talent.
