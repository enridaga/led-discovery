I [Mr John Ella] saw the L.'s in Paris, en route from Switzerland. Odd enough, they and my party were in Martigny they going to and we coming from Chamounix on the same evening, and both parties heard a Prussian officer (engineer) play Beethoven's 'Son. Pathetique,' Mendelssohn's March, and the Sonata in A flat, con Marcia funebre ! very well indeed ! I can never forget the impression! Lovely, mild night, full, bright moon, sitting outside the auberge after dinner, in a valley surrounded with peaks of St. Bernard, &c., &c.
