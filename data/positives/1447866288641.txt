<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I remember visiting the Festival of Britain, aged 15. How thrilling it all was, so many people walking about talking and laughing and enjoying themselves - amazing. I was sorry they didn't keep the 'Skylon'. I visited the Festival Hall for a concert, probably including Beethoven's 6th Symphony - the first piece of classical music I heard! The acoustics seemed wonderful then, I do hope they are at least as good in the new hall!! Living in London means I can visit as often as I can afford.</p>
