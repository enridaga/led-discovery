<p>I had the good fortune, on my benefit night, to produce, for the first time, the musical entertainment of " No Song, no Supper." It will hardly be credited that this charming and popular opera, which has been acted hundreds of nights, was actually rejected by the Drury Lane management. Its author, my valued friend, Prince Hoare, and Storace, the composer of its enchanting music, gave it me for my benefit ; the applause it received on that night, induced the managers to solicit it from the author and composer. All the music is beautiful, but the finale to the first act is a most masterly composition ; the drama is full of comic situations, and the whole, in my opinion, excellent. In the summer I went to Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester, and Chester. The Italian Opera was performed at the little theatre in the Haymarket this year, which was the first of George Colman the younger's management.</p>
