Every night, with Alice [Chabrier's wife] , we make the rounds of the café-concerts where they sing the malaguñas, the soledas, the zapatéados and the peteneras; then the dances, which are positively Arabian, that sums it up. If you could see them wriggling their rear ends, twisting and squirming, I don’t think you’d care to leave. At Málaga the thing got so strong I had to get my wife out of there, it wasn’t even funny.
