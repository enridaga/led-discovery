Mayhew and I went this morning to Corpus to breakfast with Laing. David has luxurious double rooms, oak-panelled, in the Fellows’ Buildings…. 

After breakfast we took leave of David and strolled into the College gardens where I had never been before and along the high terraced walk upon the old town wall overshadowed by the drooping feathering limes. As we walked upon this lime terrace we heard the bells beginning to chime for the ten o’clock service down at Magdalen and we resolved to go to Magdalen Chapel. Scarcely were we seated in the stalls than we heard the rustle of footsteps and white wings and the angel choir newlighted on this earthly shore came in and took their places. Then followed the praying of the sweet solitary voice answered by the chorus of angels and the splendid storm of the anthem as we 'heard once more in college fanes the storm their high-built organs make and shake the prophets blazoned in the panes.'
