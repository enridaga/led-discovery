I practise harder and harder, and have bought some new music for instance, Kalkbrenner's Effasio Musica, undisputably his best work, and Chopin's Variations on ' La ci darem ' from ' Don Giovanni.' This is so dreadfully difficult, that I have to study it bar by bar, but I think that when I have overcome the difficulties (which 
will probably take a long time) I shall find it to be one of the most delightful works I know.
