<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">On 12 May Nikolai Malko conducted my symphony at the Philharmonia, with great success. The success and fine sound of the symphony inspired me with courage and hope. If only I can manage to make ends meet, I shall work ceaselessly in the field of music, to which I shall dedicate my whole life. As for the present, I need to take a summer holiday and restore my health. </span></p>
