<p>THE LAST NIGHT OF THE BATTALION IN ENGLAND. Wednesday July 28th. The 37th Division had shouted itself hoarse for days, and was not going to stop now. The 10th R.F. seemed especially hearty, but all did well, as the saying is. And let no man dare to say he knows of what songs the British soldier is really tired. In ordinary moments he will give you 'Here we are again!', 'Who were you with last night?', 'The old garden wall', and lately the almost national 'Keep the home-fires burning', 'When this bloody war is over', and the rest. Indeed we had them all to-night from regiment after regiment on the Plain. But, as I said before I hold it truth that in this war the British soldier, when really moved, will surely give you 'Tipperary'.</p>
