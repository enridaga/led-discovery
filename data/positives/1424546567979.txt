When I broached the subject [change the violas position in the orchestra] to my dear friend Sir John Barbirolli, he was as ever ready to probe into anything that might mean progress and generously arranged, together with the Hall√© Society, to give the plan a trial, and this took place in the Free Trade Hall Manchester on 2 May 1964. The result of the trial was that the consensus of opinion did not entirely agree with my contention that better balance of tone in the normal position of the orchestra is particularly evident in passages when the brass and wind are playing with full force, obliterating a large measure of string tone which is important and thus ruining the balance.
