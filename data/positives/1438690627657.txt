<p style="text-align: justify;">At Montreuil, we went to the hotel kept by the two Brothers with enormous Cocked Hats...I would advise those who are fond of good-living, and particularly of woodcock-pies, to dine at Montreuil, the younger Cocked Hat is esteemed a perfect cordon bleu in cookery. We slept at Abbeville, at the Hotel de l'Europe, an excellent house. We took luncheon at Beauvais, where it was market-day; and the street, in which our inn was situated, was crowded with market-people, listening to a French ballad-singer, roaring away on the steps of the coffee-house, opposite to our inn. I was in high spirits, and determined to rival the said Stentorian ballad-singer; so I mounted the steps, and sang a strophe of a French song. The crowd gave me great applause, and loud cheering; so much indeed, that the mistress of the coffee-house declared, that if I would remain at Beauvais, and sing to the frequenters of her coffee-room, she would board and lodge me, free <br />of expense.</p>
