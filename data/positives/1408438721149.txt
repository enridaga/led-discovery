Begin Viola part. Usual Practice. Walk with Gates after tea. Frank Bridge rings up at dinner to know whether I can go to Russ. Ballet (at Lyceum) instead of Mrs Bridge who’s not well with toothache. So I go with him & Miss Fass. See De Falla’s El Amor Brujo – Wonderful. Glinka Ratmir’s Dream, mod. & most glorious of all Petrushka; this is an inspiration from beginning to end. Wonderful dancing esp. Voizikowsky as P. Finish with a rolicking Danses Polovtsiennes (Borodin – P. Igor). I have never even imagined there could be such dancing.
