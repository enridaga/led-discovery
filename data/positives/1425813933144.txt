Performance of Handel's oratorio Samson on Oct. 16, 1814, at the Imperial Riding Academy, Vienna....After everyone had taken his place, it was not long until Their Majesties made their entrance; after tumultuous cries of "Vivat", the introduction of the oratorio was intoned. Herr Soini was the first to be heard, opening the singing with a recitative and aria. To keep my report within bounds, I must limit myself to the total effect the oratorio had upon me. First of all, I must speak of the performance of the soloists. Mme. Gaym端ller sang the soprano part - no, this time she did not sing but rather kept out of tune and indeed showed poor training; Herr Sonnleithner also sang off pitch, and the sound was all the more unpleasant for coming from a basso profundo. On the other hand, I cannot praise highly enough the clean intonation and good delivery of Mlle. Werthheimstein, who sang the alto with a beautiful, full voice; equally good was Herr Soini, whose powerful and agreeable baritone as well as his clear declamation - modeled always to suit the sense of the text -charmed everyone. Mlle. Werthheim足stein and Herr Soini were the only singers worthy of Handel's oratorio. The chorus of more than four hundred singers performed well together, and the entire production came off with足out any mishaps. Mosel conducted the work skilfully and the orchestra accompanied the solo parts  with extraordinary re足straint, while it produced a tremendous power in the tutti sections. While listening to the oratorio, I was fully convinced that, among all the arts, the sound of music moves the human being most deeply; while a pianissimo  threatens to chill the blood, a forte or fortissimo induces the strongest excitement. Neither word nor color can produce so swift an alternation of feeling.
