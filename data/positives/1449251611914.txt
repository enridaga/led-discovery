<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I went to the Festival Hall in 1953 when I was 7 and fell in love with classical music. Shura Cherkassky was playing the piano and Sir Adrian Boult was the conductor. I had a wonderful view of the orchestra and was entranced by the music...it could have been Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No 1.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Since then, I have been to many, many performances and a few years ago took my, then teenage boys, to see The Nutcracker which, would you believe, they loved!</p>
