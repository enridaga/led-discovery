<p>[&hellip;] my cousin Jack stuck to the musical profession. Two of my songs he sang really beautifully and with very great success, i.e. &ldquo;To Mary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Youth once loved a Maiden.&rdquo; In fact, he sang them so often that one day I said to him, laughing - &ldquo;You know, Jack, they really are not the only songs I have written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was engaged by Sir Henry Irving to sing &ldquo;Sigh no more Ladies,&rdquo; when he produced <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Much Ado about Nothing</em> at the Lyceum (his mother, of course, called it &ldquo;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Much Ado about Nothing at all</em>&rdquo;), and the way he sang that song was certainly among the most attractive things in the performance. Although as Balthazar he had to call himself &ldquo;an ill singer,&rdquo; the moment he had finished the last note I am quite certain that very few people in the house were ever found to agree with him.</p>
