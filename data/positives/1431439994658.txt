Joachim, a boy of thirteen years of age, has come to London, bringing with him a letter of recommendation from Mendelssohn; his talent, however, is his best introduction. We organized a small party expressly for him; I listened with delight to him and Emily playing in Mendelssohn's lovely 'D minor trio;' after that I was fairly taken by Joachim's manly and brilliant rendering of David's 'Variations' and De BÃ©riot's 'Rondo'. Mendelssohn is right, here we have talent of the true stamp.
