<p>In the evening I went with Ian [Parsons] to a Courtauld concert. &nbsp;Bruno Walther conducted Beeth. symphony no 1, the scherzo superbly played, and then Mahler's Lied von der Erde. &nbsp;An interminably dreary soup, mawkish and morbid at once. &nbsp;The last movement was the only one I have listened to, and by the time it came I was too weary to notice anything except a passage of much worked downward phrases just before the contralto came in with her unsupprted bit about the stirrup-cup. &nbsp;When she had said Euring for the sixth time Ian and I laid our heads on each other's shoulders.&nbsp;</p>
