Of course all teenagers feel that the music they enjoy is a lot better than middle-aged adults can possibly realise. I am sure that that was the case in the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s. There was something about the stuff that was being produced from 1970s onwards which marked it out. Sure, there were trashy singles that everybody went mad over and nobody today has ever heard. But there was also a lot of music which has lasted and is still well known over forty years later. The music from that time is still heard all the time and, what is really interesting, it is still enjoyed by teenagers today. Steve Harley and David Bowie are not merely historical curiosities but singers who have a substantial following among young people in the twenty-first century. That is odd, because I don’t recall any teenagers when I was young in the 1970s being fans of Vera Lynn, for example. Something about the best music of the 1970s has lasted and is still attractive to youngsters now.
