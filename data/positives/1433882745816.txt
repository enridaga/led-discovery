<p>Sir Charles Hudson, who was very fond of music, used, every year, to entertain Mr. Greatorex and his companions for a fortnight. It was at the season of the autumnal assize, and under this gentle man's patronage, that Miss Greatorex held her annual concert. It was a common practice for the Judges to stop and dine with Sir Charles on their way to Leicester. In compliment to the baronet I have seen them both at the concert on the following evening. It was there that I caught something like true notions of taste. I had not then been to town, and the superior style with which the Londoners sang and played was a delight not to be expressed. Though so young, I played the violoncello at the same desk with Mr. Bartleman, who was a fine performer, and when he was not singing invariably took that instrument.</p>
