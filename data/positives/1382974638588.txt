I stayed over Sunday [in Gloucester] at the Bishop's, saw my good cousin [the Bishop], in robes, lawn sleeves, and wig, go into the cathedral, and enjoyed the cathedral service in perfection in that magnificent building. The organ was fine, the choir good, and the chaunting left nothing to wish for but that it had been (after the fashion of S. Salvatore in Maximis) much slower than the custom retained with too much exactness from Roman-Catholic times.
