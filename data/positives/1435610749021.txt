<p>I have before alluded to the pleasure I received from the first quartett-party we had in Leicester, under the direction of the Abb&eacute; Dobler ; and I have mentioned my gratification during the sojourn of M. Guynemer, when he was our leader. Many have been the changes in our party through the last fifty years ; still we contrive, once a fortnight, to regale our ears with a quartett of Haydn, Mozart, or Beethoven. My oldest musical friend, Mr. Bankart, I still find by my side, with his violoncello ; and, with our excellent leader, Mr. Gill, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Scott, we play the whole of Beethoven, except his posthumous quartetts, which we conceive require the penetration of the angel Gabriel to understand.</p>
