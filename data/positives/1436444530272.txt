On June 12th, 1893, my son Albert, an under- 
graduate at the time, asked me to come on a 
visit to Cambridge : a concert was to be given 
by the Cambridge University Musical Society, 
of which he was a member, in honour of Max 
Bruch, Boito, Saint-Saens, and Tschaikowsky. 
All four composers took part in the concert at 
the Guildhall, Max Bruch conducting a scene 
from his Odysseus, Boito " The Prelude in 
Heaven " from his Mefistofele, and Tschaikow- 
sky his Francesco, da Rimini. Saint-Saens played 
his fantasia Africa, and Stanford's East to West 
was also given. The members of the Musical 
Society sang the choruses, and they gave the 
composers a tremendous welcome. After the 
concert was over I met my boy, who was 
quite hoarse from singing and cheering, and 
we went down to the river to see the boats 
" bumping."
