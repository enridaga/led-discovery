The <em>Serenade</em>&nbsp;was admirably rendered, and since it was a first work, one could more or less count on a good reception; but regardless of how that might be, he had ready in his pocket a short telegram to Bob in India: "Great success," which no doubt would have been dispatched in any case.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">No sooner was the first movement over than Papa rose to send off the telegram - and get away himself; pulled down by Mother, he attempted the same thing after the second, and again after the third movement. But after the fourth and last, having given up all hope, he remained patiently sitting, and thus had the gratification of seeing his daughter warmly called to the platform by that most delightful of audiences. I went home by a later train than the family, and when I met him before dinner he was beaming with delight, and said: "Well, you had quite a jobation."</p>
