During the forty years in which I've been sitting at the very centre of one of other of London's most magnificent orchestras, in the perfect position to observe every sort of player, the many leaders have always been the focus of attention.... The first time I noticed this complexity of approach was when I studied the work of Paul Beard, then of the London Philharmonic. A dominant player whose style seemed to galvanise the whole string section, he looked immense on the platform, in spite of his average stature. He also played his solos with complete mastery and great Ã©lan - yet a student of his assured me that in working at Rimsky's Scheherazade with him only a day before a most important concert, he had great doubts and difficulties. The performance was, as always, a triumph. Obviously he was a great leader.
