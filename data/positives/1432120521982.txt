The all-merciful God has raised me from a bed of sickness, and allowed me to spend this joyous time with all that I love best in the world. I was awoke in the morning by hearing the Chorale 'Nun danket Alle Gott,' then followed the Wedding March out of the 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' a sorrowful reminder of my departed friend, who would have so rejoiced in our happiness.
