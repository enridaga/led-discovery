<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">It was on a visit to The Festival of Britain at the age of six that I was first impressed by the Royal Festival Hall. As a small lad up from the country, the building was the most modern I'd seen. Not until my late teens, attending concerts by Duke Ellington and the like, was I able to appreciate the unique building to the full. I've since attended memorable concerts af all kinds and look forward to the the Hall's reopening and rejuvination. Who knows, I may experience some rejuvination as a result.</p>
