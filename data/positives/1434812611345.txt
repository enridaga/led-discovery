All the early part of 1920 was filled with excitement, feverish activity, and continual travel necessitated by preparations for the performance of 'Pulcinella', which was given at the Opera on May 15. I had to go to and fro between Morges and Paris, where my presence was constantly required either to hear singers and rehearse them, or to follow closely the choreographic rehearsals in order to spare Massine unpleasant misunderstandings of the sort already described. / Although all this was very tiring, I enjoyed taking part in a task which ended in a real success. 'Pulcinella' is one of those productions- and they are rare- where everything harmonizes, where all the elements â€“ subject, music, dancing, and artistic setting- form a coherent and homogeneous whole.
