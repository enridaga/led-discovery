Unfortunately, in spite of my ten days' exertions and a great deal of begging, I did not succeed in securing for the blind singer, Miss A. Z., a full room at her Matin√©e today. My warmth on the subject had failed to melt the iceberg which blocked the entrance to the purses of the Leipzigers. Rietz accompanied, Joachim played Bach's 'Chaconne' admirably, and Pelz the pianist appeared for the first time, with an Andante, all embroidery. The poor singer gave her Swiss melodies and some other pieces with much feeling, but after all she only realized twenty-six thalers, twelve of which went to the expenses.
