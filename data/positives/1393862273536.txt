Sept 10th We have all been to an entertainment given to wounded, VADs, etc in the opera House. The place was packed. We have a real live professional as patient. He has a beautiful tenor & sang "Trumpeter what are you sounding now". Annie Laurie & Keep the Home Fires Burning. It was fine to hear all the tommies roaring the choruses. Heard one of the VADs in the audience remark "Yes everyone seems to have been invited, "Even those cooks & the others" Who are those "others" more degraded even than cooks?
