All during the tour I kept nagging at him. I said he couldn't play as I wanted him to. When we reached Chicago I got some piano rolls that Jimmy Johnson had made and pounded out each passage to Henderson. To prove to me he could do it, Fletch began to practice. He got so perfect, listening to James P. Johnson play on the player piano, that he could press down the keys as the roll played, never missing a note. Naturally, he began to be identified with that kind of music, which isn't his kind at all. 

 Even today, almost thirty years later, I practically have to insult Fletcher Henderson to get him to play my accompaniments the way I want.
