On 24 November 1951, when she was six, Jackie took part in a demonstration programme by Alison Dalrympleâ€™s junior pupils. She had mastered the art of vibrato and was thrilled by the far-reaching world of new sound colours which this technique offered her.

She played three pieces: Andantino by Florembassi, Russian Song by Fitzenhagen and Wiegenliedby Schubert. There was a hush of anticipation when it was her turn. Taking her place in front of the assembled group in an unassuming way, she paused and slipped into a deep concentration before beginning. The focus between Jackie, the cello and everyone in the room was direct and powerful. She was speaking to me with her cello and the sound which she loved so much had become her voice. It sent shivers down my spine.
