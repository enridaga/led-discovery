<p>The great composer and violinist, Spohr, is now here, superintending the performance of his opera, <em>Faust</em>, in which he has been very successful. It has had several representations to full houses, and the author has been much honored. But the opera is too good (musically considered) to be very popular. Musicians will delight to hear it; but it contains too much musical learning for the many. The lighter and more unmeaning compositions of the Italians are better appreciated.</p>
