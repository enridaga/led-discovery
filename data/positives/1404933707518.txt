Over a thousand people attend the concert, and rather alarmingly, I have to introduce the Faur√© through a powerful microphone, but after the concert several people tell me that my words 'made all the difference'. The concert itself goes well, despite Richard's  dropping his bow to the floor with a clatter during the Schubert. Yet, although I'm aware it's going well, I feel curiously detached. On the one hand, I feel relaxed and at home in this large handsome venue, but on the other, I feel isolated from everything and everyone.
