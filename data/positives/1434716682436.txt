<p>When Louis [Armstrong] first came to Chicago, I was at the Sunset with Carroll Dickerson and he came in to join [Joe] Oliver, who had come back from San Francisco. Louis upset Chicago. All the musicians from Isham Jones' band for example, came to Lincoln Gardens to hear the bank Joe had, and especially to hear Louis. What made Louis upset Chicago? Well, they didn't call it drive, they called it 'attack' at the time. Yes, that's what it was, man. They got crazy for his feeling.</p>
<p>King Oliver and Louis were the greatest trumpeters I ever heard together. You want to know how they'd get those unison breaks to go together that went over so well with the crowd? Well, the tunes always break in the middle. What Joe was going to make in the middle break, he'd make in the first ending. Louis would listen and remember; then when the middle came, Oliver and Louis would both take that same break together.</p>
