When Elmer Snowden came to Washington in Joe Rochester's band, all the banjo and banjorine players were playing everything right, right on the nose, according to the city's disciplinary climate. It seemed that he was not playing according to Hoyle, yet he had something extra going on that really upset everybody in Washington--musicians and audience. He had a flair for soul, plus ragtime, and a jumping thing that tore us all up. He immediately became the No. 1 Banjorine Player, and he had a tremendous influence on all the local banjorinists, and a kind of fusion resulted that was really compelling, for he, too, got something out of their style.
