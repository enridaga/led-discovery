Don Pablo, ever ready to encourage the young, gave up an evening to my students. On mounting the platform their enthusiastic greeting and the sign of so many eager young faces impressed him so much that he began my Concerto–accompanied by myself–an octave higher than written. Aware that it would be impossible to proceed beyond a few bars, I deemed it wiser to let him continue until he came to the inevitable grief which awaited him. That happened quickly, and amid much laughter, in which we both joined, a fresh and safer start was made.
