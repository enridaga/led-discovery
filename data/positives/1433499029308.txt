<p>I was out celebrating with some friends, when we went to a ball at the Odd Fellow's Hall, where Buddy Bolden worked. I remember thinking it was a funny place, nobody took their hats off. It was pretty tough. You paid fifteen cents and walked in. When we came in, we saw the band, six of them, on a low stand. They had their hats on, too, and were resting--pretty sleepy.</p>
<p>We stood behind a column. All of a sudden, Buddy stomps, knocks on the floor with his trumpet to give the beat, and they all sit up straight, wide awake. Buddy held up his cornet, paused to be sure of his embouchure, then they played <em>Make Me a Pallet on the Floor</em>. Everybody got up quick, the whole place rose and yelled out, "Oh Mr Bolden, play it for us, Buddy, play it!".</p>
<p>I'd never heard anything like that before. I'd played "legitimate" stuff. But this! It was somethin' that pulled me! They got me up on the stand that night, and I was playin' with 'em. After that, I didn't play "legitimate'" so much.</p>
