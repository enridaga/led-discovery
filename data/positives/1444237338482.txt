<p>One evening during the Ecumenical winter, at a&nbsp;musical soiree given by the Princess O----- , Liszt's&nbsp;Symphonic Poem " Tasso," arranged for two pianos,&nbsp;happened to be lying on one of the magnificent instruments that stood side by side &mdash; head and tail &mdash; in the&nbsp;Princess's music-room, where some sixty or seventy&nbsp;personages of Roman society were assembled, amongst&nbsp;them the Canon of Albano. Whilst chatting with his&nbsp;hostess, Liszt picked up the "Tasso" arrangement by chance, asked her whether she had heard it, and on&nbsp;receiving a reply in the negative, said that he would&nbsp;gladly make it known to her, if she could find any one&nbsp;amongst her guests to play it with him. There were&nbsp;several Italian pianists, virtuosi and amateurs, present,&nbsp;but none of them would venture to attempt so difficult a&nbsp;work at sight, especially in conjunction with its composer, of whom one and all evidently stood in awe.&nbsp;Archbishop Haynald (he had not then received the red&nbsp;hat), whose rooms were next to mine at the Albergo di Roma, and who had placed his excellent grand piano at&nbsp;my disposal immediately upon his arrival in the Eternal&nbsp;City, came up to me and said, <em>"Hoeren Sie mal, mein&nbsp;Lieber!</em> you have played a good many hard pieces (<em>schwere Stuecke</em>) at sight with me during the past six&nbsp;weeks. Are you afraid of Liszt ? He wants somebody&nbsp;to take the second piano with him, and try his "Tasso."&nbsp;I should like to do it myself, but am afraid of the&nbsp;fatigue. What do you say ? Will you make the attempt?&nbsp;The thing is difficult enough &mdash; more than enough." I&nbsp;thought of Liszt's dubitative smile, when Herbeck had&nbsp;introduced me to him as an Englishman who "knew&nbsp;music," and at once replied, "Will your Grandeur vouch&nbsp;for me? I am not afraid of the great man, for the truly&nbsp;strong are generally merciful; and if I break down, not&nbsp;being a professional pianist, I shall manage to survive&nbsp;the disgrace of failure." Haynald took me by the arm&nbsp;and led me up to the illustrious compatriot, saying, "Franz, thou knowest this young man. He can read&nbsp;music well; he has done so with me again and again.&nbsp;He is ambitious to play with thee, and has the audacity to essay thy "Tasso"! Wilt thou try him on my recommendation?" "Certainly I will,'' replied Liszt; and,&nbsp;after addressing a few kindly, reassuring words to me,&nbsp;forthwith took his seat at one piano, motioning me to the&nbsp;other. I felt as I suppose men feel when they have&nbsp;been told off for a forlorn hope and are awaiting the&nbsp;signal to advance. However, I contrived somehow to&nbsp;follow the Canon's superb leading, and not to put him&nbsp;out; the "fearsome foursome" went off without a hitch,&nbsp;and when it was over Liszt held out his hand to me,&nbsp;smiled benignly, and said only three words, "Herbeck&nbsp;avait raison."</p>
