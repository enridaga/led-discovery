Practise & write as usual. Play with Lauricella in afternoon. Go to lunch with Laulie in morning at Mackies62 – she is staying up here for a day or two. Go to Waterloo Studio (B.B.C). to hear Contemporary concert, with Bridges. He conducts B.B.C. orch “Enter Spring” & “Willow aslant a Brook” (Bridge) rather badly played, but magnificent, inspired works. Brosa St. Quart. plays with orch concerto by Conrad Beck. Interesting, but that’s all, incredibly played. And to end up with an absurd Concerto Grosso by Igor Markievitch. Intoleraby difficult, & consequently only mod. played by the orch. This must have been written with the composer’s tongue in his cheek.
