I was happy to meet a man [Stephen Heller] whose whole soul was wrapped up in music as my own was and the long hours we spent together at the piano playing duets form some of my most cherished recollections. It was during these seances in my humble lodgings in the Eue Notre Dame de Lorette that we made acquaintance with and revelled in the beauties of Schubert's great C major symphony, then recently discovered and published as a pianoforte duet. It was a revelation to us, and we were never tired of playing it through. But the same was the case with all the great compositions for orchestra, or orchestra with chorus, arranged in a similar form. How often we must have played Beethoven's symphonies it is impossible to tell, and how we enjoyed them!
