The girls that I hung round with from school used to meet round each othersâ€™ houses and just sit in bedrooms listening to David Cassidy or Donny Osmond. There were no videos then and so we used to do the next best thing. Sitting on the floor or laying on the bed with a record playing, the walls nearly always covered with posters, while we looked at magazines containing more black and white photographs.
