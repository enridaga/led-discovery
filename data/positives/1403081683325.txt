At one of Madame Marcello's concerts. I had the pleasure of hearing the greatest reputed dilettante singer in Europe, La Signora Teresa de Petris. Nor was her reputation higher than her merits; she had one of the finest voices I ever heard, combined with great science and expression: in addition to this, she was very beautiful and had about her all the Venetian fascination. She married a noble Venetian, Il Signor Veniera, but, for some reason, was separated from him. Her cavaliere servente was Count Vidiman, a handsome and rich young nobleman, who resided at Venice and who was devoted to music and to her. He was also a great protector of the composer Anfossi, and so attached to his music that he would scarcely listen to any other. He had fixed a performance to take place at Venice the beginning of Lent; an oratorio composed expressly for her Excellency La Signora de Petris, by Anfossi, was to be performed at Count Pepoli's private theatre
