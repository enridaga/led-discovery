<p>15.11.90 Isaac Stern birthday concert - Beethoven Triple Concerto / Violin Concerto. I had booked a couple of tickets without any thought as to who might go with me. Then the opportunity of a blind date came up - and I took the plunge. We met in the bookshop - me nonchalntly browsing the playscript for The Crucible when Colin appeared in a beard (soon to be shaved off for good) and a "teacher's tie". Not sure how much Beethoven or Singer contributed but we hit it off and the next day Colin announced to his colleague "I've met the man I'm going to marry". 16 years on we are still together and happily civilly partnered, still sharing a great love of music. We never visit the RFH without referring to that evening, without which everything might have been so different.........</p>
