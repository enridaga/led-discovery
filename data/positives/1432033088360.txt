A minister telling of a certain meeting, says :

 " Among the converts was a man somewhat advanced in years, who was very anxious about the salvation of his wife, and expressed a wish that I should visit her. I did so repeatedly, and explained to her in very simple words the plan of salvation ; but she could not comprehend the meaning of my message. Every time I left, however, she would express a strong desire that I should return. One day I went in just before dinner, and talked to her about Jesus, but no light seemed to dawn upon her mind. Then the thought struck me to sing something to her, and so I commenced, ' 'Tis the promise of God full salvation to give.' When I was through the chorus, she exclaimed, 'Sing it over again.' I did so, time after time, and when I asked her to assist me, she joined in very heartily.
