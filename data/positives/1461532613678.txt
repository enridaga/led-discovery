<p>I am thinking all the time of your music - It is&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>beautiful and I am so intensely happy that I can understand and love it so well. I can't express, what I feel - you must try to guess it - A sort of fresh joy and courage&nbsp;<em>through&nbsp;</em>it and&nbsp;<em>for&nbsp;</em>it. Art and nature are what is fine - the rest seems so small now. / Life is beautiful like that - I think I owe all this to you, my best friend -&nbsp;</p>
