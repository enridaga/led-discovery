<p>My visits to the Festival Hall began during its first season during the Festival of Britain.&nbsp; So many highlights since but those standing out - in no special order: Toscanini's only post-war visit with newly formed Philharmonia; Guido Cantelli's first (and last) performances; Karajan conducting the Philharmonia; visit of the Vienna State Opera; Fischer Dieskau's first recital; Klemperer's Beethoven Cycle.</p>
