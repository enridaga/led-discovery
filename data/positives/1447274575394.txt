<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;">Your work has been so much before the public of Paris these last days, that I felt I must write to tell you of the splendid reception your "Caneuon" have had. The students who came over from Aberystwyth have done their part well, and have charmed the various audiences that have listened to them by their singing.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">"Yr Hen Erddigan" has been the favourite quartette. Last night at a very smart (I use the word advisedly) gathering, the audience began to applaud before the end of the second line. It really has been delightful hearing these simple and charming Welsh songs sung in this gay city - where simplicity is so lacking.&nbsp;</p>
