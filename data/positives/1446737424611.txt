The complainant, on being sworn, said On Monday night last, between twelve and one o'clock, I was going past the Horse and Jockey public house, in Bridge- street, when I heard singing there. I knocked at the window, and heard some persons mention my name. I then knocked a little louder, and my fingers went through the pane of glass. The four defendants and two other persons came out. John Phillips seized me by the throat, Griffiths and White seized me by my hair, and Owen kicked me while I was falling. I was kicked on the head while on the ground, till I was senseless. Mrs. Mason picked me up. She saw the defendants ill-using me. I had been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>
