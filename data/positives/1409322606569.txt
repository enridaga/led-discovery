[T]he Pavilion was the first theatre in which I saw Donald Peers of ‘By a Babbling Brook’ fame. He had a good reception and was moved to thank the audience profusely. ‘Especially,’ he said, ‘my good friend, Jock, sitting there in the audience.’ His good friend Jock turned out to be the Hon. John Weir, son of Lord Weir. I knew he had an ambition to be the Scottish Noel Coward, because I wrote radio scripts with him. I always waited to see if Donald Peers would sing a number written by John, but the brook ceased to babble without one coming along.
