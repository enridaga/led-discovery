I have received a visit to-day from Elise Fellenburg of Hofwyl. She told me of the death of her sister Adèle, whom she described as…having found peace of mind and relief from pain in the house of Pfarrer Blumhardt, in a village of the Black Forest near Calw…. [Adèle] had told her sister she felt well, and in comfort, not long before a change in her features caused alarm, when Elise called in the clergyman, who saw plainly the last hour was come, and after praying by her side, began to sing a hymn, in which his wife and children, the maid-servants, and by degrees other inmates silently pressing into the room, joined, in that full congregational harmony which is nowhere found in such perfection as in Würtemberg: and thus they sang till after the spirit had departed, peace and joy and thankfulness being the expression of the eyes until they lost their light.
