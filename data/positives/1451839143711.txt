<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have known David Oistrakh for almost a quarter of a century - since the day of his brilliant performance at the All-Union Performers Competition. The young violinist literally stunned the judges and the audience- including me- by his mastery. He played the most difficult works with the ease of a virtuoso, and everyone in the hall realised that he was witnessing the birth of a great master. Oistrakh received a tumultuous ovation.</span></p>
