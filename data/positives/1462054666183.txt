<p>"A Village Romeo and Juliet" made an excellent impression on me, particularly the last two acts, which I find most original; as far as the first two acts are concerned I have certain doubts which I would very much like to have discussed with you, but which I think can easily be put right as they are only of a&nbsp;<em>technical</em> nature. In any case I hope to renew my acquaintance with your attractive work soon, and, incidentally, I hope with a better orchestra!&nbsp;</p>
