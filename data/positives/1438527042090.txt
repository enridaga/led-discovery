<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New';">It was during the same winter that Clara Butt<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>made her first appearance in public. The need for a new concert contralto of the first rank had <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>become pressing. Trebelli had died suddenly at<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Etretat the previous summer; and in the February <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of 1894 an even more sudden attack of heart disease<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>closed the career of Janet Patey as she was leaving the platform at a concert at Sheffield. It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was curious that midway between these two sad <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>events there should have appeared upon the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>scene the artist who, whatever her vocal attributes <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>as compared with those of her gifted predecessors, indisputably holds at the present time the position<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of leading English contralto. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Her unusually lofty stature<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>lent to the embodiment of Orpheus a dignity and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>impressiveness that were at least equaled by the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>organ-like sonority and volume of her ample<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>tones. Then she could neither act nor sing;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>but there was intelligence in her work, there<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was an evident faculty for imitation, and, above <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>all, there was glorious material in her powerful, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>luscious voice.</span></p>
