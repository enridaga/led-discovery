<p>There was a saying in New Orleans. When some musician would get a job on the riverboats with Fate Marable, they's say, "Well you're going to the conservatory". That's because Fate was such a fine musician and the men who worked with him had to be really good.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The riverboat bands played dance music mostly. But Fate had things like Jelly Roll's tunes in the book. Numbers like <em>The Pearls</em>&nbsp;and <em>Jelly Roll Blues</em>. And he had songs like <em>Frankie and Johnny</em>. As a matter of fact, <em>Frankie and Johnny</em>, with Fate's band, was the first record I was ever on. At that time they brought the machines along with them and we made the record for Okeh in New Orleans. The other side was <em>Piano Flight</em>.</p>
<p>I remember when Baby Dodds, who was in the band that Louis [Armstrong] was in on the <em>Capitol</em>&nbsp;steamboat, somehow got me on the stand so I could listen to Louis. It was bitterly against the rules but somehow Baby did it.</p>
<p>The bands on the boats then were made up of two trumpets, one trombone, mellophone, violin, banjo, drums and bass.</p>
