As the procession left the Chapel a funeral march was played, and the hymn sung at the grave-side by the famous choir, "over which he presided so splendidly for so many years," was his own setting of " Just as I am, without one plea." This was the most touching part of the service, and the crowd standing round were visibly moved. 
Among the immense congregation who filled the choir and nave were Dr. Lloyd, Dr. Verrinder, Dr. Bridge, Sir John Stainer, Dr. Hubert Parry, Sir Arthur Sullivan, Dr. Turpin, Dr. Arnold, etc.
