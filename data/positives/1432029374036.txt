Madame Schumann played it through to me. In dealing with the plot, Schumann is still undecided whether the final reconciliation shall take place in the desert or in the castle. In whatever way he treats the subject, this opera is sure to be interesting to any artist; whether it will be popular, I cannot judge from hearing it once on the pianoforte.
