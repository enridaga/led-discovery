I have always adored the music of the Strausses, father and sons, of Vienna. I recall a 1929 production of Die Fledermaus by Max Reinhardt in Berlin which left me walking on air for three days afterward. Like Kreislerâ€™s, the lilting memories of the Strausses had ideal shapes in my mind; I knew exactly how I wanted to hear them played, with a zest that whirled people off their feet.
