<p>We should have moved from Bellevue today, but because of today's rehearsal have put it off until tomorrow. It was a two-part rehearsal: two hours of strings, and two of wind. At Koussevitzky's request I started it off, while he say with the score to acquaint himself with it. I have not conducted for almost five years, moreover I have done hardly any work on my Symphony from the perspective of the conductor, and there are some very tricky places in it, for example a 6/4 and a 3/2 in the first movement recapitulation. It was extremely hard work rehearsing, and I was very glad when Koussevitzky finally chased me off the podium and took charge himself. I could then look at the score in peace and quiet myself. After two hours the string players departed, to be replaced by the wind players, and again I worked worked with them first, followed by Koussevitzky. I find it hard to say precisely what my impression was: on the whole it was not favourable, but this is usually the way when a new work is being split up into sections. The orchestra read the notes not too badly and generally behaved fairly decently to the music and to me.</p>
