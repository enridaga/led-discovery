The dining room gave a huge tea the other day for their boys and kindly invited all of mine... After tea there was an impromptu concert got up by a sick officer who, when he is not fighting, composes music. Judging by his appearance and the way he sings and plays, his peace-time occupation suits him better than his present one.
