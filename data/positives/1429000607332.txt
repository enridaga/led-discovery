He [Percy Johnson] had a player-piano and he put on a roll by James P. Johnson. This was, of course, an entirely new avenue of adventure for me, and I went back there every day and listened. Percy slowed the mechanism down so that I could see which keys on the piano were going down as I digested Johnson's wonderful sounds. I played with it until I had his "Carolina Shout" down pat, and then Percy would go out on the town with me and show me off.
