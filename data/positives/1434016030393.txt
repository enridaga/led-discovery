Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Tuesday in Whitsun-week -
The day that the Emperor was here at dinner, I sat, as usual, opposite to the King, who addressed me, in conversation, more even than usual. He began by explaining the sense of Beethoven's ' Overture ' to the ' Coriolanus ' of Shakespeare, which was performed under the windows of the dining-room, remarking that the composition designated all parts of the action, &c.; his subject led him to speak of the 'Eumenides,' and I mentioned that I had induced Franz to make a fresh translation, condensing the three parts into one
whole, in three acts, by the omission of unnecessary portions. The Emperor enquired what the matter in question was? and the King related, shortly and humorously, the subject of the tragedy, concluding with—' The thing ends thus : the Furies receive the title of Excellency, and a house rent free outside the gates, —and withdraw, on these conditions, well pleased !
