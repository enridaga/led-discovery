Although I had never felt entirely pleased with the Requiem of the highly-esteemed Mozart because of its utter disunity of style - some movements are written in an old, hackneyed church style, while other sections cannot conceal the secular influence­ - I remained in the church as long as Mozart's spirit held me, as long as his poetic strength filled me with the might of God; but when Süssmayr's weak talent began to tear me from my devout mood, I left with heartsore grief at the untimely departure of such unique genius.
