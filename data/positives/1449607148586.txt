<p class="MsoNormal">Many of my pleasantest memories are connected with the workings of the [Musical] Fund Society. Mr. Webb was the first conductor, followed by &ldquo;old Tom Comer.&rdquo; The latter, a character in Boston, was well known and beloved. He was of Irish extraction and originally an actor. He had a passion for music&mdash;could compose a little, played the violin tolerably well, was leader of an orchestra in the Boston Museum for many years, and afterwards in the Boston Theatre.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of his financial appeals in behalf of the Society is worth putting on record. He decided to perform Haydn&rsquo;s Farewell Symphony.</p>
