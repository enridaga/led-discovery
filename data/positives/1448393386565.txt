<p>A new mass, by Adam, was lately performed in the town of Avray. The composer, accompanied with a choir of singers, went from Paris for the purpose, taking with them one of Alexander&rsquo;s melodeons, and a harp, as a substitute for organ and orchestra. The accompaniment was so arranged and distributed between the reeds and the strings as to produce a fine effect. A Credo from Cherubini, and a Gloria by Dietsch, were also well performed.</p>
