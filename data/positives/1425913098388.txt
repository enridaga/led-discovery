In Advent, Hummel came to Prague to give a concert. [...] Hummel's touch was more feminine than virile, and re­minded me for the most part of Wölfel's  playing. When I recall that both men, competent artists, were Mozart's pupils, I am tempted to conclude that the master also did not possess a vigor­ous touch. Such a conclusion, however, would stand in direct contradiction to his compositions, which sound quite full­ bodied. - Otherwise Hummel played very nicely, never losing strict tempo, a virtue that is not much practiced in these times. Hummel's compositions adhered to Mozartean forms; if I had anything to criticize in his work, it was the excessive length with which his larger compositions are burdened.
