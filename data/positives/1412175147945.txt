Summer for many teenagers in the 1970s was a time for going to festivals and free concerts. In the summer of 1971, for instance, there was King Crimson playing free at Hyde Park, and Hawkwind up at Ladbroke Grove. The following year there was the Windsor Free Festival. Some of the free music then is fairly hard to believe today. In 1976, Queen played to an audience of over two hundred thousand at Hyde Park; again, absolutely free.
