<p>1986 was a year of memorable concerts. I remember Felicity LOTT Jessye NORMAN and Marisa ROBLES especially. Marisa arranged "The Concert of my Life" with 19 other harpists, the E.C.O. , James GALWAY and Ann Mackay. It was a magical evening, Marisas artistry and effervescent personality were much in evidence and the music benefited from them. I think it was on this occassion [occasion] that we bought one of Marisa's discs and she autographed it "with love from Marisa". My husband was on cloud - nine!</p>
