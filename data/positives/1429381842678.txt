<p>Edmund Anderson came over with Ted Grouya and their new song entitled "Flamingo." I listened and liked it, and gave it to [Billy] Strayhorn right away so that he could prepare it for Herb Jeffries to sing. The orchestration he did on "Flamingo" was, in my opinion, a turning point in vocal background orchestration, a renaissance in elaborate ornamentation for the accompaniment of singers. It soon caught on and became a big hit. Since then, other arrangers have become more and more daring, but Billy Strayhorn really started it all with "Flamingo."</p>
