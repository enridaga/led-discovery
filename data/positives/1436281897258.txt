<p>On the next evening a reception was given by Frau Wagner at "Wahnfried," as Wagner's house was called. It was a most interesting soiree. All the principal singers whom Wagner adopted as his children and addressed as " du " were there. They, on their part, venerated and loved him, calling him "Meister." A number of foreign visitors from all parts of the world were also present, among whom were the most celebrated composers and instrumentalists. I had the honour of being invited, with Dr. Henry Wylde and my fellow-townsman, Herr Sigismund Lehmeyer, the pianist. An amateur tenor, M. Robsart, from Brussels, was asked to sing Siegmund's "Liebeslied," and as neither Richter nor Herr Rubinstein (the usual accompanist of the opera) was present, I had to play the accompaniment, and as the song is extremely difficult, I was perhaps a little timid at being asked to do so in the presence of its great composer. But it went off well, and the singer was greatly applauded. "Wahnfried" is a splendid house, with large reception-rooms on the ground-floor. At the back of the drawing-room there is a large library with many volumes of bound music. Looking through them, I noticed that the only composers omitted from the walls of the great master were Mendelssohn and I believe Meyerbeer. I fancy that Wagner did not like Jewish composers, especially as these two I have named belonged to rich families, and Wagner was poor and had constantly to fight for his living, and was often, as one reads in his Life, obliged to borrow money, until King Louis took him up and helped him to make his fortune and a great name.</p>
