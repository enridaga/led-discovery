War had been declared, and the following Sunday I went with a friend of mine to Shepherd’s Bush Empire to see the film show. At the end they showed the Fleet sailing the high seas and played ‘Britons Never Shall Be Slaves’ and ‘Hearts of Oak’. And you know one feels that little shiver run up the back and you know you have got to do something. I had just turned seventeen at that time and on the Monday I went up to Whitehall - Old Scotland Yard - and enlisted in the 16th Lancers.
