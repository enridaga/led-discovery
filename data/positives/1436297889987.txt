<p>Mrs. Bland, when Miss Romanzini, first sang at Hughes's Riding School, now the Circus, in St George's Fields, in the spring of 1773 ; she then travelled with Breslau ; and made her first appearance at Drury Lane, the 24th of October, 1786, in "Richard Coeur de Lion." Her sensible manner of singing reminds me of an anecdote which Mozart once told me of the Emperor Joseph the Second, relative to himself: His Majesty, speaking of a piece of music of Mozart's, said to him, "Mozart, I like your music very much, but there are too many notes in Madame Lange's song." "Sire," replied the composer, " there are just as many notes in it as there ought to be."</p>
