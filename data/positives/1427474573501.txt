In 1856 Manchester began to prepare for the ' Art Treasures Exhibition,' which was to be held in the following year, the musical part of which was entrusted to me...Her Majesty the Queen visited the exhibition, and how successful its whole career was, what hosts of distinguished visitors it drew to Manchester until its close, is too well known to dilate upon here.I succeeded, not without considerable trouble, in bringing together a thoroughly satisfactory band by engaging competent performers from London, Paris, Germany, Holland, Belgium, and Italy, in addition to the best of our local players. Concerts took place every afternoon, but I conducted only on Thursdays. They were much enjoyed by crowds of visitors, and soon became one of the chief attractions of the exhibition. Thousands and thousands of people from the northern counties there heard a symphony for the first time, and it was interesting to watch how 
the appreciation of such works grew keener and keener almost with every week.
