Schooldays were very different once the war had started. We had great maps in each of the classrooms and every day we used flags to mark the progress of the war on both fronts - in Gallipoli and then on the Somme when that started. There was a keen interest taken in this because we could see how it was progressing. We had evening assembly every night and special prayers were said for the soldiers. We always sang the last verse of ‘Eternal Father’ and then the hymn ‘Holy Father in Thy Mercy’, and then said the prayer ‘Lighten our Darkness’. This went on every night all through the war.
