<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">More about the records. In this performance, the microphone was used by the singers, and by this the singers are so loud that they cover the orchestra. You don&rsquo;t hear the orchestra almost for the whole performance. In a well-balanced performance you will hear both the orchestra and the singers. </span></p>
