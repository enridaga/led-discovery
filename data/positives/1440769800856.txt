<p>Byrd Schedule. In the evening to the BBC John Ireland evening. Trio - 1919, too noble for my taste, songs by Hardy, Dekker (very good, an excited talking vocal curve, almost like hens) and the love of friendship set.&nbsp; Then the Sonatina, with a Sabbath last movement based on Lolly.&nbsp; This&nbsp;I really liked.&nbsp; It has an excitement of the wild brain instead of the usual wild body orgy.&nbsp; Then two songs from AE Houseman [sic] with a piano epilogue and a cello sonata that I should enjoy but they were playing against time, and it didn't emerge.</p>
