And at least to my taste, Stravinsky’s violin works are to a substantial degree not Stravinsky but Dushkin, even though the notes per se belong to the composer. Stravinsky was prickly, sharp, but the violin transcriptions of his works are soggy and limp. Of course, when Stravinsky himself was playing, they acquired a rhythmic sharpness. I remember Stravinsky accompanying Dushkin in his “Chanson Russe”. (That’s a transcription of the Berceuse from his opera Mavra.) Stravinsky accentuated the rhythm so much that I asked, “Igor Fedorovich, why are you striking the keys so loud and making the accompaniment so percussive?” Stravinsky just smiled smugly.
