<p>After dinner D.M. and I fell to duets, and the house rocked with our attack of the scherzo and finale of number 5. &nbsp;We also played thye scherzo of number 3 a great deal better than most horns do. &nbsp;Unfortunately after an interval of songs and D.M. doing the Bach G mi Fantasia and Fugue with masterly faking, our hands were out and we botched the 1st's Finale like two schoolgirls - Dorothie referring to squemi-quavers. &nbsp;</p>
