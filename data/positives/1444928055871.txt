<p>Last Tuesday was sevennight I was at an assembly at Lady Hillborough's ; Wednesday I was at the Oratorio ; Thursday Mrs. D., Mr. G., and Miss Chapone, and my brother, went to the play. I was to have gone, but the Duchess of Queensberry sent me a ticket to go to a ball in Soho Square, and I went with my Lady Cowper. It is a very fine room. The Duke of York was there, and he began the ball ; I danced but two dances ; it was so hot ; there was not any minuets. The French horn, fiddle, and other instruments, played till the ball began, which was about nine.</p>
