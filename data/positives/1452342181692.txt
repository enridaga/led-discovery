<p>I shall never forget one concert that was given at Epsom, near Kennerley-Rumford&rsquo;s home. I had been miserably unwell for a very long time. My friends were always urging me to take a rest, or go abroad, but a composer is, in most cases, anything but a millionaire, and my one answer was, &ldquo;I simply can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo; When I received a letter from Bertie Rumford, asking me if I would accompany Harry Greene and himself in a number of my songs at Epsom, I was feeling really ill, but I was so fond of them both that I felt I simply couldn&rsquo;t refuse. And I went from Broadway to Epsom and played a solo and helped with the accompaniments. I was putting on my cloak in the artists&rsquo; room at the end of the concert when Harry came up to me. He said excitedly -</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just you go and give Bertie Rumford the biggest hug you ever gave any one in all your life !&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Good gracious ! Why ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why ?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s been your concert, because you&rsquo;ve been ill, and because he wants this very minute to hand you over the whole of the proceeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">I could have cried my eyes out when he told me this; it was so absolutely and utterly unexpected, and the kindness and delicacy with which the whole thing had been arranged bowled me completely over.</p>
