Mr. Ludlam was in possession of a set of dish-bells corresponding to these [the upper bells of St. Margaret's, Leicester], and took me into one of the orchards near the great meeting to examine the plan upon which this peal was arranged. My ear must have been pretty exact; for after some time, on comparing the bell in his hand with that in the steeple, I observed it to become flatter, which the philosopher did not perceive; but my remark pleased him, as he presently explained to meâ€”that it was probably the warmth of his hand which expanded the metal, and lowered it in tone. In our investigation we discovered that the first bell was not a correct octave to the eighth, nor the third bell an octave to the tenth. In consequence, a sprightliness was given to the treble, by being made rather sharp, and the tenor being rather flat, made the peal, in the language of ringers, come home, with more satisfaction upon the ear.
