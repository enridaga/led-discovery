<p>During&nbsp;the spring of 1868 I was engaged in the fulfilment of a&nbsp;special mission that took me into several nooks of Tuscany and the Papal States...Throughout the winter, backed up by&nbsp;some small state or municipal subvention, the local lessee&nbsp;contrived to keep them open four nights in the week,&nbsp;with the aid of touring companies and migratory stars;&nbsp;and &mdash; although their stock orchestras, costumes and&nbsp;accessories were as a rule very marvels of weakness,&nbsp;decay and archaism &mdash; I found them almost invariably&nbsp;well-attended, by audiences...Not that they were rough upon&nbsp;the old-established shortcomings of the local executants,&nbsp;scenery and dresses, which they appeared to regard as&nbsp;inevitable evils, to be endured in silence and under&nbsp;gesticulatory protest of sardonic shrugs. They reserved&nbsp;their utmost severities for the vocal " strangers within&nbsp;their gates" &mdash; the "principals" in troupes engaged for&nbsp;half-a-dozen performances by an enterprising management, and "billed" all over the town as" the egregious&nbsp;tenor Malandrino," or "the inclyte first-lady Pette-gola."&nbsp;</p>
