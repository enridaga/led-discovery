Lille is a very fine town, the great square very spacious and uniform. The garrison at present is less numerous than usual, as a considerable part of it is drawn off to work at the new canal at St Omer. I expected at 9 oâ€™clock to hear some good music, which I remembered to have done 5 years ago at the time of beating la retraite or tattoo but was disappointed, there being only a few side drums and 2 miserable trumpets.
