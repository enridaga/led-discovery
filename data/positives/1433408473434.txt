<p>I was born in the year 1879. My father was a cigar maker and my mother was a housewife.</p>
<p>As a boy, the first jazz I heard was a jazz band at the corner of St Phillips and Claiborne. It was called the Excelsior Band. The only musician I remember from that band was Fice Quiyrit, the trumpet player. It was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Was it ragtime? No, no, it was nothing but marches they was playing--brass marches--parade music.</p>
