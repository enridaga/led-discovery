On the third night, the Marino, the Flora Gardens, and the four gates of the city were illuminated. There was music in the Chiesa Grande, where four large 
orchestras were erected, which contained all the principal musicians in the island, and many from the kingdom of Naples, both vocal and instrumental ; 
the whole was under the direction of Aprile, and there was my first regular appearance. I sang a mottetto, composed by the celebrated Genario Mano. Aprile had taken great pains with me in it, and appeared fully satisfied with my execution of it*, 

* It may not be thought unworthy of remark, that the first and only native of Great Britain that ever sang at that festival, or, indeed, in any church in Sicily, was myself. The circumstance was considered so extraordinary, that Aprile had my name and country inserted in the archives of the church.
