<pre>On the 22nd of August Colman wrote a piece for his own theatre, called "Gay <br />Deceivers," for which I composed the music. It had many comic incidents, smart <br />dialogue, and some sweet songs. One called "The Spartan Boy," was truly poetical; <br />the piece was performed a number of nights, and was much liked. Colman grounded <br />it upon a French comic opera, entitled "Les Evenemens Imprevus," one of the <br />pieces I had brought with me from Paris. The author of the French drama, strange <br />to say, was an Irishman of the name of Hale, an officer in the French military <br />service ; all his songs were versified for him, as he could not compose French 
poetry, though he furnished all the subjects.</pre>
