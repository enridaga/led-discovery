<p>Having attended both David Del Tredici's&nbsp;<em>Steps</em> (world premiere by Philharmonic) and David Diamond's 1965&nbsp;<em>Fifth Symphony</em> (the Juilliard Orchestra) this past fortnight, I'd say that Diamond's music is dramatic but not theatrical while DDT's is theatrical but not dramatic. DD's seethes with portentous content skillfully worked through but without color for color's sake, while DDT's is shy of content but gaudy to a fault.</p>
<p>Drama without theatre. Theatre without drama. Britten, at his best, has both.&nbsp;</p>
