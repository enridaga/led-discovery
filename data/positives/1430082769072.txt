<p>I met there Mr. Perring and Mr. Wynn, who take part, like me, in tonight's concert. They are both indifferent singers, but possessed of a certain amount of instruction, and very much in earnest. The givers of the concert Mr. Cooper and Miss Milner only want talent to make them very good artists. The concert took place at 8 o'clock at the Exchange Rooms, a large hall with good acoustic, and before a large audience. My share of the programme consisted of Osborne and de Beriot's duet, the Finale of Lucia, by Liszt, Caprice in E Major, by Mendelssohn, and Heller's Truite (as an encore, Lied ohne Worte in A, by Mendelssohn), variations from Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, and an impromptu and two waltzes by Chopin. The appreciation of the public, among whom was the former celebrated singer, Miss Wood, was flattering. The first duet, however, did not go well at all.</p>
