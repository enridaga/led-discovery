<p>Last night - to relieve myself from correcting that silly book Flush, - oh what a waste of time - I will record Bruno Walter. [...] "Our Germany - which I loved - with our tradition - our culture - We are now a disgrace." [...] Then he told us how you can't talk above a whisper. There are spies everywhere. He had to sit in the window of his hotel in Leipzig? a whole day, telephoning. And on the wireless, between turns, they play military music. Horrible horrible!</p>
