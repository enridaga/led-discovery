On the first Friday in Lent, March 12th, 1794, was opened the New Drury Lane Theatre, with a sacred oratorio, commencing with Handel's immortal Coronation Anthem ; the orchestra represented the interior of a Gothic cathedral, and had a most sublime effect. And on the 21st of March, the theatre opened for the representation of dramas, with " Macbeth." A prologue, from the pen of the Right Honourable Major-General Fitzpatrick, was spoken by Mr. Kemble, with great applause.
