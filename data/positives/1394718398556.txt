In less than a week... we all receiv'd an invitation from Miss Wyatt to be present at the reception of Gay's Toyshop in her dancing room by the young ladies, to which we accordingly went & were much entertain'd, especially as that also ended with a dance. The music however fell far short of ours as they only had an old man who play'd the fiddle occasionally for the dancing master, who was so vile a scraper that Mr Gibson complain'd that the music made his belly ache.
