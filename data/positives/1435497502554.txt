<p>One of Fats Waller's greatest performances publicly occurred at his last concert at Carnegie Hall. It was around 1943, I think. The first part was wonderful. He played organ and piano straight and the audience reaction was wonderful. As for the last half, everybody got kind of half-high and it ended up in a clambake. Fats was really a truly great artist. Only his very personal friends knew how much he could play. He could play all styles from modern on down. What is generally called the Waller style is more or less the style he became known by commercially. He had a much wider range than most people realize.</p>
