<p>In the fall of 2004, I moved to London from the USA to start studies at Kings College London. The first concert I ever attended here in London was a London Philharmonic concert in late Spetember 2004. I bought a &pound;1 student ticket and sat in the choir seats, behind the orchestra (and needless to say, very close up!). I am a pianist myself, and really enjoyed the quality of music played by such a world-class orchestra.</p>
