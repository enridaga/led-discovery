I always loved the foreign element in the College with Arb√≥s and Rivarde, and what fun we used to have at ensemble classes where we would read Schubert and Brahms Quartets by sight. I shall never forget the laughter caused by my left hand hopping about like a grasshopper on the cello strings but usually landing on the right note, nor the goodness of Ivor James, later cello professor at the RCM.
