Last evening I went into town to collect my modified coat. There were huge flags flying and I wondered what on earth - but then I discovered that the people were rejoicing over the retaking of Ostend, Bruges and especially Lille. Little urchins were marching through the town with improvised bands of drums, voices and whistles, and it sounded joyful. Many of the inhabitants here are refugees from places that the Boches invaded.
