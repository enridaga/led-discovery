A year after we had moved to Purley, Jackie had to go into hospital to have her tonsils removed. Gran was staying with us but Mum was having difficulty in keeping calm. She had been advised not to tell Jackie about the operation for fear of frightening her. Jackie was only four and was running around thinking that she was going on an outing. 

[…] Jackie burst into the kitchen looking perfectly fit and well. 

‘Mummy,’ she said, ‘I want to sing to you.’

Mum was trying to read calmly to Piers, but paused while Jackie drew a deep breath and poised herself to begin. As Gran and I emerged from the larder, Jackie burst into song.

Away in a Manger, no crib for a bed,
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head . . . 

Mum and Gran stood motionless as Jackie sang all the verses with startling emotion: it was a deeply felt performance. The moment she had finished, she smiled and ran off, leaving Mum and Gran in tears at the maturity of her singing.
