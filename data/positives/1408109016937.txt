At 10.30 have nearly 2 hrs of most damning (tho’ v. good) critisism from Ireland at Chelsea.
Practise in afternoon. Meet Barbara at Selfridges at 5.0 4.50, & then Madrigal very hard together. Go back to her flat for dinner (Miss Hurst’s out). Hear Brahm’s Horn trio on wireless from Paris. I am afraid that I prefer our Philistine viola version, to this overswamped by horn business. Horn – Horn – nothing else. Back by ¼ to 10.
