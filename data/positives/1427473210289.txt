In the winter 1852-53 the number of subscribers to my ' Chamber-Music Concerts ' in Manchester had largely increased. I therefore constituted them into a ' Chamber-Music Society,' with an influential committee, keeping the entire management in my own hands. The room in the old town hall, very favourable for music of the kind, was not very large, holding about 450 seats. These were all subscribed for, and there was a list of from 80 to 100 would-be 
subscribers who had to wait for vacancies. Such gigantic strides had the love of music made in three years. The visits of Ernst, Molique, Saint on, Vieux- temps, became now regular, and Piatti was the violoncellist at all the concerts.
