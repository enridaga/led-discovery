Sontag appeared this winter in Leipzig,a little older, a little less sylph-like, but;
lovely, kind, and unassuming, her voice still well-preserved, and her execution faultless. The growing enthusiasm for her completely upsets the good people of Leipzig - they are quite intoxicated; she is triumphant everywhere, and the students gave her a torch-procession on her way home from the theatre.
