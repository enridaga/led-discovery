After your description of Koussie’s Lincoln [Portrait] I heard it on the air yesterday at Ira Gershwin’s house, surrounded by Harold Arlen, Harry Warren, Yip Harburg, Earl Robinson, Arthur Kober and other noted worthies.  (Get the company I’m in!)  Of course I didn’t approve of Geer’s way of doing it, but more than that, why did Kouss take the middle part so fast?  It made it seem superficial.  It lacked charm and bite done that way.  What we need is Amurkian conductors.   In the meantime, however, I’ll take Kouss.
