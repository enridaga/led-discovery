The whole thing about music at that time [the 1970s] was how ephemeral it was. You might see a singer on television and then that performance would be gone forever. The only reliable way of hearing a song again was by means of records or tapes. Lending these to each other was a physical operation and also a social interaction with friends. One actually had to lug the album from A to B and then have a conversation, face-to-face. This is something which, to me, does not appear to take place quite so much with teenagers today. Much of their connection, not only in sharing music, is taking place in cyberspace now. The new ways of listening to and acquiring music are making it possible to see and hear practically any singer or group at any time, but it is no longer a joint enterprise for teenagers in the way it once was.
