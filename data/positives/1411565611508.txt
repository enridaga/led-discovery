I took my niece and her two children to the first Buena Vista Social Club Concert at the RFH. As I had treated them to a box we felt very grand. We all loved the energy of the elderly musicians and the music - so colourful and exciting. After the concert we were invited to go downstairs to see [?] Party, and we all danced to more of the lovely music including myself - nearly 80!!
