The merest ghost of a remark would cause&nbsp;these unsavoury fanatics to turn sharp round upon its&nbsp;utterer, glare at him with blood-chilling ferocity, and&nbsp;give vent to an angry hiss, resembling the hostile warning which a cantankerous old gander addresses to a dog seeking whom it may devour on a village green. This&nbsp;proceeding is not wholly forlorn of a comic element, and&nbsp;it rather entertained me the first time one of the Berlin&nbsp;prize musical scarecrows made me acquainted with it.&nbsp;But I found it pall upon me after a while ; and eventually it bored me so intensely that I left off attending&nbsp;concerts, all except Joachim's, at which I used to sit&nbsp;and watch dear old Moltke positively wallowing in&nbsp;silence, his favourite luxury.&nbsp;</p>
