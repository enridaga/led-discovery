<p class="MsoNormal">Even in New York the World of Art was still our only recreation.&nbsp; We heard Kreisler, whose tours, like ours, were managed by Sol Hurok.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t help wondering why such a brilliant violinist at the height of his career still played works like <em>Liebeslied</em>, which seemed so hackneyed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You have no soul,&rdquo; was the only answer I had from Muriel Stuart when I protested.&nbsp; I suppose he played it for the same reason that Madame [Pavlova] danced the <em>Swan</em>, far more often than he wanted to, simply because the audiences demanded it.</p>
