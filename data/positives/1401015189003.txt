In the morning a rather tense rehearsal of the Dvořák Quintet for Strings is interrupted by the arrival of hordes of tiny children under the impression that there is a children's theatre show in the Dome - a mistake, not of our making, in the Fringe brochure. Half the group wants to improvise a little concert for them, and the other half feels that it's not our responsibility to compensate for the mistake of the administrators, and wants to abandon the tinies to their disappointment. In the end Robin plays his Vocalise and Michael plays Danse de la Chèvre, both of which hold the tinies' attention for about one minute. Then Felix's Mum offers to do some group play-exercises with them, and teaches them all how to get up on the stage and bow, and how to recognise the difference between A and E on the violin, as demonstrated by Ruth The tinies are a bit bewildered by this mixture of being entertained and then entertaining the audience, but some of them have a fine time.
