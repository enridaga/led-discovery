Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs Dewes, Feb. 11th, 1743-4 -
I was yesterday to hear Semele ; it is a delightful piece of music. Mrs. Donnellan desires her particular compliments to all but to my brother ; she bids me say " she loses half her pleasure in Mr. Handel's music by his not being here to talk over the particular passages." There is a four-part song that is delightfully pretty ; Francesina is extremely improved, her notes are more distinct, and there is something in her running-divisions that is quite surprizing. She was much applauded, and the house full, though not crowded ; I believe I wrote my brother word that Mr. Handel and the Prince had quarrelled, which I am sorry for. Handel says the Prince is quite out of his good graces ! there was no disturbance at the play-house, and the Goths were not so very absurd as to declare, in a public manner, their disapprobation of such a composer.
