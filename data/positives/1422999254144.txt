In Boston we supped at a place called the Hi-Hat Club near the hotel, and found how easy it is to be wafted on to the radio by resident interviewers if they know you to be visiting musicians. The startling fact wasn't this at all - it was the sudden realization that the others who were chatting there were without exception world-famous jazz players - Count Basie, Buddy de Franco, John Coltrane, Wardell Gray, Milton Jackson, Clark Terry, Buster Bailey, Charlie Parker; the list seemed endless, and almost all of them were playing as well as talking. I did manage to get their signatures on a menu, and it reads like a Who's Who of jazz in the fifties and sixties; but mostly it was just a joy to be with such a vital and high-spirited group of top-class musicians. You could hear them all at that time for the price of a glass of been - and not at any fancy price either.
