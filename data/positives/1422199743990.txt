Weber's First Concerto ... It was just a great piece of show-off. I rather think it must have been the same to the first professional clarinettist I ever heard play it. His home was Newcastle, he was called Willie Walker and he had an absolutely formidable technique - one which made me shudder to hear. He played it with piano accompaniment only, as a broadcast over SNO, the local station. I heard he had a metal clarinet, Simple system, and on this his tone was surprisingly mellow; but it was his tongue, his magnificent staccato and the superb co-ordination with his fingers which staggered me. I was so impressed at hearing his that I actually bought a copy of the music - for me, an avid library borrower and laborious pen-and-ink copier, a unique event.
