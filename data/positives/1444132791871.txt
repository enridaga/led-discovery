<p>The truth is I shirk the gigantic task of giving an account of Sunday's teaparty, at which I met Sir Val. Chirrol, Sir Henry Newbolt &amp; Lady, Lady Cromer, the Bruce Richmonds, &amp; a scattering of gallant bald cavalry officers, &amp; mounds of South Kensington dowager respectability who must be nameless...The company was decorous and fur-bearing as usual; &amp; the music like the voice of spirits in another world enticing the hopelessly damned.&nbsp; Sir Henry wrote a patriotic song to the tune of it.&nbsp; But how nice they are too!</p>
