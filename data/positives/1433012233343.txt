When I saw Bloch, soon after the outbreak of World War II, at his hotel overlooking Central Park, he picked up his violin – he had started playing again at the time of the composition of the Violin Concerto (1936-38)- and showed me fragments of a projected “Symphony for Violin Alone.” As late as May 13, 1944 he wrote to me from Agate Beach, Oregon, announcing the completion of a new work for orchestra, a Suite in three movements: Overture, Passacaglia, and Finale, played in the fall of 1945 by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Monteux.
