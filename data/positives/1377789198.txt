O how we all wished for our Daddy when the Divine Agujari said she would sing! She was all good humour and sweetness. She sang -- O, Sir! -- what words can I use? -- Could I write what she deserves, you would come to hear her, let what would be the consequence. O, Mr. Crisp, she would heal all your complaints, -- her voice would restore you to health and spirits, -- I think it is almost greater than ever, -- and then, when softened, so sweet, so mellow, so affecting! She has every thing! -- every requisite to accomplish a singer, in every style and manner! -- the sublime and the beautiful equally at command! I tremble not lest she should not answer to you, for she cannot, cannot fail! She astonishes and she affects at pleasure -- O that you could come and hear her! Is it impossible? I die to have you enjoy the greatest luxury the world can offer; -- such to me -- such, I am sure, to you, would be the singing of Agujari!
