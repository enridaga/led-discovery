While I can claim to have visited the RFH as a six year old during August of Festival of Britain year, my first encounter with the hall for purely musical purposes was on Wednesday March 6th 1963 - Sir Malcolm Sargent conducted Elgar No.2 and Moiseiwitsch played the 'Emperor'  concerto - his final London appearance. On Tuesday October 3rd 1967 Norman Del Mar announced to an unsuspecting audience the news of Sir Malcolm's death. After two minutes silence Jacqueline du Pr√© performed the Elgar concerto - a very emotional evening.
