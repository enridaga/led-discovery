<p>In the evening we went to the Wickliffe Chapel, Commercial Road, East, Rev. Andrew Reed, D.D., pastor. Dr. Reed was in America several years since, in company with Mr. Matheson, now no more. In the singing exercises, the hymn was lined out. The choir (so called) consisted of several men who occupied a square pew in front of the pulpit The first tune was Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s Wareham, abridged; the second Was French (Dundee), and the third I knew not, but it was unfit for Congregational use, as it went up to G and dwelt there considerably. No small effort was made by good people around me to reach the lofty eminence, but in vain; most voices fell short of the pitch, and vibrations inharmonious followed. The hymn was that beginning,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more, my God, I boast no more,<br />Of all the duties I have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tune Hamburg, in the key of E flat, would have suited it exactly.</p>
