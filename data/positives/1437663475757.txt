<p>Go to Chamber concert at 8.30 with Grace at B.B.C. - Kolisch Quartet. playing Mozart D min. &amp; Beethoven A min. Krenek - var. from op 5. &amp; five pieces of Webern.* All from Memory - astounding. Amazing technique &amp; the perf of modern works all to be desired. The classics ought to have been perfect too - but spoilt by erractic speeds (esp. finale of B.) &amp; general lack of understanding. The Krenek, as music, was dull. The Webern interesting &amp; very beautiful in parts.&nbsp;</p>
