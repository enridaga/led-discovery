<p>My first memory of the Festival Hall was the Festival of Britain, where my uncle worked. All I can remember was watching a man cross the Thames on a tight rope. The school I joined in 1956 took us regularly to Ernest Read's Saturday morning concerts for children. We went from school at Hampton Court to Waterloo, between the age of 11 and16. Without doubt this was the trigger for a lifetime love of music and the RFH, which I still visit.</p>
