Letter from Bunsen to a son, 13th February, 1854 -
At the Queen's dinner-table, soon after this, the Princesses Helena and Louisa, and Prince Arthur, were allowed to come in and stand by the Queen, as it was a feast day. In the evening there was very fine music in St. George's Hall (the
Triumphal Symphony of Beethoven), and the Princess Royal, Princess Alice, the Prince of Wales, and Prince Alfred, were allowed to stay up to hear it, sitting to the right and left of the chairs where sat the Queen and Prince Albert, and the
Duchess of Kent.
