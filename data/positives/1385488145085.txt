I was to see the opera of Dioclesian, but was very much disappointed, for instead of Purcell's musick which I expected, we had Papuch's, and very humdrum it was; indeed I never was so tired with anything in my life. The performers were, Mrs. Barbier, Mrs. Chambers, (a scholar of Margarettas), Legard and old Leveridge.
