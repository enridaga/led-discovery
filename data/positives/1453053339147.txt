<p>The performance of the <em>Messiah</em> went off&nbsp;very well. I was in capital form and rather&nbsp;strange to our ideas of an oratorio audience's&nbsp;attitude had to repeat the air " Why do the&nbsp;Nations." Rubinstein, Leschetitsky, Mme.&nbsp;Essipoff, Louis Brassin, Leopold Auer, Helmy&nbsp;Raab, the charming Prima Donna of the&nbsp;Imperial Opera all friends and colleagues of&nbsp;Davidoff, who conducted were present, and we all met again on the following night at&nbsp;Leschetitsky's house, Mme. Essipoff receiving&nbsp;the company. These weekly receptions in the&nbsp;salons of the famous pianist and teacher were&nbsp;among the fashionable events of the season.</p>
