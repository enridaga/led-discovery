<p>I well remember the premiere of Verdi's <em>Rigoletto</em> on May 14th, 1853. The caste was very brilliant. Angiolina Bosio was an exquisite Gilda, and Mario, in his most mellifluous mood, brought down the house with <em>La donna e mobile</em>. As Rigoletto, Ronconi realised all the tragic pathos of the part. The basso Tagliafico was Sperafucile, and the charming Madame Nantier Didiee Maddalena. She had studied the part with me. The great quartette in the last act was encored.</p>
