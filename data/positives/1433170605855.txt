At the funeral, on December 23rd, in St. George's Chapel, Dr. Elvey played the organ during the mournful service. 
As the procession advanced, the commencement of the Burial Service,"I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord," was sung by the full choir to Dr. Croft's music. At the nave was commenced the passage, " I know that my Redeemer liveth," still sung to Croft's melancholy, dirge-like music, so touching, so inexpressibly mournful in its long, soft cadences. 
At the end of the lesson the choir sang the German chorale, " I shall not in the grave remain."
