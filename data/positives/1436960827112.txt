<p>Chief Blue Cloud, a real Sioux Indian who played good trombone, was the leader of the band.

When the curtain went up we&rsquo;d be sitting on front of a tepee, with one guy playing a tom-tom. Everybody would give an Indian call: &ldquo;Woo-woo-woo-woo,&rdquo; and then we would jump up with a big war whoop and bust into some hot jazz.</p>
