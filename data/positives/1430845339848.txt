We always had a good solo boy. Armes was in the choir when I was a probationer, but his voice was gone, and I cannot say that I ever remember hearing him sing a solo. He was originally a chorister in Norwich Cathedral, and, I believe, had sung in a duet at Norwich with Jenny Lind. Armes was a very efficient boy vocalist. In recognition of his work in the choir a subscription was raised at Rochester, and he was presented with a fine Broadwood pianoforte when he became the articled pupil of the organist.

He was succeeded by E. J. Crow, who later in life became organist of Ripon Cathedral. Crow was a beautiful singer; I have never heard the Finale in
Wesley's " Wilderness " " And sorrow and sighing" sung better by any soloist in any choir. He had a peculiarly delicate and effective way of singing the word "sighing," with its appoggiatura, which I shall never forget.

In his turn a boy named In his turn a boy named Williams became the leading
soloist. He too possessed a beautiful voice, and I can recall the great effect he once produced in Purcell's " O sing unto the Lord." This was on the occasion of
a selection performed in the Cathedral at a service on behalf of the Choir Benevolent Fund in 1858.
