<p>Comparatively recently, a couple of years ago, I was in London and heard Mussorgsky's&nbsp;<em>Khovanshchina</em>, using my orchestration. They sang well, but of course the Russian in&nbsp;<em>Khovanshchina</em> is not quite the same as it is nowadays; and then there was a bit of an English accent ... It wasn't quite right.&nbsp;</p>
