<p>To Sigi Weissenberg's icy Chopin recital with Arnold Weissberger. En route we stop at Arlene Dahl's where I know nobody, and vice versa, and her piano is graced with a photo of Nixon. Fact: Arnold's and Sigi's names are side by side in Who's Who. Opinion: the observe repeats in a piano should bring an altered viewpoint. The repeats in Weissenberg's version of Chopin's Sonata in B-minor were not even photo duplications - which would, after all, show another dimension - they were instant replay. Defend instant replay by stating that since it comes later we are older and so hear differently.</p>
