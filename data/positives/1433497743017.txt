Each Sunday, [Buddy] Bolden went to church and that's where he got his idea of jazz music. They would keep perfect rhythm there by clapping their hands. I think I am the first one who started four-beat for guitar, and that's where I heard it (all down-strokes--four straight down). Bolden was still a great man for the blues--no two questions about that. The closest thing to it was Oliver and he [Bolden] was better than Oliver. He was a great man for what we call "dirt music". Let me tell you, he was plenty powerful. Even with all that power, the trumpet players of that day would have their notes covered, and they would not hurt the ear the way bebop does now. You could hear every instrument in these bands--every instrument. The drummer had his drums tuned--he would tune those drums like they were a piano.
