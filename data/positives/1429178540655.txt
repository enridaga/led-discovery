Yesterday morning at nine o'clock I had the rehearsal, which went off very well, 
and to-night at half-past six is the concert, which I wish was over already. I play a Beethoven Concerto and several small pieces by Chopin ; at the rehearsal the audience (there is rather a large one at the rehearsals here) was very polite to me ; nevertheless, I am a little nervous just now.
