It was not long before I obtained a great deal of work, not only in teaching, but by conducting local choral societies. I worked very hard at this time, for most of these societies were outside Manchester, and necessitated railway journeys home late at night. But what was much more valuable to me was the chance really for the first time in my life of hearing the best orchestral music. Halle's Concerts were then in full swing, and I attended them regularly. They were a wonderful institution in those days, and made Manchester superior to London in affording opportunities for frequently hearing great orchestral works well rendered.
