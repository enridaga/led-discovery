...I met with Mr. Lock and Pursell, Maisters of Musique; and with them to the Coffee-house into a room next the Water by ourselfs. Here we had variety of brave Italian and Spanish songs and a Canon for 8 Voc:, which Mr. Lock had newly made on these words: Domine salvum fac Regem, an admirable thing. Here, out of the window it was a most pleasant sight to see the City from [one] end to the other with a glory about it, so high was the light of the Bonefires and so thick round the City, and the bells rang everywhere.
