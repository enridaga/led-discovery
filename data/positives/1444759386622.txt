<p>... in November of the previous year, 1958, the wind players of the&nbsp;Opera House orchestra had given a concert before Her Majesty the Queen as part of the Leeds Festival. The only work we performed was the great B flat Serenade for thirteen Wind Instruments by Mozart. It was conducted by Benjamin Britten who was not best pleased to find that no one had thought to provide us with any music stands. We propped the parts up&nbsp;on charis until Lord Harewood arrived with taxi loads of stands from the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Britten was a very exacting rehearser and he also had his own very individual interpretation of Mozart from the point of view of shaping and phrasing which was surprising in that it was unlike anything I had previously experienced, but entirely satisfying none the less. He obviously had a great love of Mozart's works.</p>
