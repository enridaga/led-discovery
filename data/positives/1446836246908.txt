<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">When I was studying I came with my quartet to the Queen Elizabeth Hall to see the Alban Berg Quartet. After the concert we went across to the Royal Festival Hall to met a friend from the Philharmonia. We saw the Alban Berg&nbsp; Quartet going upstairs to the Peoples Palace for dinner . The cellist of our quartet wanted to go and met them but I was too shy . However we did go up to the entrance of the restaurant&nbsp; and met them and had a lovely chat with them . I also used to enjoy a icecream on the balcony during concert intervals.</p>
