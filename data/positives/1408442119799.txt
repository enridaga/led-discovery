In January Signor Molino was chosen Dodge, but the extreame snow that fell, & the cold hindred my going to see the solemnity, so I stirrd not from Padoa til Shrovetide, when all the world repaire to Venice to see the folly and madness of the Carnevall.... Now are the greate banks set up for those who will play at Basset, the Comedians have also liberty & the Operas to exercise: Witty pasquils are likewise thrown about, & the Mountebanks have their stages in every Corner: The diversion which chiefely tooke me up, was three noble Operas which I saw, where was incomparable Voices, & Musique.
