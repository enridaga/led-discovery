<p>The next time I heard Ellington was three years later on the stage of the Oriental Theatre in Chicago. That occasion was memorable for the rendition of "Mood Indigo" by the original trombone, clarinet, trumpet combination, Tricky Sam Nanton, Barney Brigard, and Artie Whetsol. It never has sounded the same since. Subsequently I was to hear the fabulous Ellington band on countless occasions, in rehearsals, recording sessions, theatres, one-nighters and in the Cotton Club during its heyday.</p>
