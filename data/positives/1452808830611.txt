<p>Madame Joachim's was a&nbsp;perfect vocal technique, joined to the gift of a&nbsp;beautiful sonorous contralto voice, great depth&nbsp;of feeling, a keen intellect, a subtle sense of&nbsp;humour, and fine musical perception. These&nbsp;forces she put into the service of an exalted&nbsp;ideal of her art, with the result that there was&nbsp;neither lack nor exuberance, but a sort of&nbsp;Grecian serenity, a faultless balance of values, so to speak, with just enough of her own&nbsp;personality in everything she did, to render&nbsp;her singing interesting and gratifying beyond&nbsp;the intrinsic merit of the works she interpreted.&nbsp;Many are the singers who please the thousands,&nbsp;but only a very small number satisfy the few&nbsp;as Amalie Joachim did.&nbsp;</p>
