The city of York was crammed with visitors to attend the festival. The performances at the Minster for three mornings, gave universal satisfaction to crowded audiences : Madame Mara, Mrs. Crouch, and Harrison were in fine song. The performances were, the " Messiah," and two grand selections from the most approved works of Handel. There were concerts given in the evenings, at the great assembly rooms. One of the most awful accompaniments to the inspired music of Handel, was furnished by the hand of Nature. On Monday night, the 15th of August, 1791, during the grand chorus, "He gave them hailstones for rain," a storm, almost unparalleled in the memory of man, burst in all its violence over the rooms ; the flashes of lightning, and the loud peals of thunder, were magnificently awful. The great room, almost crowded to suffocation, being surrounded with windows, which were opened to admit what little air there was, appeared full of blue flame : never before or since did I behold such a tremendous night, such bursts of Heaven's artillery, and such sheets of fire, combined with the sacred words and the majestic music of the mighty master, were altogether appalling and magnificent.
