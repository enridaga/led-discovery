<p>When Dennis Coleman invited me to the West Coast premiere of <em>Whitman Cantata</em>, it was suggested I 'play something' with the chorus. As I had nothing for piano &amp; male chorus, JH suggested I simply accompany, as written, four of my simplest songs, each to be sung in unison by one of the four sections of the choir. The effect proved magical at the rehearsal, as at the performance last evening.</p>
