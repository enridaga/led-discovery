<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">University Ball - Joe Loss Orchestra (?). Didn't finish till 5am. Walking to breakfast in ball gown. Glenn Gould playing - magic. Otto Klemperer and the Philharmonia in Beethoven's 9th Symphony. I missed 1951 Festival - went to Guide camp - my parents and brothers went.&nbsp;</p>
