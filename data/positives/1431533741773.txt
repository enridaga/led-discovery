It is a problem that Bogachova comes from Leningrad; the Moscow singers Obraztsova and Sinyavskaya don’t appeal to me quite as much. It’s true that Bogachova is somewhat of an enigma to me: I recently heard her on the radio singing something by Pushkov or Novikov or some such, but I was simply knocked out by the beauty of her voice.
