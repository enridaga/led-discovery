In those days, we would carry our equipment with us and set up in almost any place we could find. In New Orleans, I remember sessions on the second floor of some shaky old building. Why, the musicians would stomp their feet as they played and the walls and floor would be shaking and the microphones would rock. So we'd take out the cardboard pads from the record boxes and spred them on the floor. When that didn't work, we'd have the musicians take off their shoes. Now, there would always be some who didn't have stockings, and so there would be a band playing the wildest kind of natural jazz in their bare and stockinged feet. 

I've always said that when musicians began to wear shoes, it was no longer the original jazzâ€¦

I prefer to think that there are two kinds of jazz--'natural jazz' and 'musical' jazz. The natural kind is what came out of New Orleans and folk music. 'Musical' jazz is what happened to it when the trained musicians got hold of it.
