I remember buying my first stereo in 1976. I was eighteen and had just moved into a place of my own, which was a bedsit. The one thing that I simply had to have to make life bearable was a stereo. They were pretty expensive, so I bought a fairly basic system with a deck and speakers for £45. That was a week’s wages for me at the time and I only managed it because my parents gave me some money for my birthday. Having a stereo was one of those essential things when you moved out of home. I could put up without a lot, but not being able to hear Neil Young was not one of them.
