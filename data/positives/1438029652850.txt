<p>After - I listen to broadcast from Covent Garden of Act. I of Beethoven's World-wonder 'Fidelio' - the more I hear of this music, the smaller I feel. Very good cast - Lotte Lehman superb as Leonore (Abscheulicher was thrilling) &amp; a very delightful Marcelline (Berger). Rocco (Kipnis) very good also. Beecham good but not first-class, &amp; orchestra only so-so. Even then, it was a thrill, and the glorious sound of the 'Canon' was unbelievable. What music.&nbsp;</p>
