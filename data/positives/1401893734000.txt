The casualty lists are terrible. In today’s there are two pairs of brothers killed. This battle for Calais has been most bloody; it has lasted twenty days already. It becomes more and more clear that legislation must be made to compel men to serve, if only during this war. Our Army will be extinct if it is not reinforced... Much more should be published about the real state of affairs. Recruiting should be carried on more picturesquely, with musical displays etc, so as to appeal to our stolid fellows.
   This morning I took you to the Park in your pram with Nannie to see the parade and departure of the Sportsmen’s Battalion for their camp, preparatory to going abroad. This splendid corps is composed of athletes and sporting men up to the age of forty five, who can shoot, ride and do other sport. They were such handsome big fellows, there are gentlemen and non-gentlemen, trainers and jockeys too. There was a big band to accompany them on their march to Liverpool Street Station.
    When the band struck up, as they left the Parade Ground, you got very excited, my pet, and waved your little gloved hands. Your pram was very soon left behind in the crowd, for your Mummy started marching alongside the battalion. Granny came too, and she and I accompanied the men from the Knightsbridge Barracks Parade to Hyde Park Corner, Mummy’s eyes streaming all the way.
