<p>At every street-comer in Japanese towns minstrels of the improvisators class may be encountered,&nbsp;who chant extempore ballads of inordinate length,&nbsp;accompanying themselves on guitars of different shapes&nbsp;and sizes, every one of which has its own special title and&nbsp;"method." In the Yoshiwara (District of Delights) at&nbsp;Tokio, Mr. Mitford counted nearly four hundred tea-&nbsp;houses, in which the well-to-do inhabitants of that city gave their formal dinner-parties and "receptions."&nbsp;Music is a leading feature of these entertainments, and&nbsp;the establishments in question, despite their large number, are all well supplied with executants. So general,&nbsp;indeed, is the demand for music at public places of&nbsp;refreshment in Japan, that even the humblest inns and&nbsp;cabarets are provided with Geshias (female minstrels),&nbsp;who welcome the traveller on his arrival, and amuse him&nbsp;during his repasts with performances upon the Shamiseng, a three-stringed guitar, the body of which is made&nbsp;of mulberry-wood covered with catskin.</p>
