The P.F. arrived safe. It is a charming instrument. I thank you heartily, for myself & my friend. He improves, I think, in his basses. I find Miss [Catherine] Forster has a sweet voice & an excellent ear. I wish you had her under your tuition: such scholars must be comfortable & refreshing. I have procured for her a set of lessons I have lately met with by one [Valentin] Roeser. Do you know them? They seem to me the best things for beginners upon the Piano Forte that I ever saw. For they are easy, short, well adapted to the instrument, fair for the hand, & are yet good harmony, & far from vulgar or inelegant melody: well calculated, me thinks to lead younkers into a good taste. What do you say? If I am wrong, tell me.
