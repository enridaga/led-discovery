<p>"The first piece was written for the Gloucester Festival of 1853, and contains some excellent contrapuntal writing, and some elegant solos for soprano, tenor, and bass voices, which were given with adequate effect by Miss Edith Wynne, Mr. W. H. Cummings, Mr. Ramsbottom, and Mr. Orlando Christian. The scoring is thoughtful and good, and the choruses broad and well written.</p>
