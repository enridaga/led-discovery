<p>what has become, I would ask, of the&nbsp;Hieland pipers, "braw" in all the faded splendours of&nbsp;eighth-hand sporrans and plaids, kilts and philabegs,&nbsp;with their tartans of clans which they could not name&nbsp;when solicited to do so, and their significant little knives&nbsp;stuck in their stockings, indicating profuse weasand-slitting to the unsophisticated childish mind well primed&nbsp;in Scott's national novels, but really functioning (as&nbsp;observation taught me) in connection with the carving of&nbsp;bread and cheese and the extraction of the reluctant&nbsp;winkle from his curly home? I never see or hear those&nbsp;pipers now, and I am glad of it, for their instrument is&nbsp;one which does not convey unmixed gratification to ears&nbsp;that, like my own, have not undergone a peculiar training in appreciativeness of its musical charms. But they&nbsp;used to be seemingly ubiquitous in London streets about&nbsp;the time I refer to, and compared infavourably, to my&nbsp;childish apprehensions, with the wooden Highlanders on&nbsp;guard in front of the snuff-shops, who were cleaner and more glossy than their perambulatory compatriots, over&nbsp;whom they had the additional advantage of not giving&nbsp;utterance to a stomach-ache of sound.</p>
