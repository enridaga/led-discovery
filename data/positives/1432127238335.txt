For many years this was the favourite hymn of Francis Murphy, the great temperance lecturer, and was the keynote of all his meetings. I had the pleasure of attending many of his services in Chicago, and have seen him move an audience to tears by his pathetic rendering of this hymn. It is believed that thousands of drinking men have been saved through its instrumentality.
