Banti prevailed on Mrs. Billington to perform with her on the night of her benefit, leaving to the latter the choice of the opera, and the principal character. Merope, by Portogallo, was fixed upon, in which Mrs. Billington acted the heroine of the piece, and Banti took the part of Polifonte, though written for a tenor voice. The curiosity to hear these two celebrated singers together, was so great, that the theatre overflowed, and even ladies were obliged to sit on the stage, for want of other places. The performance satisfied every expectation, and the applause bestowed equally on both, was as rapturous as it was well deserved.</p>
