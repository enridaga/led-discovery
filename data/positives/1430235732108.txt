We dined early, and immediately afterwards Malibran sat down to the piano, and 'sang for the children', as she used to call it, the Rataplan and some of her father's Spanish songs; for want of a guitar accompaniment she used, while playing, every now and then to mark the rhythm on the board at the back of the keys. After singing with exquisite grace and charm a number of French and Italian romances of her own composition, she was relieved at the piano by Thalberg, who performed all manner of tricks on the instrument, snapping his fingers as an obligato to Viennese songs and waltzes.
