Dear Philharmonia Management
I suppose it is a compliment that I have come to expect such excellence from the orchestra that any slippage stands out like a sore thumb, I love the Phil harmonia and some concerts live in my mind from years ago and still thrill me, in memory.
However, the recent concert of Mendelssohn and Mahler on Sunday October 14 was disappointing, The Mendelssohn sounded very unrehearsed, The orchestra sound was flat and the soloist got off to a very shaky start and never really delivered the dazzling beauty of the violin part, The Mahler was better, but just- unimaginative, I wondered if the orchestra was even the real Philharmonia? Maybe everyone had food poisoning and it was full of deps? I have never written before,(even the disastrous final concert at the old Festival Hall with the 'incomparable' Helen Grimeaux) and I have still committed to numerous concerts and always will. Just thought I had to write:
Yours sincerely
Friend of the Phil (I think)
