A week later, Jackie performed the Lalo concerto at the Guildhall School of Music with their first orchestra conducted by Norman Del Mar. It was the first time she had played a concerto with an orchestra. The Lalo is an extensive virtuoso piece and suited her particularly well at that time. Born in France, Lalo was of Spanish descent and loved to use dazzling dance rhythms in his music, making it great fun to play. Jackie captured the vivacious spirit of the music and threw herself headlong into the performance. She appeared to have no difficulties in presenting a full-scale concerto with supreme confidence.
