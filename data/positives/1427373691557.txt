<p>Sir William having invited me to dinner that day, I returned, and was introduced to the first Lady Hamilton. The taste and partiality for music of this highly-gifted person, are too well known to need a remark from me. At that period she frequently gave concerts, to which all the best per-formers were invited. She was herself considered the finest piano-forte player in Italy. After dinner, at which I had the honour of being introduced to the late Duke of Bedford, there was music. The celebrated Millico accompanied him-self on the harp in the charming canzonetta, " Ho sparse tante lagrime ;" his singing was enchanting. I was asked, and sang Rauzzini's song, " Fuggiam da questo loco," and " Water parted from the sea," accompanying myself on the piano-forte. I seemed to give general satisfaction, and Signer Millico, in particular, said many kind things.</p>
