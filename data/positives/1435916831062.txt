<p>The celebrated pianist, Sigismund Thalberg, composed an opera called<em> Florinda</em>, which his father-in-law, Lablache, was most anxious to get performed. The director, Mr. Lumley, acceded to his request, as Lablache was a most useful member of his company; Madame Sontag and he took the principal roles, but the opera only made a <em>succes d'estime</em> and was quickly shelved. I remember Thalberg coming into the room where my father was holding the chorus rehearsal of Florinda, at which I was playing the piano accompaniments; but as soon as I saw him coming I rushed away, and he sat down in my place and played during part of the rehearsal. I listened from afar, and was at once charmed with his exquisite touch and beautiful playing; so I crept back quietly and hung on every note. I had not heard him play before, and I at once realised that he was a great virtuoso.</p>
