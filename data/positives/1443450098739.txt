<p>I went dejectedly to my room, turned on the wireless.&nbsp; It was Monteux conducting the 9th. The applause is still tempesting on as I write.&nbsp; Never have I heard such infallible tempi, nor singers inspired to such fire.&nbsp; never have I heard such applause, breaking in like a finale to the final chords. Freude, Sch&ouml;ner G&ouml;tterfunken...Oh, it is true! In his 89th year, Monteux proves it. He gave such life, such fluency to his singers that even in the barking passage they didn't bark, they clamoured.</p>
