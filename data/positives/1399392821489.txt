I just wanted to thank everyone involved in the wonderful performance you gave of Yeoman of the Guard on Sunday afternoon. It was without doubt, the best performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta I have been to, not least due to the playing of the Philharmonia under John Wilson's direction. I do hope the success of this performance will encourage you to do more G&S in the future. How about The Gondoliers?  A recording would be good too! It was a reminder that when performed as well as this, these are great works that now
seem to be neglected.
Thank you again,
