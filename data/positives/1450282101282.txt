<p class="MsoNormal">Strauss, violin in hand, conducted the orchestra daily, in one of his most popular waltzes, and also in some little knick-knacks, such as the Pizzicato Polka, which became at once a great favorite. His manner of conducting was very animating. He led off with the violin bow to give the tempo, but when the right swing was obtained and the melody was singing out from the orchestra, he joined in with his fiddle as if he must take part in the intoxication of the waltz. While playing or conducting he commonly kept his body in motion, rising and falling on his toes in a really graceful manner.</p>
