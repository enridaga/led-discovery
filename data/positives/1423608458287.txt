A life-changing moment for me!  I shall never forget the concert performance of Bellini's 'Norma' with Montserrat Caballe and Fiorenza Cossotto - singers at the height of their fame and at their peak vocally.  I remember the lighting effect too especially as Montserrat started to sing 'Canta Diva?' .  I was 20 and have never heard such a beautiful voice and heavenly music combined.  At the end of 'Mira? O Norma' the two ladies embraced and the audience went mad - everyone stood and screamed.  They winked at each other and gave us an encore!  At the end everyone mobbed the platform - it was the first of many such occasions with Montserrat Caballe over the next ten years.  Where are those evenings to be found now?
