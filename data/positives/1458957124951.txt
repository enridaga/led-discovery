<p>The Sonning Music Fund in Denmark awards prizes to musicians once a year. I was the tenth person to win this prize and was invited to Copenhagen. While I was there the Royal Theatre staged a new production of my opera&nbsp;<em>Katerina Izmailova.&nbsp;</em>I was favourably impressed by the production, especially the interpretation fo the music, which was conducted by the Polish musician Kazimierz Kord - a former pupil of the Leningrad Conservatoire and now conductor of the Katowice Radio Orchestra - who had been specially invited to take part in this production.&nbsp;</p>
