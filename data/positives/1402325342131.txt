The first children's concert in Thamesmead was scheduled as the 'Trip to the Zoo' which got so out of control in the Scrubs.... Felix narrated the show dressed in a kind of respectable-gipsy outfit and was far more extrovert with his reading. The dome was packed with kids, mostly little ones, and mostly quite docile and co-operative. The new formula of story plus shouting and participation worked very well indeed, and at the end they hugged and dance with the bear, this time with Leo inside the bear costume.... The atmosphere of the show, however, was very 'high', not at all menacing as it had been on the Scrubs, and we retired feeling cheerful that we now had to children's concert programmes, both original in tone.
