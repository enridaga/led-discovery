...[Having been wounded] I became attached to an Officer Cadet Battalion or an OCB as they are more generally known. 
    ....[I went] down to a newly formed OCB at Fleet, near Aldershot [the 21st OCB].
    ...It was considered that you could get the best out of the instructors if each took his special subject... I took Trench Warfare and Bombing...
    Now as to games. ‘A’ & ‘B’ Companies held sports on the race-courses and Cadet Harvey of No. 8 Platoon won the individual cup. We also got up concerts in the big hall. I was OC [of Entertainments] in the Battalion. Newman of A’ Company was very energetic and produced the ‘Country Girl’ in an open air theatre. It was a great show.
    This opera was a successful wind-up to our first course.
