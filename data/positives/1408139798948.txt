And so home and there I find W. How and a younger brother of his come to dine with me; and there comes Mercer and brings with her Mrs. Gayet, which pleased me mightily, and here was also W. Hewers; and mighty merry and after dinner to sing psalms; but Lord, to hear what an excellent Base this younger brother of W. How's sings, even to my astonishment and mighty pleasant. By and by Gayet goes away, being a Catholique, to her devotions, and Mercer to church, but we continued an hour or two singing, and so parted; and I to Sir W. Penn's, and there sent for a hackney coach and he and she and I out to take the ayre.
