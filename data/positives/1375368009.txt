I went to the play last night, and heard some very good music, and not bad acting; but the quickness of the recitation, and the loudness of the singing, had something of caricature, or at least appeared so to my organs, unaccustomed to such performances. They acted three different pieces: La preuve Villageoise; Le Mariage d'une heure; and Les Pr√©tendues. The music of the first was old, but pretty. The second I never heard before; there were some beautiful trios in it; but the character of the composition was more brilliant and buoyant than touching; pathos belongs to the Italian alone, some few Scotch and Irish airs excepted.
