To-night we were at Madame P__'s, a retired magistrate's family.... Nice kind people; but a curious company, and the most old-fashioned of costumes; no one of note....There were several acquaintances, oh how dull! Some amateurs, who set your teeth on edge with their music; a violinist without an ear, and a fine fellow who, after casting a conqueror's glance round the room, rests one hand on the piano and sings Schubert's serenade in an attitude.... Oh, so ridiculous! I cannot understand how a gentleman can play the low comedian at a grand soiree.
