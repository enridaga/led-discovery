Go to B.B.C. concert (area ticket) at 8.15. Henry Wood. Haydn symphony (at usual break-neck speed & with usual battalion of strings) - Bach concerto E maj (Thibaud) - disgraceful performance - bad technically (rhythm out of control & intonation bad) & interpretively (impossible portamento). Thibaud was better in Chausson's long & sentimental Poem with orchestra. Delius' Song of High Hills - amazingly beautiful - incredibly long & monotonous even for Delius - but what marvellous sounds, he creates! Chorus (National) helped admirably in these.
