...I... to Sir G. Carteretâ€™s again, and so took coach alone, it now being almost night, to Whitehall and there in the Boarded gallery did hear the music with which the King is presented this night by Monsieur Grebus, the master of his music - both instrumental (I think 24 violins) and vocall, an English song upon peace; but, God forgive me, I was never so little pleased with a consort of music in my life - the manner of setting of words and repeating them out of order, and that with a number of voices, makes me sick, the whole design of vocall musick being lost by it. Here was a great press of people, but I did not see many pleased with it; only, the instrumental music he had brought by practice to play very just.
