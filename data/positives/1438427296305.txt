<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New';">Three weeks later I met impresario and conductor together at Bayreuth on the day that they <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>were to take their departure. Both were full<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of the wonders they had seen and heard. The <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>works given that year were &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Die Meistersinger&rdquo; &mdash; the Nuremberg opera <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>for the first time at Bayreuth. I asked Harris <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>which of the three he had decided to do at Covent <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Garden next season. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

But I am afraid she won't. Seriously, though, I should like to do the &ldquo;Meistersinger&rdquo;, even if I have to give it in Italian and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>get the text specially translated. If only Jean <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>de Reszke would sing Walther! See poor old <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Gudehus in the part here, and then imagine for yourself what a perfect Walther Jean would make!&rdquo;</span></p>
