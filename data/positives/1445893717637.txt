<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The Challen pianoforte was surprisingly mellow.&nbsp; When Father and I came down to breakfast on our first morning, Maudie was practising scales.&nbsp; She did not stop when I entered the front room &hellip; I saw the left side of her face in shadow, and that, with her brooding frown of concentration over the busy hands, made her yet another person whom I must get to know, a newer stimulant to my reviving emotions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">She turned her head and smiled at me, as though to challenge any questioning of her right to be in the room and at the piano.&nbsp; I studied her hands.&nbsp; They were firm and chubby.&nbsp; The backs were arched, and the fingers rose and fell like the tossing heads of horses on a bearing-rein.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&ldquo;Keep your wrists down,&rdquo; she said, and followed this axiom with a gleam of pretty teeth, and a nod of the head to indicate that she was addressing herself, in the direction of those muscular hands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The mere sound of a piano, like the mere external appearance of books, affects me disproportionately.&nbsp; I have to pull myself together, as sensible people would say, in order to balance the effect, and to prevent myself from some extravagant gesture, in word or act.&nbsp; I am a ready subject for the fluting the Pied Piper, or the wailing strings of those gipsies who tempted Tolstoi.</p>
<p>I began my breakfast, tapping the top of an egg to the rhythm of the dominant, the sub-dominant and the tonic of a minor scale, to which Maudie had just moved from the major.&nbsp; The shift of sound from light to dark, from outward to inward, from known to unknown, touched my chameleon sense, and I gloomed over the yolk of my egg, adding bitterness to the salt from the tiny bone spoon in my fingers.</p>
