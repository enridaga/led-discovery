The latter were held for years in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Massachusetts. The singers of these different States had organized governing boards that appointed the time of meeting and engaged the music director and assisting artists. The chorus of singers chiefly studied so-called &ldquo; sacred music,&rdquo; and usually wound up their week&rsquo;s labor with an oratorio performance.</p>
