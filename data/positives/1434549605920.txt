Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 27 Oct. 1750 -
I am very happy in having Mrs. F. Hamilton with me, her sprightly good humour, and ingenious works, make the day pass very agreeably. Yesterday evening we went to a concert to hear a new French fiddler, Morella by name, he has a particularly fine execution, plays with great ease and prettiness, but as it was all nonsense music I am not sure I shall like his taste, till I hear him play music of consequence ; and I believe, on the whole, he has too many tricks to please me often.
