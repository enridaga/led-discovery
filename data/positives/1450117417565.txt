<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">As for the 2 piano + percussion sonata, its world-premier has been given in Basel 2 weeks ago. My wife and myself played the 2 pianos &ndash; it had a &lsquo;tremendous&rsquo; success. Mrs. Bart&oacute;k played very well- this was her first public appearance in a foreign country. </span></p>
