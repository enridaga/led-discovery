<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">It was the most exciting night of my life, and completely unexpected because I had no hopes of attending the opera at all; eleven-year-olds were rarely seen at grand, late-night social events. The <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Ruslan</em> semi-centennial had been declared a national holiday, and my father must have considered the occasion important for my education. Just before theatre time Bertha burst into my room saying &lsquo;Hurry, hurry, we are going, too.&rsquo; I dressed quickly and climbed into the carriage by the side of my mother. I remember that the Mariyinsky was lavishly decorated that night, and pleasantly perfumed, and I could find my seat even now &ndash; indeed, the eye of my memory leaps to it like filings to a magnet. A ceremony and a parade had preceded the performance. Poor Glinka, who was only a kind of Russian Rossini, had been Beethovenized and nationally monumented. I watched the performance through my mother&rsquo;s mother-of-pearl lorgnette binoculars. In the first interval we stepped from our loge into a small foyer behind. A few people were already walking there. Suddenly my mother said to me, &lsquo;Igor, look, there is Tchaikovsky.&rsquo; I looked and saw a man with white hair, large shoulders, a corpulent back, and this image has remained in the retina of my memory all my life. </span></p>
