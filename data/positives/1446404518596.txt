<p>[T]his is the Thanksgiving Day for Lord Nelson's Glorious Victory...Our Bells were ringing all this day and Illuminations were ordered at this House...After dinner we paraded Stowey to see the Illuminations at the Cross...The Town was very lively and on top of Castle Hill was a Glorious Bonfire and Musick...We had a good Handsome Supper...At length a song was called for and Mr Northey blabbed that I had prepared one.&nbsp; On this I was called on, I did not relish singing a song of my own making and declined it much.&nbsp; At last I began and it took very much indeed, several bursts of applause at every Stanza and when I had finished they all rose up with Glasses in their Hands drinking my Health and clapping for some minutes so that I began to feel myself a little awkward.</p>
