<p>I have never heard the MN church bells lovelier than this morning - sounds are like fruits: a finger of frost, a warm midgy day will make or mar them; and this morning the climate was exactly right for the bells. I felt grateful to Slemeck for whatever delayed him, and kept the De-um bells ringing on alone for over five minutes.&nbsp; I also admired the fine rubato of the ringer, always in measure, but never exactly to the dot.&nbsp;</p>
