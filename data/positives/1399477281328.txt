Much commotion a morning or two ago when a large batch of German prisoners marched down the road with a band and their guard, and a little baggage train behind. Looked quite hale and hearty and very cheerful mostly. They were all going out to a prisonersâ€™ camp beyond Ambleteuse somewhere. They probably had been prisoners for a little while. Looked so well equipped and nearly all had extra luggage, boxes and bundles and parcels. A funny German brass band was playing them along in great style and quite added to the impressiveness of this march past. Wish the poor English troops had bands to accompany them to and from the Rest Camp. They look so weary tramping along that bare hard road backwards and forwards.
