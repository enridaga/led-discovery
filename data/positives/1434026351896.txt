<p>Extract from a Contemporary Notice, 1st May, 1847 - Yesterday Mendelssohn again played to us in the afternoon, and we had a small number of persons, who considered themselves very happy to share the enjoyment. Lord Ellesmere and Lady Charlotte Greville, Mr. Cavendish, his sister and aunt, Lord Glenelg, the Bishop of London, Lady Herschel and her beautiful daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone. Mendelssohn accompanied Ernest in his own composition, ' Auf Flugeln des Gesanges,'&mdash;and it was observed that he took the measure much slower than it is usually performed. He did not stay long, and departed in much emotion.</p>
