<p>At about eleven o&rsquo;clock, (Sunday,) the singing societies of Dusseldorf, together with such of the visitors as had already arrived, assembled at the Hotel &ldquo;Prince of Prussia,&rdquo; and at the railroad station near by, to receive the various societies as they came in by the different trains. When all had arrived, or at about twelve o&rsquo;clock, a grand procession was formed, numbering over sixteen hundred singers, which, accompanied by two bands of music, one at the head and the other in the centre, amid the ringing of bells, the roaring of cannon, the waving of banners, and the shrill sound of trumpet and drum, moved triumphant through various streets, to the &ldquo;Rath-haus.&rdquo; Beautiful faces were seen at the windows of the houses, and smiling and joyful countenances, and the waving of handkerchiefs, cheered the spirits of those who were already not a little excited. The square in which the &ldquo;Rath-haus&rdquo; is situated, was filled by the dense crowd, and presented a most brilliant appearance. It was everywhere decked with flowers and flags; and from its centre the statue of the Elector Johann Wilhelm, seemed to look on with approbation, participating in the general joy.</p>
