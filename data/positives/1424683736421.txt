<p>The papers and notices I sent you will inform you of my Paris debut. Here are a few details. In Berlioz&rsquo;s third concert, the aria &ldquo;Spolie Tchisto&iuml;e&rdquo; got a deal of applause. Soloieva started a bit low but soon took hold of herself. My &ldquo;Lezghinka,&rdquo; which, as you know, was written for two orchestras and arranged for one, really an enormous one, lost much of its effect and I am not sure whether it was the arrangement or the execution that made it rather unsuccessful. The result did not come up to my nor Berlioz&rsquo;s expectation. He likes this piece very much and chose it himself. In the fourth concert Soloieva did not sing so well and in the one I gave at the Salle Hertz she lost her head completely in the middle of the duet from the I Puritani and was unable to appear in the rest of the pieces. Marras saved the situation by singing the cavatina from Elisir d&rsquo;Amore, which was not on the program. He does this beautifully. Fifty-two musicians from the Italian Theatre played my things in first-rate style and they were well received, especially the scherzo in the form of a waltz. They play this everywhere and it&rsquo;s going to be published, along with my romance Il Desiderio.</p>
