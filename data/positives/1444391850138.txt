<p>Perhaps I will finish the account of the peace celebrations.&nbsp; What herd animals we are after all! - even the most disillusioned.&nbsp; At any rate, after sitting through the procession &amp; peace bells unmoved, I began after dinner, to feel that if something was going on, perhaps one had better be in it.&nbsp; I routed up poor L. &amp; threw away my Walpole.&nbsp; First lighting a row of glass lamps, &amp; seeing that the rain was stopped, we went out just before ten.&nbsp; Explosions had for some time promised fireworks.&nbsp; The doors of the public house were open, &amp; the room crowded; couples walzing; songs being shouted, waveringly, as if one must be drunk to sing. A troop of little boys with lanterns were parading the Green, beating sticks. Not many shops went to the expense of electric light.&nbsp; A woman of the upper classes was supported dead drunk between two men partially drunk.</p>
