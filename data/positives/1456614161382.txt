<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have had a working holiday at Dilizhan, a wonderful, picturesque spot in the mountains, where I re-edited the score of Schumann&rsquo;s Cello Concerto. Of course I also got to know some new pieces by my Armenian colleagues. The talented composer Alexander Arutyunian showed me the first act of his interesting opera <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Sayat- Nova</em>, which he was working on with great zest. The composer Grigory Yegiazarian let me hear a recording of his latest symphony. Lazar Saryan is working on a violin concerto. / In Yerevan I went to the opera to hear the first performance in the Soviet Union of Igor Stravisnky&rsquo;s oratorio <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Oedipus Rex</em>. / I have travelled fairly widely this year, taking part in festivals of Soviet music in Moldava and Kirghizia. My trips to these republics were very interesting and instructive. /In general, this kind of festival of Russian Soviet music should be encouraged in as many republics as possible. They are equally useful and interesting for Russian composers, who meet new audiences, and for the audiences themselves&hellip;</span></p>
