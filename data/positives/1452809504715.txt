<p>Like all true artists she [Amalie Joachim] was equally good in the simplest song as when rendering a great dramatic part like, for instance, that of the heroine in Gluck's Iphigenia in <em>Tauris</em>, a performance of which, at the Berlin Sing-Akademie in 1871, was the first occasion on which I had the honour and privilege of singing with her in public. Although she had slightly to transpose the&nbsp;part to quite suit her range of voice, her singing&nbsp;of it was a beautiful revelation of dramatic&nbsp;power and restraint, a splendid example of&nbsp;plastic modelling in expression.&nbsp;</p>
