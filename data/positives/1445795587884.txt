<p>Cold, clear and frosty. Christmas Day, Sacrament Day at my church. Went to Aisholt in the afternoon, returned to a late dinner by myself on spratts and a fine woodcock. The kitchen was tolerably well lined with my poor neighbours, workmen &amp;cc. Many of them staid till past ten o'clock and sang very melodiously. Sent half a crown to our Church Musicians who had serenaded the Family this cold morning at five o'clock.</p>
