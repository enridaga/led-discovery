Go to B.B.C Concert with Mrs. Bridge. Henry Wood makes a great mistake playing a garish arr. of Beranice ov. (Handel) before a perf of Mozart Haffner Symph. with reduced orch; which sounded ridiculously thin. Casals plays Haydn's conc. marvellously technically but does one or two things I don't like. But the treat of the evening was 2 mov. from Bach C min Suite as encore. Superb! End with Dvorak 5th Symp. This wonderful work was rather spoil by a rough perf.*
