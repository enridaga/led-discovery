Suddenly the sound of solemn music in the direction of the [Windsor] station reached us, and it was whispered “they’re coming”. Still the minute gun sent forth its charges. Now in the bend of the road, 200 yards on our left, a body of Cavalry on black chargers – the men wore helmets with white horse hair plumes. The sun, which now struggled through the grey clouds, reflected on their breastplates. The chargers paced very slowly. This was an escort of the 2nd Life Guards. Then came the military bands, with their instruments and gold lace dazzling in the sun. They numbered close to 200 instrumentalists, walking ten abreast. They wore on their arms the badge of mourning, and the greater drums were enveloped in crape, the ends only exposed. Then came the fifes and kettle drums in ranks, every drum being draped. The combined bands were playing Chopin’s “Funeral March” and weird and solemn were its notes.
