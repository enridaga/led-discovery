<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The twenty-ninth day of October the new mayor took his barge toward Westminster&mdash;my new lord mayor, Mr. Harper&mdash;with the aldermen in their scarlet, and all the crafts of London in their livery, and their barges with their banners and streamers of every occupation arms. And there was a goodly feast made with streamers, targets, and banners and arms and great shooting of guns and trumpets blowing. And at twelve o'clock my lord mayor and the aldermen landed at Paul's wharf and so into Paul's churchyard. And there met him a pageant gorgeously made with children with divers instruments playing and&nbsp;singing. And afternoon, to Paul's with trumpets.&nbsp;</span></p>
