<p>I arrived in the evening at Diss, and hearing that there was a grinding organ in the church, then a great novelty, I hunted up the sexton, and expressed a wish to see it. he lit his llanthorn, and on our way to the church informed me that he was the organist as well as sexton. With a very consequential air, he began his performance. I was pleased with the compact and solid effect &mdash; more so than with the loose style of playing I have heard from some dexterous performers. I then observed, " you play nothing but psalmody" ! He smiled, and with self-complacency said, " I play voluntaries, sir!" and immediately commenced one, which I applauded. Afterwards I was favoured with Handel's Hallelujah Chorus, with which he played the congregation out of church.</p>
