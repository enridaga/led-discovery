<p>So much recollection from my first decade of living in London from 1979 as a twenty something jostles to be included: ...: two fabulous performances of Rachmaninov's 2nd Symphony conducted by Mikhail Pletner and Yevgeny Svetlanov, both in the 90s with the Philharmonic [sic: Philharmonia?] orchestra. Each performance made a small cut in the finale. Why, I wondered to Pletner backstage. "Because those bars are silly", came the reply. It had been an incandescent performance; for the moment "the argument" won me over.</p>
