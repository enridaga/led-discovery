...I... carried my wife and Mrs. Pierce to Cloathworkers hall to dinner, where Mr. Pierce the purser met us. We were invited by Mr. Chaplin the victualler, where Nich. Osborne was. Our entertainment very good. A brave hall. Good company and very good Musique. Where among other things, I was pleased that I could find out a man by his voice, whom I had never seen before, to be one that sung behind the Curtaine formerly at Sir W. Davenants opera.
