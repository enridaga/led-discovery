" How comes it," said I to the Duke, " that chairmen are generally merrier than those they carry ? To hear&nbsp; these fellows without seeing them, one would imagine that we had the laborious part, while they sat at their ease." " True," answered he ; " and the same person might conclude, on hearing the bridegroom sing so cheerfully, that we were just going to be married and not he." We arrived in a short time at the inn at Lanebourg, nothing having surprised me so much in the passage of this mountain, the difficulty and danger of which have been greatly exaggerated by travellers, as the facility with which we achieved it.</span></p>
