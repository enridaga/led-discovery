Extract from a Daughter's Letter, Carlton Terrace: 3rd May, 1851 -
I hope you will have heard something of my mother's impression of the splendid opening of the Exhibition onThursday, the 1st—and I wish you could hear how my father speaks about it—he was so happy that all had turned out so well, that in the evening after E. and G-. had sung many  favourite pieces of Handel and Mendelssohn and Neukomn, he asked us all to join in a few verses of ' Sei Lob und Ehr dem hochsten Gut'— as the only appropriate expression of his feelings of thankfulness and entire satisfaction.
