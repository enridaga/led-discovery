Another uncomfortable experience was mine when Liszt's pupil Ratzenberger played his mater's Concerto in E flat at an evening concert at Court. Published only five years before, that now popular work had been as yet very rarely performed and was considered to be the last word in pianism. The composer only played it twice in public. Etiquette ordained the provision of a white waistcoat, and Frack, as well as my first white necktie. The Concerto calls for energetic visor on the part of all concerned, and–no chairs being permitted except for the 'cellists–we stood on a highly-polished floor. Its surface being exceedingly slippery, I was much more concerned for my feet than my fingers, but I managed to keep my balance and skated through the piece without the tumble I expected every minute in full view of the Court.
