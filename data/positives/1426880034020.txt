[Signor Rauzzini] was a native of Rome, and made his first appearance on the stage there, at the Teatro della Valle. He was a great musician, had a fine voice, was very young, and so proverbially handsome, that he always performed the part of the Prima Donna; at that period no woman was permitted to appear on the stage at Rome. His reception was highly flattering, and he afterwards performed in all the principal theatres in Italy.
