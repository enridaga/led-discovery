As long as Aunt Louisa staid, I used to walk with her to the Bristol Cathedral on Sundays, & it was an event in my life to hear & feel the choral service—which remains enshrined without rival in memory, the impression having been strengthened occasionally when at Bath I could attend the Abbey Church:—& thus I retained a store of love & veneration through long years, for that which in another place was to produce a frame of mind so very different, when on my first return to England after long absence, in 1838, I hastened on the Sunday which was the third day after being landed in England, with my dear husband, to St. Paul’s:—& came out with the consciousness that I expressed to the effect, that were there indeed nothing more edifying & devotional to be found in the Church of England, I should be driven to seek domiciliation elsewhere.
