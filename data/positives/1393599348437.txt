Having arrived at the entrance of the Menai Straits, we all left the "Victoria and Albert," and went on board the "Fairy" ... and... went into the Straits. As we entered, the view of the fine mountains with their rich verdure -- Snowdon rising splendidly in the midst -- and of the fields and woods below, was really glorious.... We passed the famous Swilly Rocks, and saw the works they are making for the tube for the railroad, and then went under the Menai Bridge, and stopped immediately on the other side. There were crowds of loyal people in steamers and boats, playing "God save the Queen," and cheering tremendously.
