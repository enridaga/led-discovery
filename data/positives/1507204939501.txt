<p>The fourteenth day of November began the knell again for the most right reverend father in God, my lord chancellor of England, Doctor Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and of the Privy Council with King Henry VIII and unto Queen Mary, Queen of England. And with a hearse of four branches, with gilt candlesticks and two white branches and three dozen of staff torches and all the choir hanged with black and arms. And a dirge sung and the morrow, Mass of Requiem. And all the bishops and lords and knights and gentlemen and my lord Bishop Bonner of London did sing Mass of Requiem, and Doctor White, bishop of Lincoln, did preach at the same Mass. And after, all they went to his place to dinner.</p>
