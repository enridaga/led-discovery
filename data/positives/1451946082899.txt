<p>In the year 1869, Wagner was staying at Lucerne,&nbsp;busy with the composition of his famous Tetralogy. His&nbsp;Bavarian Majesty, desiring to give the Saxon Master a&nbsp;birthday treat such as would delight his soul, specially&nbsp;engaged the famous French stringed quartet (Messrs.&nbsp;Maurin, Colblain, Mas, and Chevillard) which at that&nbsp;time enjoyed the reputation of interpreting Beethoven's three last quatuors with supreme intelligence and felicity. Early in the morning of the 22nd May, Wagner's&nbsp;natal day, these executants were introduced into the&nbsp;composer's house, by the connivance of a member of his&nbsp;family, about an hour before he had risen from his bed.&nbsp;They softly tuned their instruments and took up a position in his breakfast-room, awaiting his appearance to&nbsp;strike up. What was his astonishment and pleasure&nbsp;when he came down to breakfast as usual in his duffel&nbsp;dressing-gown, to be received by the strains of a composition for which he entertained profound admiration and&nbsp;reverence &mdash; one of the Posthumous Quartets &mdash;performed&nbsp;by artists of such surpassing ability! For a few seconds&nbsp;he stood, as though turned to stone, mouth and eyes&nbsp;alike wide open; then, suddenly recognising Maurin,&nbsp;whom he had known and frequently heard in Paris, he&nbsp;rushed up to him with open arms and embraced him,&nbsp;fiddle and all. The French musicians spent the whole&nbsp;day with Wagner, during which they played at least a&nbsp;dozen quartets for his delectation. He, on his art,&nbsp;feasted them right royally, and during dinner proposed&nbsp;two toasts in eloquent language &mdash; one to "his Royal&nbsp;benefactor," and the other to "the greatest of French&nbsp;musicians, Camille Saint-Saens."&nbsp;</p>
