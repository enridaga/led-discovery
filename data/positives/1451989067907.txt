<p>But Viennese opera-goers and concert-frequenters&nbsp;alike, though constituting in many respects ideal&nbsp;audiences from the artist's point of view, have one&nbsp;extremely unpleasant and objectionable characteristic in&nbsp;common. They become fidgety and fussy shortly after&nbsp;nine o'clock p.m. Up to that hour their demeanour is&nbsp;exemplary. The singer or player, at least, if expert in&nbsp;his function, has no reason to complain of it; for his&nbsp;hearers are attentive, sympathetic, and ever ready to&nbsp;give tongue to their approval at the opportune moment.&nbsp;But, with a few exceptions &mdash; the sum total of which does&nbsp;not amount to five per cent, of an average musical&nbsp;audience &mdash; they are bond-slaves to a baneful tyrant who&nbsp;rules the middle-class Viennese with an inflexible and&nbsp;undisputed sway. Their bondage begins to weigh upon&nbsp;them with peculiar oppressiveness at the hour I have&nbsp;referred to ; they become more and more nervous and&nbsp;uneasy with every minute added by the clock-hand to the&nbsp;record of fleeting time ; no spell of music's magic has&nbsp;power to restrain them from making rustling noises,&nbsp;shuffling their feet, and scraping their chairs along the&nbsp;floor, and finally, if the performance be protracted for as&nbsp;much as a quarter of an hour beyond the time-limit in&nbsp;question, from quitting their seats and hurrying out of the theatre or concert-room with a precipitancy that is&nbsp;manifestly prompted by dread of their dire despot.</p>
