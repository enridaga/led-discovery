Hank Crawford had joined our band [in 1958]. He played baritone and took down songs and arrangements which I dictated to him. I was writing the same then as I do now, the same way I wrote for Joe Anderson in Florida [in the 1940's], the only way I know how: I see and hear the chords in my mind…  I keep a sound picture in my head…

Soon Hank learned exactly how I work. He played very good jazz and blues himself, and he turned out to be my first musical director.
