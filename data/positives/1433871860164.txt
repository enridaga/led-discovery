<p>So the first I heard of the New Orleans style was on records. The next I heard were Wilbur Sweatman's records on Columbia. Also there was the winter in of 1917 when I made a tour down to New Orleans and heard the New Orleans music in the city itself. We only stayed a week. I was in high school at the time. I heard Johnny Dodds at Tom Anderson's. And I heard Piron, Mutt Carey, Clarence Williams.</p>
