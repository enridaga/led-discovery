I feel very strongly Berlioz's want of melody, rhythm, phrasing, and contrapuntal proportions. I have heard his overtures 'Francs Juges' and 'Benvenuto Cellini' performed with full orchestra, but his effective instrumentation could not compensate, in my judgment, for the loss of the qualities I have referred to, especially in passages where he attempts to be melodious and poetical, but lapses into prose.
