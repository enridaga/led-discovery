[D]ined at Lord Waldegrave’s; then to the opera. Imagine to yourself for the drama four acts   entirely unconnected with each other, each founded on some little history, skilfully taken out of an ancient author, e.g. Ovid’s Metamorphoses, etc., and with great address converted into a French piece of gallantry. For instance, that which I saw, called the “Ballet de la Paix,” had its first act built upon the story of Nireus. Homer having said he was the handsomest man of his time, the poet, imagining such a one could not want a mistress, has given him one. These two come in and sing sentiment in lamentable strains, neither air nor recitative; only, to one’s great joy, they are every now and then interrupted by a dance, or (to one’s great sorrow) by a chorus that borders the stage from one end to the other, and screams, past all power of simile to represent. The second act was Baucis and Philemon. Baucis is a beautiful young shepherdess, and Philemon her swain. Jupiter falls in love with her, but nothing will prevail upon her; so it is all mighty well, and the chorus sing and dance the praises of Constancy. The two other acts were about Iphis and Ianthe, and the judgment of Paris. Imagine, I say, all this transacted by cracked voices, trilling divisions upon two notes and a half, accompanied by an orchestra of humstrums, and a whole house more attentive than if Farinelli sung, and you will almost have formed a just notion of the thing. Our astonishment at their absurdity you can never conceive; we had enough to do to express it by screaming an hour louder than the whole dramatis personae.
