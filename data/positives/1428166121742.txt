<p>The magnificent theatre, La Pergola, was open at this time ; during the spring season, it was considered the first in Italy. Here I first saw our old favourite, Rovedino, perform with the prima donna La Morichelli, and excellent they both were, in Anfossi's comic opera, " II Viaggiatore Felice." There was another theatre, a small one, La Via del Cocomera, in which Morelli had often delighted the Florentines with his magnificent bass voice, which, take it for all in all, was the finest I have ever heard.</p>
