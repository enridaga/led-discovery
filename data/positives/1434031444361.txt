An extract from a Contemporary Account, Berlin: 6th August, 1848-
Here, where one was as much used to hear the calling out of guards to salute the passing members of the Royal Family, as in England to hear the ringing of bellsâ€” now to perceive no such sound is very strange. And as to the literature of the day, the ancient lime-trees are pasted full of all kinds of street literature, and at every corner is a board where old women sell the last publications in that class ; besides which, hundreds of street boys are for ever roaring out the news. Almost every evening large gatherings of the mob take place, ' unter den Linden,' before the University, &c., when the citizen-guard makes its appearance, and with sound of drum requests ' gentlemen ' to go home; which ceremony and noise continue till near midnight.
