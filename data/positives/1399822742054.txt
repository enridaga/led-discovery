Besides sending Instructors to the camps, we advertised ourselves and our classes at the School.... 'Come and Learn how to Write a Story,' and under that head I read or told how the few best stories in English had been written. 'French' did not need to be camouflaged as everybody... wanted to learn it....'German' at this stage nobody wanted to learn.... Then there was the singing class. No shyness to come forward here. The Base Commandant led the way and the entire Base seemed ready to follow him. It is not often you get the chance of yelling louder than your Commander and not being punished for it. So the choir grew and multiplied with a will, both as regards numbers and lung power, until in the end we had to borrow a hall for it, as no single room in School - to our relief - would hold the singers.
