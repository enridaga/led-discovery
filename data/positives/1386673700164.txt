I heard a sweet new instrument called the celestinet, the improvement, if not the invention of Mr. Mason the poet. His gentlest muse is not more harmonious and pathetick. I know your sister will long, as well as yourself, to have it described, but that is past my skill. I can give you a sketch, but not a finished piece. The shape is that of a short harpsicord, with the same sort of keys, and played on only with the right hand in the same manner; and at the same time you draw with your left hand a bow like the bow of a fiddle, that runs in a groove under the keys, and by proper management presses on the wires and brings out a delicate, exquisite sound, something between the finest notes of a fiddle and the glasses. It is not above 2 feet long and 1 foot and a half in the broadest part, where the keys are, which are placed on the top of the instrument in this manner. It is set on a table, and is best accompanied with a piano-forte or harpsicord. Mr. Mason plays charmingly, with great expression. I must own tho' that Handel's majestic musick is too deeply implanted on my soul to suffer me to delight (in general) in modern flimsy Italian music.
