Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Tuesday in Whitsun-week -
Trinity Sunday. â€” The King has expressed to me his 'wish' that I should remain till the return of Mendelssohn, 10th August, that I may work upon him to execute the idea of the King as to the cathedral choir of Berlin. He has
named Mendelssohn Director-General of Sacred Music in the whole monarchy, and desired to hear only the highest and most genuine style of choral singing, with compositions ancient and modern. Mendelssohn declares his interference impossible. The King says, ' He ought not to be withheld by the cry against catholicising, which should be despised.'
