Neither, however, achieved any notable success, or made any very durable impression. M. Barroilhet was the favourite and admired baritone of the Academie of Paris. On the boards of the Parisian grand opera his reputation was immense. As the king in "La Favorita," and the mad monarch in Halevy's opera of "Charles VI&rdquo;, he had been proclaimed without an equal. </span></p>

Moreover, the role of "Nottingham" (though originally composed for him) was less favourable to his style than the parts in which he obtained repute in Paris. He appeared in two operas only, and then returned to France to recruit his failing health. </span></p>

She obtained, it is true, a share of approbation; but it was only moderate.</span></p>
