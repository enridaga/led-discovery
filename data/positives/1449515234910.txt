<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">It was in the early 1950's, when I was in my mid-teens that I discovered 'classical'music. My first visit to the RFH was in late 1952, for a recital by the tenor, Lugui Infantino.&nbsp; It seemed that all of Italian London turned up and emotions ran high.&nbsp; The encores lasted longer than the official programme.&nbsp; What a night! There were other, for me, memorable firsts. My first 'Four Last Songs', sang by Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, and, in the same programme, my first Brahms 4th - the Philharmonia conducted by Karajan(20.06.56). A couple of weeks later, my first Verdi Requiem, with Schwarzkopf, Tagliavini, Stignani, Modesti and conducted by Guido Cantelli(06.07.56). I think this might have been the last time Cantelli conducted in London; shortly after he died in an air crash. That concert was another first for me - the firstime I paid more than &pound;1 for a concert ticket - that against my weekly wage of a little under &pound;8.&nbsp; But worth every penny!</p>
