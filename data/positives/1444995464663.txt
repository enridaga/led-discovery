The overture is full of comic and original passages, the airs are very pleasing and far from common. If he has any fault &lsquo;tis in repeating passages too often even to 5 and 6 times, which is like driving a nail into a plaistered wall &ndash; the 1st 2 or 3 strokes fix it better than more - for after that number it either grows loose or recoils &ndash; this an energy is often given by reiterated strokes on the tympanum, but too often repeated they cease to make an impression and seem to obliterate those already given.</span></p>
