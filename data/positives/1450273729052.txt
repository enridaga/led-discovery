<p class="MsoNormal">In 1853, Madame Sontag came to Boston with a brilliant company, Carl Eckert being the conductor. When the Sontag party first arrived in America they had with them the fine boy violinist, Paul Jullien. I think he was about fifteen years of age at that time. He played mainly Alard and Leonard pieces, and played them very brilliantly. When the company had made a limited concert tour, attended with indifferent success, it was reorganized into an operatic enterprise and the boy violinist returned to Europe. I think his career was closed by death.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I remember distinctly Sontag in her best role, &ldquo; La Fille du Regiment&rdquo; She was a most attractive picture in her <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">vivandiire</em> costume, with the drum hanging from her neck by a &ldquo; sling,&rdquo; and as she was a good drummer she won enormous success. She was certainly a fine actress and an excellent singer.</p>
