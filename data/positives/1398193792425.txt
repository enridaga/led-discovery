<p>Wednesday 7th December ... Heard Daddy's fifth symphony after tea, and I think it is my favourite. It seems much more gay than the first 4 and with an exuberance of themes. However, the next is filled with even more! Every other phrase has a curious effect on me. They seem to turn something inside; an experience I am not able to describe.</p>
