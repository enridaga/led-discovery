But in the field of music we are never, in the long run, judged on the basis of one movement, one work, one recital. Every musical statement of ours fulfills two functions: It embraces to some extent (for better or worse) the immediate job of communicating music to the people in front of us, and it also becomes a unit in those many performances-spread over the years – on the basis of which our “rating” is computed. We know that this rating of a player’s stature is the resultant of the innumerable reactions of innumerable persons to innumerable performances. / When we hear, say, Casals, and tell ourselves: “Tonight he has given the full measure of himself,” we are in fact applauding not only tonight’s performance but all the fragments of his performing past that we have been fortunate enough to glean. Our enthusiasm is also colored by much of what fellow-enthusiasts has passed on to us. And a third factor may be the cumulative effect of being constantly reminded of the influence of style-formers, like Casals, in the playing of younger and lesser players, disciples of theirs, whether pupils or not.
