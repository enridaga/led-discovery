When a master is a master and has continually, on every occasion, honoured and respected Art, we must honour and respect him also, whatever divergence there may be between the line he has followed and ours. Wagner could use the same argument against me if he knew whom I loathe [probably Rossini] so much, but I shall guard agains telling him. When I hear or see certain pieces by that coarse master, I content myself with clenching my teeth until I return home and am alone, and then I relieve myself by heaping curses upon him. People are not perfect.
