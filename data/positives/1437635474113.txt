Subjects for extemporaneous fugues were mutually given and worked out. No living British organist surpassed Ouseley in this now rare art. As you know, he would treat a fugal theme in its various contrapuntal possibilities, introducing 'in version,' 'augmentation,' 'stretto,' etc., if either device were feasible, and never abandoning legitimate style. I know of very few published fugues by Englishmen better than some of his improvisations. Instances of his accuracy of ear have no doubt been mentioned to you. His certainty as to keys was well-known. Sharing with him, from my childhood, this useful gift, I may say that frequent opportunities occurred of testing his accuracy, and of comparing 'notes' during divers musical performances</span></p>
