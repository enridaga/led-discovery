The first time I heard Duke Ellington was at the Kentucky Club in New York, where he had come in with the five-piece band he had been appearing with in Washington D.C. ... I think the number that caught my attention that night was "Black and Tan Fantasy". When I learned that it was Duke's composition, I immediately recognised that I had encountered a great creative artist--and the first American composer to catch in his music the true jazz spirit. 

Shortly after that, when I was producing a new show for the Cotton Club, I built as much of it as possible around Duke's band and his musicâ€¦I had complete faith in Duke Ellington and firmly believed that together we were launching something more than just a dance orchestra.
