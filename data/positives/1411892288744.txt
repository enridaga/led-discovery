<p>It was on 22 May 1982 that I achieved a lifelong ambition to hear in person Horowitz. This was due to Prince Charles who brought him over from America to give a concert in aid of the Royal Opera House development appeal. The audience, a discerning one of musicians, gave him a standing ovation as aged 79 he bounded onto the stage , no display of emotion, it was all in the music, incredible technique and wonderful tone in the Scarlatti, Chopin and Schumann. All too soon it was over and he held up three fingers for three encores. To have been first present at his first performance in Europe for over 30 years was a memory of the Festival Hall I shall never forget.</p>
