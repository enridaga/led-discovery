I don&rsquo;t believe a finer Lieder singer ever lived. People&rsquo;s opinion used to differ about his voice, but real musicians were unanimous about his splendid interpretation of German music. Rubinstein once put off a performance of one of his works because Von Zur M&uuml;hlen was not able to sing in it. To hear him interpret Schumann and Brahms was a perfect revelation. To my intense delight he took up a great number of my German songs, and I can only say that I adored the way he sang them. He sang with splendid rhythm, with such pathos, such deep feeling, and often with such real ecstasy, that it was quite impossible for any musician not to feel enthusiastic over him. And it was delightful, perfectly delightful, to rehearse with him. No trouble was too great &mdash; he would try effect after effect till he got the right one.</span></span></p>
