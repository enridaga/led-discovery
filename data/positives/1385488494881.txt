Yesterday I was at the rehearsal of the new opera composed by Handel: I like it extremely, but the taste of the town is so depraved, that nothing will be approved of but the burlesque. The Beggars' Opera entirely triumphs over the Italian one; I have not yet seen it, but everybody that has seen it, says it is very comical and full of humour; the songs will soon be published, and I will send them to you.
