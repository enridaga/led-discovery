<p>On one memorable occasion Rubinstein and Wieniawski did me the honor to spend an evening at my house in Boston. A right royal musical evening it was, shared by about fifty artist and amateur guests. We made much music,&mdash;beginning with Rubinstein&rsquo;s String Quintette in F, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">op</em>. 57. Then we had the Rasoumoffski Quartette in F, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">op</em>. 57, by Beethoven, with Wieniawski playing first violin. Then the Schumann Piano Quintette, with Rubinstein at the piano. Oh, it was a joy to take part with such a man and in such a work! and how Rubinstein did spur us on by his passionate way of playing some of the great parts! his power was fierce and tremendous. I think we all revelled in the sea of sound we made about us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the Quintette, Rubinstein played a lot of choice solo pieces, ending the evening with the Chopin Polonaise in A flat, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">op</em>. 53, in which comes the wonderful passage for the left hand in octaves. He began the phrase very soft, then the &ldquo;little-by-little <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">crescendo</em>&rdquo; was most admirably done, finally reaching a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">fortissimo</em> power which was quite colossal. It stirred us all up, and set even the chandelier to jingling in sympathy, and possibly in admiration.</p>
