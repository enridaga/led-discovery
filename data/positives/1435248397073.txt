<p>We have just come back from what is almost certainly the last Church Parade in England of the 11th Brigade. There was a Celebration this morning, in the big C. E. tent for the first time, at which I dare say sixty attended. The week before in the little tent there were six. The 10.00 service was not quite the best, as we hadn't the brass band of the 10th but only their fifes; and these, besides, sounding a little shrill and unstately, played far too slowly. However, there we stood, singing the same chants, making what we could of 'Onward, Christian Soldiers' and 'Fight the good Fight' and 'Praise to the Holiest'.</p>
