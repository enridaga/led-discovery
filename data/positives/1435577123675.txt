<p>Incredibly good concert in the orchard last night. One Baynes (late C.U.B.C.; he rowed against me) is now our M.O., and very remarkable he is: he is one of those men who sing like birds, and swim, and dive (WITH somersaults), and do a lot of shouting, and are very good, in fine. You should have heard him take 300 men clean off their feet with 'Songs of Araby' last night; an old, old friend, of course, but I never saw it so effective. Nor any one so priceless as the modern R.F.C. man: he is perfectly immaculate, salutes all officers, and drills like a guardsman. He was much in request at the concert.</p>
