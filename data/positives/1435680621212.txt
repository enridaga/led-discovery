As with my other ballets, I made an orchestral suite from the music of ‘Le Baiser de la Fee’, which can be played without much difficulty by reason of the restricted size of the orchestra required. I often conduct this suite myself, and I like doing so, all the more because in it I tried a style of writing and orchestration which was new to me, and was one by means of which the music could be appreciated at the first hearing.
