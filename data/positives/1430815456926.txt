Some German and some English symphonies and overtures have no vitality; an orchestral Fantasia, with a printed explanatory programme, containing 'Conspiracy, Revolution, and Deliverance,' is fit for a melo-drama in a suburban theatre; one symphony and a couple of overtures are better, but nothing much to speak of; not one of them found a place in the programme of the eight concerts given this year.
