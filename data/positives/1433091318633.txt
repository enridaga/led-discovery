<p>Sullivan relinquished the direction of the National Training School in 1881, but I by no means lost sight of him. He lived in Victoria Street, close by me, at Westminster, and would frequently come down to the Abbey when we did one of his anthems. Having been educated as a chorister, with much the same training as myself, he had an intimate knowledge of the requirements of Church music, and although he had chosen a path outside the ecclesiastical world, he retained his skill in organplaying. On one occasion, when hearing him play at a wedding, I was delighted with his powers of extemporisation, which were called forth by the late arrival of the bride.</p>
