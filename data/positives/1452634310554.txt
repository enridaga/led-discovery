<p>On another occasion I brought him [Ignace Mascheles], for his&nbsp;criticism, a pianoforte composition of my own&nbsp;of which he had accepted the dedication.&nbsp;After he had made a slight change or two I&nbsp;asked him if I now should play to him the&nbsp;corrected version. "My dear sir," he said&nbsp;with a smile, "there's no need of that, I hear&nbsp;it all in my mind's ear-- I really must tell you&nbsp;a little story about that. When I wrote my&nbsp;concerto with three kettle-drums"-- he seemed&nbsp;to feel a particular pride and satisfaction in&nbsp;remembering this then almost unheard-of boldness and revolutionary innovation-- "when I&nbsp;wrote my concerto with three kettle-drums, I&nbsp;came to a 'tutti' which I wanted rather fully&nbsp;and noisily orchestrated. Well-- will you&nbsp;believe, I heard that tutti and the noise of the&nbsp;different instruments so distinctly whilst I was&nbsp;writing it, that-- <em>that I got a headache!</em>".&nbsp;</p>
