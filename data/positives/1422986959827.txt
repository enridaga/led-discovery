More scoring in morning & evening. Practise as usual only 2.30–4.0 with Lauricella in N.S.M. We do the Beethoven Vln concerto, which he plays really very well. Listen, in evening on a rather poor wireless, to Mozart’s Jupiter Symphony, Even then it was magnificent, especially the exhilerating & gorgeous last movement. What a marvellous man Mozart is! (It was from the Prom.).
 
V. good lesson with Benjamin 12.20–1.0. Practise in afternoon at N.S. of M. & go afterwards to Augeners to get Music.
