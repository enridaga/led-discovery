The Nuns had lighted Tapers in their Hands, and wore black transparent Veils. The Abbess took the Crucifix; and the rest follow'd in procession into their Choir behind the Church. Here they sung their Hymns and Anthems, which we heard in the Church. Among the rest, the admirable <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Guinsana</span></em> signaliz'd herself, who has been famous above these thirty Years; and continues still to charm, unseen. Two other Nuns in this Convent, <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">Palazza</span></em> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><em>Doria</em>,</span> are likewise much esteem'd for their Voices, and fine Manner of Singing. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
