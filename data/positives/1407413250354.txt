By and by with my Lord Brouncker by coach to his house, there to hear some Italian Musique; and here we met Tom Killigrew, Sir Rob. Murray, and the Italian Seignor Baptista - who hath composed a play in Italian for the Opera which T. Killigrew doth intend to have up; and here he did sing one of the acts. Himself is the poet as well as the Musician, which is very much; and did sing the whole from the words without any Musique pricked, and played all along upon a Harpsicon most admirably; and the composition most excellent. The words I did not understand, and so know not how they are fitted; but believe very well, and all in the Recitativo very fine. But I perceive there is a proper accent in every country's discourse; and that doth reach in their setting of notes to words, which therefore cannot be natural to anybody else but them; so that I am not so much smitten with it as it may be I should be if I were acquainted with their accent. But the whole composition is certainly most excellent; and the poetry, T. Killigrew and Sir R. Murray, who understood the words, did say was excellent. I confess I was mightily pleased with the music. He pretends not to voice, though it be good but not excellent.
