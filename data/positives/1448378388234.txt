It was his first appearance since 1939 and he was too old to come again. It was perfection - from the moment he came on the podium via a special platform made for his aged legs. The audience standing in respect for his many great years of music. He was such a mesmerising and vital inspiration for the special hand picked Philharmonia. He transformed three old war horses into something fresh and inspiring. Surely the greatest events in RFH history.</p>
