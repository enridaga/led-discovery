<p>The Music Center is truly marvellous &ndash; a wonderful set up in heavenly country and such a fine group of students and teachers. I was there the first week but already the place had such spirit and atmosphere. Most congenial, and stimulating to a degree. My Alleluia had been sung to perfection at the opening exercises, so my entrance into the place two days later was not so awkward as it might have been. I went to several of the Institute (&ldquo;professional&rdquo; students) Orchestra rehearsals, which gave its first concert on Friday night of the first week, opening (if you please) with a certain E minor Symph, led by Leonard Bernstein, student from C.I.M.[Curtis Institute of Music] I confess I enjoyed this privilege because it was really a fine performance. Most of all I relished watching Koussevitzky sit directly behind the student conductors at all rehearsals, criticizing them at every turn. He has proved himself a fine teacher and &ndash; still more surprising &ndash; a most skilful administrator of the school. His outlook is very broad and he seeks at every turn to do equal justice to the professional and non-professional students. There is no doubt in my mind that he has come out with a permanent institution of the greatest value and importance. It preserves the best in Mr. Surette&rsquo;s Summer School, with an added plus of a fine performing group, the presence of members of the B.S.O and facilities of all kinds &ndash; little operas, masques, plays, large choral works, and a situation that is simply beautiful. You must go up, and so must the Giddings.</p>
