<p>Going out for a morning walk on the 30th, whom should I meet but my friend Spohr - a good omen! Our joy on meeting was mutual, we were a long time together, and sauntered on the Boulevard des Italiens. Later in the day I accompanied him to the Palais Royal, and in the evening we heard 'Don Juan' at the Italian Opera, given, to my surprise, in its integrity; Fodor was a charming Zerlina, and all the others good.</p>
