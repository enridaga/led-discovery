<p>To hear him [Franz Liszt] play his own compositions or arrangements in private was almost to hear him extemporise.&nbsp;When performing them in public, I believe he usually&nbsp;adhered to their printed text ; but in the salon or club-room (as when I listened to him during a soir&eacute;e given&nbsp;by the German Club at Rome, in December, 1869),&nbsp;surrounded by intimate friends or approved musicians,&nbsp;he could seldom resist the temptation of trying experiments in the way of treatments or cadences, and especially delighted in surprising those familiar with his piano-forte works, by interpolating therein new episodes or novel&nbsp;effects. I particularly remember hearing him dealing in&nbsp;this irreverent and startling way with his admirable transcriptions of <em>Faust</em> and <em>The Flying Dutchman</em>, to the&nbsp;rapturous astonishment of all the pianists present, who&nbsp;were "note-perfect" in those <em>chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</em> of mechanical contrivance. Upon the occasion referred to, Cardinal Haynald, Liszt's dearest friend and the companion&nbsp;of his boyhood &mdash; himself, moreover, an excellent pianist&nbsp;&mdash; who, like myself, was standing close to the piano,&nbsp;threw his arms round his illustrious fellow-countryman's&nbsp;neck, kissed him on both cheeks, and then, turning to&nbsp;the electrified group of listeners, exclaimed, "Was there&nbsp;ever such a God-gifted creature, so fertile in invention,&nbsp;so strangely enabled to realise in sound the beautiful&nbsp;thoughts that incessantly surge up from the depths of&nbsp;his soul to its surface? We must all reverence as well as&nbsp;love this great man, recognising in him an elect recipient&nbsp;of Divine favour, grace, and inspiration!"That night was an ambrosial one, ever to be&nbsp;gratefully remembered by those who were privileged to&nbsp;participate in its delights.&nbsp;</p>
