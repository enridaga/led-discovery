<p>One evening we did the show [<em>Beiderbecke and all that Jazz</em>] in Hull, at the Spring Street Theatre...Alan Barnes was unavailable - 'I've got a better gig at less money', he explained - and depping for him was Nigel Hitchcock, a young tenor player and a ferocious exponent of the post-bop tradition.</p>
<p>One of the pieces the band always played was a more or less straight-ahead version of 'Jazz Me Blues'. As Nigel was about to play his solo, Kenny [Baker] wandered over and murmured, gently but firmly: 'Play it like Frankie Trumbauer'.&nbsp; The Spring Street performance also has a unique place in the history of broadcasting.&nbsp; It was recorded by the BBC and later transmitted on Radio 3's <em>Jazz Notes.</em></p>
