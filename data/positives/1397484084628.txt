Sister Chesters went to Abbeville with Matron yesterday afternoon, so Sister Banham was on all day and she and I had great time together after dinner.... We got the gramophone going in the ward and the men shouted choruses with very lusty voices, 'Down where the breezes blow - Oh-oh-oh-o-o-oh' was our favourite refrain and we all got quite giggly and foolish.
