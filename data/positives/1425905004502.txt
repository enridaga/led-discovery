<p>Pixis [...] invited me to drop in after lunch as he had asked Klengel to come at that time. We actually met on Pixis's stairs and I listened to him playing his fugues for two hours. I did not play myself although they asked me to. He plays quite nicely but <em>(entre nous</em>) it might be better.</p>
