<p>I had enjoyed&nbsp;many opportunities of becoming well acquainted with Roumanian music and minstrelsy... Of the many roaming minstrel-bands with&nbsp;which it was my good fortune to foregather in the course&nbsp;of my own successive wanderings...between the years 1865 and 1875,&nbsp;the " brotherhood " submitted to the sway of Nick the&nbsp;Moldavian, was in every respect the most remarkable.&nbsp;It consisted of eight performers, each of whom could&nbsp;play more than one instrument, and with really extraordinary ability, whilst one and all were tuneful and&nbsp;passionate singers. I first came upon them, very late at&nbsp;night, in a summer-garden, the abode of vociferous frogs,&nbsp;myriads in number, and never weary of croaking batrachian part-songs in every vocal register, from the gruffest&nbsp;of basses to the shrillest of trebles. Thither some of my Boyar friends conveyed me, to sup under the dark&nbsp;blue canopy of a Roumanian midnight sky, and to hear&nbsp;the best minstrelsy in all the land. As we were sitting in a bosky nook, dimly lighted by one stearine candle,&nbsp;defended from the breezes by a crystal sheath, we&nbsp;became aware of dusky faces peering in upon us from&nbsp;among the rustling green leaves. It struck me, I&nbsp;remember, that if the owners of such ominous physiognomies earned their daily bread by honest means, Dame&nbsp;Nature must have done them a cruel wrong. The situation seemed precarious; suddenly the frog-choruses&nbsp;themselves, to my ear, acquired an intolerably menacing&nbsp;vehemence. Whilst I was anxiously scanning those&nbsp;dingy visages, in the faint hope of detecting a ray of&nbsp;mansuetude in at least one gleaming eye, they all broke&nbsp;out into meriy smiles; off went a fiddle with a humorous flourish ; tink-a-tank twangled the double-necked&nbsp;guitar under the deft fingers of Niko Moldovean&ucirc;l ; a&nbsp;fiutey tooting revealed the presence of Pandean pipes,&nbsp;uncommonly mellow in quality ; and Nicolai Terranul&nbsp;(Nicholas the Peasant), a slender young Tsigan, with&nbsp;crisply curled black hair, and eyes like dark brown&nbsp;opals, stepped forward, bowing with all the grace and&nbsp;ease, of a practised courtier, and sang one of the gayest&nbsp;predatory ballads of his repertoire in a throstle-throated,&nbsp;truly admirable manner. The "Peasant" and the "Moldavian" could both&nbsp;fiddle distractingly well, besides singing in such sort as&nbsp;to stir the heart and charm the ear, and playing the&nbsp;ciombolan&ucirc; &mdash; a sort of upright zither, plucked at with a&nbsp;plectrum &mdash; quite inimitably. To either of them a page&nbsp;of printed notes would have been about as intelligible as&nbsp;a chronological brick from Mesopotamia. Of their comrades, one in particular &mdash; a withered gipsy, exactly the colour of an ancient copper kettle, with revolving wild&nbsp;eyes &mdash; was the original genius of the "brotherhood."&nbsp;His instrument was the fiddle, upon which he could&nbsp;imitate exactly the tones of the flute, Paudcans, and&nbsp;three-holed reed &mdash; the genuine Dacian peasant's solace&nbsp;and only musical " familiar." This incomparable sound-mimic was, moreover, a composer and improvisatore,&nbsp;extravagantly proud of his compositions, which seemed&nbsp;to me the ravings of insane tonality, though there was&nbsp;unquestionably " method in their madness." When he&nbsp;extemporised, his "brothers" accompanied him by ear&nbsp;and intuition, hitting off the just harmonies with a surprising prescience of the most improbable melodic transitions. In all his rhapsodies there were real tunes,&nbsp;cast in the oddest of rhythms, but correct in form and&nbsp;intelligible enough to a quick musical ear. The copper-&nbsp;coloured, wizened Tsigan had queer ways of his own.&nbsp;His ordinary attitude in the company was retiring, not&nbsp;to say furtive ; but when he detected appreciativeness in&nbsp;his audience he would edge his way through his fellows&nbsp;to their front, jerk his chin down upon his fiddle like&nbsp;some extremely aged and supematurally wily bird, roll&nbsp;his eyes, wink, and grin a saffron grin. Then, dropping&nbsp;his bow lightly on the strings, he would conjure there-&nbsp;from, with the supplest of wrists and most exterous of&nbsp;fingers, such weird sounds as I, for one, have never&nbsp;before or since heard produced from any combination of&nbsp;wood, catgut, and horsehair.&nbsp;</p>
