<p>I started playing around 1924. Never could afford to go in, but would listen outside the Friar's Inn [Chicago]. Then at Columbia Hall, where Muggsy [Spanier] played, Johnny Lane was clarinetist and had an orchestra there. I liked that kind of music. The others would go to dance, but my brother, Marty, and I used to listen to the band, and hear them jam.</p>

<p>Most of the playing I did in those days was for nothing--I just stayed up all night and did so much sitting in, they didn't have to pay me. I got to know about the different styles--Rappolo was finest clarinetist I heard on records; never heard him in person, he was working in some high-class joint that I couldn't afford. Teschemacher I was just crazy about, but he never made any records that did him justice. He had a good tone and terrific technique. But Noone was the man who gave me the biggest kicks--holding the horn over that great belly of his and playing just like it was nothing.</p>
