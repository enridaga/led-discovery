We artists assembled for the funeral at nine o'clock in the morning, in the house of Sir G. Smart, and the procession moved on to the chapel in Moorfields. After the usual service, Mozart's Requiem was sung. Then twelve musicians (myself among the number) carried the body into the vault, while the funeral march from Handel's 'Saul' was played. Those solemn strains touched all of us most deeply.
