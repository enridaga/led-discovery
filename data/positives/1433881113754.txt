M. Guynemer had married the sister of the celebrated Baillot, first violin to the King of France, and after they were settled, the leader of the Concert Spirituel paid us a visit at Leicester. During his stay, which was more than a month, we had a carnival of music, such as had never taken place before in a country town. I was then in possession of eighty four quartettes of Haydn, sixteen of Mozart, and twelve of Beethoven. These, from day to day, furnished us with an entertainment, the most refined and elevated in the musical art.
