November 11th was a day to be remembered. We received the news of the Armistice at about 12:20 and the Band turned out and played the National Anthem and popular national airs. After that everybody or nearly everybody celebrated in the accustomed fashion and most of the Battalion were in bed at 5:00. The few left enjoyed a good dinner in the Mess to the accompaniment of the Pipers and Band.
