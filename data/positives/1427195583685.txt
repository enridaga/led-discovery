A few days after having made the acquaintance of Chopin, I heard Liszt for the first time at one of his concerts, and went home with a feeling of thorough dejection. Such marvels of executive skill and power I could never have imagined. He was a giant, and Eubinstein spoke the truth when, at the time when his own triumphs were greatest, he said that, in comparison with Liszt, all other pianists were children. Chopin carried you with him into a dreamland, in which you would have liked to dwell for ever ; Liszt was all sunshine and dazzling splendour, subjugating his hearers with a power that none could 
withstand. For him there were no difficulties of execution, the most incredible seeming child's play under his fingers. One of the transcendent merits of 
his playing was the crystal-like clearness which never failed for a moment even in the most complicated and, to anybody else, impossible passages ; it was as 
if he had photographed them in their minutest detail upon the ear of his listener. The power he drew from his instrument was such as I have never heard 
since, but never harsh, never suggesting ' thumping.' His daring was as extraordinary as his talent.
