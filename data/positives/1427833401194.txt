<p>I also performed the 'Serenade in A'. At the Conservatoire we often played the Piano Concerto, transcribed for two pianos. My student days hold another memory of a work by Stravinsky &ndash; the excellent opera 'The Nightingale'. Of course, my acquaintance with it was made under &lsquo;fatal&rsquo; circumstances: during an exam on reading scores. I&rsquo;m a little angry with the opera for that. It was like the Spanish Inquisition &ndash; a cruel sight. But I managed somehow and conquered The Nightingale.</p>
