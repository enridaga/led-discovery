That this debut was successful could not be gainsaid. With a fine person, a voice of excellent natural quality, considerable brilliancy of execution (slightly defective perhaps in finish), and energetic powers as an actress, the new prima donna displayed much to justify the warmth of her welcome, and the amount of encouraging applause which followed upon it. Still, the impression made by this great favourite of so many continental audiences was neither strong nor permanent; so hard was it to struggle with advantage against the absorbing prestige which surrounded Jenny Lind.</span></p>
