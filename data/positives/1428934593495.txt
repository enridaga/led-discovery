The C minor symphony of Beethoven, for the first time here; and immediately after this sublime work, this food for the gods, a variation for the flute, a violin concerto, and several airs. Besides this Mozart's G minor symphony, and to conclude, an overture by Romberg - a programme which I write down now, that I may never forget it.
