<p>Rode to Asholt in the afternoon and the Church full, met several persons from all parts going to the burial of the old shepherd which they thought would be in the morning. I returned and dined and then both of the corpses were brought.&nbsp; Old Shepherd May from Quantock House and his wife and such a crowd before I never saw here.&nbsp; I had the Service at five in the afternoon purposely to prevent any infection spreading if there was any and to keep the people from being present but this alas was to little purpose.&nbsp; However I hope all is well.&nbsp; It is said there were no less than four hundred people at Church. After this business was over I retired but must observe that in Church there was best singing I ever heard. The Trumpet shall sound and the Dead be raised was quite sublime.</p>
