<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Living in London in my twenties late 1958-1962 and working at London's County Hall from 1965-1989 supplied me hearing recitals [sic] in the RFH, especially on the Wednesdays at 5.55pm. Foremost were the Bach works played by the blind Helmut Walcha. Ralph Downes, designer of the instrument, reappeared as player until the late 1980s, including in the 1985 commemorating [sic] Bach's birth in 1685. Always I allowed myself time to enjoy at the caf&eacute; at ground level looking over the Thames, notably as the sun disappeared behind the Houses of Parliament.</p>
