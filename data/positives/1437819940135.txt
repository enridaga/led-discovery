He seems at Naples to have met SCARLATTI and played one of his adagios in C major instead of C minor. On discovering his error, he was so much annoyed, that he left the town immediately. He was very sensitive to rivalry, and had the mortification like most great executive musicians who go on too long to see younger artists preferred to himself.</span></p>
