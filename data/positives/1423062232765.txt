In July we gave seven performances of Die Entführung - known to almost everybody as Mozart's Il Seraglio but produced, of course, at Glyndebourne in the original German. We played seven performances of Così fan Tutte as well, with Fritz Busch and Carl Ebert making it very much the pre-war Glyndebourne once more; but it should be recorded here that we all knew that the lavish productions that had been made possible only with the help of John Lewis Ltd. It was all so perfect and so unsparing.
