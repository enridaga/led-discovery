<p>Listen to an Ansermet Concert from B.B.C. at 9.5. H. Perkin plays Ireland's 'Legend' with orch. - an attractive idea, but he hasn't the creative power or technique to do it - tho' there is fine atmosphere in parts of it. Also Debussy - Jeux (Nigensky) - not super Debussy, but very interesting &amp; attractive, with wonderful scoring &amp; colouring.*</p>
