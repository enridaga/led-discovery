On the last occasion Joachim, our favorite, was there; Felix accompanied him in his violin Concerto, and both played the music by heart; afterwards Felix let us hear some 'Lieder ohne Worte,' written by his sister Fanny. Although close imitations of his own, they are interesting, and treated in a genuine musical spirit. He then played us that part of the 'Elijah' where the widow invokes the prophet's help. It has been remodelled, and I must confess that the part of 'Elijah' acquires more dignity and importance than it had at the performance in Birmingham, where I considered the whole work already perfect. The angel trio is now really lovely.
