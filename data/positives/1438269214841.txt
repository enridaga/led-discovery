<p>F.B. (who phones about 9.0) conducts at light L.S.O. concert at 10.20. A lovely show of Ravel Pavane (d.I.) &amp; Tsh. very entertaining Cap. Italien. The orch. hadn't settled down in the Rim. Korsakov ov. May night. Anyhow it is rather a scratch lot of players. Massenet's Sc&eacute;nes Pittoresque - quite amusing.*</p>
