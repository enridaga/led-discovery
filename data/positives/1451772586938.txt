<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">On Sunday I turned on the radio and heard one of my favourite pieces of music. It was part of the regular puzzle concert, in which the titles of the pieces are announced only once the work has been performed. Music-lovers (and there are many millions of them in our country) are invited to guess which works they are listening to and so test their knowledge of music. Quite often, these &lsquo;puzzle concerts&rsquo; are compiled by the listeners themselves. From year to year the programmes are growing more and more complex and diverse, testifying to the increasing musical awareness of the people and to their growing cultural demands. </span></p>
