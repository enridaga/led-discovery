Shostakovich, his wife and I went to the Maly Opera to see the ballet 'Coppélia'. After the performance, Shostakovich said: ‘I love Delibes’s ballet music. It is written with such taste and refinement, as well as mastery. Tchaikovsky greatly admired it and went so far as to say that it was much better than his own 'Swan Lake'.’
