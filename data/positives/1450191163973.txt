<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have not heard a live performance since 1958, when I conducted a piece of my own on a programme with it; but I have <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">never </em>heard a balanced one. The &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; notes stick out wrongly in the &lsquo;apocalyptic&rsquo; opening chord, despite recording engineers, nor can all of their periphonic faking pick up the string-figuration in the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&lsquo;Seid umschlangen</em>, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Millionen!</em>&rsquo; the failure being not electronic but musical. Yet the greatest failure is in the &lsquo;message&rsquo;, hence, if you will pardon the expression, in the &lsquo;medium&rsquo;. For the message of the voices is a finitude greatly diminishing the message of the wordless music. And the first entrance of the voice is a shocking intrusion. The singer is as out of place as if he had strayed in from the prologue to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Pagliacci.</em></span></p>
