<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 10.1px;">I</span>n 1956, a friend and I, both about 15 and brought up in North Wales were staying with my friend's aunt and uncle in Sevenoaks. Our day in London took in 'Reach for the Sky' at the Piccadilly Odeon in the afternoon and a late night concert in the RFH. The band playing in one of the smaller concert rooms was the Mick Mulligan Band&nbsp; featuring George Melly as vocalist.The second half of the concert was broadcast on BBC radio at 11:15pm, but as the last train from Charing Cross left about then we stayed only for the first half during which George Melly sang all the risque songs not allowed on the BBC. We ran as fast as we could across the Hungerford footbridge to catch that train naively hoping that we might have heard the end of the concert on the radio when we got back. That visit to RFH is lodged in my memory and in later years we have found the RFH to provide a welcome refuge from the general rush and bustle that is London.</p>
