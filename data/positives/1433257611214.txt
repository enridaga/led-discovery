<p>I never will forget one other time, at the Chess Records studio, Robert Lockwood, Jr., and Luther Tucker was getting ready to do a Little Walter session. The song was "Temperature." It goes, "My baby gives me a high temperature." People who know Lockwood know that he was a creator and innovator of a lot of those sessions. He said to Luther, "Man, this might be something here." But Luther said, "Yeah, man, but instead of me playing that, how about faking it?" So Lockwood looked at him hard and said, "Hey, man, we're not faking nothing here! Today we're playing!" So Luther finally got into his head how Robert wanted the music to go, and he played it. That was one of Walter's biggest sellers.</p>
