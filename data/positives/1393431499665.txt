How shall I describe to you my astonishment, I might say my pleasure in sadness, when, on entering yesterday evening at 6 o’clock the room closed throughout the day, then brilliant with the Christmas tree, I was greeted by the soft organ tones to which I was accustomed on the Capitol, and afterwards in Carlton Terrace, sounding forth from a hidden corner the ‘Pastorale’ of Händel and then the German ‘ Chorale,’ to which the voices of twenty children and many others, those of Frances and Theodora and Sternberg prevailing, intoned the Hymn itself! I could not help thinking, in the midst of these pleasing sounds, of the fine organ enjoyed so many years, left behind in England with so many other treasures. But when I turned to ask whence came the organ now heard? to whom belonging? of whom borrowed? Frances met me with the card containing your name and kind greeting, and then the pleasure became as great as the surprise. For the orgue expressif was our own, and it was your present—your Christmas gift! After the greater part of those present had retired, we again enjoyed the organ and Theodora’s playing, full of soul and feeling—to no one more delightful and surprising than to her husband. Then we had ‘He shall feed His flock ’ of Händel, sung by Theodore.
