In M Camp I acquired an extraordinary facility in issuing the mighty rum ration.... The indefatigable dear Worley held up his candle, or turned on his pocket torch, as I stood at the door of each billet, and it was rare that anyone went short. The precious drops were fairly distributed, and when all was done Worley would prolong my visitation, in defiance of military principles, by luring me into his tent to join a party of old stagers whose bread and cheese was the emblem of an unforgettable kindness. And there was an occasion or two in which Cassells and myself were the guests of those good souls at a veritable banquet. An estaminet by St. Jans ter Biezen was then the scene of much music, much champagne and a dinner of the best: thereâ€™s no higher honour to come.
