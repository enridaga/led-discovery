<p>[W]hen the time came to do the show [at the Lafayette Theatre, New York], he came into the pit with me. I didn't know it then, but he had hidden a trumpet there, and when some blues singer (I just can't remember her name) began to sing, Joe [Smith] played. And the people started to howl. I'm telling you, I couldn't play another note that night!</p>
<p>He came to the theatre every day after that band I helped to make him read and he really could play anything. [&hellip;] Joe had such a big soft beautiful sound.&nbsp;Bessie Smith was just crazy about his playing and he was on lots of her records later on.</p>
<p>There's one other musician I'd like to mention. He was SO good. That's Hilton Jefferson. I don't know why people don't appreciate him--one of the finest saxophone players I ever heard. His record of "Who Can I Turn To" with Cab Calloway is so beautiful.</p>
