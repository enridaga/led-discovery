<pre>ONE of the proudest moments that I can recall in my early Norwich life was my <br />being presented to Mr. (afterward Sir) Julius Benedict, who officiated as <br />conductor of the festivals from 1842 until 1878, when he was succeeded by the <br />present conductor, Mr. Alberto Randegger. By the light of subsequent experience,<br />I learned to realize that Benedict was one of the worst conductors who ever held <br />a baton. His head was invariably buried in his score; his arms were ever <br />uplifted, as though seeking a higher level than the shoulder-joints naturally <br />permitted. He rarely gave a cue until it was too late to be of practical value; <br />and he entirely lacked the magnetic power and the sense of ensemble that should <br />be the primary gifts of a good conductor. But at the time I am speaking of these 
deficiencies were noted only by the few. The vast majority of East Anglian <br />amateurs, including my youthful self, were satisfied to look upon Sir Julius 
not only as a great conductor, but as a musician whose cooperation brought <br />honor and glory to the festival. Was he not the favorite pupil and friend of <br />Weber? Had he not, when a young man of twenty-three, seen and shaken hands with <br />the immortal Beethoven? 

I have been introduced to Verdi and Gounod; I have known and spoken with Wagner; <br />but, great as those privileges undoubtedly were, I do not think they aroused in <br />me the same feelings of mingled pride and awe that I experienced when, as a boy, <br />I was first addressed by a man who had stood face to face with Beethoven.</pre>
