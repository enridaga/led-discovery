<pre>The next musical piece I produced at Drury Lane was in conjunction with Mr. <br />Dusseck, the celebrated piano-forte player ; he composed the serious part of it, <br />I the comic. What he did, was masterly and effective. The piece was entitled, 
"The Captive of Spilburg;" the story from the French piece, "Camille ; ou, le <br />Souterrain;" it was ably managed by Prince Hoare, and had a run of seventeen <br />nights.</pre>
