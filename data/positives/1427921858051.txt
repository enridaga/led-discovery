Voroshilov loved choral singing. He sang himself, he was a tenor, and that’s probably why he felt he was as much a specialist in music as Zhdanov. He longed to give valuable advice to composers and performers. His favourite works were Ukrainian folksongs. He used to sing them with his puny tenor voice. One of my actor friends told me how he sang with Stalin, Voroshilov, and Zhdanov after a reception. The soloists of the Bolshoi modestly sang along with the leaders. A horrible dissonance hung in the air. Stalin conducted – he wanted to command even here. Of course, they were all quite drunk.
