<p>From the top of the tower may be seen one of the grandest and most interesting scenes in the world. I determined to have at least one song in honour of King David before descending. Selecting one of the most beautiful psalms, the 121st, "I to the hills will lift mine eyes," I began to sing at the top of my voice, using the grand old tune, " Belmont." The soldier, not acquainted with that kind of performance, and perhaps never having heard a sacred song in his life, rushed up to where I stood, looking quite alarmed. I knew that he could not understand a word of what I was singing, so I kept right on to the end of the psalm. Coming to the conclusion by this time that I was not likely to do any special damage either to him or to myself, the guard smiled and tipped his cap as I finished. By tipping him I returned the salutation, and then we passed down into the Street of David.</p>
