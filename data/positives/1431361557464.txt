It was a Saturday morning when Rankl whose days as Musical Director were then numbered, introduced Kleiber to the orchestra and scurried away. I could not help wondering for a moment whether it would all be as I remembered. Would the magic still work? How would the new players react to him? I could not help thinking of the anti-climax after Beecham's return. I need not have worried; he had the orchestra in the palm of his hand from the first movement. Even a hard-bitten old cellist who used to grind away down at the bottom and didn't care for anyone said to me with shining eyes: "I wouldn't have believed I could enjoy a Saturday morning rehearsal so much! And he finished half an hour early!"
