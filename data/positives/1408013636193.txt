Very windy & rainy all day, so only go out after breakfast with Caesar, & after tea with Pop, Beth & Caesar up north end via Morlings to pay for “Hear my prayer”, which we have chosen after much discussion and now with many misgivings. 2 Astles, 2 Phillipps, Ethel Boyd, & Mrs. Owles come in to sing Beethoven rounds after supper. We have a very hilarious time, if we don’t give very perfect performances of these lovely little creations! I play 2 movs. of Beethoven op. 10 no 3. & a Prokoview prelude. Bobby & Marjorie go to a dance.
