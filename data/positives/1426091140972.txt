[Performance of Angela] Wolkow sang and acted very well indeed the role is one that she simply had to play and she hit it off perfectly. Perhaps it's the way she uses her eyes rather than her throat that will appeal to the public. Once or twice she goes up to D with purity and assurance. I don't doubt that she will be more popular than Gladkowska. The quintet went splendidly and the General [Director of the Theatres] was beaming.
