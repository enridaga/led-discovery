After dinner I listen to Prom on wireless - British Programme. Delius' marvellously beautiful, tho' meandering & too long. Song of the High Hills, completely dwarfs the rest of the anemic programme - Cyril Scott's dismal Noel, Elgar's typical Sea pictures & Ethel Symth's "Aubrey Brain". Vl & Hrn. Concerto.*
