<p>On the 12th of September we left Wakefield, to commence the winter campaign on the 15th at Old Drury ; and on the 23rd of September, 1787, Mr. Linley revived his musical piece of " Selima and Azor," with splendid scenery and decorations. Mrs. Crouch was inimitable in Selima she looked and acted the character to admiration, and sang the favourite rondo of u No flower that blows, is like the rose," in a manner to secure a nightly encore. The music, though in a different style from Gretry's, so renowned all over the Continent, was very appropriate and pleasing.</p>
