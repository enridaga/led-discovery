    ...Joe smiled and said, “Sonny Dunham is rehearsing a new band at Nola’s. Be there tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m..."....
     Sonny was famous for his trumpet solo on “Memories of You,” with “Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Band.” Sonny’s band was known as a training ground or feeder system for the best big bands in the country: Stan Kenton, Harry James, Gene Krupa, and many others....
     Sonny played both trumpet and trombone. “Take out ‘East of the Sun,’” he said, as he called out the first tune. It was a four trombone feature with Sonny playing the lead. The writing was beautiful and I was impressed, especially after hearing Sonny play. He was a first class trombonist. I was inspired after we played another tune called “Robins’ Nest.” The band was sensational, the most alive and modern group I’d been associated with.
