At Tul Keram the train decided it would not go any further that day. We took things quite philosophically, however, and found a tent in a rest camp hard by and made ourselves tolerably comfortable. A group of Tommies sitting by the railway line and full of railway optimisim were singing a music-hall ditty, something about "Watching the trains come in." They were led by a humorist, mimicking the conductor of an orchestra, in pukka low comedian style. He sang solo parts and raised his baton dramatically to bring in a chorus. And a right noisy chorus it was too. It went something like this: -

Solo: Watching the trains come in,
Watching the train come in,
There we were sitting hand-in-hand,
As only lovers can understand!
(pp.) Watching the trains come in,
(Cres.) We could hear the porter shout,
Full Chorus: And when we had watched all the trains come in
(fff) We watched all the trains go out!
