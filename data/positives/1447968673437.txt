<p>Shortly after the alarming experience above recorded,&nbsp;I was sent on a brief mission to Berlin, where a young&nbsp;Austrian diplomatist, himself an amateur pianist of the&nbsp;very first order, and one of Carl Tausig's favourite pupils,&nbsp;introduced me to that truly great teacher...Tausig was good enough to play to me&nbsp;several times, at his own apartments and in the Bechstein repository of pianofortes, where some of the finest&nbsp;instruments in Europe were always at the disposal of&nbsp;masters of the craft But that his playing lacked inner&nbsp;warmth &mdash; whilst teeming with superficial fire and sparkle&nbsp;&mdash; I should incline to rank Tausig as one of the three&nbsp;greatest pianists to whose marvellous achievements I&nbsp;have ever listened; placing him immediately after Liszt&nbsp;and just a little to the front of Rubinstein.</p>
