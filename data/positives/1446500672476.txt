<p>On the following Tuesday, accordingly, I was in my accustomed stall [at the Hofoper] at seven precisely, &nbsp;[for a performance of Lohengrin (Hohe-Preise)]&nbsp;just in&nbsp;time to see my friend Carl Eckert take his place at the&nbsp;conductor's desk and look over his acolytes with a circular and severely-inquiring glance before executing the&nbsp;smart double rap that never failed to concentrate their&nbsp;attention upon the tip of his ebony baton [...] As was, and I believe still is, always&nbsp;the case on a Wagner night, the house was crowded&nbsp;throughout; fashion in the side-boxes and dress-circle;&nbsp;science and dilettantism in the stalls, abundantly provided with spectacles and full scores ; various grades of&nbsp;the musical bourgeoisie in the three tiers of upper boxes,&nbsp;and a host of appreciative proletarians in the cheap and&nbsp;capacious gallery. By the time the overture had come&nbsp;to an end every place available to the general public&nbsp;was occupied, and the temperature had risen to its customary tropical degree of elevation. "If this," I found&nbsp;myself thinking, "be the result of the new ventilation&nbsp;system, the Emperor, save for the honour of the thing,&nbsp;might just as well have saved his money." Had the&nbsp;audience been exclusively composed of orchids they&nbsp;could not have been more congenially accommodated in&nbsp;the way of atmosphere. Henry the Fowler, however,&nbsp;had scarcely taken his seat under the shade of the Justice Tree, the public having meanwhile settled down to&nbsp;enjoy and perspire in compliance with hallowed Hofoper&nbsp;traditions, when suddenly piercing jets of iced air invaded the house from every direction simultaneously.&nbsp;The effect in the stalls was that of a lively breeze; persons located higher up in the house described their&nbsp;experiences to me subsequently as varying between a&nbsp;moderate gale and a circular wind-storm of no inconsiderable violence.&nbsp;</p>
