<p>Jan. 24, Chelsea Music Club, Grinke Trio, Lisa Perli</p>
<p>The Grinke Trio though competent enough hasn't any particularly outstanding qualities and I am inclined to think that the violinist (F[rederick] Grinke) is a little inferior to his cellist (Florence Hooton) and his pianist (Kendall Taylor). Certainly his tone was a little rough at times while Miss Hooton&rsquo;s was generally smooth &amp; rich. The Brahms <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trio in C. op. 87</span> never seemed to come properly to life and the andante con moto might almost be said to have dragged its slow length along. The other work they played was Ravel&rsquo;s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Trio in A minor</span> which I have never got hold of properly or found specially attractive. I don&rsquo;t think it was a bad performance but it did not strike me as being particularly good.</p>
<p>After each trio Lisa Perli (who took, at short notice, the place of Dino Borgioli, indisposed, himself a substitute for Bruce Boyce) sang a group of songs. It is a long time since I heard or saw Dora Labbette but I think her hair has changed its colour with her name. The hair is now a light auburn or dark-gold. I doubt whether opera singing has been good for her singing of songs tho&rsquo; it may have improved her voice production. It is not a very full voice tho&rsquo; it can ring out. I thought I detected a trace of unsteadiness now and then. She began with Duparc&rsquo;s lovely <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Phidyl&eacute;</span> followed by four of Faur&eacute;&rsquo;s of which the best (or best sung) was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apr&egrave;s un R&ecirc;ve</span>. Her second group consisted of 7 songs by Delius which do not call for comment.</p>
<p>On the whole it wasn&rsquo;t quite so good an evening as one usually gets at these concerts &amp; the audience, notably smaller than usual, visibly diminished before and during the last group of songs</p>
