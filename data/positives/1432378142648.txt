At David's we heard him play a pianoforte arrangement of his Fantasia on the 'Prophet,' originally written for the organ. Hans v. Balow played the pedal part in the bass. The first and last movements consist of violent and stormy Fugues; I prefer the middle one with its quieter subject. He also played his very piquant waltz in A flat major, introducing many overstrained effects by first using the soft pedal, and then suddenly introducing strongly accentuated notes.
