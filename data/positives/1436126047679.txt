<p>Mrs. Crouch and I were engaged at the Edinburgh Theatre, during the Leith Races; I had a letter from my Apicius, Tate Wilkinson, asking us to stop and play one night at Leeds, on our way thither, which we did. "The Siege of Belgrade" drew an excellent house ; we spent a very pleasant evening, and picked up a little loose cash to pay turnpikes.</p>
