[O]ur farewell concert in the evening...went off splendidly, and was a glorious finish to our season here. There was not an available standing-place in the whole of that big Town Hall (larger than the Manchester Free Trade Hall), and many hundreds had to be turned away. It was an exciting evening, and no one can wish for greater 
ovations than those that were accorded us. We sent to the hotel a whole cab-full of beautiful flowers, amongst them a large lyre in violets and white flowers from the Victorian orchestra, which we esteem highly. It was an evening to be remembered, and we may be sure of a good reception if ever we come back to Australia. The feeling of satisfaction when we sat down to our supper, surrounded by our flowers, was very pleasant, and sent us to bed tired, but happy.
