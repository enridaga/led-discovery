Neukomm's arrival in Berlin was generally welcome. Felix and I heard his oratorio, the 'Ten Commandments' in the Academy, as well as the 'Crociato', given for the first time on the birthday of the Crown Prince. Unfortunately the Crociato himself was quite hoarse, but Frau Kraus Wranitzky was excellent as Palmyra - the men nothing to speak of; choruses and scenery splendid.
