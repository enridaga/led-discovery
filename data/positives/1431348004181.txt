And here’s an opposite example, Hindemith’s music. It’s published and recorded but there’s no great interest in listening to it. Yet once his works had a great impact on me. Hindemith is a true musician, a serious one, and a rather pleasant man. I knew him slightly, he played in Leningrad as part of a quartet. He made a nice impression. And his music is like his personality; everything is in place, well put together, and it’s not merely craft, it has feeling and meaning and content. It’s just impossible to listen to. The music doesn’t spark, it doesn’t spark. But gypsy songs, damn them, do. Work that out.
