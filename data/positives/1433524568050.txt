<p>Of course Bunk Johnson deserves credit for what he used to do. He had marvellous ideas and I used to like to hear him play. He wasn't quite the drive man that Joe Oliver and Freddie Keppard were, however. He always stayed behind the beat instead of getting out there in the lead like those other men. Bunk was good, and he was solid when he was playing. Bunk had plenty of competition on his way up and he never was the king down there.</p>
