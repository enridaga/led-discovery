Mr Woerlitzer, pianist to His Majesty the King of Prussia, has been here for the last two weeks. The young fellow plays quite nicely. He is Jewish and hence learns very quickly. He has a thorough grasp of the few pieces he let us hear. He has been to see me. He is really still a child he's sixteen. Moscheles' Variations on Alexander's March is his show-piece. It seems to me he plays them perfectly, leaving nothing to 
be desired. He has twice appeared in public and each time played these Variations. When you hear him you will be pleased with his playing although, entre nous, he is still far from justifying the Court- title which he bears.
