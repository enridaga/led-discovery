<p>Only a few weeks before His Majesty's death, Mr. Elvey took his choir, by request, to the Castle, to perform selections from the "Messiah." On every desk he placed a card, giving full directions for the performance, to avoid all confusion ; thus showing, even at this early period, his great attention to detail. One of these is still preserved as a relic by Mr. William Corden, who played the violin on this occasion. Queen Adelaide was delighted with the music, and frequently beat time to it with her hands, but its effect on the King was so soothing, that he slept peacefully during the greater part of the performance. Shortly after, His Majesty presented his portrait to Elvey, a gift which was highly prized as a memento of his kind benefactor.</p>
