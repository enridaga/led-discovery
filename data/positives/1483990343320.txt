<p>The concert was at seven o'clock in the evening, a glittering affair, one of the subscription concerts with an audience as rich as it was bored. But the Concerto was a success and I got three curtain calls. Afterwards there was supper in a club with about fifteen people. I was told that someone in the hall had been displeased by the castanets striking up in the second subject of the first movement. 'What's the point of that?' he asked. His neighbours, who obviously knew a little of my biography, explained: 'He has a Spanish wife.' Terrific!</p>
