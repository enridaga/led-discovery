Lesson with Benjamin 12.30–1.0. Arrange about practice at New S. of Music [the RCM’s new practice studios] in aft. & go on to Augeners to buy some music. Go to Prom. (Brahms) in evening with Peter Floud & his sister. 3 Magnificent works – orch. moderate – Haydn Var. – Concerto no 1. (Myra Hess – v. creditable & moving performance) & the glorious 3rd Symphony. After interval Myra Hess plays the Symphonic Var. of Franck. Delightful work (quite[crossed out] his masterpiece), equally delightfully played. Considering the diff. between this & the Brahms. M. Hess did splendidly.
