The great Elizabethan, Restoration, and later periods were amply represented, and I believe that the event which gave the greatest satisfaction and earned unstinted praise then, and afterwards in the German press, was the special Service in St. Paul's under the care of the late Sir George Martin. His highly-trained choir offered such strikingly fine renderings of Gibbons, Purcell and Byrd that the eulogies were richly deserved.
