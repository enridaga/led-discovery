<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Furtw&auml;ngler, when I played my<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> Piano Concerto </em>under his direction in Leipzig and in Berlin, was at the height of his reputation (as &lsquo;the last of the great tradition&rsquo;, though old-timers contended that he was the first of the small). He conducted it wretchedly, even worse than Kussevitsky at the premi&egrave;re, which surprised me because other musicians of his and still older generations had guided the orchestra without difficulty.</span></p>
