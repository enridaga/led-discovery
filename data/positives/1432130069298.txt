Soon after dinner, we made our way to the Small Hall of the Philharmonia, where Yevgeny Nesterenko sang the Michelangelo Sonnets, to my mind with great feeling. The whole audience rose to its feet and applauded the composer. Afterwards, before returning to Moscow, Shostakovich said: 'Nesterenko sang well, I might even say powerfully, but I think he has more work to do on this piece. It is far from simple.'
