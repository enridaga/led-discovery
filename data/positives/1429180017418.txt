<p>The first opera I saw [at St Benetto] was Orpheo and Euridice. Orpheus was performed by Rubinelli, a native of Brescia ; his fine contre-alto voice has never been surpassed, and he was an excellent actor as well as a sound musician. The prirna donna was Signora Banti, who had just then returned from London, where she had been engaged at the Opera House. As many of my readers doubtless remember, she had a finely marked countenance, and a noble soprano voice, but was no musician. The difficulties arising from this deficiency she obviated by an extraordinary quickness and niceness of ear, perfect intonation, and strong feeling. She played Euridice finely. The music of this opera was by Bertoni ; one duet between Banti and Rubinelli was almost the most exquisite treat I ever received. Two such voices I never heard before nor since. When a superior contre-alto voice and a fine soprano unite in a duet, nothing can surpass the effect !</p>
