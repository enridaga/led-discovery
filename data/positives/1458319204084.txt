<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">When I saw <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Carmen Suite</em> at the Bolshoi Theatre, I was simply astounded by Rodion Shchedrin&rsquo;s brilliant transcription of Bizet&rsquo;s music. It is like an original piece of music and is worthy of a place alongside the best transcriptions by Liszt and Busoni. Outwardly, everything is so simple in Shchedrin&rsquo;s transcription: none of Bizet&rsquo;s melodies are changed, merely the accents are shifted- strings and percussion instruments naturally and smoothly replace the singers&rsquo; voices and full orchestra&hellip; At first, I know, many people found Shchedrin&rsquo;s experiment impudent, almost blasphemous. But what have we got? &ndash; a fine ballet, in fact a great new success for Soviet music&hellip; Let&rsquo;s have more of these experiments!</span></span></p>
