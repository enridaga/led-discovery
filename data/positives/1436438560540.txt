<p>I remember a cantata of his called Undine, in which Madame Clara Novello took her farewell of the British public. It was performed at St. James's Hall, and she sang, as always, most beautifully, and her voice seemed as fresh as ever; but, as she had married an Italian Count, and was well off, there was no need for her to remain any longer in the profession. I was present at this interesting concert and heard the great ovation accorded to this most charming singer, who had to bow repeatedly to the audience before they would let her go.</p>
