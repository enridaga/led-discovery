<p>At half past 3 o&rsquo;clock we attended the church of St. Martin&rsquo;s (Episcopal). The congregation was small, and was (as we supposed from the application of almost every one who came in to the Beadleship for a seat) composed mostly of strangers. The service was dull and monotonous, no one appearing to manifest any other interest than a desire to get through. The chanting, however, was an exception, and was of a character somewhat new. It was almost exclusively instrumental, being performed on the organ. Of course, we could find no fault with the articulation of words, or the rapidity of utterance, since the pipes appeared to do their best. But voices could not be heard in this part of the service with the exception of &ldquo;Gloria Patri,&rdquo; in which there was a feeble attempt at vocal effect. It may be well for congregations who do not wish to be at the trouble of opening their mouths and speaking forth God&rsquo;s praises in the &ldquo;Venite,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jubilate Deo,&rdquo; and other canticles, to confide the matter wholly to a faithful instrument; for, under a master&rsquo;s hand, it is always sure.</p>
