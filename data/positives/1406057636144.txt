The next item was the Monn.

There was a scraping on chairs as the orchestra readjusted to make room for Jackie as the soloist. Piers adjusted the microphones. The atmosphere was electric. Suddenly the church was packed with Jackie and expectations. This was the orchestra’s big moment, too, and they were in it now. They played their introduction. Jackie took a deep breath, and she was off. The church’s flint walls seemed to bulge and the woodwork throbbed. Although the Monn is a relatively light-weight classical work, Jackie played it as though it was a great romantic concerto, with colossal passion and power. The audience was inwardly gasping with the intensity and thrill of her sound, and the lift of her playing. There was total concentration in that little church, and for those twenty-one minutes nothing else existed in the world except Jackie and her miraculous playing. 

She transported everyone to an unknown paradise.
