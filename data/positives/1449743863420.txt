<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My abiding memory is of attending the 5.55 pm Wednesday Organ Recitals in the 1960s. I was a teenager, working in the City and I would go straight from the office. What a privilege to hear some of the youngest organists of that decade who were later to become virtuoso recitalists of international renown.&nbsp; I will never forget the now Dame Gillian Weir giving her first RFH recital after taking first prize at the St Albans International Organ Competition. Or sitting almost next to Ralph Downes who designed the RFH organ; or of Dr George Thalben-Ball, tut-tutting at a young up-coming organist who played in stockinged feet. Those recitals introduced me to a lifelong love of the organ, its music and recitalists. Incidentally, I will be devastated and totally gutted if the RFH Harrison &amp; Harrison organ is not reinstalled in its entirety! Brian Longman</p>
