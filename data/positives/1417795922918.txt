     My first reaction to Sonny’s trumpet playing was negative. I didn’t care for his sound and what I considered a nanny goat vibrato. How wrong I was! After a couple of nights, I realized he was a fine player and was amazed with his creative ideas. He’d switch from trumpet to trombone with ease and after awhile I loved to hear him play both horns.
