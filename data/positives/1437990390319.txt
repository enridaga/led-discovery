On taking the baton he turned to the musicians and - "This is the last time I shall ever conduct.' "Why?" they asked. "Because I shall soon die." This was not at all his usual mood; he spoke sometimes of living till ninety he said that he could hardly finish the work he had in his mind even then.</span></p>
