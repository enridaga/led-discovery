Midnight May 8th 1970…….a darkened auditorium ……an expectant hubbub from the audience….then onto the stage he strode…..SINATRA! The worlds greatest entertainer….. With Count Basie and his orchestra…..and he gave the most amazing musical performance I have ever witnessed....The climax with "My Way" ..... the audience slowly leaving . The Hall in SILENCE ....realising they had seen and heard a musical genius at his peak....just wonderful!
