<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">As a child of 12, on a school trip from Bristol to the Festival of Britain, I was completely awestruck by the whole thing.&nbsp; I remember seeing the Festival Hall building and, without knowing what it was, thinking how different it was from any building I had ever seen before.&nbsp; Little did I know how familiar it would become in later years and how many happy hours I would spend there enjoying concerts and events.&nbsp; Long live the Festival Hall!</p>
