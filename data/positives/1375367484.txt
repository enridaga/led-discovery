There was some excellent music at the Duchess of D[evonshire]'s. A Madame Vera, who was on the stage, but is now married to an Italian gentleman, and is quite a lady in mind and manners, sang delightfully. She has one of those deep toned voices so rare in a woman, and which I admire so much. Perhaps a critic might have said her voice was rather too coarse.
