The work has all the great qualities which one knows and loves in Spohr: beautiful treatment of the subjects, admirable modulation and instrumentation, but there is a want of novelty in the leading ideas, and I should like more episodes and contrasts; so much unity leads to monotony. It may satisfy the harmonist, but there is too much sameness throughout. The orchestra played zealously and 'con amore,' but the work was only moderately applauded.
