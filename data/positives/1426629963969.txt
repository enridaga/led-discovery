I wrote to you about a concerto by Chopin that is the one Karl was playing with Chopin last Friday [25 November] when a visitor was announced. It was the Hanoverian ambassador. "Oh ! come in," said Chopin, and Baron Stockhausen flung himself into Chopin's arms and gave his hand to Karl, whom he had met at Count Apponyi's. He had become an admirer of Karl's and asked Chopin to let the lesson proceed. He enjoyed the concerto so much that when we were all at Count Apponyi's that same evening he pressed us to give the Count an opportunity of hearing it. Chopin came in shortly afterwards and had to promise that the concerto would be played at his house on Monday during Karl's lesson. And so the Count and Countess, their son and daughter-in-law, their daughter, 
the ambassadors of Saxony and Hanover, Baroness Rothschild, the great Meyerbeer, etc, came to hear the concerto. Karl played alternately like an angel and like a little devil. Everyone was delighted: dear Chopin touched and flattered, myself happy, and Karl dignified and serene. The most striking moment was when Meyerbeer took him in his arms: this was more impressive than all the embraces of ladies, ambassadors, etc., who gazed wide-eyed at each other and flung 
themselves on Karl. Mr Rothschild adored Mm and tries to win him away from our ambassador, I need hardly say that the Rothschild ladies have invited us. ... Anyhow it was a great day and you may judge how Karl is progressing and what a lofty position Chopin occupies.
