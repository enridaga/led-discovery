On the morning they were sailing, I went all haywire and hysterical - I had to do something. I knew I couldn’t go down to Dover, nobody did, because they’d been rushed, being pushed out, quickly, so I went to see a girl friend and we danced and danced and tried to clear the depression away. There was a street organ in the road and it was playing the latest songs and one of them was “Baby Doll” and it began:

Listen, my honey love to my tale of woe 
Listen, my honey love I just love you so
I’ve been looking around
Ho, ho, guess what I’ve found 
I found a honey bee buzzing round my hat 
It’s been a-stinging me from the very start,
Stinging with love that is almost a pain 
Come, honey, let me explain 
You’re my baby doll 
You’re my baby doll.

And we were dancing in the road and letting ourselves go, and having a lovely time, but then when that had gone, the gloom came down again because the boys had gone that day, they’d embarked for France.
