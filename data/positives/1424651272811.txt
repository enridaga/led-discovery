I can write you no more significant news about music in our dear Vienna than that Beethoven finally gave his long-awaited concert. He astonished everyone in the most amazing manner since everybody feared that after a loss of hearing lasting ten years he would be able to produce nothing but dry, abstract, unimaginative compositions. His new symphony [the Ninth], to a great extent, breathes forth such a fresh, lively – indeed, youthful – spirit, and as much strength, novelty and beauty as anything else that has ever come forth from the brain of this original man. Moscheles and Kalkbrenner have earned all the glory here that they deserve, and everything else is pretty much in statu quo.
