<p>Amongst the many great musical professors at this time at Naples, was the celebrated Schuster. He was the favourite scholar of the renomme Hasse, Maestro di Cappella to the then Elector of Saxony. Schuster, though a very young man, had been sent for from Dresden to compose for Pachierotti, at the theatre St. Carlo. The opera chosen was Metastasio's " La Didone abbandonata." I recollect his taking me to a rehearsal, which was a crown and sceptre to me in those days. The opera was received with enthusiasm, particularly the rondo, sung divinely by Pachierotti, " lo ti lascio, e questo addio," which was afterwards introduced in the musical entertainment of " The Flitch of Bacon, "with the English words, " No, 'twas neither shape nor feature," adapted to it by my worthy friend Shield. La Didone drew crowded houses, but the rondo was the magnet ; indeed, Pachierotti's singing it, was supposed to have raised a violent flame in the bosom of La Marchesa Santa Marca, one of the most beautiful women of the Neapolitan court.</p>
