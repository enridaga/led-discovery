<p>On the establishment of infant schools in Leicester, I was requested to furnish the young aspirants with some simple songs, suitable to their understanding and voice, and I had the satisfaction of hearing the four little songs... sung with spirit and pleasure. It was obvious that the children comprehended both the words and the music, and entered into it with all the enthusiasm of a hundred professional performers. Slight as this tuition is, it will awaken a sense for harmonious sounds in the rising generation, and do much towards laying the foundation of a more general taste for music in England.</p>
