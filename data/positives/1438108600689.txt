<p>After dinner listen to an excellent studio performance of Hansel &amp; Gretel from Huizen, complete of course. What Heavenly music this is - perfectly done. I simply revel in it. Some of it, I could wish performed otherwise - I wish they could get simpler voices for the children - but on the whole a good show.</p>
