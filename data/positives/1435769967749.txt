<p>From York we were engaged to go to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for a grand musical festival, which was fixed for the week following the assize week ; we had in the interim a few days to spare, and Wilkinson engaged Mrs. Crouch and myself to play at the theatre on the Monday and Tuesday in the race week, August the 25th and 26th, which allowed us full time to get to the Newcastle Oratorio. Tate called upon us, and we agreed to perform " Lionel and Clarissa," "Inkle and Yarico," and Henry and Louisa in the "Deserter," which we did to crowded houses.</p>
