The band played exquisitely, so placed as to be invisible; so that what with the large proportions of the hall, and the well-subdued lights, and the splendours of plate and decoration, the scene was such as fairy-tales present: and Lady Canning, Miss Stanley, and Miss Dawson were beautiful enough to represent an ideal Queen’s attendants. The Queen looked well and rayonnante with that expression of countenance that she has when pleased with what surrounds her…. The old Duke of Cambridge failed not to ask after you.
