Yet how beautifully<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>he had sung the music of Br. Marianus in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>third part of Schumann's &ldquo;Faust"! It was all he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>had had to do at the festival; but it was enough,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>he had made his mark. Then he went home, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>in a month's time was no more. </span></p>
