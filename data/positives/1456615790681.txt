Both in general and in the details, he did a fine job. At the two performances I attended, I heard Regina Frinberg and Rita Zelmane, who sang the part of Katerina. Like the other performers, they sang excellently. The producer, Karlis Liepa, the artist, Artur Lapin, and the choirmaster, Harald Mednis, all showed great skill in putting the production together. The fine singing of the choir deserves special mention. </span></p>
