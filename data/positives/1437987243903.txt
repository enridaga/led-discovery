FERDINAND PRAEGER, who for thirty years, through evil report and good report, had never ceased to support WAGNER, the Philharmonic Society invited him over to London, and whilst here he conducted eight concerts. He was not popular; he was surprised to find that the band thought it unnecessary to rehearse, and the band was surprised that he should require so much rehearsal.
