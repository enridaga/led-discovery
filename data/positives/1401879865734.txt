Begin completely re-writing “Christ’s Nativity”. Practise 11.45–12.45. Go to College in a fruitless effort to find out about R.C.M. Union. I practise 3.30–4.30. Go to quite a good concert (British Women’s Symphony Orch) at Queen’s Hall with Barbara (tickets given by Miss Atkinson). They play Sibelius’ beautiful En Saga, quite well, & also (with Emilo Columbo [Emilio Colombo]) Max Bruch’s G min. Vln concerto. C. plays some pifling little solos (including Debussy’s charming fille aux chevaux de lin) competantly To finish with Bantock’s Hebridian symphony – mediocre stuff!
