<p>We were so unfortunate as to lose both the &ldquo;Seven Words&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Passion Music,&rdquo; but have had the satisfaction of hearing the &ldquo;Tod Jesu&rdquo; twice in Berlin. It is a learned work, not designed for amusement merely, but rather to paint with a deep coloring, the death scene of the Saviour of the world. It is, in general, too serious for a popular audience. &ldquo;It is quite tedious,&rdquo; said a German lady to me, &ldquo;but yet it is very grand.&rdquo; It does not afford sufficient immediate musical gratification for many; indeed it appeals to a higher principle than that of the mere sensuous, &mdash; even to the religious; and to appreciate it, one must be both musically and religiously educated and inclined.</p>
