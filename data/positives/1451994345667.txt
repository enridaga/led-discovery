<p>Amongst the musical audiences of Berlin is one which&nbsp;I believe to be, of its kind, unique in Europe, probably&nbsp;in the world. It is exclusively composed of Prussian&nbsp;officers, and frequents the concerts given during the&nbsp;winter season by a full orchestra of guardsmen, every&nbsp;member of which bears his Prussian Majesty's commission. Shortly after the conclusion of the Franco-German&nbsp;war I attended one of these entertainments at the Guard&nbsp;Artillery Barracks, which are situated in a melancholy&nbsp;district, unpenetrated by any of the frequented thorough-fares that are household words to an habitu&eacute; of the&nbsp;Northern Kaiserstadt &mdash; a sort of debateable land, called "Am Kupfergraben," or "By the Copper Ditch,"...The particular festivity to which I had the honour of&nbsp;being invited was held in celebration of the twenty-first&nbsp;anniversary of the society's birthday, and was characterised by the utmost jollity and good-fellowship. The first&nbsp;part of the entertainment was altogether musical, and&nbsp;consisted of orchestral and solo performances by members&nbsp;of the Union. The programme opened with an "occasional" overture by Kalliwoda, correctly and spiritedly&nbsp;rendered; another of the '' numbers " was Mendelssohn's&nbsp;Grand Concerto (pianoforte and orchestra) in G minor;&nbsp;and a third was the slow movement of a quaint old&nbsp;concerto by Haydn, redolent of pulvilio, and suggesting,&nbsp;at every bar, bag-wigs, clouded canes, knee-breeches&nbsp;and silk stockings. A Saxon artillerist sang the great&nbsp;tenor song out of <em>Freisch&uuml;tz</em> and a Blue hussar &mdash; who&nbsp;figured very creditably in the orchestra amongst the&nbsp;first violins &mdash; warbled a sentimental ditty, with cello&nbsp;obbligato by the regimental doctor, to everybody's&nbsp;unbounded gratification.</p>
