<p>The first week, a concert by Harry Blech (?) and the London Mozart Players. Later a concert by Segovia which was so quiet you could hardly hear him and a concert by Modern Jazz Quartet also very quiet, and then a "Hoffnung Concert".&nbsp; Very amusing. We all stood up for "God Save the Queen" and then realised that the first note just went on!&nbsp;</p>
