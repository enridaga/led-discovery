<p>When I first met [Buddy] Bolden, he came to my house. He asked me if I was playing regular. I told him no. He asked me to be a member of his band. So I played in his band for four or five years. Bolden was a strong trumpet player. You couldn't help from playing good with Bolden. He was crazy for wine and women and vice versa. Sometimes he would have to run away from the women. I used to take his horn away from him sometimes and bring him to my house. When he went mad, he would walk up and down the street talking to the wrong people--foolish--about this gal and that gal.</p>
