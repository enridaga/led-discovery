<p>Usual Sunday, long walk with Beth in morning. Wireless, reading, letters, work at other times of day. F.B. conducts a lovely B.B.C. Orch. concert at 9.20. Haydn 99 Symphony - v. beautifully played - Sch&ouml;nberg's lovely Verkl&auml;rte Nacht - which the strings played splendidly. A rousing show of his own thrilling Enter Spring, with the heavenly tune in it. And a brisk finale in Coq D'or Wedding March* Act. the hall's a bit too resonant, but otherwise it was a fabulous concert.</p>
