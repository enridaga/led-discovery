After a time we began to rehearse. It was a great effort for Glazunov to climb up on the rostrum and I am sure he was very sleepy because the first violinist had to tap him on the arm before he began conducting. He conducted the Brahms Double Concerto very slowly – the fast and the slow movement the same!(…) The public was wonderful and brought us back some forty times! Glazunov himself was adorable, an enormous great man of about six foot three who used the tiniest baton and made quaint little bows. After the Brahms my sister played Glazunov’s own Concerto for Violin with immense success and I played his Chant du Ménéstral once again. In that atmosphere I felt more than ever how perfectly he had depicted the real tragedy of the old minstrel and the intense misery and hopelessness of the end. Playing it that night with Glazunov gave me a strange feeling which always lived on in my heart and soul. There was a roar of applause and Glazunov beamed all over. The audience would not stop clapping, so the pianist came back on and I played twenty-seven encores and had fifty recalls!
