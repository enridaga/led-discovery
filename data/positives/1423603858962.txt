<p>My husband is on sabbatical from Calarts in California. Wednesday, 13 April 1988, we sit in the 5th or 6th row of the hall right center. Itzhak Perelman plays Tchaikowsky's Violin Concerto; Vladimir Ashkenazy conducts the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. So thrilled are we by the performance, we afterwards persuade a Festival Hall custodian to give us one of the posters that announced the event. It hangs in our bedroom today.</p>
