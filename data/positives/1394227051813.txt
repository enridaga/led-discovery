The next Sunday the organ was played by Mr Wheatley, who gave us a Cornet piece both morning and afternoon for his voluntaries, & tho' he had by no means a good finger, yet his style being new to me, as was the Cornet stop, I was pleas'd with his playing, tho' not so much as I had been with Mr Hudson the preceeding Sunday.
