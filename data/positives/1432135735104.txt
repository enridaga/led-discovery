One of my lady pupils, on the examination day, plays a posthumous manuscript Study in F major by Mendelssohn, a work entirely new to me; on this occasion I learn quite by chance that there still remains among Mendelssohn's papers much that is of artistic value, and yet I and a few others were selected specially by his widow to look through the posthumous works, with a view to their publication. So a favored pupil is allowed the privilege of playing an unheard work of Mendelssohn's before I know even of its existence!
