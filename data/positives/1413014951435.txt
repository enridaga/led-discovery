<p>Whilst I was going through some of my childhood bits which have been stored in my parents attic I found a badge which reminded me of my very first orchestral concert at the Royal Festival Hall. It was a halloween childrn's concert by the LPO back in 1982, I would have been seven years old and I remember being very excited with all the "fun" that was happening both outside and inside the concert, people giving out sweets, magicians, etc. The music was very child friendly, I seem to remember performances of the sorcerer's apprentice, the nutcracker and night on bald (sic) mountain, all music that I had heard and was familiar with. I also remember being very excited that "Ronald MacDonald" was there, at the time MacDonalds was a very new experience for me, I had only ever been to one ot their restaurants for birthday parties so to be able to meet the man himself was a real privilege and it was him who gave me the badge which I obviously treasured and still have to this day! It was a magical event for me and I genuinely believe that it was the start of a now longstanding love of classical music. I will try and send a picture of my much loved and treasured badge.</p>
