<pre>A musical entertainment, written by Mr. Dimond for mv benefit, was produced on <br />the 23rd May, 1805, entitled "Youth, Love, and Folly." I composed the whole of <br />the music. It combined the talents of Elliston, Dowton, Mrs. Bland, and Mrs. <br />Mountain ; and I had an excellent part in it. Miss Decamp acted a Jockey with <br />such vivacity, dressed it, and looked it, so completely, that she might have <br />passed as having been brought up at Newmarket. The versatility of this lady's <br />talent was very great ; as was, to my knowledge, her zeal for her employers, and <br />affability of manners to every person in the theatre. When she quitted her home, <br />Drury Lane, her departure was regretted by all. </pre>
