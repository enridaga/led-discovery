<p>Bunk Johnson told me once that he worked under P.G. Lowery and that he went with the circus on a tour of Europe. I don't know if that was true or not, as Bunk did a little stretching of the truth from time to time, but I do know that it was a great thing for all the musicians to listen to Lowery when he came to New Orleans with the circus.</p>
