I paid occasional summer visits to New Brighton where my friend and ex-student, now Professor, Granville Bantock, was installed as Musical Director. Wending our way to a rehearsal of an orchestral concert through the beautiful grounds, Bantock halted on an eminence for the purpose of letting me hear his newly-formed military band which, at his signal, played a selection from a comic opera. After praising the performance I remarked, "Well, Sullivan does write some jolly good tunes."
