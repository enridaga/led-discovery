Had such a frivolous evening last night! There was a musical soir√©e in the recreation tent. All the officers were invited and a good number turned up. We all came in best bib and tucker to receive them. Our music and refreshments were much appreciated. The coffee and cakes were provided by ourselves, the music by C[hristie], Miss Huntley, Miss Urquart, Miss Laird and three MOs. We all sat round and talked and listened and amused ourselves very much if only by considering what a joke the whole affair was. Our guests all went or were cleared out by Matron at about 10, and then we went off to bed.
