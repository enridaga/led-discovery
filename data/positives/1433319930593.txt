In after years the choir greatly improved, and Sir George used frequently to express his approbation of their work. Indeed, the last time he was there, in June, 1893, he was delighted at the progress they had made, and especially admired the chanting of the Psalms, which they did most intelligently from his brother's Psalter. He specially wrote an anthem for this choir to sing at a harvest festival.
