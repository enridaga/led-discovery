I feel sure that anyone who had actually been in the presence of a great orchestra could reconstruct the sound from the attenuated version which came from the tinny horn-speakers of the day; but as I had not yet had that first thrilling Queen's Hall experience, it was lost upon me, and names like Dr Adrian Boult, Sir Hamilton Harty and Sir Thomas Beecham, while familiar, were unassessed as yet.</p>
