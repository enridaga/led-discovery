Miles Davis coming annually to the RFH…allegedly unwilling 'cos he was on contract. Every time a radically different show…one characterised by sparse notes from the Maestro..played facing away from the audience as if he was serenading his crutch…but every note told. Meanwhile his presence pushed the band on to better and better solos...no one took it easy with Miles around...except Miles. There was no choice but to put in your best possible performance...it looked like he'd beat you up if you didn't. A man much missed.
