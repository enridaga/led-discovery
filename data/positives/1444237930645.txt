<p>On the 11th of April, 1886, when my&nbsp;London home was honoured by his presence [Franz Liszt]...he alluded to several musical ana of that&nbsp;memorable winter, incidents which I had completely&nbsp;forgotten, and especially recalled to my remembrance&nbsp;the excellent playing of a Polish pupil of his, then a&nbsp;stripling of twenty, now a prosperous P.F. teacher, and&nbsp;the father of half-a-dozen children ; also of his (Liszt's)&nbsp;having played one evening at poor Harry Arnim's to&nbsp;Prince Frederick of Hohenzollern, the King of Romania's younger brother, upon whom Liszt's inimitable&nbsp;extemporising produced no visible impression whatever.</p>
