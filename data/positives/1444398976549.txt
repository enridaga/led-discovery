<p>To the Bach festival last night; &amp; coincidence led me to run at once into two people I've not met for an age, Noel, for one; then, as I settled into my seat, a voice said it was Virginia! It was Walter Lamb.&nbsp; The egg-shaped man - the billiard ball man - sat by me, &amp; told me a great deal about Bach.&nbsp; Bach was very beautiful, though the human element in the choir always distracts me. <em>They</em> aren't beautiful; all in greens, greys, pinks, blacks, fresh from the suburbs and high tea.&nbsp; The hall seemed to suit them better than the music.</p>
