One day when Weber had given my father repeated assurances that I should do something in the world, I was rewarded by being taken for the first time to the theatre. The opera was that of 'Achilles,' by Paer; it was a new work, and I was particularly delighted with the funeral march. When I came home, I played it correctly from beginning to end, and drew tears from my dear father's eyes.
