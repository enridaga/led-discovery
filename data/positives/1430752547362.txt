His [Royal Highness the Duke of York's] first visit to the theatre [in Vienna] attracted a crowded and brilliant assemblage. The Emperor, accompanied by his brother Maximilian, the Archbishop of Cologne, was present. A new 
opera, composed by Stephen Storace, was produced on the occasion : Signora Storace and myself had the two principal parts in it. In the middle of the first act, Storace all at once lost her voice, and could not utter a sound during the whole of the performance ; this naturally threw a damp over the 
audience, as well as the performers. The loss of the iirst female singer, who was a great and deserved favourite, was to the composer, her brother, a severe blow. I never shall forget her despair and disappointment, but she was not then prepared for the extent of her misfortune, for she did not recover 
her voice sufficiently to appear on the stage for five months.
