<p class="MsoNormal">Jenny Lind&rsquo;s repertoire during her American tour was the " Casta Diva,&rdquo; from <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Norma</em> ; &ldquo; With Verdure Clad &rdquo; and &ldquo; On Mighty Pens,&rdquo; from the Creation; a cavatina from <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Beatrice de Tenda</em>, by Bellini; the great song with two flutes from the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Star of the North</em>, by Meyerbeer ; and &ldquo; Non mi Dor,&rdquo; from <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Don Giovanni</em>, by Mozart. She also sang in the trio from <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">II Barbier</em>, and, with Belletti, the duo from <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">L'Elisire d'Amore</em>, and a great variety of the Swedish folk-songs. With the latter she nearly always ended her concerts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">She used to introduce imitations of mountain echoes in the Swedish songs, and people said she did it ventriloquially, but I have always maintained that it was done by very refined <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">pianissimo</em> singing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have often been asked, &ldquo; How much of a singer was Jenny Lind?&rdquo; I can say she deserved all that was claimed for her, unmusical, nonsensical stories excepted. Her voice was of extensive range, reaching easily to D in alt,&mdash;a voice of veiled quality with something of the essence of a tear in it. She had almost unlimited execution, sang with great earnestness, and did everything in a highly finished, broad style. Such pieces as the &ldquo; Casta Diva &rdquo; and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">I Know that my Redeemer Liveth</em> she sang with so devotional a sentiment that she really seemed like some inspired priestess proclaiming her faith.</p>
