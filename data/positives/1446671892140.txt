<p>[I] found myself included,&nbsp;through Hellmesberger's influence, in an invitation&nbsp;addressed to the "musical and literary celebrities&nbsp;honouring Pesth with a visit " by Heckenast, the leading&nbsp;publisher of the Hungarian capital, to a supper-party at&nbsp;his mansion in a street with a polysyllabic, and, to any&nbsp;tongue save that of a born Magyar, unpronounceable&nbsp;name. Heckenast, an enlightened and liberal patron of&nbsp;the arts, had at that time but recently "discovered" Robert Volkmann, and taken the luckless composer under&nbsp;his protection. He happened to mention, in the "artists'&nbsp;room" at the Redoute, that we should meet Volkmann at&nbsp;supper, and Hellmesberger at once suggested an agreeable surprise for the latter &mdash; with whose gloomy past he&nbsp;was acquainted &mdash; in the shape of a post-coenal performance of the G minor quatuor by the Viennese quartet&nbsp;party... the genial suggestion was adopted by acclamation, and as soon as the&nbsp;concert had terminated, Heckenast's guests, some twenty&nbsp;in number, were conducted by their host to his residence,&nbsp;where they found Volkmann and one or two other local&nbsp;notabilities awaiting them.&nbsp;</p>
