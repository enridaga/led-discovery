The first thing upon arrival in Vienna, I called Otto Schulhof, with whom I was to play the concert that night. He was a remarkable fellow who knew as only a few know how to blend his piano with the cello. Strictly a professional, he would play with anyone, anywhere, and anything, for his fee. But this did not reflect on his great sensitivity as an artist, which made playing with him a joy. I played with him many times in different countries and had never needed more than one rehearsal.
