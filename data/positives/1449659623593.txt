<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was 11 years old and my maths teacher Miss Rayne decided to take a group to the Festival Hall, Ernest Reid Childrens Concerts that took place on Saturday mornings. My regular seat was in the front row on the right hand side of the stage on the 1st aisle. This was a great seat except that you were under the constant gaze of the cello section so sweet wrappers were a complete no no during the performance. Anyway these concerts gave me a lifetime interest in music - I now play double bass!&nbsp;</p>
