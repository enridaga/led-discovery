I think that the French are now coming to the fore. They have many new and fine talents. Recently I heard Delibes’s very skilful music – in its own style – for the ballet Sylvia. I became acquainted with this music in the pianoforte arrangement some time ago, but the splendid performance of it by the Vienna orchestra quite fascinated me, especially the first part. Swan Lake is poor stuff compared with Sylvia. Nothing during the last few years has charmed me as much as Carmen and Delibe’s ballet.
