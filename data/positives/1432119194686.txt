Major D. W. Whittle told me the following incident in connexion with this hymn : "I went with General O. O. Howard to hold meetings for the soldiers at Tampa, Florida, and one day while going through the camp I found a young man dying of fever. I knelt by his side and asked him if he was a Christian. He replied that he was not ; but said that his father and mother were Christians, and he asked me to pray for him. I did so, but no deep impression was made upon his heart. I went away with a sorrowing heart and promised to return another day. Two days later I visited him again and, praying with him, the Lord put into my mind to sing, ' Jesus, Saviour, pilot me.' The dying soldier said : ' Oh, that sounds good ; it puts me in mind of my beloved sister in Michigan, who used to sing this hymn for me before I entered the army.' He wanted me to repeat it over and over again for him, and finally he asked : ' Will Jesus be my pilot into the haven of rest ? ' I told the young man that Jesus would. ' Then,' he said, ' I will trust Him with all my heart.' The next day I called to see him again, but his comrade said : ' He passed away during the night.'
