The excellent orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre with its conductor Samuil Samosud played the work [Seventh Symphony] superbly. The fate of the symphony - which was written under the impression of the Leningrader&rsquo;s heroic defence of their city, and is dedicated to these valiant Sovietic patriots- is in capable hands.</span></p>
