At the ancient concert (in the Hanover Square Rooms), Handel's 'Messiah' was given in all its grandeur and simple majesty. The organ accompaniments were supplemented in the full passages by wind instruments. The chief soloists were Mrs. Salmon, Miss Stephens, and Mr. Vaughan. It seemed strange to me that, instead of boys, elderly men sang the contralto part with the head voice. The famous Hallelujah Chorus was given in very slow time. The obligato trumpet parts attracted my attention.
