<p>Another incident, <em>haud obliviscari</em> took place that evening. He [Mendelsohnn] made me play a Bach prelude to him, with&nbsp;cold perspiration running down my back and in such an&nbsp;agony of nervousness as I have never since been called&nbsp;upon to fight against &mdash; I was only nine years old and&nbsp;extremely sensitive &mdash; and, when my terrible ordeal had&nbsp;come to an end, patted my head, kissed me between the&nbsp;eyes, and said: "Little fellow, you were born a musician,&nbsp;and will play the piano some day." I doubt whether&nbsp;that night there was another so happy and proud a boy&nbsp;as I within the confines of Her Most Gracious Majesty's&nbsp;realms.&nbsp;</p>
