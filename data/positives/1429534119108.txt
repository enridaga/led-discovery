What emotion he must have felt on his first appearance yesterday, before the English public, in Covent Garden Theatre! The thundering applause with which he was greeted affected us deeply, how much more himself, the honored object of all this enthusiasm! The performance consisted of a selection from the 'Freysch√ºtz' conducted by himself; the overture was encored with acclamation. Braham, Miss Paton, and Phillips sang the chief numbers of the opera; they seemed inspired by Weber's presence.
