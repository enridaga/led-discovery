<p class="MsoNormal">Printers have played some funny tricks with our programmes at times. It is a dangerous thing not to see a &ldquo;proof" before printing, but often the programme has to be &ldquo; rushed,&rdquo; and there is no opportunity. One of our violinists was to play a solo on the old French air, &ldquo; <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Je suis le petit tambour</em>." When the concert was over, my attention was called to this number on the programme, which read, to my horror, &ldquo; <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Jesus le petit tambour</em>."</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At another time, Mr. Schultze was playing nightly the old caprice by Miska Hauser, entitled, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Bird in the Tree</em>. Writing the programme one day in the office of the printer, I incautiously wrote, &ldquo; Bird business, Mr. Schultze,&rdquo; supposing that they would print the full title as usual. The programmes were printed without giving me a chance to read the proof. When we came to that special number, we noticed a peculiar buzz and fun- enjoying condition among our auditors. When the concert was over, we inquired the cause, and a friend replied, handing us a programme, &ldquo; We wanted to know when Mr. Schultze was to begin his &lsquo; bird business.&rsquo; &rdquo; It was a funny way to learn a useful lesson.</p>
