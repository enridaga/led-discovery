Its finales, and many of its very numerous <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">pezzi concertati</em> are uncommonly loud, and the lavish use made of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">noisy</em> instruments appears to my judgement singularly inappropriate to the subject, which though it might have been rendered touching, is far from calling for such warlike accompaniments.</span></p>
