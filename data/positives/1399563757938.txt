George got in last night about 7.15 and at 8.45 we heard the guns begin, and we had a very bad time. We went into the kitchen, and the firing was continuous, shells whistling around us, and engines humming, and occasionally a loud deep dreadful noise like a bomb....  [A] public house at the corner of Hornsey and Seven Sisters roads had its basement blown away.... Many were killed here.

Some of our choir left London today. We managed an anthem this morning, but poor Mrs Hancock who took the solo was so shaky that she nearly broke down. This evening we had the service at 5.30 and we had a wonderful congregation considering that it was only known this morning. Much better than an ordinary morning congregation. There were only 8 girls in the choir and 5 men so we could not have an anthem.
