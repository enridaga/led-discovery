<p>I entered the house one evening, carrying my books loose, to hear music.&nbsp; Jack looked round as I opened the drawing-room door (he would never sit in a room with the door open), nodded severely, and continued with the Mozart sonata which was sparkling out from the refreshed strings of the German instrument.&nbsp; There was nothing defiant, enquiring, or challenging in his nod.&nbsp; It was absolute.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is reality, the continuum&rdquo; it said&hellip;</p>
<p>I held up my books, knowing better than to interrupt the flood of formal gaiety with its under-current of melancholy, an element which Jack always contrived to pronounce wherever it was latent in music.&nbsp; A gleam of sardonic amusement lit his eye, and he nodded again.&nbsp; I felt a glow of warmth, the pleasure of being understood.&nbsp; It was the first time I had felt really warm since time stopped, the Saturday before &hellip;</p>
<p>The music was delicious again.&nbsp; It perfumed our death-tainted home.&nbsp; But it also emphasised the emptiness.&nbsp; I put down the books, retreated to the kitchen, and began to prepare tea, methodically filling the kettle, lighting the gas-stove, laying two cups and saucers, noticing the hollow tick of the Swiss clock on the mantelpiece over the heavy cooking-range.&nbsp; The music followed me, cool yet impetuous, refusing to be excluded from my sorrow.&nbsp; The clock ticked out the increasing distance from the shore of my childhood and its premature burden.</p>
<p>I stood listening both ways, my hearing doubly acute. &nbsp;The blood once again pounded in my body, demanding something that I dared not understand.&nbsp; The conflict was so violent that I cried out involuntarily: &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; and was instantly astounded.&nbsp; I had been standing with the tea-caddy open in my hand, I don&rsquo;t know for how long. But the kettle was boiling away and had filled the scullery with steam.&nbsp; The music had stopped, and Jack stood at the kitchen door.</p>
