<p>I went with Teague to a board-school children's concert in Wandsworth. &nbsp;We went in a tram, and came to a Wesleyan hall and walked up and down a very respectable dark street of semi-detached residences which frightened me. &nbsp;The children sang folk-songs and a Bach piece, and a Brahms piece. They looked very clean and happy, but there was a curious sort of gravity abou them when they sang...There were also a band of fiddle-players from Catford, very good indeed. &nbsp;</p>
