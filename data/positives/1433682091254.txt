<p>Cootie Williams, that style he played, he got that from Chris Kelly. Chris used to go to Mobile [Alabama], where they had the same caste system as New Orleans. He played a dicty dance there one night and played nothing but barrelhouse with that plunger. He was the first one I saw play with a plunger. [...] And he also played church music, especially <em>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot</em>. He really moved people. He should have been a preacher. But he preached so melodiously with his horn that it was like somebody singing a song, and he would go into the blues from there. When he went to Mobile and did that, nobody else could go to Mobile any more. They only wanted Kelly.</p>
