<p>Although he didn't have what is usually called a "personality", Joe Oliver impressed me from the first the I saw him. He was a tranquil man and it was surprising to see him blow such joyous music.</p>
<p>In this era [1920's prohibition era, the Royal Garden, Chicago], Louis Armstrong played in the ensemble and Oliver took the majority of solos. He had a real 'gutbucket tone' and really moved. Armstrong was only rarely heard playing solo [... When he did solo,] Louis really played, showing everyone present all he knew, all his tricks, and he received after each song tremendous acclamations.</p>
<p>One can say that from that time on there was a question only of Louis. The school kids began to imitate the acts of "Satchmo". Hearing Louis after Oliver it seemed that Louis was more powerful.</p>
