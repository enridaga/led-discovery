I shd be very happy to submit the Translation to yr Correction - for tho' I know you are so good a Patriot as to be tender of yr Countrys honour in things of importance - yet yr judgement & yr taste will I trust, befriend my opinions in the present case - it is not such music as I Had the pleasure to hear Mlle Diderot perform, that I condemn - & upon that, as well as upon yr admirable writings, I form my judgement of yr taste in Music. I must intreat you, Sir, to present my most humble respects to Mlle Diderot, together with 6 concertos by Wagenseil, 6 Ditto by Jean Bach & 2 Trios which neither merit her acceptance nor the Company they keep.
