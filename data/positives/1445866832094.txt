<p>I remember the first time I heard Perlman play was at the RFH. I was about 12 or 13 and I think he was playing Mendelssohn concerto.&nbsp; I was studying the violin and I remember just crying and standing up at the end in disbelief at how beautiful it was. Definitely a seminal moment of musical inspiration. I also remember the repeated tonal A (?) that you play to signal the end of the interval.&nbsp; I hope you keep it.</p>
