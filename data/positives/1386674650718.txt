[W]e were appointed to go to the Lodge at Windsor at two o'clock. We were first taken into the Duchess of Ancaster's dressing-room; in a quarter of an hour after to the King and Queen in the drawing-room, who had nobody with them but Prince Alverstaden, the Hanoverian â€¦.There were two chairs brought in for the Duchess of Portland and myself to sit on, (by order of their Majesties,) which were easier chairs than those belonging to the room. We were seated near the door that opened to the concert-room. The King directed them to play Handel and Geminiani's music, which he was graciously pleased to say was to gratify me. These are flattering honours, and I should not indulge so much upon this subject, but that I depend upon your believing it proceeds more from gratitude than vanity.
