On the morning of Christmas-day I went to the old Gothic church of St. Nicholas, where a venerable old man, Nicolai, is the preacher : the service according to the old Lutheran ritual, the singing of the congregation very fine, accompanied by the trombone, to which I am now reconciled. Nicolai spoke in faith and power the language of the Gospel. On my return home I was astonished to find again an invitation from the King.
