To HIS SISTER. 
B.E.F.
Sunday May 14, 1916.

Yesterday we had a very good Church Parade, which I liked very much, with the Divisional Band playing. In the afternoon, regimental sports-with a lot of side-shows like Aunt Sallies etc., and Riflemen got up as showmen, one of them even in a complete evening-dress suit with top-hat. In the evening we had a concert in a barn, with the Divisional Band again. I played Humoreske and Perpetuo Mobile on a very poor fiddle which the Quartermaster-Sergeant of 'A' Company carries  about with him.
