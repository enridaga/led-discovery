One of the most fortunate days for me occurred in 1902 when I met at Stafford House (which later became the London Museum) and again a little later at a concert given by the London Diocesan Orchestra in which she [his wife] played the viola. This orchestra consisted of about forty women players, mostly amateurs, and was conducted by the talented amateur musician Margaret Haweis, sister of the Rev. H. R. Haweis, author of Music and Morals. The orchestra played well under her baton, and gave concerts in all the poorer districts of London â€“ a good deal in the East End.
