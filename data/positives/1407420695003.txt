At home to dinner, whither comes and dines with me W. How, and by invitation Mr. Harris and Mr. Banister, most extraordinary company both, the latter for music of all sorts, the former for everything. Here we sang, and Banister played on the Theorbo. And afterward Banister played on his flagelette and I had very good discourse with him about music, so confirming some of my new notions about music that it puts me upon a resolution to go on and make a Scheme and Theory of music not yet ever made in the world.
