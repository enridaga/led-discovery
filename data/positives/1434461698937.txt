<p>Viewed across the chasm of six years, some of my London appearances of the last seasons before World War II are particularly full of meaning to me now. A folder of the 1939 London Music Festival (April 23- May 28), at which I played the Beethoven Concerto, evokes nostalgic memories. The diversity and richness of these musical offerings will be difficult if not impossible to duplicate in years to come. Toscanini conducting the 'Missa Solemnis', Mozart operas at Glyndebourne, Shakespeare at Stratford-on-Avon, Handel&rsquo;s 'Fireworks' Music in the open air accompanied by actual fireworks in Regent&rsquo;s Park, Covent Garden opera, the &ldquo;Old Vic&rdquo; theatre, Beecham, Bruno Walter, Sir Henry Wood, ballet, and chamber music at Burlington House, at Hampton Court Palace, at the London Museum, the National Gallery, and the Wallace Collection (where I played a Mozart Divertimento with chamber orchestra) &ndash; read in 1945 this folder takes on a slightly fabulous quality and makes one somewhat dizzy!</p>
