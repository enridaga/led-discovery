Friday 15th November 1957 - a murky winter's night, but one which was to glow in the memory for a lifetime: Otto Klemperer conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra in the final concert of a Beethoven series at the RFH. Klemperer, the orchestra, soloists and the magnificent newly-formed chorus gave a spellbinding performance of the 9th Symphony which, to my ears, has never been surpassed. A privilege to have been in the audience that night.
