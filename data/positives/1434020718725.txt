<p>Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Aachen: Monday Morning, 10th August, 1845 - I drove on with the King (the Queen remaining in the Palace of Bruhl) through Cologne to Aachen, where the King alighted at the house of the President von Wedel, and held a great reception ; an hour afterwards to supper, which proved dinner to me, and was very welcome. Then appeared a procession of torches, with singing, and acclamations animated and general. To-day at ten o'clock the King proceeds to the frontier. Immediately after Queen Victoria's departure, the King will accompany his Queen to Ischl, and I shall then be free in about a week from this time.</p>
