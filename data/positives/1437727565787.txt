CHAPMAN of the Overend and Gurney Bank. They lived in Brunswick Square, and I met this young lady on an average twice a week at musical parties, and late and early she sang very deliciously and dreamily, "Birds in the Branches". The poor girl married a fashionable baronet in the neighbourhood, and died shortly afterwards. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
