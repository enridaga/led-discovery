<p>The congregational singing in the Kreuz-Kirche was excellent, that is, excellent congregational singing; but the organ was played with mighty power, and without variation of Piano and Forte. It seemed to support, bind together, and lead the people, who bore a somewhat similar relation to the organ, to that which a large factory wheel does to the water power by which it is moved. It seemed almost to take away from the people voluntariness or free agency, and to compel them onward in their song. It was certainly impossible for any one to commit any overt act of sin against the laws of time and tune, during such a torrent of sound as that which the organ poured forth.</p>
