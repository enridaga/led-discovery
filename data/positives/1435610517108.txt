<p>September 1836. My friend, Signor Puzzi, Mademoiselle Grisi, and Lablache, on their way to the festival at Manchester, gave a concert at Leicester, in which the wonderful powers of these artists were shown, especially in two pieces from the opera 'I Puritani', by Bellini.

The two pieces just mentioned are sufficiently distinct in style to admit of no such imputation. The ideas are original, and very beautiful.
