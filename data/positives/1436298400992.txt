<p>[Madame Mara said], " I was at Drury Lane, a few nights since, to see the pantomime ; there was a little girl, who sang a ballad, 'Up, Jack, and the day is your own ;' that girl, depend upon what I tell you, has one of the finest voices I ever heard ; and could I be induced to take a pupil, to bring forward on the stage, that girl should be the person of my choice." The young lady is Miss Povey ; and proud may she be of having been so mentioned by such a person as Madame Mara.</p>
