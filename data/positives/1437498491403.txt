<pre>August 1811, Signora Bertinotti, Naldi, Signer Cavini, a very sweet tenor <br />singer, and his wife, a very pretty singer, and beautiful woman, Madame Naldi, 
Miss Naldi, and myself, were engaged by Mr. Jones to perform two Italian operas <br />at the Dublin Theatre. One of them was "II Furbo contro il Furbo;" the other, <br />Mozart's "Cosi fan tutte." Signora Bertinotti, who was one of the most popular <br />prima donnas on the Italian stage, pleased very much; but the houses not <br />answering the expectations either of ourselves or Mr. Jones, we performed very <br />few nights, and the party set off, via Belfast, for Scotland, to appear under the <br />management of Corri, at Edinburgh; afterwards to go back to Liverpool for a few <br />nights, and then return to London. It was proposed to me to accompany them, but <br />I declined. </pre>
