<p>Solomon at the Philharmonic in the evening.&nbsp; Good performance by the choir.&nbsp; Beecham conducted by memory, and I hear he conducted the rehearsal by heart also.&nbsp; Two especially fine choruses, 'Let no rash intruder' - almost Purcellian, &amp; 'draw the tear from hopeless love'.&nbsp; One amusing example of prudery. Solomon should remark in a brisk recitative. 'Arise my fair one, come away. My love admits of no delay'. But Clara Serena sang from a bowdlerised text which gave as the second line: 'In sweet seclusion let us stray.' Immediately followed by 'Let no rash intruder', all about pillows and nightingales.&nbsp; I was reminded of Parry altering O spare the husband and return the wife into '<em>restore</em> <em>the wife'</em>.&nbsp;</p>
