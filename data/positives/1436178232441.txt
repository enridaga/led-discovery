<p>A memorable event in the spring of 1852 was the first series of orchestral concerts given by the New Philharmonic Society, which was formed by Dr. Henry Wylde with the special object of producing novelties and giving concerts of the best kind. Great eclat attended these concerts, as Hector Berlioz, after his triumphant tours throughout Europe, was specially engaged to conduct. The orchestra consisted of 110 per- formers, the leaders being all well-known soloists, such as Sivori, Jansa (violinists), Goffrie (viola), the great 'cellist Piatti, Bottesini, the famous contrabassist, Remusat the flautist, Barret the oboist, and Lazarus the clarinettist. I was fortunate in being engaged as one of the second violins, and was much gratified when, during the first rehearsal, Berlioz said, "Ganz, I want you to play the small cymbals with Silas in the scherzo" We were rehearsing his Romeo and Juliet symphony, which has a wonderfully light and fairy-like scherzo to represent "Queen Mab," and he had had two pairs of small antique cymbals made to give a particular effect in it. There were several orchestral rehearsals, which for England at that time was a really great innovation. Every one was intensely enthusiastic, and anxious to please Berlioz, who was a wonderful conductor. His beat was clear and precise, and he took endless trouble to get everything right. I remember his asking Silas and me to come and see him in King Street, St. James's, just to try over the passage for the little cymbals. I mention this to show the care he took over every detail. As a result, the first concert proved a veritable triumph for him, and it was generally admitted that no such orchestral performance had ever before been heard in England. The hall was crammed, and the audience was absolutely carried away and cheered him to the echo.</p>
