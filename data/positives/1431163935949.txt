At 6.30 we went to the Gewandhaus, which was already filled to overflowing. I was in the orchestra with Mendelssohn who was received with acclamations, well warranted by the performance of the Euryanthe Overture and Beethoven's B. flat Symphony. His influence over the band gave it the fire, tenderness, and requisite 'nuances.' I was in ecstasies.
