<p>Since the advent of Richard Wagner, no composer has created such a sensation or aroused such controversy as Richard Strauss. I remember being present at the first concert which he conducted here : it was at the Queen's Hall one evening in December 1897. From the outset there was no mistake about his gifts as a conductor. He had the lights lowered in the hall when he began Mozart's " Eine kleine Nachtmusik," and it was a real pleasure to note the sympathy he showed for the music and the beautiful balance and phrasing of the orchestra. There was immense Schwung, as the Germans say, about the performance of his fine tone-poem, " Tod und Verklarung " ; everything was made beautifully clear and understandable. It was apparent that another great figure had arisen in the musical world. There was great enthusiasm, and Mr. Leonard Berwick, who happened to be sitting next to me, was also full of praise for Strauss's work.</p>
