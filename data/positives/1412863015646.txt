    J. W. Bowie, a tenor, who for forty years retained the affection of the concert-going public, began at the [Good Templars] Harmonic [Concerts, Glasgow].
    His special successes were at gatherings. Forty years ago every county had a gathering in Glasgow every year where the natives in exile foregathered for a soiree, concert, and ball. W. F. Frame, J. W. Bowie and his wife, Jessie Craigie, were booked for them all.
    The old Scots domestic duets which they sang, particularly those representing a “tiff” between husband and wife were sure to bring the house down. Yet everyone present knew the songs by heart already. Ah! we were a simple folk in those days!
