The second part of the performance was devoted to Mendelssohn; he was heartily received with ringing cheers, but seemed all anxiety to make his bow to the public, and get the thing over. Of course this was sheer modesty. His conducting of the band in this performance of the 'Lobgesang' effected a marvellous unity and precision, and one of the chorales of this glorious work told so powerfully that the whole audience rose involuntarily from their seats - a custom usually confined in England to the performance of the Hallelujah Chorus. At three o'clock in the afternoon, when the hall was emptied, Mendelssohn, fresh as ever, played for three-quarters of an hour upon the organ before a select circle, as though his day were but just beginning.
