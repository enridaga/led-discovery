Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: Wednesday, 9th April -
It was granted to me to enjoy the Easter solemnity. Thursday was the day of preparation ; Good Friday that of the Communion. Strauss preached in the Cathedral to 4,000 persons, 6OO of whom remained for the Lord's Supper, the
Royal Family among the number. In the afternoon I read with the Bernstorffs the Good Friday service ; then heard Graun's oratorio of the ' Death of Jesus ; ' and at night remained late with Strauss.
