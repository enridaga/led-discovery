One of the clarinet players, Bernard Walton, exactly my age, was to have a career which ran parallel with mine for many years. He died tragically young a few years ago. I shall never forget hearing him play, in that darkened barn at the camp, the Brahms Quintet - it was the first time I had heard it or him, a memory to treasure.
