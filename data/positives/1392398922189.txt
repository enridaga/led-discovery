My journies, both to & from Passenham, & my stay of near five weeks there, were as pleasant, & as perfectly answered to me, as possible. I wished for you often. We had abundance of Music. Two musical mornings at Mrs. Prowse’s at Wicken Park: two at Passenham, &c. Two Miss Sharps were at Wicken: one of them plays & sings charmingly. I wish you had heard her & me (I speak as a coxcomb) rattle away the Gypsy movement in Op. 73 of Haydn. It is delightful in its style; which has such a restless vivacity & gaiety, that I believe you would have danced about the room, nay perhaps have broken your neck in trying to jump over the Doctor’s great Piano Forte in the middle of his drawing room. Every evening we played Trios & Quartetts when Mr. Doyle was with us. Elmsall plays both fiddle & violincello well.
