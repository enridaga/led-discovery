<p>I continued, until the end of the Carnival, passing my time with very little variation, living in the lap of luxury, and in a vortex of pleasure. We began the rehearsal of Anfossi's oratorio, and the first week in Lent the performance commenced. I had a song which had been composed purposely for me, and sent from London by Anfossi to Count Vidiman. Nothing could exceed the brilliancy of Signora de Petris' execution and feeling ; she sang divinely, and we repeated the oratorio eight nights to the fashionables invited by the Count and the Signora. There was a particular friend of hers, Sigiior Gioacino Bianchi, then an amateur, a man of very good family, and a sweet singer; but, owing to some circumstances of a tender nature, he quitted Venice, and went to England, where he became a singing-master of eminence, esteemed by all his friends for urbanity and talent, and highly patronised by the Earl and Countess of Harcourt.</p>
