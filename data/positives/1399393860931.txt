Dear Sir or Madam,
I was very disappointed with last night's concert. Rarely can members of the Philharmonia have made so many mistakes in playing a Brahms symphony, and Schiff ought to stick to playing the piano. The first movement was turgid in the extreme - it is decidedly not a slow movement- and then the slow movement was even slower. Brahms made very boring. The Mendelssohn was a warning that this might happen. Fortunately the Dvorak was better, but there were moments of scrappy ensemble that could be put down to the conductor rather than the players. I am a Friend of the Philharmonia, but will not be coming again to any concert conducted by Schiff. I thought you ought to know what I feel.
