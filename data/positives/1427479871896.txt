A grand evening musical party at the Rothschilds', at their country house on Stamford Hill, given to the foreign Ministers present in England on account of the approaching coronation of George IV. I was introduced to most of the Ministers, who, with the old Prince Esterhazy, expressed themselves greatly pleased with my playing. In the intervals vocal solos and quartets were given by English singers.
