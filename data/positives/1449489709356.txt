I once heard a wonderful &lsquo;Parsifal&rsquo; from his baton and watched him rehearsing Tchaikovsky and &lsquo;Tod und Verkl&auml;rung&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s incredible what he can wring out of such by no means first-class stuff. It&rsquo;s very sad that one can&rsquo;t hear that sort of thing in the artistic capital!</span></p>
