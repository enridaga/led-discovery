<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Feb 25th 2005 my friend and I saw the remaining members of the MC5 + the Sun Ra Arkestra play together.&nbsp; Recreating the sound, visuals + energy as if it were 1966.&nbsp; The sheer power, energy + urgent excitement of the MC5 has always blown me away.&nbsp; Mixing in the Space jazz of the Arkestra changed it from a full on rock 'n' roll assault to something else.&nbsp; The 'something' they had been trying to create 40 years ago.&nbsp; The power of 'Kick Out the Jams' + 'Over + Over' with the jazz cacophany apocalypse of 'Starship'.&nbsp; Sitting amongst Bjork + Jason Spaceman (of Spiritualised) was a novelty.&nbsp; But nothing topped meeting + chatting with Wayne Kramer of the MC5 + discussing the Phun City festival of 1970, near me + my friends home town of Worthing, Sussex.</p>
