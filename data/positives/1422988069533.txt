Go to Prom (Bach) with Mollie Floud at 8.0. V. long programme to stand for. Sarabane, Andante, & Bourée (Strings), v. good & well played. Murchie in B minor Flute Suite (delightful playing). 2 Conces. (C. & C min). 2 pianos (Ethel Bartlett & Rae Robertson) – wonderfully played. Thalben Ball in B min Prelude & Fugue; only bit of organ music I’ve ever really enjoyed. Also arias by Stuart Robertson (excellent) & Gladys Ripley (not so good). Also Suite no 6 Bach – Wood – Even Wood’s garish orchestration could not spoil some of this music. Back at 11.25.
