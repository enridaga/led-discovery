<p>Mendelssohn's Finale to the opera of 'Lorelei' is impressive and highly dramatic, every instrument is ennobled, even to the big drum. The general impression was electrical, and even the champions of a new art-system, who hitherto have been pleased to pronounce Mendelssohn and his creations as old-fashioned and out of date, applauded enthusiastically. Should this fragment never be produced on the stage, it will always be a valuable acquisition to the concert-room; it is a gem from Mendelssohn's posthumous treasures.</p>
