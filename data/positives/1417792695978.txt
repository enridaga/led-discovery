     During one of my practice sessions I heard someone yell from above in the courtyard. “Hey! You below, blowing Dorsey’s theme song, pop your head out.”
     Since I was the one playing “Getting Sentimental Over You,” I poked my head out...
     “We need another trombone to play the 4th part for a quartet we’ve written. Can you come up? We’re in room 625.”....
     After scampering upstairs real fast, each of the trombonists introduced themselves. Moe Snyder... would be a future clinician for the Getzen Instrument Company. Tom Mitchell would play with Kai Winding’s first four man trombone group.... The third player, Frank Rosolino, became a famous jazz soloist with the Stan Kenton Band....
     These guys were fantastic and I was overwhelmed by their playing. They must have thought I was okay because they asked me a couple more times. They taught me more in those few hours than I did studying with my teacher for a whole year. After hearing them play, I was inspired and knew what direction I had to go as far as modern playing was concerned.
     These were just a few of the fine musicians in the building. Laying in bed listening to those marvelous musicians was like getting a free lesson.
