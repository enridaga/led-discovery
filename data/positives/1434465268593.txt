Letter from Mrs.Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 8 March, 1745-6 -
Last Wednesday the Dean and I were invited to the Bishop of Clogher's to a musical entertainment, made for my Lord and Lady Chesterfield ; no ladies were invited but performersâ€”Lady Freak, ! Miss Maxwell, and your humble servant, but I was excused; the other ladies played and sung extremely well. Lady Freak has a great hand and genius for music, but has had few advantages in learning ; Miss Maxwell has been very well taught. Mr. Dubourg played the first fiddle, and played better than ever I heard him : the concert was very agreeable, and everything ordered well and handsomely. Lady Chesterfield says she never heard so good a performer as Dubourg.
