<p>After the Jenny Lind fever there arose another star in the operatic firmament, namely, Henrietta Sontag. She had married a Sardinian nobleman, Count Rossi, and left the stage; but, when misfortune overtook her husband through political affairs, she returned to the opera and came out as Linda di Chamounix at Her Majesty's in 1849. She was no longer in her first youth, and, coming directly after Jenny Lind, her success at first was not great; but afterwards she appeared as Rosina in <em>Il Barbiere</em> and carried everything by storm. In the duet "Dunque io son" with Signor Belletti, and in "Una voce" her vocalisation was perfect, and, to crown all, in the Lesson Scene she interpolated Rode's "Variations" (which were popular about that time) and created a great furore. The last variation is very difficult, consisting of arpeggios and chromatic scales, running up and down, which she executed with perfect ease, her face not betraying in the least that she was singing the most difficult phrases; on the contrary, she warbled everything <em>con amore</em>. In fact, it was a real pleasure to look at her face, while singing, as she was still very pretty.</p>
