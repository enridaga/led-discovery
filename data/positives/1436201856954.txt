<p>At the sixth concert Madame Regan-Schimon was the vocalist and sang "Lieder" by Schubert in beautiful style. Madame Essipoff made her second appearance and played Rubinstein's Concerto in D minor, achieving another triumph. Since Rubinstein played this concerto at one of these concerts no one has ever had such a success in it as she had. She also played Liszt's "Hungarian Fantasia," then little known here, with great fire and brilliance. After Madame Essipoff had left England she wrote me a letter in German, in which she said: "Last night, at half-past twelve at night, I knocked and rang for a long, long time at your door, but it would not open to me any more. I am very sorry not to have seen you again before going away. ... A thousand heartfelt thanks for your friendship for me; I know how to ap-preciate it."</p>
