The Twentieth-Century Music Festival continues. In the evening attended the second performance of the Britten opera (which Virgil calls "The Screw of the Century") with Denise Bourdet and "drove" her home in a gondola to the Bestigui Palace. In Munich last winter Peter Pears had already warned me that the little girl's role would be taken by a lady-midget of forty. Of course it was a flop. Why not a boy dressed up as a girl? At those ages there is little difference!
