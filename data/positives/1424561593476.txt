In Barcelona, at the time of my return, there were two symphony orchestras. They had no regular concert schedules â€“ they played only on special occasions and rehearsed infrequently. When I heard them, I thought it was shocking that a city this size not have something better to offer. Other major European cities had first-class orchestras. Why not Barcelona?
