On our way to Manchester for the next week of Jack Hylton concerts we stopped off in Blackpool for a Sunday evening concert as well and ended the programme with Tschaikowsky's "1812" Overture, complete with explosive canon effects unwisely laid on by Basil Cameron to liven things up. After the news of the London Blitz the audience were understandably a trifle jumpy and almost panicked, several of them trying to rush out as it began to get noisier and having to be restrained by friends with stronger nerves.
