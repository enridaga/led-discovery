<p class="MsoNormal">...I went directly to the opera, which to night was at the <em>Teatro Nuovo</em>... This burletta was called <em>Le Trame per amore</em> &ndash; and set by <em>Signor Giovanni Paeisello, Maestro di Capella Napoletano</em>. &nbsp;The singing was but indifferent. There were 9 characters in the piece and yet not one good voice among them. However, the music pleased me very much. It was full of fire and fancy. The ritornels abounding in new passages, and the voice parts with elegant and simple melodies such as might be remembered and carried away after the first hearing or be performed in private with a small band or even without any other instrument than a harpsichord. The overture, of one movement only was quite comic, and contained a perpetual succession of pleasant passages.</p>
