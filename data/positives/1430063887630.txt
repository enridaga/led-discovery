This morning I listened, as I was dressing, to little Litolff, who had come for his promised lesson. Then a hasty breakfast, but while I was sipping my first cup of coffee, in came the Ladies B., who staid so long: that I had to make up my mind to give Litolff his lesson in their presence. Next in turn was a Viennese pianist, who brought a Rondo, the chief feature of which was a 'Crescendo a la Rossini'. Close on his heels came the two Eichhorn boys, who had to wait while I saw the doctor. No sooner had he gone than I had the exquisite treat of hearing the boys play.
