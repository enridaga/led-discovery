<p>The first time I came to the Royal Festival Hall with my daughter aged 7-8 we saw the "Nutcracker" Dame Margot Fontaine was in the audience, my daughter was in awe of her. The conducter was taken ill during the interval. We had an hour long interval. My husband and young son were waiting outside when the balet finished. What a long wait they had. I day I will remember forever, the first London Ballet we both had been to. "Wonderful show".</p>
