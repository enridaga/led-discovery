After a few pleasant days with Jacques [Thibaud] he made me promise to hear Wanda Landowska. Thibaud said it was a crime that I never had. I went to hear her play the Haydn Concerto. She crossed the stage draped in something priestly, approaching her harpsichord as though it were an altar. There was the solemnity of a virgin offering and a mystic ceremony about to begin. But her performance was wonderfully simple and as exemplary as one would expect of a truly great artist.
