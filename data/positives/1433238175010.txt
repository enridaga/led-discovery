On April 15th, 1872, Sir George went with the choir to serenade the Princess Beatrice on her birthday. For this occasion he wrote a part-song, "The Thorn is in the bud," which was very much admired both by the Queen and Princess Beatrice. In the evening he received the following letter from Dean Wellesley :
" DEAR SIR GEORGE,
"I have a more than usually flattering message to you from the Queen. ' Tell Sir George Elvey how pleased the Queen was with the singing to-day, and how much she admired the piece composed for Princess Beatrice, with such pretty
verses.'
" Yours sincerely,
(Signed)
"G. WELLESLEY."
