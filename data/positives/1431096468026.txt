Good reel players still existed in numbers, and I can recall the exciting effect a large, picked band of violinists–led by my father, who had gathered them together from all parts of Scotland–produced on an enthusiastic audience by the long strings of alternating strathspeys and reels which succeeded each other without break. The changes were effect by the simple plan of passing the name of the next tune round. I doubt whether any of the performers could read music. The necessary "snap," strong up-bow jerk of the wrist and exaggerated accentuation, are features not easily captured even by the most accomplished violinists.
