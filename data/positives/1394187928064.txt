Have two of the most hectic days in my life. To hegin with, the Taxi ordered to take me and my heavy bag & music case to station doesn't turn up & I run 1/2 mile in 6 mins & leap into train, more dead than alive, without ticket or breath as it is moving. Meet Mummy at Kings X, & have meal, & go for talk with H.S. at 3.0, about my future. Have tea there & go immediately to Bridge at 5.45 & have 1 hrs lesson & leap back to Belvedere Hotel in time to have a short dinner with Barbara & Mummy, before going (incidently 5 min late) to topping concert at Queen's H. with Mummy. Backhaus was simply ideal; I enjoyed the Bax, but didn't understand it. Orchestra marvellous.
