As for my new compositions, I have nothing apart from an unfinished Trio in G minor which I began shortly after you left. I tried out the first Allegro with the other instruments before going to Sanniki and shall do the same with the rest of it after my return [from Berlin]. I imagine the Trio will have the same fate as my Sonata and 
Variations.
