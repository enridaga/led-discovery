<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">It is so difficult to detail so much pleasure over so many years.&nbsp; The names say it all - Schwarzkopf, de Los Angeles, Gheorgiu, Kissin, Fischer-Dieskau, Klemperer, Davis, Krips, Haitink, LSO Chorus and Orchestra, Vienna Phil and so the list goes on, bringing special and warm memories of a loved and virbrant concert hall, and delightful meeting place. Deeply treasured memories are Peter Pears singing the tenor arias in Messiah under Klemperer, and Schwarzkof's Four Last Songs and Final Act of Capriccio under the young Maazal. But such selection belittles a great era of music in London. Vivat the new RFH and more indelible memories!</p>
