<p>That's the wonderful thing about music: it can be described but not explained.&nbsp; To recycle the tiresome old advertising slogan, it reaches the parts other art forms can't reach. We had another telling example in 1995, at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle, in a play called <em>Shooting the Legend. </em>Max Roberts directed, Tim Healy starred and this time we had an array of songs including a stand-out performance by Tim of 'Mustang Sally'; a Tamla Motown medley featuring Libby Davison (later of T<em>he Bill) </em>Charlie Hardwicke (later of <em>Emmerdale</em>); Denise Welch (later of <em>Coronation Street</em>); and all-join-in audience participation version of a nineteenth century Geordie song called 'Wor Nanny's a Mazer'.</p>
