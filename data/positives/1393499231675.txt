The Sunday morning service in the unequalled Lorenz-Kirche was one of my great gratificationsâ€”a sermon worth hearing and well heard, and at the close, the Benediction pronounced in cadence from the communion-table, and distinctly audible, great as was the distance. The chorus of voices from the entire and numerous congregation had a heart-strengthening effect.
