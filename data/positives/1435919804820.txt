<p>As for bop, I certainly don't have to be convinced about the place it has taken in the jazz scene, because back in 1943, when I had men in my band like Dizzy [Gillespie] and Benny Green and Charlie Parker (Charlie was playing tenor in those days), they were playing just the same style of music that they are playing now. They were very conscientious about it too. They used to carry exercise books with them and would go through the books in the dressing room when we played theatres.</p>
<p>Charlie had a photographic mind. When we would rehearse a new arrangement, he would run his part down once, and when we were ready to play it the second time, he knew the whole thing from memory. Naturally, I have respect for musicians of that caliber.</p>
