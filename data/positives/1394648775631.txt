As I was so much pleas'd with the little my sister played my aunt told me there was a young lady (Miss Wood) who liv'd at the next door to us..., & as Mr Wafer sometimes attended her of an evening, she wo'd ask leave to introduce me there the next evening he came, which she accordingly did, & I was delighted with the effect of the fiddle (which Mr Wafer played) & spinet together.
