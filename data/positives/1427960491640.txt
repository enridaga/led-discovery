Carnegie Hall in 1959 stands out in my mind as one good stop along the way. I'd heard so much about the place and had promised myself I'd play there one day.

The night was especially memorable 'cause we happened to be appearing with Billie Holiday. I hadn't met Lady Day before. This was the very end of her life, and three or four months after this gig she'd be dead.

Her voice was very tired. I could hear how it had deteriorated. But she was a veteran, one of the best singers ever, and she could still whip your ass just from her experience. Yeah, old pros have their long lives to rely on, and even in the end, Lady had wisdom and dignity inside her singing; she could still make you cry like a child.
