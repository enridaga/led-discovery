Go to B.B.C. Concert (area) at 8.15. Henry Wood. Myra Hess plays the Beethoven G maj. after rather a ragged Brandenburg no. 6. She plays it technically v. well, but ridiculous cadenzas, & she & Wood have no idea of the 2nd movement - it's Andante not adagiossississimo. A fine performance of Strauss' Heldenleben to finish with. It contains some marvellous things, & some great scoring, but the common-place harmony of alot of it kills me. The programme is vile I think.*
