<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My first memory of the Royal Festival Hall is being taken to see the Festival Ballet in Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s The Nutcracker when I was four. &nbsp; I was taken by my parents with my brother who was seven as a Christmas treat so it would have been in December 58. &nbsp; Our seats were at the front of the terrace on the aisle and when I sat down I couldn&rsquo;t see, so naturally I stood up.&nbsp; Fortunately I was not in anybody&rsquo;s way so I stood for the whole performance.&nbsp; So did my brother.&nbsp; We were both so enthralled that we barely moved and I remember it very clearly still.&nbsp; I also remember asking my mother to take me down to look at the pit during the interval as I wanted to know where the orchestra was.&nbsp; I could just see over the wall and spent the whole interval there.&nbsp; As I am now Concerts Manager with the London Sinfonietta, one of the South Banks resident orchestras, this was clearly prophetic!&nbsp;</p>
