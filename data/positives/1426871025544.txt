During the 1935 season with Colonel del Basil's Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo we left for a two-day concert visit to Brussels, ostensible to promote British music at the International Exhibition. It was wonderful weather and Sir Thomas was sporting his straw boater; after a good dinner in the Hotel Metropole we all assembled happily in the Salle des Beaux Arts for the concert, only to discover that for some now long-forgotten reason the music appeared to have been impounded by the customs and only our instruments had so far arrived. Quite undaunted, "Tommy" quickly procured the "Meistersinger" Overture and the G minor Symphony of Mozart from a local Library and, without any preliminary announcement, this ad hoc programme was given to a bemused audience. After the interval the music must have arrived because I remember playing the overture to Ethel Smyth's "The Wreckers" which was on the original programme.
