Had the first meeting of our second session of the choral society last night. I haven’t laughed so much for a long time as we all did over our efforts to tackle the ‘Revenge’. Never heard such an infernal sound or such dismal wails. Capt. Blaney endeavoured desperately to get us along over the rough and smooth. Fairly large numbers turned up. Hope the choir will continue to exist as it really is a very pleasant distraction and I do get real enjoyment from it, even though I am tired after being on duty all day. L/Cpl. Chant did the accompaniment and was much amused by the hopeless efforts and wandering wails of the choir. He suggested we should have more practices and we really will need them to tackle this piece, as it is much harder than the ‘Crucifixion’. We have gained much ‘kudos’ for that and seem to have acquitted ourselves quite well, considering it was our first effort.
