We performers who have had the advantage of familiarity with the technique and material of the phonograph for many years are free of the inhibitions that bother some artists in the recording room. Recordings by people who are used to recording therefore often give you the warmth and feeling of a concert hall. Experienced performers don’t think foremost of turning out absolutely impeccable – but cold – records, such as I call “laboratory records”; they strive after a living performance that has the impact of the moment, on that gives you almost a visual impression of the player. Some people try to produce a document. Apparently they have a legalistic obsession to get the “definitive” recording. I am always careful not to let this obsession get me. When I feel that I am losing spontaneity and am hypnotized by the fear of flaws, then I try to get around it in some way; I stop recording that section, jump to the next, and come back later to the other.
