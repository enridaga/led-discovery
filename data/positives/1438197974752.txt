<p>Rest in aft, &amp; have late tea at 5.0 (eggs &amp; things) &amp; go off to opera to see Meistersinger. Any trace of illness is then obliviated by the Prelude, &amp; we enjoy a wonderful evening. Krauss conducted very well - one or two speeds weren't mine but on the whole, fine - the orchestra superb as usual. Prohaska was a very lovable Sachs, who poured forth volumes of lovely sound, &amp; acted excellently. Ursuleac lookd &amp; sounded very lovely as Eva. As Walther, Kalenberg wasnt so good - looked nice &amp; acted well but too small a voice, Beckmesser (Weidemann) &amp; David (Zimmermann) both first-rate actors &amp; singers, the first rather pathetic in his comedy, the second lively to the utmost degree. The five hours of the music didn't seem as many minutes; the incredible vitality, modernity, richness &amp; lovely melody, humour, pathos in fact every favorable quality. As a stage show, just 'it'; esp. the glorious Act 2</p>
