As to the Zarzuela (opera comique) ... music generally imported, becomes, by an easy process, Spanish at the frontier. I was informed the other night, that `La prova di un opera seria,' called here `Campanone' was Spanish, and (oh shade of Rossini!) that the `Barber of Seville' was Spanish music arranged by an Italian! And (en parenth√®se) what a treat to listen to these thrilling Italian notes, and that true voice of melody in which they speak, after the inanities to which I have been accustomed by national composers, ignorant of what true music means.
