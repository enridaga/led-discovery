<p>The last piece in the programme was <em>The Rite of Spring</em>. This I listened to with great absorption, and once again decided that I liked it better in a staged than a concert performance. Heard in concert <em>Sacre </em>is formless, but when it is staged this very formlessness is its own justification. It is just the other way round with <em>Les Noces</em>: there I find the staging unnecessary, seeming to have been tacked on. That work I should very much like to hear in concert form. After <em>Sacre</em> I ran into Stravinsky in the corridor, and going up to him clapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Bravo, well done, old man!' I meant 'old man' in the affectionate way the French use 'mon vieux', but Stravinsky flared up at once: 'As if you weren't an old man yourself!' he snapped, and rushed off without saying goodbye, leaving the bystanders in a state of amused astonishment.</p>
