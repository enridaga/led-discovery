<p>Letter from Bunsen to one of his Sons, Heidelberg: last evening of the year 1854 - The melodious bells of all the churches are ringing out the old year&mdash;in the church a full and devout congregation have been singing, with trombone accompaniment, 'Nun danket Alle Gott!'&mdash;and your mother and I have said together with tearful eyes, ' Praise the Lord, for He is gracious, and His mercy endureth for ever ! Who maketh the lame to walk, and the blind to see ! What is man that Thou so regardest him, or the son of man that Thou so visitest him? ' Lord ! I am not worthy of the goodness and mercy which Thou hast shown me! What a year this has been ! how dark was everything when the old year was hastening to its close! Once a gleam of hope appeared, but who would trust it? and immediately after the sky darkened altogether.</p>
