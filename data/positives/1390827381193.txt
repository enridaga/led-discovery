Thomas Twining to John Hey, Bristol, May 31, 1762
We have a very delectable Irish counsellor & his wife with us at present. Just come from Dublin on account of his health. A very good Lion-like man in a great coal-black wig. But his wife is far the best man. She is rank Irish, & never was in England before: has the brogue as strong as any Irishman in a play: calls her husband "Honey", & "dear Honey". The first day they din’d with us he happen’d to say that in Ireland they often danc’d to a dulcimer & fiddle, & that it was very good dancing.
