My big thrill in Birmingham was having a chance to talk with the Whitman Sisters, very light-skinned women who developed some of the best of our Negro performers. Like Gus Edwards, the Whitmans helped many talented youngsters make their start. Some of their protégés are still around. 

We opened the act I was doing with Jo Hill with a duet, followed by Jo's song and specialty dance. Then I'd sing my blues and we'd close, wearing our short dresses for the kid routine.
