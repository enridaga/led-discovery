<p>We attended, last Sabbath, the Church &ldquo;De l&rsquo;oratoire,&rdquo; one of the old Calvinistic churches of France. The church contained a good-sized organ, which was indifferently played. There was no choir. The organ led, and was followed by a very nasal precentor&rsquo;s voice, with a few of the congregation joining in humming under tone;- one of the worst specimens of Congregational singing we have heard, yet interesting by association, for it carried us in imagination to our home country (beloved) where we have sometimes heard similar attempts. At this, and the associate churches, the old psalms of Clement, Marot, and Theodore Beza, with the tunes originally set to them, are still sung. But the tunes have recently been much injured, nay spoiled, by a rythmical arrangement by Wilhelm. He has introduced dotted notes, which, with other things, makes them so difficult, that a congregation cannot keep together in singing them.</p>
