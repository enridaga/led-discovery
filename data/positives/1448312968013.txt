<p>An excellent military band plays daily at eleven o&rsquo;clock. It contains about sixty instruments, and we were truly glad to see that the use of the old-fashioned military band instruments is continued. Here were Oboi, Faggotti, Clarinetti, Corni, as well as all the modern brass instruments. The band usually play an overture and one or two smaller pieces daily, at the hour above mentioned; and in its performances, it is sufficient to say, that the characteristics of good orchestral playing are carefully observed.</p>
