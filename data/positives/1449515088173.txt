<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I remember Dudley Moore's first ever solo performance (for charity) in one of the recital rooms. This would have been around 1959 and it was sheer joy.I knew then that I was seeing a star in the making.The reason I attended was that I had already seen him as the pianist with the Johnny Dankworth orchestra.</p>
