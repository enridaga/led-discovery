<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My happy memories are numerous. Sir Malcolm Sargent rehearsing The Messiah with the Huddersfield Ladies Choir. He made them repeat a phrase several time until it was perfect and tears came to my eyes. This rehearsal was better than the actual performance which was good. Seeing Princess Diana at the ballet performance, head shyly down but smiling. Talking cricket with Michael Parkinson, travelling down the performer's lift with Jane Asher and discussing dyeing eyebrows , I am a redhead too. I felt as a programme seller we were part of an excelllent team at the heart of London's concert excellence. My team leader was Peggy Lox on a Thursday, we still keep in touch and I am now 75.</p>
