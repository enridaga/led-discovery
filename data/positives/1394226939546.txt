On the 19th I rode to Winton Races w'th Godfrey eyc. from whence I went on to attend the Race Concert, which was now, Mr Kent being dead carried on by Mr Fussell, who succeeded him in his places of organist to the Cathedral & College. At this I played with Basset of Southton the leader, being the 1st. time I had ever been promoted to so high a post at any concert of this kind. Catches & glees beginning now to be introduc'd in concerts; at this were perform'd the glee "How merrily we live" & the catch "Twas you Sir," the former of w'ch I was much pleas'd with. As to the latter, as it requir'd humour, & was certainly fitter for a convivial party than a public concert Mr Corfe who with Barrett of Sarum sang in them, was rather apprehensive of meeting wiht a hiss.
