<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">That Vecsey-Saint-Sa&euml;ns affair happened as follows: We were in Portugal, in Oporto, at the time. Saint-Sa&euml;ns was also there. Papa Vecsey was intent on bringing him and Frankie together. I don&rsquo;t know which concerto was to be &lsquo;performed&rsquo;, I can&rsquo;t remember even the key, nor anything else about it, except that the son played the (end) andante movement at an impossibly slow tempo &ndash; obviously following his father&rsquo;s advice. The composer arrived in the room of the hotel, and we started to play. When we reached the 2<span style="font-size: xx-small;">nd</span>&nbsp;movement, Saint-Sa&euml;ns interrupted with: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to play it like that', and, going up to the piano, he corrected it to a proper andante tempo. That made this otherwise boring (at least for me) piece at least tolerable. Saint-Sa&euml;ns then left, and old Vecsey burst out, &lsquo;Oh, he does not understand, he is not a violinist!&rsquo; </span></p>
