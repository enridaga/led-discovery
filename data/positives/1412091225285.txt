Listening to music was a shared experience..., whether on the radio or stereo; it was part of the thing. This business now, where each person has a set of earphones plugged into their head and they alone can hear the music, still looks a bit odd to me. I was on the tube recently and there was a group of girls, aged fifteen or sixteen. Two of them had earphones in and the others were looking at their mobiles. There was no shared sense of being a group at all. In my day we would have been chattering away and sharing our thoughts.
