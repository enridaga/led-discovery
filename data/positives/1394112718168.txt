Imediately after the concert, a fellow of a most consumate impudence mounted the orchestra to perform an imitation of diff't birds, as introduced in & accompanying a symphony played by the orchestra, which he appear'd to lead having a solid piece of wood shap'd like a fiddle & struck with a stick instead of a bow, with w'ch he imitated the manner of a leader of the band at the same time he introduced the notes of different birds with his voice. This as something new seem'd to please much during the 1st. movement (tho' some of the clergy & grave gentry did not seem to like suh an exhibition being tack'd onto an oratorio) some of his imitations, particularly a kind of screeching in some of the forte parts being so comical as to make Dr P. Hayes who had conducted the oratorio & still sat in the orchestra shake his fat sides & much divert the young Linley's. This however being succeded by a slow movement, the audience in general seem'd to have had enough of it & begn a chatteration all over the room. But when another movement still succeeded, & that of a light trifling nature, many of the audience began to express their disapprobation by hissing, hooting etc, whilst another party clapt. The man however seem'd quite undaunted & perserver'd to the last, imitating the exaggerated gestures of a conductor, concluding amidst a tumult of applause & disapprobation.
