Probably the most successful production of our first year was "Turandot" with sets by Leslie Hurry and Dame Eva Turner in the title role. She was already in her middle fifties but her magnificent voice had lost none of its power and only a little of its sharpness of definition. Constant Lambert conducted and before the first night the tenor, Walter Midgley, came down to see me and asked to mark various pauses he intended to make very clearly in the score so Lambert could not miss them.
"Is he still having trouble following singers, then?" I asked innocently.
"Follows?" cried Midgley in his curiously high voice, "He couldn't follow an open bottle of Chanel down Piccadilly on a hot night!"
