<p>IN 1855 I thought the time had now arrived when I should give a public concert, as I had a good connection and many friends and pupils, having also made the acquaintance of many distinguished people at Lady Waldegrave's. I gave my first London concert at the old Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square, on June 14th, and have given annual concerts ever since. The audience included Lady Waldegrave and many of the musical circle I had met at Nuneham. The concert was most successful, and at its close I received many congratulations. I played Weber's "Concertstuck" with quartette accompaniment and felt very nervous; but it went off very well. Among the artists who assisted me were Herr Heinrich Ernst, the great violin virtuoso, and Herr Alexander Reichardt, the popular tenor from Vienna, whose pretty song, "Thou art so near and yet so far," became a great favourite with singers.</p>
