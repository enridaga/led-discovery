<p>Memories are abundant over such a long period of time and very many visits to the RFH. Beautiful music in comfortable surroundings and listening, over the years, to the world's greatest artists. Apart from the above, the wonderful ballet performances given by Festival Ballet, not forgetting the early evening organ recitals. The mailing list small booklet was always eagerly awaited. As they say "those were the days"! Needless to say my home was near by. Living in Cornwall is a fairly recent move, but still looking forward to the reopening!</p>
