<p class="MsoNormal">I&rsquo;ve spoken about Evlyn Howard-Jones and the piano.&nbsp; He was a friend of John Ireland, Bax, Goossens, and that school of music, as well as Cyril Scott.&nbsp; On the other hand, Holst was a friend of Vaughan Williams, and the two schools of thought were much opposed to each other.&nbsp; Howard-Jones said rather nasty things about Vaughan Williams&rsquo;s school, and the other side said equally nasty things (although not quite so much) about the school that Howard-Jones championed.&nbsp; But Holst didn&rsquo;t know much about what was being produced by these other composers, so that, very often, when I had little to show him he would say, &ldquo;would you play me some piano music&rdquo; of whoever it might be &ndash; Delius, Bax, or Ireland &ndash; and he would listen to it very silently and say nothing at the end, so I wasn&rsquo;t aware of whether he liked it or not. &nbsp;But he was interested in hearing it anyway.</p>
