<p>[S]uch reminiscences as I have retained of music&nbsp;and musicians in Belgrade are exclusively connected&nbsp;with the foreign element of that capital's population.&nbsp;When I first paid it a brief visit, nearly twenty years&nbsp;ago, the mighty fortress for the possession of which&nbsp;Moslem and Christian have so often and fiercely fought&nbsp;in times long past, was still in the hands of the Turks,&nbsp;and the first music, or that which was intended to be so,&nbsp;produced for my especial delectation, as the honoured guest&nbsp;of the worthy old Pasha in command of the garrison, was of a nature to all but petrify me with astonishment and&nbsp;and consternation. Having gleaned from the British&nbsp;Diplomatic Agent, with whom I was staying, that I was&nbsp;a music-lover, His Excellency Ali Riza, bent, in the fulness of his heart, upon giving me the greatest artistic&nbsp;treat of which he could dispose, despatched the full band&nbsp;of the artillery regiment constituting the bulk of his&nbsp;garrison, to the court-yard of the British Agency at an&nbsp;early hour of the morning after the banquet at which he&nbsp;had entertained me with profuse Oriental hospitality.&nbsp;This band, some forty strong and brass to a man, except&nbsp;the drums and a peal of silver bells intermingled with&nbsp;horse-tails, received orders to take up a position exactly&nbsp;under the bedroom window of the newly-arrived English Effendi, and there, at precisely seven a.m., to open upon him with the March of Sultan Mechmet &mdash; by many degrees the most vigorous concerted piece in the Ottoman&nbsp;military orchestral repertoire.</p>
