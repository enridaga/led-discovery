To Westminster hall; and not finding Mrs. Lane, with whom I purposed to be merry, I went to Jervas's and took him and his wife over the water to their mother Palmers (the woman that speaks in the belly and with whom I had two or three years ago so good sport with Mr. Mallard), thinking, because I had heard that she is a woman of that sort, that I might there have light upon some lady of pleasure (for which God forgive me); but blessed be God, there was none nor anything that pleased me - but a poor little house which she hath set out as fine as she can. And for her singing which she pretends to, is only some old bawdy songs, and those sung abominably; only, she pretends to be able to sing both bass and treble; which she doth, something like but not like what I thought formerly and expected now.
