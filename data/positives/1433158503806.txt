"By request Dr. Elvey has composed an anthem for the Gloucester Festival. He has adapted passages from the 97th Psalm as part of his text, and the words of the Psalmist have inspired him with the happiest thoughts that have yet helped him to rank honourably among our most meritorious composers for the Church. 
" This anthem is in D major, and it opens with a spirited chorus, 'The Lord is King/ and terminates with a clever fugato, ' For His mercy endureth for ever."
It abounds in beautiful passages, and the choruses are very grand and massive. The principal singers, orchestra, and chorus appear to vie with each other in giving effect to it. The chorus, 'Clouds and Darkness' is exceedingly effective, and the double chorus, 'At His sight the mountains are shaken' is dramatic in expression, the music being made to convey the spirit of the
words. ' The concluding chorus is a clever specimen of writing, and displays Dr. Elvey's ability as a composer.
