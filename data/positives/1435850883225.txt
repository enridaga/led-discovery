<p>Diz [Dizzy Gillespie] continued to work on these beautiful patterns, and I think that was the start of the new sounds. Next thing I heard of there was a character in town called Bird [Charlie Parker] who had worked with Jay McShann and another called the Mad Monk [Thelonius Monk], and they played at Monroe's. They would meet there in the mornings and play those sounds and experiment with harmonies. When I heard Bird for the first time I didn't pay it no mind because I had heard benny Carter and Hilton Jefferson. They are still great today, and Hilton was then doing some of the same things. Ever heard Hilton run a progression right out of the key? It seems like as long as I have heard Hilton Jefferson he was always a cat who excited all the other sax players and had their respect.</p>
