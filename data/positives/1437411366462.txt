<pre>On our last night in Limerick, just in the middle of a most impressive and <br />beautiful duet, which Catalani and I were singing in "Didone," and at a moment <br />when the whole house was wrapt in attention, a man vociferated from the gallery, <br />"Mr. Kelly, will you be good enough to favour us with <em>O thou wert born to please </em><br /><em>me?</em>" This unexpected request produced a loud laugh from the audience. Catalani 
asked me what the meaning of it was ; I answered, that it was nothing but a <br />peculiar manner of applauding. My gallery friend, I suppose, recollected poor <br />Mrs. Crouch and myself, singing "<em>Oh; thou wert born to please me</em>," at the same <br />theatre many years previous, and wished to hear it again. </pre>
