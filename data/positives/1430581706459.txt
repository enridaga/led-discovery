<p>[... W]e had a booking at a festival in Newport, Rhode Island. This wasn't the old Newport Jazz Festival, [...]&nbsp;but a smaller-scale show set in Fort Adams State Park.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>The show itself went off without a hitch. Though they played well, Miles and the band didn't try for the heights they'd reached in Japan. It was simply too pleasant a place and too nice a day for such explorations, so Miles toyed with the band instead, engaging in some call-and-response blues lines with Sam Morrison, our new sax player.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>[&hellip; Later that evening] I got out my Sony tape player, and put in the 'Jack Johnson&rsquo; tape. By the time "Yesternow" was done, and I'd flipped it over to "Right Off," I was fairly well lubricated. I started telling Miles [who arranged and played on the LP, &lsquo;Jack Johnson&rsquo;] all about the music, urging him to listen to what the guitar does, showing him how the organ builds and then breaks. I even explained him what the trumpet player was doing! I got more and more excited, raving on about how great the record was, while Miles just looked at me, wide-eyed. Occasionally he'd laugh and say, "Oh really?" as I made another point.</p>
<p>[...] The next morning, all he said to me was, "Chris you sure are funny when you're drunk."</p>
