I caught the tail end of her class [Jan DeGaetani]. Jan's more patient that I, entering on individual singers and discussing their technical vocal problems (or virtues) in relation to the texts they sing, while I'm inclined to address the audience, using the singers as mannequins whom I publicly reclothe in the memory of how I happened to compose this or that song. Jan, of course, is discussing other people's songs and how to approach them technically, while I (in a classroom situation with energy) almost always discuss just my songs and how to approach them literarily.
