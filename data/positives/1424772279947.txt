How will the German Dr. affect you and Mr. Schirmer next Tuesday? [The first American performance of Richard Strauss’s Salome at the Metropolitan Opera House, January 27, 1907] Please tell me all about it after the première. I hope to hear it later too; then I shall probably enjoy my staying with you much more than the opera. I have misgivings! Dr. Heitzel played to me some of the important scenes. They may be theatrically effective – beautiful they are not.
