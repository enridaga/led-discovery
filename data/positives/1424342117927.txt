I remember in the ‘prehistoric’ days of gramophone recording hearing on a cylindrical Edison record a lovely melody that Kreisler had played into it. It was not published and I recollect taking it down bit by bit, a laborious process which involved many hours of really concentrated listening. Eventually I produced this melody as an ‘Air on the G string’ which I have to this day in manuscript. Ultimately Kreisler’s playing of it into this Edison contraption was published and turned out to be entitled Sarabande by Sulzer. My version was in a different key with variations in the piano part and slight alterations here and there in the solo part.
