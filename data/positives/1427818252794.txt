<p>Some years ago, in 1864, Professor Ruskin asked him to come and play to a school of young girls in whom he was greatly interested. My father readily consented, and as the Professor was there himself, and it was the first time he had played to him, he was careful to select what was most great and beautiful, and played his very best. When it was all over and my father was about to leave, one of the girls told him she had been practising Thalberg's arrangement of ' Home, Sweet Home,' and would very much like to hear my father play it before he went away. He told her it was a pity they should listen to a trivial thing like that after the beautiful music they had just heard, but as she appeared disappointed and some other girls came forward with the same request, he gave way, sat down again, and played it. To his chagrin, Ruskin, who had been politely appreciative, now became enthusiastic and told him that was the piece he liked best far and away. Of course my father said nothing at the time.</p>
