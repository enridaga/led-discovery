<p>The symphony [Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s Fourth] formed the second half of the concert.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After the interval, Ken and I in our best suits silently filed on to the platform with the French horns and took our place alongside them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The camera, draped with all the cloth we could find to muffle its sound, stood alongside Ken like some unfamiliar addition to the percussionist&rsquo;s battery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Ken focused it on the podium and locked it off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All he then had to do was unobtrusively to reach up and press the start button.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>He wasn&rsquo;t sure of the right point to do this but I knew the symphony well, particularly after having sat through four performances of it so recently.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So I would give him a nudge.</p>
