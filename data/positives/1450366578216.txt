<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Recently, in Japan, I was fascinated by a plectrum instrument with movable bridges, moved, that is, while being played. I do not forget that such traditional symphonic instruments as clarinet, trumpet and trombone are not the same when played by jazz artists, who seem to have greater variety in articulation and tone colour, and to be at ease in higher ranges &ndash; on the trumpet, for instance &ndash; than symphonic players.&nbsp;</span></p>
