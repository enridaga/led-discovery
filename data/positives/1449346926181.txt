<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">It must have been around 1957/58 that the school that I was attending took us to see "Peter and the Wolf".&nbsp; It was my first introduction to "serious" music and gave me a lasting appreciation of music.&nbsp; I am reminded of that first visit whenever I am at the South Bank, whichever venue I happen to be going to. &nbsp;</p>
