<p>John Peel's Meltdown Festival in 1998 - one of the best gigs I've ever seen. The Delgados to open - they should be so much bigger and better known than they are, they were totally bewitching. Then Spiritualized, mesmerising, amazing sound, the best I have ever seen them. Finally Sonic Youth, my favourite band of all time, an absolutely storming set - a perfect evening.</p>
