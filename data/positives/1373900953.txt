28 June, 1819. - In the course of the last week, a Lutheran clergyman arrived, as chaplain to the Prussian Embassy, in consequence of Mr. Niebuhr's representations to the King of Prussia of the great need in which the numerous colony of German Protestants at Rome stood of having a person among them whose office should be to keep alive a sense of religion, and counteract the influence of Catholic priests, by which so many conversions have been effected: and service was for the first time performed yesterday, at Mr. Niebuhr's, to a congregation of seventy persons.... The service consisted of prayers and hymns, and two chapters from the New Testament.... The prayers were those of Luther.... The hymns were all belonging to the period of the Reformation, both words and music, and one was composed by Luther himself.
