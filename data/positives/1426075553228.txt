Yesterday I went to a soiree at Soliva's where there was practically no one else apart from the Sowans and the Gressers. Gladkowska sang an aria which Soliva had expressly composed for her and inserted into the opera; this aria is to be her 
show-piece and there are in fact some lovely things in it. He has managed to suit her voice perfectly.
