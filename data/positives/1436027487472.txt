<p>Chicago was really jumping around that time (1923). The Dreamland was in full bloom. The Lincoln Gardens, of course, was still in there. The Plantation was another hot spot at that time. But the Sunset, my boss' place, was the sharpest of them all, believe that. A lot of after-hour spots were real groovy, too. There was the Apex, where Jimmie Noone and that great piano man, Hines, started all this fine stuff your 'yars listen to nowadays. They made history right there in the Apex. The tune, "Sweet Lorraine", used to gas everybody there nightly. I was one of the everybodies.</p>
