In the evening went with Tiny to the beautiful new English Opera House in Shaftsbury Avenue [now the Palace Theatre, built in 1888-90], to see Sir Arthur Sullivan’s Ivanhoe. I can’t say we cared for it: the music is “Wagner and water,” to use Rainald’s phrase. Some of the orchestra music is good, specially in the third act, but there is a truly Wagnerian absence of tune and somehow there is something wrong with the mise en scène; it is pinchbeck and tawdry. Miss McIntyre [Margaret McIntyre 1865-1943; British soprano] sang well.
