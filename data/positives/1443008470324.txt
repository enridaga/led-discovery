<p>I took heart enough to pack Paul's parcel: <em>Lost Summer</em> was in.&nbsp; The singer a Nan Merriman with an extremely wide, dark-coloured vigorous mezzo-soprano - an Amneris voice; and a very good serious method.&nbsp; The music I still cannot assess, for my heart is too much in it.&nbsp; But listening to the 2 river songs I could say, It is justified, I can accept that then, for this music that has come out of it.&nbsp;</p>
