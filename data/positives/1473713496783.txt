<p>The following morning there was a <em>matin&eacute;e&nbsp;musicale</em> at the house of the same Princess&nbsp;of Hesse-Barchfeld. The Frankfort String&nbsp;Quartet, Hugo Heermann leading, had come&nbsp;over for the purpose. Brahms played with&nbsp;them his Quartet in C Minor, Op. 60, and&nbsp;then accompanied me in the longest, and to&nbsp;me the finest, of his romances from Tieck's&nbsp;beautiful <em>Magellone</em>, " Wie soll ich die Freude,&nbsp;die Wonne denn tragen," Op. 33, No. 6.</p>
