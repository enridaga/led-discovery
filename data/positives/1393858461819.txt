July 27th & 28th We have had nothing very special happening. We have had an awful fog for the last 24 hrs & are getting pretty sick of it. Tonight Rebie & I are going to a concert at the Pavilion & Mrs. King Hall is joining us at it. Ruth Vincent is singing at it. 

July 29th We much enjoyed the concert last night. It was very good, & Ruth Vincent sang beautifully. 

I heard the machine gun men called out in the night. They made such a noise. I got out of bed & looked out, but there was such a thick fog that it seemed almost incredible that any aircraft could be about.
