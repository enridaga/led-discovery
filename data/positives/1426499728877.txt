Best known among the many Viennese entertainments are those evenings in the beer-halls where Strauss or Lanner (who correspond to the Swieszewskis in Warsaw) play waltzes during supper. After each waltz the applause is terrific: but if they play a "quodlibet", i.e. a pot-pourri of opera-tunes, songs and dances, the audience are so delighted that they can scarcely contain themselves. It just shows you how corrupted the taste of the Viennese public is.
