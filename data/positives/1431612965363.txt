While staying at Munich, we were asked to assist at a grand concert, at which the Elector, the Electress, and their Court were present ; the band consisted of several eminent performers, among whom was the famous violin player, Frantzl, who performed a concerto in a masterly manner ; and a most excellent female singer of the name of Dussek ; and the next morning we set off for Augsbourg.
