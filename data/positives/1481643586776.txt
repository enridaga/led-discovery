<p>{Christmas in Leipzig: On christmas Eve, 1887, Grieg invited me, Sinding and Halvorsen to spend Christmas Eve at his rooms, and a very delightful evening it was. After a hearty supper and a good deal of wine, we had music: Mrs Grieg singing all Grieg's Vinje songs most beautifully, Halvorsen playing the C minor Violin Sonata, Sinding accompanying Mrs Grieg to several of his own songs, and I playing a piano piece I had just composed - a Norwegian Sleigh-Ride. We had all had rather more than was good for us to drink, and left in the early hours of the morning. As a Christmas present, Grieg gave me his Piano Concerto with a dedication.}</p>
