<p class="MsoNormal">[The] Havana troupe was notable for its corps of fine singers, among them being some of the world&rsquo;s foremost artists. Tedesco, the soprano, was truly a great dramatic singer. After the Boston season was over, she went to Paris, and easily won the first place in all European opera houses. Then there was Vita, the contralto, a splendid singer, second only to Alboni. Then came Perelli, the tenor, who was a fine singer, a thorough musician, and a remarkable pianist This artist after leaving Boston made his home in Philadelphia. There was also Novelli, a magnificent basso, who became well known in Boston, as he visited that city many times subsequently.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The opera had a good effective chorus, and a complete orchestra, with Arditi (afterward so well known) as <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">maestro</em>, or conductor, and first violin,&mdash;it being the custom in those days for the leader to beat time with his bow, playing on his violin when he desired to assist or to animate his men. [&hellip;] I must not omit to say that Arditi was a true virtuoso on the violin.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">[&hellip;] They had for contrabasso the world-renowned Bottesini, a veritable Paganini on his big instrument. The troupe performed but three times per week. That also was the prevailing custom of the day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was customary for the troupe to give concerts in the theatre on Saturday evenings, on which occasions Arditi and Bottesini played solos.</p>
