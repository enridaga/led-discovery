Sitting with my husband in the "choir stalls" (being used as overspill for the audience) during the playing of the 1812 overture, when the over enthusiastic bursts of  "smoke" from the apertures above our heads not only made the audience disappear from our sight but also the orchestra sitting just feet in front of us!  For a short while we were isolated in time and space!
