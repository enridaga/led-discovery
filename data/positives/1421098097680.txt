<p>With Mother, yesterday morn, to rehearsal at Met of Barrault's Carmen. (We leave at intermission.) Dine at Shirley's. Messiaen-Loriod recital at Hunter College. (At intermission we bump into Morton Feldman who's lost a dramatic amount of weight. I mention this to him. "Yes," he answers, "ten more pounds, then I'll publish The Brooklyn Diary of Morty Feldman.") Reception at the Morotsirs'. Baths. Review new Beatles record for Village Voice. Evening, to see Mame with Jerry Lawrence. (He laughs appreciatively at his own script.)</p>
