<p>At the close of the concert, the most exciting scene perhaps of the whole four days was witnessed, namely, the announcement of the successful competitors in song, and the presentation of the prizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A half-circle was formed around the prize committee, who had taken seats around the stage just in the rear of the table on which were placed the shining vessels of gold and silver. Amidst the loudest shouts the Burgermeister Hammers ascended the tribune to announce the decision of the judges.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Each of these announcements was received with the waving of banners, the blast of trumpets, the rolling of drums, and the loud cheering of the multitude, which continued while the Mayor took from the table the prize, as it was announced, and handed it to the President of the Society to which it had been awarded. As soon as the cheering would permit, the President of the Bonn &ldquo;Concordia&rdquo; jumped upon the tribune and called for three times &ldquo;Hurrah, and long life and prosperity to the friends in Dusseldorf,&rdquo; to which a most enthusiastic response was given. These ceremonies were all over by about ten o&rsquo;clock[.]</p>
