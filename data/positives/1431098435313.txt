Shift the scene to the Princess's Theatre, with Charles Kean and his wife in The Winter's Tale; "Time" (the prologue) rolling forward on a great ball; the Sheepshearing Scene; Autolycus (Horatio Saker); the statue at the end of the play, and a little girl–whose better acquaintance I am proud to have made in after ten years–Ellen Terry as Mamillius . . . The excellent music was by John L. Hatton, whom I knew when his mind was failing, and he had no recollection of this beautiful production.
