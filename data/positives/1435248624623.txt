I like great big ole tears. That's why I liked [Artie] Whetsol. When he played the funeral march in "Black and Tan Fantasy", I used to see great, big ole tears running down people's facesâ€¦ Bubber used to say, "if it ain't got swing, it ain't worth playin'; if it ain't got gutbucket, it ain't worth doing."
