Go with Lauricella to a L.S.O. concert at Albert Hall - Beecham. HÃ¤nsel & Gretel ov. - charming. Haydn's delightful 3rd Symph.* v. well played. Delius' Pft. Conc. (Katherine Goodson). Don't like the work - Liszt & Tchaikovsky, not much Delius. Beethoven Symp. 2 very well played. V. spirited under Beecham only first mov. too fast.
