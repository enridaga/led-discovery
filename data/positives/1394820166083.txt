I go to College for lesson with Ireland, but he doesn't turn up (rehearsal); & I walk back to Prince's Sq. for a time, & go back at 12.0 for Mr. Allchin's class. Practise 2.0-4.0 in afternoon. Go (having had early dinner) to Queen's Hall & prom. - Purcell trumpet Voluntary, Goossen's Oboe Concerto (beautiful, monotonous, impossibly gorgeously, immortally played by LÃ©on [Goossens]). Two V. William's songs; J. Ireland Pft Concerto (very beautiful, interesting & excellently played). Elgar 2nd Symphony, (dreadful (nobilmente sempre) - I come out after 3rd movement - so bored. He [Elgar] conducts - ovation beforehand (!!!!!!!!!!)
