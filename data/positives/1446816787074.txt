<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">On Tuesday 23rd March 2004 the RFH Organ's 50th Birthday Concert was in my mind one of the most memorable concerts in all the time I have been going to the RFH. With the London Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by David Hill, one heard Dame Gillian Weir, Thomas Trotter, John Scott and Nicholas Kynaston all playing great organ works, one after another with a wonderful orchestra. It was a night never to be forgotten.</p>
