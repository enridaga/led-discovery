The first concert of the society was held on December 5th, 1868, and was a very successful one.
For these concerts Sir George composed several pieces ; among others, "The Zetland Fishermen" "Softly, softly, blow, ye breezes," " Hark ! those voices," "Shall I wasting in despair," "Love under friendship's vesture," "Bright may the sun shine o'er him," written for the birthday of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, 1868.
