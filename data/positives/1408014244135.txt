I finish my rewritten Variations in morning & after lunch. Practise 11.30–12.45, & 2.15–4.15 with Lauricella, with whom I play Greig G min. Sonata & Mov 1 of Dvorak’s Vln Concerto (A min) which he plays magnificently. Go to H Reeves after tea & get Saint Saen’s 4th Pft. Concerto, soiled soiled (where, I know not!) for 3/- instead of 4/-. Play cards (Rummy) with Mr Gates & Mr Summers 2 of the new people here. Barbara rings up.
