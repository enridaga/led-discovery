<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The twenty-first day of September was the obsequy of the Baron of Dudley, Sir John Dudley, at Westminster at the back side of St. Margaret. And there was at his burial priest and clerks&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #006699;" name="hl1"></a><span class="hilite1" style="background-color: #ffff00;">singing</span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;in Latin, the priest having a cope and the clerk having the holy water sprinkle in his hand. And after, a mourner bearing his standard and after another bearing his helmet, mantles, and the crest&mdash;a blue lion head standing upon a crown of gold&mdash;and after another mourner bearing his target and another his sword. And after came Mr. Somerset, the herald, bearing his coat of arms of gold and silver. And then the corpse covered with cloth of gold to the ground and four of his men bearing him and his arms hung upon the cloth of gold. And twelve men of his servants bearing twelve staff torches burning to the church. And in the choir was a hearse made of timber and covered with black and arms upon the black. And after came the mourners, a great company. And before the dirge began, the herald came to the choir door and prayed for his soul by his style. And so began the dirge sung in Latin, all the lessons, and then the herald prayed for before Mass. And so the Mass sung in Latin. And after, his helmet offered and coat and target. And after all was ended, offered the standard and the banner of arms. And so home to dinner. And there was goodly ringing and a great dole.</span></p>
