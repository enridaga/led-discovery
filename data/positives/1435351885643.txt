<p>On January the 1st, 1791, was produced at Drury Lane, the opera of " The Siege of Belgrade." The drama was written by Cobb, the music by Storace. The under-plot of this opera was taken from the Italian piece of " La Cosa Kara," which had been originally taken from a Spanish drama. There was a good deal of beautiful original music in it, by Storace, who, with his great taste and knowledge of effect, had also selected some from Martini. The opera was received with great applause, and was performed the first season sixty nights to overflowing houses. The acting of Mrs. Crouch, in the "Letter Duet," with the Seraskier, was beyond all praise, and Palmer's bye-play was excellent. One night, during the performance, an accident occurred which gave me great uneasiness : in the battle scene, between Palmer and myself, when fighting with scimetars, he left his head totally unguarded, and received so severe a blow in the forehead, that the blood spouted all over the stage; luckily, the wound was not sufficiently serious to confine him, although he was obliged to wear a black patch on his forehead for a length of time. In justice to poor Palmer, I must say he bore his misfortune with the greatest good humour.</p>
