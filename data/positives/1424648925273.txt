Last Sunday I attended Mass in the Heiligkreuzkirche and at ten oâ€™clock I went to Herr Stein. That was on the 19th. We rehearsed a few symphonies for the concert. Afterwards I lunched with my uncle at the Heiligkreuz Monastery. During the meal we had some music. In spite of their poor fiddling I prefer the monastery players to the Augsburg orchestra.
