<p>At that time [1928] Bix [Beiderbecke's] piano composition "In a Mist" had not yet been published and I had been trying to learn it from the records. I'd been having trouble with it and I asked Bix to show me how it went. Bix sat down next to me at the piano and began playing the parts with which I'd been having trouble. I shall remember that piano lesson as long as I live.</p>
