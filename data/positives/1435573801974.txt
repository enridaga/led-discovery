Sunday Feb. 13. Discovered the Morels in a new and delightful house terraced on the hill at the back of the town, with a wonderful look down on to the  great churches. I was recognized by Isabelle, who opened the door to me, and 
Madame gradually put the pieces of me together, like a kind of jig-saw in her memory. I stayed to tea. It was all very good, this revisiting, and they were glad to see me. I did not see Monsieur. But one rarely did. The pensionnaires were an English Army Pay Officer, and three boys (French), one of them a diminutive violinist, very shy. I played on his diminutive violin the Allegro of the Leclair Sonata by request, Madame remembering it from 1909.
