<p>Went with Schubert to the Grand Op&eacute;ra for a performance of <em>Boris Godunov</em>. Koshetz in the part of Marina. An appalling production - Paris should be ashamed of an institution like this! It was limp, incoherent, the scenery ancient, in short a disgrace.

All the same, she is having great success in paris and neighbouring countries, and has eclipsed Janacopulos.</p>
