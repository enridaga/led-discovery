At 5p.m. there is a rehearsal of the Bach Flute Suite in the Dome, and immediately the music resumes its ambiguous quality, which had seemed to disappear in the last concert. The group is divided into two parts, one of which wants the music to be more flowing and more directional in its phrasing, while the other wants poise, the slow swing of the musical pendulum. The acoustical problems of the last performance are greatly relieved by the addition of Nina Wurman on double bass, and listening from outside the Dome I'm aware of what, for the first time, seems the correct balance between treble and bass instruments. I get chatting to the Head of the BBC Transcription Service, who compliments the group on its playing and compares it very favourably to the Baroque playing of a well-known group appearing in the Official Festival.
