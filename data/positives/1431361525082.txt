<p>So many of the operatic mishaps have passed from one story-teller to another that I have on occasion been told coldly, when relating one of my own personal experiences, that this event took place somewhere else and in another opera. I can only say that I have no need of "set pieces"; if I tell a story then I was there! A particular example of this "Russian Scandal" effect concerns a night on tour in Manchester in the fifties (most disasters seemed to happen on tour) when, the pit being too small to seat the full orchestra for "A&iuml;da", we had to open the door under the stage and overflow into the passage. As the Radames called pathetically in the last scene in the tomb: "A&iuml;da, where are thou?" he was answered by a rusty clanking and flushing from the stage hands' lavatory which could be clearly heard in the auditorium and was greeted by a roar of laughter.</p>
