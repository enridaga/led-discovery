The second show was "Othello" with Abraham Sofaer and Maurice Browne as Iago. The band was slightly larger then and my friend Wilfred Hambleton, later bass clarinet with the Philharmonia, joined us. Shakespeare was generally well expurgated then but on Saturday nights they put the rude bits back. During the long spells of inaction for us we played endless games of Newmarket under the stage and Ben Ashby, the other trombone, always won. One night I won and we did not seem to play after that.
