<p>The audience, somewhat taken aback at the afternoon performance (the sort of people who come for the odd hour and munch chocolates all the way through, as they do at the cinema), was very responsive in the evening. House full all the time (4,000 seats). Our poor little <em>Rats</em> took five curtain-calls. I conducted the orchestra (!) and thoroughly enjoyed it. Jean left yesterday, I leave tomorrow. Increasing success. &nbsp;</p>
