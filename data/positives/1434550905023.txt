Letter from Mrs. Dewes to Bernard Granville, Esq., at his house in Park Street, near Grosvenor Square, London, Welsbourne, 3rd Dec. 1750 -
I hope you find Mr. Handel well. I beg my compliments to him : he has not a more real admirer of his great work than myself ; his wonderful Messiah will never be out of my head ; and I may say my heart was raised almost to heaven by it. It is only those people who have not felt the pleasure of devotion that can make any objection to that performance, which is calculated to raise our devotion, and make us truly sensible •of the power of the divine words he has chose beyond any human work that ever yet appeared, and I am sure I may venture to say ever will. If anything can give us an idea of the Last Day it must be that part—" The trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised." It is few people I can say so much to as this, for they would call me an enthusiast; but when I wish to raise my thoughts above this world and all its trifling concerns, I look over what oratorios I have, and even my poor way of fumbling gives me pleasing recollections, but I have nothing of the Messiah, but He was despised, &c. Does Mr. Handel do anything new against next Lent ? surely Theodora l will have justice at last, if it was to be again performed, but the generality of the world have ears and hear not. Mr. Dewes is vastly afraid I shall make the boys love music, which he thinks would interfere with their necessary studies, but I doubt they have all good ears, and the little girl really can sing a tune, and he allows me to make her a musician if I can.
