<p>Through sleet to Bank Street last night, with JH and Gustavo, to see Stanley Silverman's new little opera,<em> Hotel for Criminals</em>, which lacks the witty energy of his <em>Elephant Steps</em>. Pastiche and parody are legitimate expressions and can be funny. But this is pastiche of pastiche (the dadism of Bu&ntilde;uel and Clair), and parody of parody (Satie and Weill). Imitation of imitation provides no nourishment; one goes off hungry.</p>
