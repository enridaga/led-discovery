<p style="margin: 0px;">I hope you will arrange to have an adorable fair haired young student whose name I do no know - but who sang &ldquo;Cons&ecirc;t W.m Owen Pengraig&rdquo; - most charmingly last March, to sing this year also. I very greatly enjoyed her singing - I have never forgotten the impression she made.&nbsp;</p>
