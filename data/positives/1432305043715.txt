One thing that stands out in my mind while I am thus digging through these years is my intense shyness. I was very bashful in public places, my cheeks often flushed by conflicting reflexes of outraged shyness and little stirrings of vanity whenever, on entering a café with my father, I heard the gypsy “primas,” Pali Racz XXXII (32nd son of his famous gypsy-band-leader father), salute me with the first two bars of Bach's Prelude in E, interjected into whatever the band was playing – csardas, operetta medleys, and the like. A fraternal greeting and a sort of accolade- from one fiddler to another!
