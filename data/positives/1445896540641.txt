<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Bertie &hellip; sat with his back to me.&nbsp; He was an untrained oarsman, and at last I had to suggest that he might do better to ship his sculls and leave the job to me.&nbsp; He assented with the greatest good-humour, and proposed that he should hum the accompaniment of Schubert&rsquo;s boat-song, &lsquo;<em>Auf dem Wasser&rsquo;</em>, while Maudie sang the melody.&nbsp; It appeared that he had taken her repertoire in hand, replacing such pieces as &lsquo;Because&rsquo;, &lsquo;Kashmiri Song&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Two Eyes of Grey&rsquo;, by <em>lieder</em> chosen to draw out and confirm the quality of Maudie&rsquo;s singing voice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped rowing as she sang.&nbsp; I leaned over the sculls, my head heavy with the tumult of this conflict.&nbsp; Bertie beat time with one hand, his blunt-ended fingers flashing in the sun.&nbsp; His humming accompaniment was so deep-toned that the sides of the boat vibrated.&nbsp; The blue sky above us, with a dappled cloudlet here and there; the sleeping hills to the north, and the sleeping pastures around us; the green willows posting the canal, shuddering under the heat of the sunlight; Maudie&rsquo;s pure voice, effortless and ravishing; and death, and hatred, and murder in my heart &hellip;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The melody of Schubert&rsquo;s song floated out from that powerful throat.&nbsp; I glanced up, out of the Pit, and saw the smooth muscles of her neck, the perfect teeth and the moulding of her mouth. Then I dropped my gaze again, for I had seen something else, something to accuse me.&nbsp; She was singing to him, and under his instructing guidance &hellip; His was the master&rsquo;s hand, and his the true love.&nbsp; I had to acknowledge both, before that day was over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purity and simplicity of Maudie&rsquo;s singing finally roused me from the despair and self-pity into which I had fallen.&nbsp; Still in that eternity while the boat slowly came to rest among the water-weeds, and while I leaned over my sculls, my head bowed, I passed round the circles of that inward hell, the hatred, the shame, the embrace of murder.&nbsp; From one after another I extricated myself, mandrake-wise, tearing myself up by the roots from this horror, acknowledging that the betrayal was in me, not in the lovers &hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song ended, and Bertie&rsquo;s hand dropped to the gunwale.&nbsp; He turned to look at me, and I saw the happiness in his eyes &hellip; Silence fell over us all.</p>
