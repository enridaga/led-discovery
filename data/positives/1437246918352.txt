<pre>Mrs. Billington and I were engaged this year by Mr. Francis Aickin, for Edinburgh <br />and Liverpool. Accompanied by her brother, Charles Weichsell, we left London in <br />a post coach and four for Liverpool. Her fame drew crowded houses every night <br />during a fortnight. "Artaxerxes" was performed several nights; she was the <br />Mandane, I, the Artabanes, and Miss Duncan (now Mrs. Davison) the Arbaces; and it <br />was really surprising how well that lady sang and acted the part, considering that <br />she had never been accustomed to recitative. I took a great deal of pains to <br />instruct her, and was highly repaid, by her assiduity and truly amiable manners. </pre>
