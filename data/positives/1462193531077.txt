<p>I've been going through your "Appalachia" this morning. It is an extraordinary work, its sincerity makes me weep. I dont know&nbsp;<em>when</em> such a surprise offered itself to me. The copy only arrived this morning - I took the sincere opinion of a learned musician as to its greatness in a letter I had after the London performance. We will have it here and you shall hear your music sung. Im&nbsp;<em>proud</em> to know such a genius - it is most extraordinary music. May god let you write more such music.</p>
