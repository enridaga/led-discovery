After tea we went to the ‘Very Lights’ a concert party of — Div. which was excellent.The stage was draped with dark green & white in stripes and the pierrots were in dark green with white bobs.

‘A Long long Trail’ sung behind the curtain opened the show & it had a most pleasing effect. The dancing & everything else was topping but perhaps this was due to the fact that there was a stringband as opposed to the ordinary blare without violins etc. The man who was Columbine danced perfectly & was a jolly good impersonator. Our Div. lady is hopeless always mincing about & very gawky, grinning inanely the while! In fact our ‘Duds’ are hopeless where compared with the Very Lights ... Soon even this place will be ‘long ago & far away’!
