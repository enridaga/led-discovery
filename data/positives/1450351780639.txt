<p>I have a bootleg audio-cassette of [Kenny Baker's] last appearance with the <em>Beiderbecke and All That Jazz</em> show at Tunbridge Wells. At the end, during our encore - 'The Totally Spontaneous Officially Designated and Well-Honed Encore Blues in F' - I introduce Kenny with the words: 'the only trumpet player banned from playing within a fifty mile radius of Jericho' - whereupon Kenny explodes into his solo like a twenty-year-old: the new kid on the lock, fresh from Yorkshire, eager to show London's city slickers and the world beyond how it's done.</p>
<p>He did that for sixty years.&nbsp; He showed the world how it's done, shared the joy and, above all, he never made the mistake of growing up.</p>
