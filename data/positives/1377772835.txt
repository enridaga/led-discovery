Last night we had a little knot of [M. and Mde. D'Albert's] most intimate musical friends -- a Mlle. Herpin who plays admirably, a gentleman who has a splendid bass voice, and two really remarkable men, a M. Chaponnière, a physician, and his Father, a fine old man, quite a subject for a sculptor, who has written an infinity of clever poetry in the style of Thomas Hood, some of which M. D'Albert has read to me. He has also been a composer of music. The son is an antiquarian, has written a history of Bonnivard, is scientific, is full of all sorts of knowledge, with a delightful bonhommie. He has a fine tenor voice and sings with facility very difficult operatic music. M. and Mde. D'Albert introduce me to their friends as if they wished me to know them, as if they wished me to like their friends and their friends to like me. Mde. Chaponnière, the younger one's wife, is an amiable looking little woman who brings her work and listens to the music. The people and the evening would have been just after your own hearts.
