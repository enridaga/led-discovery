<p>Mr. Jos. C. Miller, the lion-hearted joint owner of this aggregation, carried several features of the show to the State prison there to entertain the prisoners and each number was roundly applauded. The music was by Prof. Baker's band. Jess Willard, the big champion, was presented amid cheers. Also cowboys and cow girls came in for great applause.</p>
<p>Our old plantation show was well received and we are well pleased to know we were able to shed a ray of sunshine in the lives of those poor fellows. When our band struck up the "Memphis Blues" it was a riot.</p>
