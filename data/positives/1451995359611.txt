<p>It matters not to Italian opera-goers how&nbsp;high the professional standing of an artist may be, or&nbsp;how great his international renown; if he fail to fulfil&nbsp;their expectations they do not hesitate to hound him&nbsp;down as unmercifully as though he were an assassin or&nbsp;an incendiary, caught in the very act of delinquency.&nbsp;As excitable as they are exacting, they by no means&nbsp;restrict their demonstrations of displeasure to hisses,&nbsp;whistlings, yells, hootings and other more articulate&nbsp;vociferations couched in terms of astonishing vigour. I&nbsp;have seen many a wretched singer, panic-stricken and&nbsp;livid under his paint, pelted off the stage with damaged&nbsp;fruit and vegetable refuse, culled from the market-place&nbsp;during the entr'acte by the vengeful occupants of pit&nbsp;and gallery; and, in cases when the luckless offender&nbsp;has belonged to the softer sex, it is customary in most&nbsp;of our provincial theatres to call her before the curtain&nbsp;ten or a dozen times in succession in order to assail her,&nbsp;over and over again, with storms of hisses and abusive&nbsp;epithets.</p>
