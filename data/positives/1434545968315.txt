Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Glocester, 1 July, 1749 -
I found all here well except poor Nancy, who seems to me in a very bad way ; our first meeting was what you may imagine it to be, and the first object that struck my eyes was a new tomb, and that put my spirits into such a hurry that I could not get the better of it for some time, nor had I courage to venture
yesterday to church morning or evening, or to go out of doors but into the garden. I set Mrs. Viney to the harpsichord, and I was much pleased with the improvement the girls have made. Miss Viney really sings well, and Harriot surprised me with her playing ; I think she will make one of the best players I ever heard on the harpsichord : they are agreeable well-behaved girls, and Jemmy a pretty modest lad.
