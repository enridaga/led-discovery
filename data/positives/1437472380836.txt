Many people are not aware that at least one of these Evangelists was a vocalist in a minstrel entertainment in America many years before they came to England on their religious mission. They came to Liverpool on their great campaign, and at a time when Aynsley Cook, as the Baron in "The Babes of the Wood," was singing a topical song called "It's a fraud." Cook I certainly think unwisely brought in the Moody and Sankey movement, ending with the gag-words "It's a fraud." This brought on an acrimonious newspaper warfare, and Aynsley Cook's disclosures in self-defence of the burnt-cork attributes of the popular Evangelist.</span></p>
