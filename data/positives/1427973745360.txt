[At a Ray Charles outdoor concert in Fort Worth Texas, 1959] the eight-piece band plays for an hour. They play rhythm and blues and they play what is then called hard-bop jazz…

From the back door I see them leading him out… He opens his mouth and the spirits come charging out, like convicts escaping prison.

He sings his new song--"Them That Got"--two times, to remind us to buy it.
I witness the ritual: They call him High Priest. His singing is coarse and romantic; he phrases like the great jazz masters of old. "What I Say," the hottest song in the country, brings the crowd to the very edge of its ecstasy.

He throws back his head and smiles, flashing his teeth like a horse. He is grotesque and beautiful. He cannot stop moving. He screams, and the scream lasts for ten, twenty, thirty seconds. The scream is the breaking point, and the show is over.
