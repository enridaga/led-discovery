I had some pleasure in fiddling with Miss Marshall on the Wednesday evening, but the pleasure was greatly diminished by this villainous deafness of mine, which continues just as it was in Norfolk. Accompaniment, Mr. Twining, requires a great delicacy of piano, & great nicety, & submission, & subordination to the principal part. Now, when a man is deaf, he does not know whether he is playing loud or soft: at least he does not know how loud he plays. So the poor man is afraid to let his bow touch the strings for fear he should be making a devil of a noise without knowing it.
