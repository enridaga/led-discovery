 An extract from a Contemporary Notice, 6th April, 1845 -
Besides all the engagements mentioned, I have had daily sight-seeing with the
Arnims, and very glad have I been both of their company and of the sights. They are delightful people, and know how to enjoy everything. Our music was fine on Friday evening ; Hausmann played on the violoncello exquisitely; Frances
accompanied at sight, and was much praised by Neukomm ; then Mrs. Sartoris (Adelaide Kemble) sang, as if inspired, a Scottish balladâ€”poetry, melody, expression, all wonderful.
