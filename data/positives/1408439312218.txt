I have early breakfast & go to Victoria & catch 9.20 to Eastbourne, where Mrs. Bridge meets me in Miss Fass’s car (a friend of theirs who lives v. near & is with them most of the day) & motors me to their lovely cottage in Friston. I play tennis all afternoon & after tea with Mr. Bridge who is really very good, & amazingly steady. Great fun. Miss Fass is here for tea & dinner, & Mr. B. & I go to her house & listen, after supper, to a bit of Carmen, on her wireless from Rome. The country around here is too superb for words. No one about at all – lovely!
