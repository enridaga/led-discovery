 About nine at night I came home, and there find Mrs. Pierce come, and little Franke Tooker and Mr. Hill and other people, a great many, dancing, and anon comes Mrs. Coleman, with her husband and Laneare. The dancing ended, and to sing, which Mrs. Coleman doth very finely, though her voice is decayed as to strengt;h but mighty sweet, though saft - and a pleasant jolly woman, and in mighty good humour was tonight. Among other things, Laneare did at the request of Mr. Hill bring two or three the finest prints for my wife to see that ever I did see in all my life. But for singing, among other things, we got Mrs. Coleman to sing part of the Opera; but, above all, her counterfeiting of Capt. Cookeâ€™s part, in his reproaching his man with Cowardize, Base Slaves &c., she doth it most excellently: at it till past midnight, and then broke up and to bed.
