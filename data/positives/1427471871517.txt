[T]here came in the winter of 1855 the offer to conduct a series of operas at the Theatre Royal, Manchester. A very excellent troupe had been engaged, comprising Mme. Eudersdorff, Mme. Caradori, Mile. Agnes Biiry, Herr Reichardt, Carl Formes, and other remarkable vocalists. Most of the operas were given in German, and it was happiness to me to conduct really firstrate performances of ' Fidelio,' ' Don Giovanni,' ' Der Freyschutz,' 'Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail,' alternately with more modern works such as ' Robert le Diable,' ' Les Huguenots,' ' La Favorita,' and others. Madame Rudersdorff was one of the most dramatic and accomplished singers I have ever listened to, and 
achieved a real triumph as Leonora in 'Fidelio.' Formes was at the zenith of his powers and equally admirable as Leporello or as Don Giovanni. Reichardt was a charming tenor who sang Belmonte in ' Die Entfuhrung ' to perfection, and all were musicians to the core, having their heart in their work.
