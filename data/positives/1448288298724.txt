<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Although I remember the Festival of Britain as a schoolboy in 1951, I got to know the RFH well as a student across the river at King's College when the hall became almost a second home. As a piano enthusiast I heard many of the great masters of the keyboard such as Artur Rubinstein and the Hungarian wizard Gy&ouml;rgy Cziffrs(?). The QEH had not yet been built, so all the big recitals were at the RFH. I also loved the 'see through' vistas of the foyers.&nbsp;</p>
