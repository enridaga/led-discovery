... [O]ne evening I was ordered away to take charge of the equipment of a bombing school near a little place called Paradis... The school had been held in the outbuildings of a château ... I saw myself beginning a holiday in the château, the owner of which still lived in it. A courteous and conversational man he was.... Evenings were spent in the drawing-room, where the widower's two daughters would sing and talk sweetly; the younger of them, pale with an illness, was in love with another officer who on some business like mine was billeted in the house.I did not think he was in love with her; but I will not go into that aspect. She sang and on a sudden she was singing to him; her dark and enchanting and piteous eyes would seek him in the silences. It was another of the Salon pictures to be seen in these parts.
