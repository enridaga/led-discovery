<p>At night the Comedie Italienne where there was a Harlequin piece, in which 2 thirds of the characters spoke Italian [...] Carlin the Harlequin wonderfully comic and entertaining - the rest, who sung now and then, but too French for me, Italian airs I could not much relish. [...] One of these pieces was new and meant as a comic opera in all its modern French form of Italian music (that is music composed in all the Italian Stile) to French words: no recitative, all the dialogue and narrative part being spoken, and this piece was as thoroughly d-d as ever piece was here. I used to imagine that a French audience durst not hiss to the degree I found they did tonight, indeed quite as much mixt with horse laughs as ever I heard at Drury Lane or Covent Garden. In short it was condemned in all the English terms except breaking the forms and the actors heads - instead of hissssssss - hishshsh. The author of the words, luckily for him or rather judiciously by him, lay concealed, but the composer M. de St Amant, is very much to be pitied, for a great deal of real good music was thrown away upon bad words and upon an audience not at all disposed, especially in the two last acts (there were&nbsp;3,) to hear anything fairly.</p>
