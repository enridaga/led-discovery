My dear William,	
A part of Lord Harrington's new raised Corps have taken up their quarters at Olney since you left us. They have the regimental music with them. The men have been drawn up this morning upon the market hill, and a concert such as we have not heard these many years, has been performed at no great distance from our window. Your mother and I both thrust our heads into the coldest East wind that ever blew in April, that we might hear them to greater advantage. The band acquitted themselves with taste and propriety, not blairing like Trumpeters at a fair, but producing gentle and elegant symphony, such as charmed our ears and convinced us that no length of time can wear out a taste for Harmony; and that though Plays, Balls and masquerades have lost all their power to please us, and we should find them not only insipid but insupportable, yet sweet music is sure to find a corresponding faculty in the soul, a sensibility that lives to the last, which even Religion itself does not extinguish. â€” I must pity therefore some good people, (at least some who once were thought such) who have been fiddled out of all their Christian profession, and having forsaken the world for a time, have danced into it again with all their might. It is a snare from which I myself, should find it difficult to escape, were I much in the way of it.
