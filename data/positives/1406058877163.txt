Danny arranged for Jackie to play the drum in a performance of the Toy Symphony by Haydn (now attributed to Leopold Mozart) conducted by Rafael Kubelik, in the Royal Albert Hall, on 1 July. The occasion was to celebrate the centenary of her agents, Harold Holt Ltd. She was excited by the prospect, but I thought it was immensely brave of her. To see her sitting in the orchestra banging a drum was shattering, even though she performed with commitment and dignity. It was a very different Jackie from the little girl who broke the drum with her enthusiastic blows all those years ago at the BBC. But she seemed to enjoy it, and certainly loved being on the platform again. It was a terrific boost to be applauded by her adoring audience once more.
