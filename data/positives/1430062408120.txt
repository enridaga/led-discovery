My wife had prepared a pleasant surprise for me. Mendelssohn and the German artists came to dine with us on the eve of my birthday. [...] A packet was then handed to me, containing a sheet of paper on which Mendelssohn had transcribed a regular catalogue of the themes of my works, illustrating them with humorous drawings in the margin. I was, however, allowed no time to study the interesting present, for a four-part song broke in upon us; then Schrödes, the Haizingers, and Hause, sang a Canon by Mendelssohn, upon four lines of a stanza written for the occasion by Klingemann; the music founded on
the motive of my 'C major Concerto'. It was a charming fète for me, as an artist and a man.
