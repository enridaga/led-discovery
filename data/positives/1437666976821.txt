<p>Paul Wright comes to dinner, &amp; go to Ballet Club with him by 8.30. 2nd of MacN. Lemare concerts - Choir (select(!!)), &amp; quart. Do. Elizabeth Machonchy's Motets, &amp; Syke's Motet. My 2 part songs (which I accompany) go quite well - esp. Lift Boy. But really there isn't a singer in the lot of them. Anne did her best with my 'Go Play, Boy, Play' - but again, I want 1st class instrumentalists besides enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>
