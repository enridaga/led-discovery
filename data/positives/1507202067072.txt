The procession was through Cheap unto Leadenhall. And before went the children of the Grey Friars and Paul's school. There were eight bishops and the bishop of London, mitered, bearing the sacrament with him, of torches burning and a canopy borne over. And so about the churchyard and in at the west door with the lord mayor and the aldermen and all the crafts in their best liveries.

And at night bonfires and great ringing in every church.</span></p>
