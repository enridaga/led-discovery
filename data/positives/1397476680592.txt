February the 24th, 1809. I went to the Haymarket Theatre, and heard Acis and Galatea throughout. This serenata was first performed as a pastoral drama, aided by scenery, and what must have rendered it ridiculous, the characters were not in action, but sung and performed in what was called still life, standing like so many statues upon the stage. In this way Handel’s oratorios were first introduced to the public. The music of this work originally belonged to an Italian opera, which Handel composed when in that country, on a very different subject. I once saw a copy of it in Handel’s own handwriting, the property of Mr. Bartleman. The present poem was written by Gay, at the instance of the composer, and between them they contrived to marry it to the music. The opening chorus of nymphs and swains commences with nearly the same notes as the curfew song in L'Allegro il Pensieroso, shewing how musical sounds may be used for opposite effects, when the time and accent are altered. The general style of this work is now out of date, but some songs in it are written in his best manner; particularly, "Love in her eyes sits playing,” which is a specimen of great beauty; and the trio, “The flocks shall leave the mountains,” has the dramatic force of a modern composition.
