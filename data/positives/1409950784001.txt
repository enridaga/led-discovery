In New York in the early 1970s, Diana and I attended a recital given in the Carnegie Hall by David Oistrakh and Sviatoslav Richter. The opening sonata, the Beethoven Number 6 in A Major (beautifully played, of course), passed without incident, then, in the first movement of the Brahms D Minor, a young man raced down the aisle, leaped onto the stage and shouted, “Soviet Russia is no better than Nazi Germany!” The music halted and Oistrakh left the stage, but Richter sat on at the piano, observing with interest the thin, taut, fanatical young fellow still screaming protests against Soviet treatment of the Jews. […] Oistrakh came back, the Brahms Sonata was begun again and reached its last movement before a second young man sprinted toward the stage, this time to be neatly intercepted by the audience.
