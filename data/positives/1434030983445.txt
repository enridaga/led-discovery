Extract from a Contemporary Notice, Carlton Terrace: Saturday, 8th July, 1848 -
Hitherto we have not allowed ourselves to spend anything upon amusements ; if there were temptations, they were the more easily resisted, as the fatigue of unavoidable home receptions, and of invitations not to be declined, was already more than enough ; but at last, on the morning of Thursday,
the 6th, Bunsen went himself to see what boxes, within a moderate price, the benefit-night would afford ; and his trouble was successful in procuring us the indulgence of seeing Jenny Lind in the ' Sonnambula.' If Lady H. wrote
to you on the effect produced by that gifted creature as eloquently as she described it to me, you will conceive, better than I can tell, what she is as a whole ; for the grace, elasticity, modulation, roundness, fullness, continued life and animation, of her bodily movements, and of her voice, taken together, all seem the result of one impulse. No essential beauty, and yet the result of grace and unceasing suitableness, making the whole appearance beautiful ; accounted for by the mind, whose softness harmonised the whole !
