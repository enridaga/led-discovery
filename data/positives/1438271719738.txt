<p>Bath before dinner - after which get Act III, IV, I of Pelleas &amp; Melisande from Huizen - a very fine performance with Concertgebouw Orch. under Pierre Monteux - unfortunately the atmospherics often dreadful, so alot of the delicious music was lost. It is marvellous stuff - but so sensitive &amp; intangible.&nbsp;</p>
