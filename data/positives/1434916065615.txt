Go to Bridges to dinner at 7.15 & listen to a performance of Act II of Tristan on wireless. Beecham spoils it by hurrying & there is only a very poor orchestra. Florence Austral & Walter Widdop (Isolde & T.) very good. The rest rather poor. Even they couldn't spoil this wonder of the world. Back by 11.30.
