<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">We had seats on the stage behind the orchestra, not ideal for sound, but giving us a splendid opportunity of seeing those sparing eloquent gestures that were always the very antithesis of the methods of most other precision-bound conductors.&nbsp; It was uncomfortably hot, and the audience was one of those notoriously noisy Italian ones quite inappropriate to the type of music-making that was taking place, except that everyone was silenced by the breath-taking string crescendos in Cherubini&rsquo;s <em>Anakreon</em> overture (a piece that had also begun the maestro&rsquo;s first BBC concert in 1935); and the obvious popular appeal of <em>Vltava</em> called forth shouts of &lsquo;grazie, grazie&rsquo; from all directions.&nbsp; <em>Don</em> <em>Juan</em>, too, was stunning, glorious in its abandon, overwhelming at the climaxes, yet never ceasing for one moment to &lsquo;sing&rsquo;, and as clear &ndash; even from where we were sitting &ndash; as the finest playing of a Bach five-part fugue.&nbsp; (Disbelievers may hear <em>this</em> miracle preserved in the NBC recording.)&nbsp; But the Pastoral Symphony suffered both from the heat and the maestro&rsquo;s forward-looking impulse, and his unhappiness was not alleviated by the flashing cameras that greeted its close.</p>
