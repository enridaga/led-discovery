<p>In the evening we go with Lisel &amp; the Eisingers to a very lovely show of Zauberfl&ouml;te at the Stadtheater. I haven't enjoyed anything like this for along time. Perf. very good - delightful Pamina &amp; Papagino (E. Franscher &amp; A. Weltner). A delightful staging, &amp; orch. playing quite good. Of course nothing can be said abt. the music. It is just great from beginning to end. Heil, Mozart!</p>
