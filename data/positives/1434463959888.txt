Letter from Mrs. Delany toMrs. Dewes, Clarges Street, 21 Feb. 1744 -
Semele is charming ; the more I hear it the better I like it, and as I am a subscriber I shall not fail one night. But it being a profane story D.D. does not think it proper for him to go ; but when Joseph or Samson is performed I shall persuade him to goâ€”you know how much he delights in music. They say Samson is to be next Friday, for Semele has a strong party against it, viz. the fine ladies, petit maitres, and ignoramus's. All the opera people are enraged at Handel, but Lady Cobham, Lady Westmoreland, and Lady Chesterfield never
fail it.
