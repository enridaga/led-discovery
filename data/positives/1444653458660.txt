<p>In 1986 an American friend took me to the RFH for a concert of Jessye Norman singing the final scenec from Salome and then a number of Srauss songs for voice and orchestra. The concert was so overwhelming that as we walked back over Hungerford Bridge to Embankment station we were unable to talk about it.</p>
