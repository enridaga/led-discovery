Carlotta Grisi, not absolutely unknown here, but now entitled for the first time to touch the highest position, and her clever, agile husband, Perrot, were the prominent artists in the entertainment. A Mademoiselle Fleury, new to England, added to the excellent effect of the ensemble as the Queen of the Wilis. The anti-pantomimic malcontents not having yet assumed the position of a fashionable faction, the "story" was admitted to be "vastly pretty." "Giselle" was pronounced a success, and the production of this ballet may be regarded as the main element of attraction on the opening of my first season. Its success was probably owing to the fact of the whole story being comprised within the limits of a short romantic legend, which, in the hands of a skilful "Mime," becomes easily intelligible.</span></p>
