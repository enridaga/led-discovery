Then a grand concert was given, at which every member of the orchestra was a former <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>student of the Hochschule, every individual fiddler a pupil of the "King of Violinists&rdquo;; while, to make things perfect, the hero <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of the night was ultimately persuaded to take his violin and bow <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>from three of his fair musical children and delight his excited <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>auditors with a solo by Bach. I went over expressly to attend <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that unique and brilliant function. The orchestra was directed <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>by Herr Steinbach, and as long as I live I shall never forget the magnificent quality of the tone of those violins or the superb<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>elan that marked the performance of Weber's "Euryanthe" <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>overture. Every player was an artist of repute, and the total <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>value of the stringed instruments was computed at a quarter of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a million dollars. </span></p>
