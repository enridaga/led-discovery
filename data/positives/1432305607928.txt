It was here [shows at a summer theater in a small resort in Hungary] that I first had my fill of the stage, seeing 'Rip Van Winkle', 'The Chimes of Normandy', and some operettas with Hungarian folk background; and here it was that I had to play with a seven- or eight-piece orchestra and like it. It was swim or sink. My piece had to be reorchestrated down to the numbers of this little band by its pianist-conductor.
