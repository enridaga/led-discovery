He would sit down at the rickety old piano in our lodgings, and all the things in musical literature I had ever wanted to hear, not to speak of others I had never even heard of (including his own "first fine careless rapture," <em>Trompeter Lieder</em>) were poured out before me. As some people rejoice in having seen Venice for the first time by moonlight, so I am thankful the <em>Gruppe aus dem Tartarus</em> was first made known to me by Henschel, and in my eyes this dear old friend, whom in after years even my father came to be fond of, was like a god. </span></p>
