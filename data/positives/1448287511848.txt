<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I first visited the Festival Hall during the Festival of Britain - a wonderful experience of celebration, even though I was not quite a teenager! During the 1960's and 70's a regular concertgoer to the New Era concerts, London Mozart Players and then Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by international names such as Giulini. Latterly we have chosen individual events rather than series, but always love the atmosphere of the Hall.&nbsp;</p>
