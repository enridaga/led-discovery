<p>Go to B.B.C. Symphony Conc. with Beth at 8.15. Cond. Weingartner. H. Samuel plays Beethoven 2nd Conc. delightfully - tho' abit inaccurate in spots. W. is disappointing; the Brahms (Variations)* was rough, &amp; rather dull (tho' who could make that antidiluvian scoring sound interesting); &amp; the Symphony Fantastique of Berlioz didn't sound as electrifying as it should - in spite of all the din &amp; speed.</p>
