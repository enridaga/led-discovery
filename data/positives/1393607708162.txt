The 11th - therefore a calendar-month since that last day of something like life [i.e., a month after the death of her husband, Baron von Bunsen].... O! these dates - these recollections! If we did not recall what his sufferings were (and yet it kills one to think of them) how should one continue, as one ought, to thank God for his present blessedness. If one was only not so earthly, so clinging to the clod - one should be less rebellious - less unreasonable.

My own Emilia! I did not think, when I took the paper, that I was going to write these things to you: - but last night Meyer sung a number of old songs, words and melodies, that he [Bunsen] like to hear - and I enjoyed hearing them, from habit - and afterwards was foolish enough to remember that the ear was deaf to sounds of earth, that used to listen with me. He takes in now the heavenly harmonies, after which he aspired!
