On Good Friday the 'St. Matthew Passion' was performed. I am deeply moved by the work [...] Those double choruses, interspersed with majestic chorales, the moment when Peter 'weeps bitterly' at his own treachery, the air in C minor, 'Ich will bei meinem Jesu wachen' - in fact, one and all of the numbers - how inadequate our praise must be!
