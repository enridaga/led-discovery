You say that “music in drama always impresses me very strongly.” That is not quite clear to me. What music do you mean? Name one play with music in which the music makes an impression. I have never seen or heard such a play. I have only seen some Ukranian plays, but I have already written you what I think of them. And I do not think that plays with music can be developed in the future; I think even less of the future of opera, though at present it has engulfed music. It seems to me that mixing drama with music is impossible in any form, especially in opera. In that respect Wagner squandered his genius and only demonstrated to artists of word and sound that fusion of these two arts is an absurdity. I think I have expressed myself this way to you before and I know you do not agree.
