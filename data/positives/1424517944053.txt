<p>I had heard much about the pianist Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli. He was the most notorious for cancelling concerts at the last minute on the grounds of health or that his piano had been damage somehow in transit so, I was prepared for the worst. Well he did not let us down. We had a wonderful performance the details of which I do not recall but I know that something magical was happening.</p>
