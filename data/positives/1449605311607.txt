<p>In my early days in Boston, series of concerts were given in the Federal Street Theatre, on the corner of Franklin Street, by the so-called Boston Academy of Music<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>[&hellip; ] formed and named in 1833, by Messrs. William C. Woodbridge, Lowell Mason, and a few kindred souls.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The programmes were of very mixed music, but aspiring to the best. Beethoven&rsquo;s <em>Fifth Symphony</em> was brought out by them for the first time in Boston. Each programme was generally made up of a French opera overture, one or two instrumental solos by members of the orchestra or strangers, a movement from an easy symphony, a potpourri, and a few vocal pieces.</p>
