Concert of my music at the American Embassy. Because soprano Ethel Semser's nice leg was in a plaster cast he could not walk. We therefore kept the curtain down, posed Ethel beside the piano like a statue in en evening gown, and were both on stage when the curtain rose. Then, my God, it wasn't us but the audience which seemed on display as we gazed out over that Proustian assemblage of heads.
