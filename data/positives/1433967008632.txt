Brussels is Paris in miniature ; the streets and shops have the same air of gaiety. The cathedral, next to the Hotel de Ville, is the most splendid object in the city. The service was performing when we entered, with a full band of instruments in addition to the organ, and though the performers were not of a first-rate description, musical sounds acquire so much lustre in a spacious church that I was delighted with that which in a smaller building would have given the ear no pleasure.
