<p>Wonderful memories of a concert hall that staged some of the most enjoyable classical music concerts I have ever been to. In particular, Carlo Maria Giulini's stunning performances of Verdi's Requiem, with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus come to mind, but the Hall itself always had such a wonderful atmosphere and welcoming feeling whenever I attended. In the late 60s, I was lucky enough to take part in the first two performances in the RFH with the Wandsworth School Choir, under Russell Burgess - works by John Rutter and Ian Kellam. Looking forward to the re-opening.&nbsp;</p>
