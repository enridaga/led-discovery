Calling one evening upon Mr. Greatorex in town, he took me with him to a musical club, composed of the principal vocalists of the ancient concert. They met at each other's houses for the sake of a little fiddling. It was at Mr. Linley's, the brother of Mrs. Sheridan. Bartleman, I think, played the first violin, and Greatorex the principal bass. The Knyvetts, Elliot, Vaughan, &c., joined in filling up the parts to Corelli's concertos. Every one tried to do that which when done was not worth hearing; but they seemed highly amused and gratified. When they had gone through a movement with tolerable success, oh ! they would have it again; it was charming; it was beautiful. I could not but be astonished to see how easily they were pleased. They were like children who met to amuse themselves.
