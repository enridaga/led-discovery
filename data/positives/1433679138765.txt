<p>The first time I ever saw Louis [Armstrong] he was about twelve, thirteen years old. He was singing with three other kids in an amateur show at Bill and Mary Mack's tent show in New Orleans. Louis was singing tenor then and they broke it up that night. The other three boys were Red Happy, Little Mack and a guy by the name of Clarence. This happened just before Louis got sent to the Waif's Home, and so I didn't see him again for a while. But I heard about him at the home. Some of the fellows that were sent there would come back and say how fine this Louis Armstrong was playing.</p>
<p>Then I saw Louis playing in a band at a picnic. He was marching along with the band, so we got up real close to him to see if he was actually playing those notes. We didn't believe he could learn to play in that short time. I can still remember he was playing <em>Maryland, My Maryland</em>. And he sure was swingin' out that melody.</p>
