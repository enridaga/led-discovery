<p>So home that long cold exhausting journey for the last time.&nbsp; Some odds &amp; ends of ideas came to me at dinner.&nbsp; For one thing how pungent people's writing is compared with people's flesh.&nbsp; We were all toothless insignificant amiable nonentities - we distinguished writers - Not a fig would I give for anyone's praise or curse.&nbsp; Jack Squire, fat, &amp; consequential; Eddie [Marsh] grown grey &amp; fatherly; Nevinson beetroot coloured, &amp; a little praising blood, &amp; by inference himself; Tomlinson like the hard knob of a walking stick carved by a boy of 8; Blunden despairing, drooping, crow-like, rather than Keats' like...The truth is these collective gatherings must be floated by some conventional song, in which all can join, like He's a jolly good fellow, which Squire started. Subtler impressions did occur to me, but I can't place them at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
