Her welcome of the 4th of May previous could scarcely have been surpassed in the amount of rapture and enthusiasm to which a great theatre could give vent; but yet it was almost "o'ertopped" by the tumult of applause, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs, and the long protracted lingering, and still lingering cheer which bade farewell to the great singer on this night. The curtain at last fell on Jenny Lind, and in falling, closed a season of unexampled interest.</span></p>
