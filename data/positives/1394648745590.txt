In the course of these peregrinations the amazing passion for chimes & carillons again struck me, most of the churches (which are very numerous here) having them, at some of which there was a tinkling of bells every 5 minutes, except at the quarters, when a small part of a tune was play'd, & a whole one 3 or more times over every hour, so that reckoning the variation of time in the different clocks, there were scarce 3 minutes together without a tinkling of bells to be heard somewhere, besides the tolling for prayers & funerals.
