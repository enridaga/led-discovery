<p>This visit to Cape Town was a busman&rsquo;s holiday for both my wife and myself, for the Cape Town Symphony Orchestra were very short of cellists (instead of at least eight, there were only four), so my wife gallantly stepped into the breach, playing as a member of the orchestra at all the symphony concerts during our stay of over three months. She thoroughly enjoyed her new role of orchestral playing, and becoming conversant with a tremendous slice of the cellist&rsquo;s orchestral library, while I enjoyed myself attending almost daily rehearsals as a listener and meeting the conductor, Derek Hudson.</p>
