<p>The early spring of 1867 was a season of patriotic&nbsp;rejoicing and feverish emotion for the Hungarian nation.&nbsp;For eighteen years Hungary had been dealt with as a&nbsp;conquered country; all the political and administrative&nbsp;institutions had been in abeyance, and the heel of oppression had not been lifted from her neck for a single hour.&nbsp;Austrian military reverses in 1866, however, compelled&nbsp;Kaiser Franz Josef to make large concessions to his&nbsp;Magyar subjects...One of the most strikingly&nbsp;manifest results of this transaction was the "King's"&nbsp;visit to Pesth in the character of a Constitutional monarch&nbsp;&mdash; his first appearance in the Magyar capital since the&nbsp;days of his boyhood. It was my special mission to witness his reception and the fetes given publicly and&nbsp;privately in honour of the reconciliation achieved between victors and vanquished. Pepi Hellmesberger,&nbsp;with his customary intelligence, had made arrangements&nbsp;to give two concerts during the week of national elation,&nbsp;knowing full well that the capital would be thronged&nbsp;with representative Magyars, free-handed and pleasure-&nbsp;loving, their pockets full of paper currency destined to&nbsp;be squandered in recreation and revelry. I accompanied&nbsp;the ''quadrilateral of harmony" under his command&nbsp;to Pesth, and punctually attended its first performance at the Redoute.&nbsp;</p>
