<p>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have with great pleasure received the recordings of your performance of my second chamber symphony. / Let me say at once: this is quite different from what I heard from the broadcast. It was really distorted in an extremely annoying manner. One heard for instance very seldom the basses (could this not also be the fault of the radio station???): there were many sections mixed with other sounds and there was often noise. This was no pleasure. / Let me tell you I find now that your performance was very good, very convincing and expressive, though, in order to show the sincerity of my judgment, I would say that the first movement was too slow. I am sure if you would try to read this movement now in the tempo which my metronome marks indicate, that everything would fit very well to this tempo. Curiously, Stiedry also played it too slow. What might be the reason? I think, I am right. / Now thank you again for helping me to [form] this good impression, and I hope to see you should you once visit California. </span></p>
