I have special memories of the Symphony of Psalms. I transcribed it for four-hand piano as soon as I obtained the score and showed it to my students. I must note that it has its problems in terms of construction. It’s crudely worked out, crudely. The seams show. In that sense the Symphony in Three Movements is stronger. In general, Stravinsky often has this problem: his construction sticks out like scaffolding. There’s no flow, no natural bridges. I find it irritating, but on the other hand, this clarity makes it easier for the listener. That must be one of the secrets of Stravinsky’s popularity.
