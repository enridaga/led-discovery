[It was in] ’80, ’81, and ’82. As he [Miles Davis] was coming back out. I was telling somebody this the other day. Half of his audience was young kids wanting to catch up to a new understanding and the other half was fifty and sixty-year-olds, if not older, wanting to hear Kind of Blue and Sketches of Spain. And Miles refused to play that. And for me on an audio side, it was a bit of a complication because the shows were more high energy, fusion rock-and-roll kind of stuff where Mike Stern was steering the ship in terms of volume... reviewers were having a rough time with that, I know Mike was feeling very self-conscious, and I go, "Oh my god, like what do we do?" And I remember I went to Miles, and said, "Miles, you've got half your audience wants to hear a very smooth, mellow, quiet, pleasant jazz show and you've got the other half of your audience that wants to hear a screaming, loud, go-for-it show, and I'm just like getting comments out in the house, just letting you know your audience is on the fence. What do we do? What do you want me to do? Want me to try to tone this down to appease one or the other, or, you know?" And he said, "Fuck it. Turn it up."
