The Court Orchestra, which contains from sixty to seventy musicians, is rather given to be idle during the summer months, but, luckily for me, since my arrival there have been rehearsals every morning from 10 to 1 o'clock for two concerts in aid of the Beethoven monument, which have just lately taken place. I have there heard Beethoven's masterpieces, his symphonies, the second act of ' Fidelio,' 
and his fantasia for pianoforte, orchestra, solos, and chorus, given in the highest perfection. You will believe that it was in the highest perfection when I tell you that the Kapelle, certainly one of the best in Germany, has, for a quarter of a year, studied these works regularly three hours a day.
