Folklore memories that mean much to me are those of long sessions with the Soviet Ethnographic Song and Dance troupe, both in Moscow and in Paris, during its season at the Exposition des Arts Decoratifs in 1903. How unforgettable the ineffable phrasing on that primitive reed flute of the Bashkir or Turkmen player whom I used to compare to Kreisler!
