<p>As to evening amusements, there&nbsp;are two pretty little theatres, one dedicated to the lyric&nbsp;drama, the other to comedy and operetta, at which performances are given alternately, so that one need be at&nbsp;no loss how to spend the hours between dinner and bed-time. Moreover, musical cafes abound in Cairo cafes&nbsp;of considerable dimensions, in which on est pousse &amp; la&nbsp;consommation by the strains of Donizetti, Strauss, Wagner! I once heard at the Grand Caf&eacute; Egyptien the&nbsp;"Flying Dutchman" done into quadrilles.&nbsp;</p>
