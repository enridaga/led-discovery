<p>I did not see very much of you at the concert. Your hasty departure afterwards and your rather despondent mood during the concert - what was it all about? Or am I being indiscreet? / As for me, I left the concert in utter disgust and despair. So did Ansermet. Actually, the rehearsal had promised quite a good performance of&nbsp;<em>Mavra</em>. And then you saw what the singers did to me. Apart from how my music is performed, there is a great deal to be said about where it is performed. Most places tend to be designed for dressed-up music, whereas mine - the kind I have been writing for the past two years - is naked. And then it finds itself in the hands of the courturiers, against whom brave Ansermet struggles desperately. I am in a very bad mood, and with good reason.&nbsp;</p>
