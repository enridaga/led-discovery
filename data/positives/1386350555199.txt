In the Evening, we went to the Opera to see Gustave, which in point of music, of acting, of splendid decoration exceeded any expectations, but I own I looked for better dancing…. In the midst of the Ball, upon the Stage, to the Tune of the Galoppe, Gustavus is murdered, he is borne to the proscenium, his black stock is removed, its red stains are exhibited, and he expires surrounded by masks of the most grotesque description…. The Newspapers tell us that the representation of this Opera has been prohibited at Stockholm. I cannot wonder at this and hope it will not be tried in London.
