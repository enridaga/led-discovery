'Thursday, May 4th, was the performance of Sonnambula. The Opera-house was packed full with people. The Queen, the Duchess of Gant [Kent], the Queen-dowager, and the Duke of Wellington were there. After the first act 'God save the Queen' was sung, and the Queen herself stood up and bowed to the public. Then the cheering began and they cried 'Hurrah!' and made an awful noise. Lind pleased very much.'</p>
