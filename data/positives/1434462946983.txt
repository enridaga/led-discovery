<p>Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Clarges Street, 24 Jan. 1743-4 - I was yesterday morning at Mr. Handel's to hear the rehearsal of Semele. It is a delightful piece of music, quite new and different from anything he has done : but I am afraid I shall hear no more music this year, and that will be a loss to me,&mdash;but the harmony of friendship must make up that loss. As we have a prospect of meeting soon I defer a particular account of it till we meet. Francescina is improved, and sings the principal part in it.</p>
