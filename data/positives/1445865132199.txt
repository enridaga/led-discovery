<p>The&nbsp; oscillating ? whistle during the first half of Sir Charles Mackerras's Gala Birthday Concert last eveing (20 June) reminded me of another such event on Tuesday 2nd of December 1980 - that for Aaron Copland. The programme consisted of works&nbsp; by Copland and was conducted by the composer. Following Fanfare for the Common Man the performance of Quiet City was seriously affected by a hum from the sound system. At the end of the work the noise had abated. A clearly annoyed conductor decided to repeat the performance of the work much to the delight of the audience. The remainder of the concert proceeded without a hitch. It was, even so, a memorable event in the presence of one of the truly great musicians of the twentieth century.</p>
