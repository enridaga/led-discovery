<p>On our return [from Gaeta], I continued my attention to Aprile, who gave me a lesson every day, and almost every day an invitation to dinner ; he seemed much entertained by my boyish mimicry a talent which I possessed at that time in no mean degree. I went with him to visit the miracle of St. Gennaro or Januario, in the Cathedral ; the King and Queen, in state, attended his Saintship. There were two immense orchestras erected in the church ; and all good professors, vocal and instrumental, were engaged to perform upon these occasions. The Archbishop prays, or appears to pray, while the Te Deum is sung. He then displays a phial, which contains the congealed blood of St. Gennaro ; towards this he holds up a large wax taper, that the people may perceive it is congealed. The miracle consists, as every body knows, in this blood dissolving before the congregation, and is supposed to be performed by the saint himself. As soon as it is liquified, the Archbishop roars lustily, " the miracle is accomplished". The Te Deum is again sung, and the whole congregation prostrate themselves before the altar of the saint with gratitude and devotion, and every face beams with delight.</p>
