It was on this tour that Constance Shacklock sang her first "Carmen". She was always a very whole-hearted performer, given in her early days to impromptu asides like: "Well, you know what he's like!" which were audible to the front stalls. As she was making her escape while being led off to jail at the end of the first act she knocked over not only the guar but a portion of the scenery as well. In a later performance she would attack Don Jos√©, (Edgar Evans) so vehemently with the knife in Act III that he was slightly wounded. Still, it was all in the cause of verismo.
