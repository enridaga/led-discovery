<p>In 1890 my dramatic oratorio "The Repentance of Nineveh" was produced at the Worcester Triennial Festival, my gracious friend (Madame Albani) singing the principal solos. She was much struck by an Aria, "Hear ye and give ear," and later very kindly and entirely spontaneously brought my composition to the notice of Queen Victoria. I append some extracts from a letter that she wrote to me from Braemar, where she was staying, in September of the same year: DEAR DR. BRIDGE, Soon after my return from Worcester, Her Majesty The Queen honoured me with a visit, and over tea I took the opportunity of speaking of our grand Festival, and of your work. She seemed much interested in it all, and I asked her permission to sing the air, "Hear ye and give ear" the next time I went to Balmoral ... I could not go until yesterday. I sang it, and it seemed to make as good an impression in the drawing-room as it did in the Cathedral; and the Queen was much pleased, and said it was 'very clear and very fine.' Princess Beatrice also thought it 'very fine'. I think it had a great success, and you can be well pleased.</p>
