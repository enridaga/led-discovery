While we were in Dilizhan the composer Avset Terterian acquainted me with some of his compositions. He seems very talented to me. Apart from these pieces, I heard no other works new to me, although I did hear a gramophone record of Edgar Oganesian’s Saxophone Concerto and also Aleksandr Glazunov’s Saxophone Concerto. I liked the Oganesian; Glazunov’s concerto was so bad it made me want to cry.
