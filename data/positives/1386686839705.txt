I begin a perfectly awful day, with Gog telling me that my piano style (incidentally learned from Miss Astle & approved of by H. Samuel) was no good, & thereupon showing me the [underscored] (his!!) [underscored] style. After a pouring morning, & a meagre lunch, we watch a match v. Old [strikethrough] Cambridge O.G's, & have a near scrape from J.R.E. (he ticks the 2 boys with whom I was watching off for not watching etc.); return to Music rooms, & have a play & gramophone with Floud & thereupon Gog finds us together & is livid. Horrible orch. practise. Get into row with Docker for not staring Mr. Thompson in the face all the time in a house jaw! Music lesson 12.0 only cheerful thing in a silly day!!!
