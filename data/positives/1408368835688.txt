I went on to the Methodist[s] and seeing a black man in the pulpit I went in and took my old place…
    He spoke about the Jews and the captivity, and I remarked as I have often done that they (the congregation) always identify themselves with that chosen people in bondage and look forward to the release. Some look to heaven, but some, I am sure, look for a better time on earth.
    They sang ‘I’m going home to glorie. Peter, John I then shall see. I’m going home to glorie. Matthew, Luke I then shall see. I’m going home to glorie, etc.’ I think they put in the names of anyone they wanted to see, for they sang different names—all the time stamping time, so that as the singing surged along I felt carried along too and sang with them. One old lady sang so intensely that she dropped down from exhaustion. There was no occasion to say to her (as all of the men called out to another old lady who was timid), ‘Sing up, my sister, sing up!’
