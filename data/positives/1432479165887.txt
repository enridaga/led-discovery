Julius Stockhausen's first appearance here has given us all great pleasure. I can pay him and his singing no higher compliment than to say that he is the worthy son of one whose gifts as a vocalist were of the highest order; his pronunciation and method are faultless. Our public, never over demonstrative, enthusiastically applauded him.
