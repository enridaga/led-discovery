<p>The concert hall in Shizuoka is another impressive one, with a gorgeous Steinway. Here the audience reaction is noticeable more provincial, however. The concert goes really well (by which I mean that we play well) but the audience response is formulaic, well-mannered. Two friends in the audience tell us afterwards that our programme of Faur&eacute;, Schumann and Ravel trios was too esoteric for 'an uneducated audience'. Strangely, this programme was a request of the Japanese promoter.</p>
