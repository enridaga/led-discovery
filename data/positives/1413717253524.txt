Gates goes away at mid-day, for good I’m sick to say. I write a Vln & Pft piece, “Moon,” in morning – more satisfactory than the Bicycle one. Copy parts out, & Lauricella plays them in aft. He’s going to practise them, but plays them already well. Meet Beth at 5.59 at Lv’pl St. She comes here to dinner. Walk in park with her, & then go with her to Barbaras, where she stays the night, befor departing for Switzerland (Basle with Yvonne Clar), in morning at 9.0 Back at 11 0.
