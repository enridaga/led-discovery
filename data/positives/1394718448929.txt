On the 11th of July I went again to the Subscription Concert in Portsmouth & played 2d. ripieno with Mr Fitzherbert, the timber merchant who liv'd close to the concert room. At this concert the music then usually play'd was Handels [sic] overtures, Corellis Geminianis Handel's, Defesch's Humphrey's & Stanley's concertos & Bach & Abel's symphonies with others of the same kind, particularly that of "La buona Figliola," then lately publish'd, with w'ch I was so much pleas'd that I imediately [sic] got it for my own private practise. We had also now & then a violin concerto from Mr Lethin & organ concerto from Mr Hawker. The only singer was Mr Chapman, who used to sing mostly Jackson's songs in no very elegant style.
