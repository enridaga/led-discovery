<p>[...] Coleman Hawkins came to Kansas City with Fletcher Henderson and Herschel [Evans], Lester [Young], and Ben Webster played for him.</p>
<p>That night, Herschel played all over the horn--played it the way it is supposed to be played because Hawk was his idol. You couldn't say anything bad about Hawkins to Herschel. [&hellip;] Lester, you know, has always been an unlimited soloist, and he was still playing at the session when everybody else was finished.</p>
<p>And then, too, there was something about tone. Hawkins had a full tone and Herschel's was full, too. But Lester's tone was different. It was lighter. Some people would tell Lester that he didn't have a good tone, that he should change his tone. And that would cause friction.</p>
