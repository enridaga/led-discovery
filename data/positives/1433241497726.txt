In the cantata composed for Her Majesty's birthday, Sir George Elvey has treated the 'National Anthem' in a variety of ways, and always cleverly and effectively, as a chorale, as a fugue, and as a fantasia. There is also a well-written madrigal,  'Through the Realm' introduced into the cantata, and although not so well sung as the other portions of the work, was still enough to show the versatility of the composer's talent.
