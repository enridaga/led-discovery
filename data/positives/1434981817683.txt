<p>Bix [Beiderbecke] also made a point of taking me to hear Ethel Waters. It was 1927, I think, and she was in a show called MISS CALICO. She sang, man, she really sang. We were enthralled with her. We liked Bessie Smith very much too, but Waters had more polish, I guess you'd say. She phrased so wonderfully, the natural quality of her voice was so fine, and she sang the way she felt--that knocked us out walkways with any artist.</p>
