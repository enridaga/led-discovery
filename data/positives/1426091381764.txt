<p>Soliva drilled Mlle Wolkow so well for last Saturday that she charmed both the stalls and the pit by her coquetry, her excellent acting and lovely eyes and teeth. She was prettier than any of our actresses; but in the first act I scarcely recognised her voice. She came on in a rich costume, seeming to walk by the sea-side, with lorgnette in hand and flashing deadly glances &nbsp;[...] She moved with such elegance that no one would have taken her for a beginner. All the same in spite of the tremendous applause and bravos she was so nervous that I did not recognise her until her aria in the second act, which she nevertheless did not sing so well as at the second performance two days ago, when the first act also went better. As for the singing, Gladkowska is incomparably better, and when I saw Wolkow on the stage I did not expect such a difference. We all agree that we shall not have another like Gladkowska for clarity and intonation and that superior expressiveness which she displays on the stage. It sometimes happens to Wolkow to sing out of tune, whereas I have twice heard the other girl in <em>Angela</em> and she never produced a single doubtful note. When I saw them two days ago I recited your string of compliments, for which they were very grateful.</p>
