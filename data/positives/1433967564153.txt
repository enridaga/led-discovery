<p>Our music at the church was attended by Sir John Hill's family, Lord Hill, Sir Clement Hill, Sir Robert Hill, Sir Rowland Hill, Lord Denbigh, Lord Bradford, and other neighbouring gentry. Sir Robert sent for his band from Windsor, which gave great eclat to the performance. The trumpet-major of this regiment, Mr. Keightley, I recognised as the son of a carpenter who lived next door to me.

He owned the benefit he had derived, an acknowledgment not often made by musicians, and said, by due diligence, he had risen to his present situation.</p>
