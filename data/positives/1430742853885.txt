Peter Gellhorn, Rankl's other assistant, conducted several performances of "Magic Flute" and I was again playing first clarinet. A beautiful and sensitive pianist, he was very knowledgeable and very hard-working; unlike Reggie Goodhall [sic] he had an excellent stick technique but nothing he could do as a conductor was ever right for the Press, perhaps because of his association with Rankl. In spite of this I can say confidently that I have played for many worse performances that those conducted by these two much-maligned men. I think that Peter's true problem stemmed from the fact that, on his own admission, he did not like to look directly at the players and so he had no real contact with us but was, as it were, conducting an ideal performance in his head or in a small space around him.
