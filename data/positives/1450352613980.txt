<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have participated as a conductor in only a few staged performances and have seen only a few other stagings. (Of recent ones, I should mention the Vienna Opera&rsquo;s, where the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&lsquo;e peste&rsquo;</em> sounded as though the singers really did have the plague, and the Washington Opera&rsquo;s, where the white faces of the chorus glistened like the craters in Emmental cheese.) </span></p>
