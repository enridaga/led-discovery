Go to John Ireland’s via the college at 10.30. Have v. good lesson. I think he quite likes “Preparations”. Practise 12.15–12.45. & all aft. Lauricella doesn’t turn up as arranged – Go to recital with Tumpty by Sheridan Russel (Vcl), assisted by var. others. All English programme – some old music, well played by Russell, & v. interesting suite of L. Berkeley for Vlc & Oboe (H. Gaskell). Rather dull Idyllic Fantasy of C. Scott for Voice (Dorothy Moulton), vlc & ob. New Sonatina (pleasant & competant) for Vlc & Pft of Ben Burrows; nothing striking or original at all.
