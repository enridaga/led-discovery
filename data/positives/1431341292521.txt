<p><em>Do you listen to jazz? </em></p>
<p>Very little nowadays, because there's so much electronic stuff. I'll go back and listen to Art Tatum's collection, that Pablo series [ Tatum Solo Master-pieces], or I'll listen to Leadbelly, Sarah Vaughan, and Billy Eckstine. I like a lot of different things.</p>
