'Parsifal,' yesterday, made a very deep impression upon me, much more so than before, and I shall see it again tomorrow with very great interest. After all, one has no idea in England of such a performance, and one ought to come here every year to learn what can be done every detail is so perfect. The musical pleasure is not paramount, but there are very fine and powerful effects in it, and it is interesting throughout, and much less crude than 'Siegfried'.
