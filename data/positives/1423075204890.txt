Igor Stravinsky... He was a strange, tiny, bird-like man, and quite compelling. On one occasion we played the original manuscript parts of his Firebird ballet at the Festival Hall. Although it was televised and broadcast, we had never rehearsed it fully. He managed to compel me to make a solo entry in the right place when the part, which was wrong, still had me counting three bars of rest.
