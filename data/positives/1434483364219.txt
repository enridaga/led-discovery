Mum & I both go to Norwich. Mum with Mrs. Dance (in her car) & Mrs. Owles & I with John Nicholson in his car. We go to N.S.Q.C. concert. 2.45. Beethoven no. 1. in F; Dittersdorf Eb; Elgar.* Playing rather ragged & lifeless. Mrs. Alston is by the far the best in a rather bad team. Elgar I didn't like - the Dittersdorf was amusing. Back by 6.15.
