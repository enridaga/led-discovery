<p>One Sunday the children started their new hymn. My father turned to his younger daughters and said, ' Where did that come from ? I never heard it before.' ' Oh, Jemima made it,' they replied. Next day he asked for a copy, and sent it, without my knowledge, to The Sunday School Teachers' Magazine. But for this it would probably never have appeared in print." Mrs. Luke adds regarding her composition : "It was a little inspiration from above, and not ' in me,' for I have never written other verses worthy of preservation."</p>
