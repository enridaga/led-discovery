Amateur players comprised about two thirds, and professionals one third, of the orchestra. The professionals were engaged to &ldquo; help out.&rdquo; We were paid the modest sum of two dollars for each evening, whether concert or rehearsal, every Sunday through the season. It was an invaluable apprenticeship. I believe that musicians of the present day, who do not have the slow building-up through the regular performance of oratorios, lose a schooling no other music can give. Old Bostonians were great gainers by being permeated with <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the Messiah, the Israel in Egypt, Samson, Jephtha, Solomon, Saul, Judas Maccabeeus, Acis and Galatea, and Esther, all by Handel; the Creation</em>, the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Seasons</em>, and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">masses,</em> by Haydn; the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Elijah, St. Paul, and the Hymn of Praise</em>, by Mendelssohn ; and the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Requiem</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">other masses</em>, by Mozart</p>
