<p>In 1875 I gave a matine'e and a soiree at my house in Harley Street, at which Edward Lloyd sang. This great artist is well remembered by the present generation. For years he was the leading tenor at all the provincial festivals. He took leave of the British public at his farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall on Decem- ber 12th, 1900, at which I was one of the con- ductors in conjunction with Dr. Hans Richter and Sir Edward Elgar. Lloyd was recalled again and again at the end of the concert, and I rushed to the piano and struck up "Auld Lang Syne," which was sung, with clasped hands, by Albani and the rest of the artists, who were Clara Butt, Evangeline Florence, Sarah Berry, Ben Davies, Santley, Kennerley Rumford, Lane Wilson, Plunket Greene, Johannes Wolff, and Gertrude Peppercorn.</p>
