I went this Evening to see the order of the Boys & children at Christs hospital, there was neere 800 of them, Boys & Girles.... They sung a Psalme before they sat down to supper in the greate hall, to an Organ which played all the time, & sung with that cherefull harmony, as seem'd to me a vision of heavenly Angels: & I came from the place with infinite Satisfaction, having never in my life seene a more noble, pious, & admirable Charity:
