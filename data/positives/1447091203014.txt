<p>[H.S. Dudley wrote in an article in 1928 that Ernest Hogan] "...was a great actor. I remember when he headlined in Vaudeville; he sang 'Emancipation Day,' and when he finished the song, instead of dancing the chorus he pantomimed it so real that you could just imagine you were looking at 'Emancipation Parade". &nbsp;</p>
