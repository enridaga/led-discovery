I could never imagine as a musician that any other part could in fact intensify and reveal more profoundly and clearly the message and sincerity of a musical score. Yet I must confess that when I saw Balanchine’s choreography to Stravinsky’s Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra there was not a quaver nor a rhythmic inflection nor an emotional, intellectual, or humorous communication which was not elucidated in the dances. The pace and tension of even the slowest pieces were conveyed in a remarkable sense of weight, of gravity, of continuity, of length of line and precision of timing. I saw a musical interpretation and was thrilled to admit that Balanchine is one of the greatest interpretative musicians of our era, as well as the most creative choreographer. It is an overwhelming revelation to be made so palpably aware of the transfigured expressiveness of the total body.
