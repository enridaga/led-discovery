<p>I have perfect pitch, which I discovered in the third grade. My teacher didn't have a harp to tune us in, so I raised my hand and said, "I know what key you're singing in." She ran over to test me out on the piano and found out I had perfect pitch. On finger training, you have to sit down and practice passages or take things off records. I used to copy Art Tatum's runs, but that can be like exercises you'd get at school.</p>
