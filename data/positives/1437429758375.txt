<pre>In the month of February, 1811, "Blue Beard" was produced at Covent Garden <br />Theatre ; and Mr. Harris requested me to superintend the getting up of my <br />music, which I did. On the first morning of my going to the theatre, at the <br />back of the stage, I perceived a number of horses, and on inquiry, found they <br />were to prance about in "Blue Beard." I was making my way to the green-room, <br />when, in the middle of the stage, I came in contact with John Kemble, and <br />pointing to the place where the horses stood, I thus accosted him, 

"Now are we in Ardeu!" 

His reply was, "More fools we!" We bowed to each other, <em>&agrave;-la-mode de</em> Noodle and <br />Doodle, in "Tom Thumb," and passed on without further remark. </pre>
