<p>The opera gave me quite a new idea - the <em>concert opera</em>: sit round a table <em>with copies</em> &amp; sing with a minimum of action (<em>no costumes</em>). I thought it was a perfect representation. Do you think there's a <em>little</em> bit too much 6/8 in the opera? I wonder if Nigel Playfair would do it at his light opera season. But I dare say you've thought of that. The one thing I can't yet quite get hold of is 'Hammersmith' - but you are (like your daughter) a realist &amp; you are almost unique in that your stuff sounds better when it is played on the instrument it was originally written for.</p>
