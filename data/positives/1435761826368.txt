<p>&hellip;[A]t one place we ran into Art Tatum. Art had a radio program, also a job in a dicty private club, but preferred wailing after hours.</p>
<p>It was this place every night then. Whenever I wasn't listening to Tatum, I was playing--Art inspired me so much. Chords he was throwing in then, the boppers are using now. And his mind was the quickest.</p>
<p>Art usually drank a bottle of beer while the other pianists took over, and didn't miss a thing. For instance, there was a run that Buck Washington showed me. (Buck, of the Buck and Bubbles team, played a lot of piano, especially when jamming. Everything he did was unusual).</p>
<p>Now Art heard me play this run, which consisted of F, E-flat, D-flat, C; (octave up) C, B-flat, A-flat, G; and so on all the way to the top of the keyboard. When he sat down he played it right off. Other pianists had heard and tried, but taken time to pick it up.</p>
