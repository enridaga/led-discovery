<p>I was at the fourth concert here when the RFH opened in 1951. I still have the souvenir programme for the first five concerts that should have been conducted by Toscanini - instead, they were conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent with Benno Hoisewitch (piano).&nbsp; The programme was the 9th Symphony and Choral Fantasia (both by Beethoven).&nbsp; I would dearly love an invitation t0 the re-opening.</p>
