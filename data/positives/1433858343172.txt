<p>Letter from Bunsen to his wife - I came home in time for the dinner at the Duke of Cambridge's. The Duchess of Gloucester was there,&mdash;most kind and gracious&mdash;full of enquiries after you and mamma. At ten, the Duke retired, to play a quartett with three violinists who can only come on a Sunday evening. I heard this still going on when I retired, and it is said he keeps it up till two o'clock.</p>
