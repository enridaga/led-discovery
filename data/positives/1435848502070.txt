<p>Dizzy Gillespie came into the Calloway band in the early 'forties. The first impression he made was that he was very progressive--even more than Chu Berry. Chu and Dizzy didn't hit it off too well.</p>
<p>[&hellip;] Dizzy was playing a new thing. But Chu's style was based on riff patterns and speed. Diz was working on a new harmonic structure.</p>
<p>Dizzy's music was much more exciting. It was the beginning of a new trend. Dizzy hadn't perfected it yet. There were things he attempted to do that he couldn't, [&hellip;] but he got to me, and I admired him for what he tried. Like he would try a long-range progression with a high note at the end and he missed it. [...] Most of [the band] didn't think he had anything or would amount to anything.</p>
<p>I was a kind of laboratory for Diz in the Calloway band. It was easy to get a bass aside so I'd walk him on bass while he'd try different chords and progressions. At the College Club [may mean 'Cotton Club'], for example, during intermissions, we'd go up on the roof and practice. It was easy to bring a bass up on the roof.</p>
