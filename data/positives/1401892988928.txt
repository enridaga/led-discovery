The evening papers gave a glorious account of a stand made on Wednesday 26th by our British Army, in the proportion of 1 Britisher to 3 Germans. Greatly cheered by this news, Daddy and I went to dine with Theo Barneby and Olive at the Automobile Club, finishing the evening at the Alhambra. It was the first time since the beginning of the War that we had felt in anything like a mood for laughing.
   The house was draped in red, white and blue, and the performance was much leavened with patriotic display. A poem calling all the men to arms was recited and the Marseillaise was sung by the House, everybody standing.
