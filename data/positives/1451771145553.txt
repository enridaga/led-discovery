<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">My Ten Choral Poems are united by a single theme- the 1905 revolution. I do not know how well I succeeded in conveying the spirit of the age. But the music was bound to reflect the huge impression which Russian revolutionary songs have always made on me./ The Poems are really my first experience in the sphere of music for unaccompanied choir, not counting some short choral episodes written for various films. I am fascinated by choral music and intend to write more in the future. / The new composition will be first performed by the Russian Song Choir. I personally have profited greatly from the concentrated, detailed work done on each poem by this magnificent choir and its leader, Professor Sveshnikov. </span></p>
