I heard <em>Parsifal</em> twice. It made a great; impression on me; the beautiful overture and exquisite Good Friday music could hardly fail to move any one; nevertheless, I cannot say that the opera, as a whole, roused me to anything like the same enthusiasm as the <em>Meistersinger</em>, which of all Wagner&rsquo;s works is the one I love far and away the best.</p>
