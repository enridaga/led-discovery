 The next Sunday evening I presented myself at the ' Conservatoire,' where Cherubini lived, trembling with emotion.... His old friend Berton, the once greatly-renowned composer, was with him (' les inseparables ' they were called), and greeted me with equal kindness. Cherubim had a great regard for my former master, Einck, also for G. Weber. After some conversation, of which they formed the subject, I was requested to play one of Beethoven's sonatas, Cherubim professing to be but little acquainted with them, which I found to be the truth by his asking for certain movements, even for whole sonatas, over again not only on this but on many subsequent occasions, for to my intense satisfaction I was invited to repeat my visit. Most of the sonatas I had then the privilege of playing in the presence of Cherubini and Berton were evidently new to them, somewhat to my astonishment, but there could be no doubt about the interest with which they listened to them an interest demonstrated solely by their silent attention and the requests for repeats, for not once did Cherubini make a remark on the beauty or the character of the works, or criticise them in any way.
