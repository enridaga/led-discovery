<p>"september 1980. Just returned from Moscow after 5 weeks working on the Olympics. Within the same week Pink Floyd at Earls Court and then the best night of my listening life. Frank Sinatra at The RFH. Sergio Mendes opened the first half and then the Man arrived. I have never felt such emotion,devotion,or love in one room before or since. Truly the greatest contemporary artist of the 20th Century and in the best modern concert venue. A night I will never ever forget. Thanks for booking him!!!"</p>
