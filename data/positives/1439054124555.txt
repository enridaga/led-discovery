<p style="text-align: justify;">An artist of entirely different calibre [to Rubinstein], yet barely less serious in his aims and certainly not less remarkable for the flawless perfection of his technical gifts, Senor Sarasate had just turned thirty when he made his first appearance before a London audience. Three years later (October 13, 1877) his rendering of Mendelssohn's violin concerto at the Crystal Palace fairly took the town by storm, and he repeated his triumph at the Philharmonic in the following spring. After 1885 he became an almost annual visitor to England, and he also toured several years with unvarying success in the United States.</p>
