<p>The church of St. Peter appeared to me so magnificent, that our St. Paul's seemed but an epitome of it, though built on the same plan. When the Pope chaunts the Te Deum, assisted by the choir, and in some parts by the whole congregation (generally possessing good voices and fine ears), the effect produced is certainly sublime ; but it is in the Pope's chapel only, one can hear in perfection the divine music of Palestrina.</p>
