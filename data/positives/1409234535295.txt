    Since, from an early age, I went to every pantomime in Glasgow, I recall seeing Robinson Crusoe at the Coliseum in the very early ’twenties. The Principal Boy was a popular singer named Fred Barnes. Male principal boys were unknown in Glasgow in those days, though I later saw Randolph Sutton as Boy in a pantomime at the Pavilion. However, Fred Barnes was known to be ‘gay’ (although we didn’t denigrate that adjective in those days). The night I went to the Coliseum I was most impressed to see that the front two rows of the stalls were completely filled with his friends, who went into raptures over his every appearance.
    After all these years I still remember his big ‘hit’ song.
      Oh, what a pal was Mary,
         Oh, what a pal was she.
    An angel was born on Easter morn
       And God sent her down to me.
    Heart of my heart was Mary,
      Soul of my soul divine.
    Though she is gone, love lingers on 
        For Mary, old pal of mine.
    I remember the tune too and, when prevailed under certain conditions, I can belt it out with suitable actions.
