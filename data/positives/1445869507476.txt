<p>Walked down this morning with my daughter to Stowey where I preached the Club Sermon. They marched in great order and parade with Colours flying, drums beating and a band of Musick. After Church they returned in the same order and parade and we all dined at the Rose and Crown. An excellent dinner, a great many Loyal Toasts drunk after dinner and the musick played of God Save the King, and Rule Brittania. Stowey was very gay this day and I think shewed as many pretty faces, genteel and well dressed young Nymphs as any town its size in the County.</p>
