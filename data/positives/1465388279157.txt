<p>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">In the afternoon, at [Professor Haupt's] suggestion, I visited the church of S. Marien, a fine building, possessing one of the largest organs in Berlin, ably presided over by Herr Otto Dienel. The service and organ were both similar to those I had heard in the morning; the organ, however, was enclosed in a much handsomer and elaborately carved case. In the evening I went to the recently erected church of S. Thomas, which has an immense dome in the centre, and is most richly and profusely decorated throughout. Here I found a large new instrument of four manuals, built by W. Sauer, of Frankfort-on-the-Oder. The organist is Herr Succo, an admir&shy;able writer of organ music, whose courtesy and kindness demand my warmest acknowledgments. The service began with a grand old chorale in G minor, and was of the same character as those I have mentioned above. After the service, the organist performed a &ldquo; Toccata&rdquo; of his own, and in other pieces displayed the various qualities of the instrument, which was not so fine in the flue work as the older organs, but much superior in reed work and mechanical appliances, the pneumatic lever being amongst the most valuable.</span></p>
