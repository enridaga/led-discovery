Go in car up town in morning with Mum. & Beth, & walk back with Caesar. Play tennis, 3.30–4.30, 5.30–7.30 on cort opp. with Beth, K. Mead, Mr. Amery, Mrs Sewell, Teddy Rogers & after tea Mr. Sewell. Listen to Prom. after dinner; British Composers’ night. Walton’s wonderful Vla Concerto (beautifully played by Tertis) stood out as a work of genius. Lamberts’ Rio Grande very interesting & beautiful, as was Holst’s Ballet from Perfect Fool, & Warlock’s Capriol Suite. Boughton’s 2 songs (beautifully sung by Trefor Jones) amusing, quite delightful. Smyth’s songs Chrysella, & the Dance – the reverse – despicable!
