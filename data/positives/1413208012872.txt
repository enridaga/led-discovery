Of all my acquaintance no one has contributed more to the pleasures of society, in my native town, than Dr. Hill. His hospitality and urbanity are extensively known, together with his eminence as a physician. The encouragement of the arts depends chiefly upon gentlemen of fortune and education, who have large establishments; for, whether in painting or music, spacious apartments are necessary to viewing the one or hearing the other. These advantages are more generally found in the houses of medical men than in those of any other class of society; and nowhere have our musical parties succeeded better, by the aid of dilettanti performers, than at the residence of Dr. Hill.
