<p>While watching last night the successfully dreamlike (though less successfully dreamlike that two years ago) decors of David Hockney for <em>Rossignol</em>, I of course listened to the beautiful, but finally unsuccessful, music and thought how one thing leads to another, no escape. Elsewhere I've pointed out whence Stravinsky swiped the introductory material. But I hadn't before realised that Honegger's <em>Pastorale d'&eacute;t&eacute;</em> was swiped from the Fisherman's famous plainte in <em>Rossignol</em>, with its suave blues and fluted filigree.</p>
