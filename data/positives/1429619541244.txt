<p>I was present at the dress rehearsal of the ' Barbiere,' she enchanted every one with her Rosina. When the lovely girl appeared on the balcony, she was applauded to the echo, and the magic of her voice and style captivated us in the opening air 'Una voce poco fa.' [...] I can't say which of her characters I consider the most successful, for her vocalization is always enchanting; if I feel the absence of grand dramatic effect, I am more than compensated by the beauty, natural grace, and the combined charm of her voice and person. Her variations on the 'Schweizerbue' are absolutely perfect in their own way, and it never occurs to me to ask myself 'How can she sing such trash?' because she sings it so perfectly.</p>
