<p>Few&nbsp;Roumanian ladies sing or play with any degree of proficiency and my experience in Bucharest salons, to&nbsp;which musical performances are admitted as an element of social diversion, have penetrated me with the conviction that there is not a single first-class pianoforte in the&nbsp;whole city. Even executants of real merit, like the&nbsp;Princess Jon Ghica, appear content to play upon second&nbsp;and third-rate instruments, whilst in the houses of&nbsp;wealthy Boyars whose names are historical landmarks,&nbsp;may be found objects bearing the aspect and dignified&nbsp;by the title of pianofortes, which, considered as mediums&nbsp;for the production of musical sounds, have no more&nbsp;affinity to a Bechstein or a Bluethner than a child's toyfiddle has to a Stradivarius or an Amati.</p>
