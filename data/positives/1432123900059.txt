The utterance might have bene made with less confidence at Newport in the following year, when a splendid body of well-groomed stalwarts were received with prolonged howls of disapproval on appearing on the platform to compete with another male choir. An ugly interference with the wooden benches began, a cordon of police was drawn round the hall, and sufficient order restored to allow us to listen to an admirable rendering of an unaccompanied Psalm by Mendelssohn. To add to the turmoil, a violent thunderstorm broke out just at the right moment. I was given to understand that the cause of the disturbance was the unfair advantage taken by the offending choir in having secured the services of a London trainer in order to improve its methods of singing! Small wonder that the intonation became slightly uncertain during the last few bars, considering that the singers, immovable as rocks, had faced the ravings of the crowd for nearly thirty minutes! The second, and inferior, choir, having had no such exciting trial to undergo, kept in tune and gained the prize which I rather reluctantly awarded to them.
