     We are having a very quiet time at present and having splendid weather. Tonight we are having a bit of a concert. Of course we are the artistes.Someone has unearthed an old piano. More or less in tune.
    The Divisional General [Harper] is coming to hear our band.
     We have a fine pipe band (sporrans, spats and dyed hose tops)
