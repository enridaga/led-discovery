Go to B.B.C. Symph. Concert at 8.15. Sit first 1/2 in area - Haydn Symphony 88 (G) & Mozart Symph. Concertante (Sammons & Tertis (2nd rather disappointing)) - both played with over 60 strings!! Rather ragged & uninspired playing under Boult. 2nd Half in stalls with Bridges (speak to V. Williams, Howells & Bliss) Holsts's - Hammersmith* - interesting. but not H. at his best. Walton's Belshazzar's Feast (National Chorus - mod. good) - very moving & brilliant (especially 1st half) - but over long - & to continuously loud - I felt, Back via Bridges at 12.0
