Thursday Night 10 O'Clock - I am just come from our Frd in Bolt Court, who has agreed to go with me to dear Streatham this Day 7 Night.... 
    We must brush up our feeble Music, though, at Streatham - tell Miss Thrale I have a Power of Musical news for her - I have heard the Bernasconi - Pacchiarotti - & the new Comic Opera rehearsed to Day - - -
