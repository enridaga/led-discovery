Watch a match in the afternoon, against the masters. The school wins after quite a good match, 4-1. Orchestra practise in evening, quite interesting but oh! the orchestra is bad. It consists of 6 first. vlns, 8 seconds 2. vlas., 6 Vlcs., 1 pft, 1 trombone, 2 flutes, 1 Clarinette, but there is about 1/2 a person in the orchestra who can play. Why a school of this musical reputation cant get up an orchestra of decent standard, I don't know; lack of energy?!!
