<p>I have attended many concerts in the Festival Hall over the years but the ones that I will never forget are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.) Otto Klemperer conducting the Philamonic iorchestra in the 1970- especially his 85th Birthday concert ( Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde) Who can forget this frail old man, and his perfromance and powerful vision.&nbsp; 2) Geog Solti with the London Philamonic Orchestra in the 1970's&nbsp; and his outstanding fiery readings of 'Richard Strauss' tone poems. Moments to treasure for ever!</p>
