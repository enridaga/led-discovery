<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">1949-50 I attended one of the test concerts (as a student) before the hall opened.&nbsp; '50 I attended a few of the all-night balls given ;by the Inter-Varsity Club. '70 I was at the Sinatra/Basie concert: midnight 8 May 1970 (programme available) and at Sinatra and Bob Hope and Grace Kelly! and at Sinatra on my 50th birthday - 13 September 1978.
