<p>Angrily excited as was German popular&nbsp;feeling against France and Frenchmen during the terrible struggle of 1870-71, the chefs-d'oeuvres of Gounod, Auber, Halevy and Mehul were not even temporarily&nbsp;withdrawn from the repertoire of the Royal house, but&nbsp;appeared on the bills in their due turn (according to&nbsp;certain prescribed customs of the estabUshment) and&nbsp;drew, so the General-Intendant subsequently informed&nbsp;me, audiences quite as numerous and sympathetic as&nbsp;those which attended performances of Die Zauberflote or&nbsp;Der Freischuetz. In no European opera house &mdash; above&nbsp;all, not in that so long and conservatively directed by&nbsp;M. Halanzier &mdash; have Rubinstein's operas been so splendidly put upon the stage, so favourably received and so&nbsp;frequently given. I have even heard Michael Balfe's&nbsp;Bohemian Girl under the German title of Die Zigeunerin&nbsp;far better played and sung in the house on the Opern-&nbsp;platz than it had thitherto (within my personal experience) been rendered in London &mdash; in a word, as carefilly&nbsp;and intelligently as it has in later years been performed&nbsp;by the Carl Rosa Opera Company.&nbsp;</p>
