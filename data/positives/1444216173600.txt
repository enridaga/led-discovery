<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday was spent in musical matters related elsewhere. I have only to observe that at an academia to which I was carried at night by Signor Marin Giorgi, al Casa Grimani where I heard Signora Bassa perform, it was a company of the chief of nobility of Venice, the 3 persons I have named being among the first class here. This lady who is now pass&egrave;e has still beaux restes &ndash; she plays neat and with taste but her fingering as well as that of a professor who played on the harpsichord there was miserable. In running up the keys it was always with the 2 or 3 finger tumbling over each other &ndash; and in descending &lsquo;twas with the 2 and 1st. &ndash; She had not the brilliancy now in her playing that many of my own scholars as well as those of other people can boast and yet she&rsquo;s the cream among lady players here, and has long held that station. I was very well received here and obliged to sit down twice to the harpsichord which with the heat of the weather almost drowned me.</p>
