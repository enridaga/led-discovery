I lay on the floor throughout making no end of alterations and improvements now there were going to be two players...The strain of the recording was terrible to me though I feel at ease now. As there were two players I had to conduct and I am not an experienced conductor. I had to watch the screen to keep the pace of the music and follow cues; the commentator was on my left, drummers on my right, my score in front of me and a red light switch hung around my neck to signal to the recording chamber. I had to listen to the commentator and drop the music when he was speaking to me and give all cues to the drummers for synchronization watching the screen and my score and remembering to signal to some room for the sychronizing of a record for parts of the film. We worked till 6.30 without a break but the Blades brothers were not satisfied with our recording so we arranged for 8.30 a.m. on Wednesday, I was so exhausted I could hardly speak
