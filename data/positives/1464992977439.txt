<p>The concert took place in a small hall with three to four hundred seats, of which about two hundred were filled. Once again, I was not at all nervous and Ptashka only very slightly. Can it really be that Klein has lifted this burden from us?! When you are not nervous, what possibilities there are for creative inspirations while performing! Ptashka sang not badly, especially taking into consideration how tired she is, that she is not feeling well and that her voice was not sounding at all this morning. The audience was attentive and well disposed, trying hard to understand the music, but only at the end, after the Toccata, was there serious applause. Another post-concert reception, very tedious.</p>
