I also about this time began attending the Assemblies again & on Friday the 29th went with Mr Wafer for the first time to Mr Phillip's little weekly concerts at Weivill, where there happening that evening to be no one else present we play'd only Corelli's sonatas, of which I took the 1st. fiddle, & old Mr Phillips the 2d. & Miss P. the thorough bass on the spinner accompanied by Mr Wafer on the tenor. As I had never heard these sonatas compleat before, I was much pleas'd by the wonderful improvement occasion'd by the addition of the bass & promis'd myself much pleasure as well as improvement from these weekly meetings.
