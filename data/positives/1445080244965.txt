<p>How many&nbsp;highly-polished instruments he [Anton Rudinstein] has irretrievably ruined&nbsp;by allowing his cigarettes to burn long corrugated&nbsp;grooves in their surface whilst he has been wrestling&nbsp;with extemporised difficulties of his own imagining, I will&nbsp;not venture even to surmise. At such times, however&nbsp;&mdash; when the rosewood is slowly calcining and emitting a&nbsp;pungent scent that, as I have more than once noticed,&nbsp;exercises a painfully depressing influence upon the spirits&nbsp;of the suffering pianoforte's owner &mdash; Rubinstein plays&nbsp;with a passionate vigour, intensity of feeling, and subtlety&nbsp;of intorprotaticm that arc peculiarly his own.&nbsp;</p>
