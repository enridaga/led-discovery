I met Zoltán Kodály at one of the Three Choirs Festivals. I think it was at Hereford the first time. One of his works was being performed but I remember that poor Kodály looked terribly bored. I had received a copy of his Sonata for Solo Cello from a great friend, Edwin Evans. He was most enthusiastic about it and told me to go and hear it brought out in London. When I heard it I thought both the Sonata and the player very dull.
