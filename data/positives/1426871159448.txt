Albert Coates... did the "Siegfried". This was the only time I played for him in opera... In 1935 the cuts he put in "Siegfried", when we went on tour to Brimingham [sic] a week later with a small orchestra, were staggering. It was quite usual for Wagner to be heavily cut but this was "Cut eight bars, play eight bars" all over the place; it worked but made it very difficult for us.
