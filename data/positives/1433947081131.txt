<p>An Extract from Contemporary Letters, London; Monday, 14th February, 1842 - On Saturday evening, the 12th, we had the great indulgence of having the music of the Holy Week (as Neukomm arranged the ancient compositions, Roman and German, to the materials combined by Bunsen) performed in our own house, by a small number of good voices (Germans and Danes) sought out by Neukomm and Moscheles. It was droll to see Sir Benjamin Hall walk in,&mdash; in the midst of a performance which might not have been supposed to interest him : however, he seemed pleased with what he heard, and afterwards went in next door to Lady Palmerston's, whither we also had been invited &mdash;but Bunsen had been in bed till the preceding day, and was quite unfit to go out.</p>
