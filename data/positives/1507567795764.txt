And there was a goodly Mass sung as has been heard. And Mr. Thomas Greenhill, wax-chandler, made a great dinner for Mr. Garter and my lady, and Mr. Machell, the sheriff, and his wife, and both the chamberlains and many worshipful men and women at dinner and the waits&nbsp;playing and divers other minstrels, for there was a great dinner.</span></p>
