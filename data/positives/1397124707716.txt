Go to R.C.M. Patron's Fund at 10.0. Here [Hear] rehearsal & performance by L.S.O, Adagio & Scherzo (Edric Cundell conducting himself) - terribly Elgarian & Wagnerian. CÃ©sar Franck Symph. Var. (under M. Sargent) well played by P. Cory (R.A.M). & very good Dance Suite of D. Moule Evans. Quite original
