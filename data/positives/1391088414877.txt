The best thing you can do will be to get me made a Bishop that I may dine now & then at your table: but then do not let it come to the ears of their M_s that I am a mortal enemy to trumpets and drums, single or double. (If Music goes on improving in noise at this rate, I am sure the audiences ought to have double drums to their ears.)
