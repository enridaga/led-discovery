<p>One of the best numbers I ever heard Joe [Oliver] play was "Eccentric". He took all the breaks, imitating a rooster and a baby [on his horn]. He was a riot in those days, his band from 1915 or '16 to 1918 being the best in New Orleans. The La Rocca Boys of the Dixieland Jazz Band used to hang around and got ideas from his gang. The boys playing with Joe then were Johnny Dodds, clarinet; Edward Ory, trombone; Ed Garland, bass viol; Henry Zeno, drums; Eddie Polla, violin; and a guitar player whose name I have forgotten. He didn't use a piano. How those boys could swing, and it was jazz they played too, not ragtime.</p>
