<p>1984? John McLaughlin plays electric guitar again! The reformed Mahavishnu Orchestra: now with sax instead of violin, plays the RFH. Two buddies and I drive up from Bristol and arrive seconds before the gig starts: racing into the hall just in time to catch JM's funky strumming opening to "Radio Activity" the intense opening of one of the best gigs I have ever attended. Rapture!</p>
