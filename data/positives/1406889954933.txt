It is difficult to thank you for last night because I've said it all before. I went expecting a real treat but I doubt if I've ever been so carried away by it before - which is saying a great deal. 

And I'm going to repeat myself - it's the very essence of you.

Which is one of the two reasons (the other being that it is a beautiful work of art) why it is such an important event in my life. 

It was a stroke of either a) genius or b) unconscious humour, to do it just after the Hindemith. It reminded me of the first definite idea of life I learnt while still in my cradle. Namely, that music is a nice thing.
