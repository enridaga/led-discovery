<p>In this connection I must mention here the first concert performance of 'Mavra' a year earlier. Jean Wiener, who had at that time arranged a series of auditions of contemporary music in Paris, on December 26, 1922, gave a concert consisting exclusively of my music, including my 'Symphonies pour Instruments &agrave; Vent' and 'Mavra', conducted by Ansermet. This time also the conditions provided were those which are essential if the music is to be heard and appreciated by the public.</p>
