[August] 21. I dined in the Citty, at the fraternity feast in yron-mongers hall, where the 4 stewards chose their successors of the next yeare with a solemn procession, garlands about their heads & musique playing before them, so coming up to the uper Tables where the gentlemen sate, they drank to the new <stewards> &c: and so we parted.
