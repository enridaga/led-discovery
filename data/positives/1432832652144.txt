Early in the same year [1894] also an influential committee was assembled, under the presidency of H.R.H. Princess Christian, for the purpose of setting up in the Abbey a memorial to the great name of Jenny Lind (Madame Lind-Goldschmidt). The memorial took the form of a medallion, and was unveiled on April 25th by Princess Christian, in the presence of a distinguished company. A few days afterwards Her Royal Highness caused the following letter to be sent to me:

8, Onslow Gardens,
April 24th, 1894.
 
DEAR Dr. BRIDGE, Princess Christian has desired me to write and tell you how much obliged she is to you for the very kind way in which you made and
carried out the musical arrangements, with which all present were delighted, on the occasion of Her Royal Highness unveiling the Jenny Lind Memorial on
Friday last in Westminster Abbey. Her Royal Highness wishes me to mention how much also she appreciated the singing of the boys.
Believe me to be,
 Yours very truly,
 CHARLES ELIOT.
