<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I used to attend RFH concerts whenever I could, as a student in the early 1960s, and usually managed to afford at least 2 concerts a term.&nbsp; I particularly remember sitting behind the orchestra, where the choir would be placed,and having a 'musician's eye view' of Pierre Monteux conducting -- the joyousness with which he took the rostrum was unforgettable.&nbsp;</p>
