<p>Via Bridges they take me to Barbara, where I have dinner and dash off to B.B.C. Q. Hall concert. Very deadly show - a typical, ignorant, listless Boult concert. Elgars' 'Int &amp; Allo'. which I don't like at the best of times. A new &amp; unimportant [?] Scherzo of Holst - Gieseking is disappointing in a dull show of Beethoven's adorable 4th Concerto - tho' technically some of it is perfect. Brahms impossible 2nd Symphony is made even thicker &amp; muddier than it is.*</p>
