If you would know the history of all this temporary metamorphosis in my way of living, the chief cause of it originated from (a common expression which always diverts me, making the cause its own effect) the arrival of Col. Villiers & his regiment at Colchester. You know, or do not know, that the late Lady Clarendon, his mother, made me her Chaplain some years ago, & was extremely civil to me: in consequence of which I became somewhat acquainted with the family: in consequence of which Col. V. called on me, & I have become acquainted with him & Mrs. V. Hence engagements, late dinners, &c. Then in his regiment there is a very good fiddle player, a Captn., a Swede, & several other musical folks. Hence (again) a weekly Concert has been set up, by private & limited subscription, at the White Hart every Thursday; which concert, & the attending rehearsals on the Thursday morning, have swallowed a good deal of my time, & now take up still more of it, as I have the honour (& trouble) to be now director & leader of the band, in my turn. All this has, also, occasioned frequent private musical parties, &c. So you see how engaged, & visiting, & visited, & fiddling & faddling a life I have led!
