Clothed in a foreign <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>garb, it did not really appeal to connoisseurs, while <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the subscribers, as usual, gave infinitely more <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>thought to the interpreters than to the work. That <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Goring Thomas's charming opera would have <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>fared better&mdash; obtained an abiding-place in the active repertory&mdash; had it been presented in English by <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the same distinguished artists, is also a matter of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>doubt. Experience has proved that Covent Garden audiences do not care for opera in the vernacular, whether the work be of native or Continental origin; and it is the same, I believe, with <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the audiences of the Metropolitan Opera House in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>New York. Nor will the prejudice be overcome <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>until the leading singers of the English-speaking countries are perfectly trained in the enunciation of their native tongue and can coax <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>their compatriots into listening with pleasurable appreciation to first-rate native works rendered in the language &ldquo;understanded of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>people.&rdquo;</span></p>
