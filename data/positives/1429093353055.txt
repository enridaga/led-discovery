That same season saw just two performances of a new work by Eugene Goossens, "Don Juan de Ma√±ara", in a most beautiful production ablaze with blue and gold. There was a little serenade which earned a round of applause but otherwise the music was faceless, it was never revived and the event is only worth recording because it was the only new British opera to be put on in the pre-war Grand Season at the Garden in my time.
