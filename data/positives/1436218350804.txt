This afternoon, a nice little party at Boosey's for Robin Holloway, and this evening, a dreary dinner at the Academy. The latter was followed by an as-always-ill-advised recital of works by the new inductees. Ill-advised, because the members are mostly drunk, musically uncomprehending, and more interested in gossiping with each other.
