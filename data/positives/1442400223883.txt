<p>...in the evening I took Daphne Muir to the second Courtauld concert. &nbsp;The Bach suite in D. Anton Bruckner's 8th symphony. &nbsp;The conductor was Otto Klemperer. &nbsp;He was very good and played Bach overture, as Daphne said, as if it were by Beethoven. &nbsp;Before the air there was an outburst of anxious coughing. &nbsp;He waited, grew impatient; turned and scythed the audience with such a look. &nbsp;Then he went to the air played twice as slow as ever I have heard it before, and extremely ode on a grecian urn-like. &nbsp;The Bruckner I found hard to stomach. &nbsp;It is all mental music, weak and scrappy and forever going up to climaxes and down again like someone industriously practising scales. &nbsp;But the scherzo is good - all the best true wandervogel german romantic manner, a great deal of satisfied repetition and a ravishing oboe slippery tangle in the trio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the slow movement, I thought it would never end. &nbsp;It was like being in such a slow train with so many stops that one becomes convinced that one has passed one's station.</p>
