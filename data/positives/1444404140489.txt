<p>Roger is staying with us.&nbsp; I think he has the nicest nature among us - so open, sincere, &amp; entirely without meanness; always generous, I think, &amp; somehow hearty?&nbsp; He throws out a tremendous laugh.&nbsp; We went to the Bedford Music Hall last night, &amp; saw Miss Marie Lloyd, a mass of corruption - long front teeth - a crapulous way of saying 'desire', &amp; yet a born artist - scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing.&nbsp; A roar of laughter went up when she talked of her marriage.&nbsp; She is beaten nightly by her husband.&nbsp; I felt the audience was much closer to drink &amp; beating &amp; prison than any of us.</p>
