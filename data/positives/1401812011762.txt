My earliest recollections of the RFH:- Christmas 1963 - trudging kneedeep through the newly fallen snow past the "lookout posts" along the river, to see the film Born Free.  20 May 1964 - my first encounter with Segovia.  High up on the Green side, our customary position in the Grand Tier.  A packed house and a magical performance of Handel, Bach, Ponce, Albeniz & Granados, I seem to remember there were at least 5 or even 6 encores.
