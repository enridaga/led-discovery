<p>June weather. Still, bright, fresh...I walked Pinker to Grays Inn Gardens this afternoon, &amp; saw - Red Lion Square: Morris'es house; thought of them on winter's evenings in the 50ties; thought we are just as interesting; saw the (street) Great Ormond St where a dead girl was found yesterday; saw &amp; heard the Salvation Army making Xtianity gay for the people: a great deal of nudging &amp; joking on the part of very unattractive men &amp; women; making it lively, I suppose &amp; yet, to be truthful, when I watch them I never laugh or criticise, but only feel how strange &amp; interesting this is: wonder what they mean by 'Come to the Lord.' I daresay exhibitionism accounts for some of it: the applause of the gallery; this lures boys to sing hymns; &amp; kindles shop boys to announce in a loud voice that they are saved.</p>
