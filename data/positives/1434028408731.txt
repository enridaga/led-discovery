Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Osbourne House: Monday 19th July, 1847 -
Here I am, well and quiet, just as if taken away from a seething cauldron, or awakened from a bad dream. The journey and the passage over the beautiful sea, and then a good walk which your good Queen took us, did me a vast deal of good. We arrived at Portsmouth in two hours, saw the Victory (Lord Nelson's ship), going thither in a boat ; then got on the Fairy, and passed the splendid fleet quite near, greeted by all ships with the royal salute, the men drawn up, and the band playing alternately the English and Prussian national melodies.
