I have a beautiful memory of seeing Spiritualized and Sonic Youth at RFH as part of John Peel's Meltdown back in 1998.  It was just after 'Ladies and Gentlemen we are floating in Space' was released. Sonic Youth were on first and played an amazing set that ran through all their greats.  They got the crowd so excited that everybody left their seats and ran down the front to dance. Spiritualized headline the evening with a stunning performance of Ladies and Gentlemen in its entirety that left the crowd in a breathtaking silence. I think John Peel's Meltdown was one of the most inspiring Meltdown line ups and I am so proud to say that I was lucky enough to have experienced part of it.
