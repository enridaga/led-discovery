<p>I have been several evenings at the Queen's Lodge, with no other company but their own most lovely family. They sit round a large table, on which are books, work, pencils, and paper. The Queen has the goodness to make me sit down next to her and delights me with her conversation, which is informing, elegant, and pleasing, beyond description; whilst the younger part of the family are drawing and working, &amp;c. &amp;c., the beautiful babe, Princess Amelia, bearing her part in the entertainment; sometimes in one of her sister's laps; sometimes playing with the King on the carpet; which, altogether, exhibits such a delightful scene, as would require an Addison's pen, or a Vandyke's pencil, to do justice to it. In the next room is the hand of music, which plays from eight o'clock till ten. The King generally directs them what pieces of music to play, chiefly Handel.</p>
