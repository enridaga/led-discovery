<p>All my most recent quartets- the Twelfth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth- have been first performed in Leningrad, usually by the Beethoven Quartet. But because of the death of their wonderful cellist, Sergei Shirinsky, they could not perform my Fifteenth. For this reason I asked the Taneyev Quartet for the first time. I must say they are first-class musicians, who play the quartet superbly. On the eve of its premi&egrave;re in Leningrad I feel nervous - not about how it will be played (I have no qualms about that!) but about the work itself.&nbsp;</p>
