A letter from Bunsen, Tuesday 15th October -
With a heart full of love and thankfulness, I have only time to scrawl a few lines to give you a sign of life, and to dearest mamma, to whom I have written more than one sheet in my heart. We had a beautiful journey, and were singing and talking the live -long day from Monmouth to London. We repeated ' Ar hyd y nos,' and sung our Capitoline ' Godsave the King,' to the great amusement of all our English fellow-travellers, who supposed us to be singing Welsh : the
people passing by on the road greeted us merrily, and we them.
