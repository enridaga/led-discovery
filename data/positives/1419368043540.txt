Tympanists [sic], as distinct from percussionists, are of course quite special people.... They can, after all, drown the whole orchestra at will; and although the conductor may think he is setting the tempo, you may be sure there's nothing much he can do if a determined timpanist decides otherwise. This is probably a subconscious reaction with most of them, but just occasionally it surfaces, as it did with Jim Bradshaw on the very first appearance of Herbert von Karajan in London, conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra. The concert had been exciting, to say the least, the more so since it included the very first appearance of Dinu Lipatti, the wonderful pianist who died tragically a few years later. It had not, however, been without its moments of doubt or disaster, and James reflected sadly on this the next day. 'He wants watching, that Karajan,' he commented. 'He got away from me more than once last night!' He wasn't joking either!
