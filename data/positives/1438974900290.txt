<p style="text-align: justify;">During the opera seasons of 1874-75, there appeared at Drury Lane a young Polish singer, who met with emphatic success in leading barytone parts such as the King ("Favorita"), Don Giovanni, De Nevers, Valentine, and Count Almaviva ("Le Nozze")- He also created a secondary part in Balfe's posthumous opera "II Talismano," which was produced in June, 1874, with Nilsson, Tietjens, Campanini, and others in the cast. I distinctly recollect him in two characters Don Giovanni and De Nevers. It seemed to me that he had a beautiful voice, of almost tenor quality, and both as singer and actor he displayed the highest promise. He appeared then under the name of "De Keschi." Twelve years later he was to return to London and take the town by storm under his own name of Jean de Beszke.</p>
