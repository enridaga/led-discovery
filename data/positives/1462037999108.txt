<p>Everybody has heard of the Haarlem Organ. It was for many years the largest in the world, and is famed for its size the world over. We thought it as good as it is great, and listened to its tones with delight. It is indeed very powerful, but its&nbsp;full power is seldom heard, and never in public worship. There are now several organs as large, or larger; for example, the organ in the Town Hall, at Birmingham; but although the Haarlem organ is now equaled in size, and although various improvements (especially within a few years past) have been made both in action and in pipes, yet there is not perhaps anywhere to be found, a more powerful chorus than that of this famous instrument. Dr. Burney took particular pains to examine and describe it, many years ago; and, in his "Musical Tour in Holland," he gives the details which have been often copied and published. The present organist has fine execution, and appears to understand well his instrument; but, it is a pity that, for the sake of pleasing his company, and confirming his hearers in a bad taste, he should employ its noble powers in battle-piece and thunder-storm representations; or, at least, that these should be made the principal feature of his exhibitions.</p>
