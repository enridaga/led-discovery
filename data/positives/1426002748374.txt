At a matinée in the ‘Römischen Kaiser,’ I heard a new trio by Beethoven. It was no less than the Trio in B flat, and Beethoven himself played the pianoforte part. In how many compositions do we find the little word 'new' wrongly placed! But never in Beethoven's compositions; least of all in this work, which is full of originality. His playing, apart from the spirit prevailing in it, satisfied me less, for it lacks clearness and precision; still I observed several traces of the grand style of playing which I had long since recognized in his compositions.
