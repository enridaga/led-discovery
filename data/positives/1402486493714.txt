I was in search of a quiet estaminet, as I wanted to write up some notes. I gave the sign of the Three Pigeons estaminet a wide berth as I knew from experience what was going on in there... [A]part from the attentions of the quartet of Mam’selles, Tommy Carrol would be singing ‘Roses in Picardy’ at one end of the room, whilst Pat Mayo would be singing ‘My dear old Galway Bay’ at the other. So I took my notebook and notes down to the sign of the ‘Belgian Hare’ estaminet… 
     Madam furnished me with a litre of beer and babbled over ‘cat sue’ francs. I imagined that I had found the ideal place at last and that I could write in peace and quietness. I was to be sadly disillusioned. Madam talked me to death… Madam sang. Madam had a terrific voice; the plaster fell off the ceiling.
