<p>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">&hellip;I consider it my fortune that I have a great many likes: Russian and foreign writers and composers, classical and contemporary. And I think that this is an attitude that every person and every musician should foster in himself. That is my advice to everyone, for one can lose so much otherwise&hellip; Someone once reproached me for being omnivorous, saying that I devoured all music &lsquo;from Bach to Offenbach&rsquo;. But I consider this to be my good fortune. I enjoy both the great music of Bach and the melodies of Offenbach. Thus I cannot name a favourite composer or a favourite writer. I derive real pleasure from very many things and very many writers, composers, artists and sculptors. Though I am a fair age and know and have heard a great deal, I could listen to, let us say,&nbsp;<em>Eugene&nbsp;</em><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Onegin</em> or a modern opera over and over again. I have no favourite genres either: I love them all, from Bach&rsquo;s Masses to the operettas of Johann Strauss. </span></span></p>
