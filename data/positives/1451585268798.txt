<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have just got back from a rehearsal, where the Philharmonic Orchestra under Malko was playing my October Symphony for the first time. It sounded great, and there were no misprints in the score. Today they rehearsed it without the choir; the choir practice will be on Friday or Saturday. I have spoken to some of the singers and they said that the parts are easy and well-suited to their voices. </span></p>
