Dazzling as Heifetz was, I felt confident that my “Perpetuum Mobile” and “Dance of the Goblins” held their own next to his. Kreisler mystified me or rather defeated me. The Heifetz sound lay on the surface of the records I played, wed to grooves, arm and spindle like a beautiful ribbon spooled at seventy-eight revolutions per minute. The Kreisler sound was all subtle emphasis, innuendo, dropped hints which those primitive recordings and I caught as best we could. How I longed to play “Schön Rosmarin” or the “Caprice Viennois” with such chivalry!
