<p>My friend Elliston, (of whom Mrs. Crouch, it will be remembered, prognosticated at&nbsp;York, that he would one day become a distinguished actor,) made his debut at the Haymarket, on the 25th June, 1796, in Octavian, in "The Mountaineers," and Vapour, in "My Grandmother." His admirable voice and excellent acting in both characters, stamped him, at once, a favourite, which he continues to this day; I need hardly say,&nbsp;how very deservedly so.</p>
