In the next season (1877) I performed the 
overture to Wagner's Meistersinger and his 
Huldigungs Marsch, which he dedicated to King 
Louis of Bavaria. These works were not then 
much known in London and they attracted a 
large audience. Herr Arnim von Boehme, from 
Dresden, sang " Siegmund's Liebeslied " from 
Die Walkiire, and a young English singer, Miss 
Elene Webster, " Elizabeth's Prayer " from 
Tannhduser. I also gave the Flying Dutchman 
overture.
