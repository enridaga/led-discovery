When we returned from the Orient in 1972, we had the pleasure of working with Joe Williams for a week in Detroit. I first heard him in Chicago. He was singing around for a while with Jimmy Noone, and at that time he was a very good ballad singer. He sang beautiful sweet songs, and whatever he sang he sang magnificently, but he never got a real good breakâ€¦

Joe Williams was still waiting for his break when he turned to the blues. He was no imitator of other blues singers, but he sang real soul blues on which his perfect enunciation of the words gave the blues a new dimension. All the accents were in the right places and on the right words
