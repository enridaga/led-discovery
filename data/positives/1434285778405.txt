Go with Mr. & Mrs. Bridge to first performance of R.C.M. opera - Holst - Savitri* (rather dull, but beautiful in a way) & Benjamin's op. "Devil Take Her". Brilliantly done. Marvellous little work - every note comes off - charming & witty to a degree. The College students in it were not put in the shade by Trefor Jones (Poet) or Sarah Fischer (Wife) - excellent as they were - which is saying a lot. Enthusiastic reception.
