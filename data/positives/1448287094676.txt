<p style="text-align: left;">Through the politeness of Mr. Moscheles, I was permitted to listen to a private performance of a pianist, who is just coming into most favorable notice, Mr. Dupont from Belgium, He has, say the critics, very great execution and delicacy of touch, and is regarded as approaching nearer to Lis[zt], than any other person. He intends a professional visit to the United States. If all the musicians who go there are treated, as far as dollars and cents are concerned, as was Jenny Lind, there will be no lack of singers and &ldquo;players upon instruments.&rdquo;</p>
