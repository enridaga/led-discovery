I go to Courtauld Sargent-concert* with Howard Ferguson at 8.15. Kodaly's rather dull "Theatre Overture." Suggia plays Haydn's conc. v. well. An amusing Concertante by him (Vln. Vlc. Ob. Fag.). Bax's fourth Symphony.** V. disappointing after 3rd. But one can't judge by one hearing, I suppose Back, after going to a restaurant with Howard by 11.30.
