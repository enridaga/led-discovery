Write letters in evening, & also listen to Philharmonic Bach concert (Herbert Menges). Really quite good - excellent, superb, soloists, Concertos, F min (H. Samuel) & A min (Isolde Menges) - Both with supreme Slow mov. Marvellous Performance of 5th Brandenburg (above two with Gerald Jackson) & creditable, very, performance of 3rd Brandenburg - marvellous work.
