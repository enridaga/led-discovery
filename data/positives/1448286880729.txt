<p>Another recent musical performance of much interest was on the occasion of the anniversary of a Singing Academy (Society) of this place. But one piece was sung, and that was a new composition by Robert Schumann, &ldquo;Der Rose Pilgerfahrt&rdquo; (Pilgrimage of the Rose,) an allegory by M. Horn, to which Schumann has written music. The choir consisted of about one hundred voices, well balanced as to the parts, with an efficient orchestra; the whole directed by the Concertmeister David.</p>
<p>The music is mostly solo, though some fine chorus effects are produced, especially in a funeral scene, the &ldquo;burial of a miller&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; It is, throughout, highly scientific or learned, and of course difficult. A very fine musician, Mr. Richter, teacher of harmony and instrumentation in the conservatory, who was sitting beside me, said, &ldquo;Robert Schumann is truly a great composer, but his music must be studied, and heard more than once, to be appreciated; we cannot understand it at the first hearing.&rdquo; His opera, &ldquo;Genoveva,&rdquo; failed &mdash; it is too learned, and is now seldom performed. He writes for the musicians rather than for the people.</p>
