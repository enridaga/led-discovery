<p>Early dinner &amp; we go to opera at 7.0 to see Fledermaus (J. Strauss). Superb show - never have I heard an orchestra play like that - incredible rhythm, precision, &amp; eagerness. And the singers too. Everything was worthy of the inimitable, delightful work - inspired from the beginning to the end. A marvellous introudction to the Wiener Oper.&nbsp;</p>
