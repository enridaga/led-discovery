<p>Once, when conducting a rehearsal of the "Messiah," one of the lady principals finished her solo with an elaborate cadenza. Sir George waited until the end, and then said, " What's <em>that?</em> Don't you think that if Handel had wanted that he would have written it ?" " Oh ! we always do it in London," replied the lady. " Never mind,' he answered," <em>here</em> Handel shall have it in <em>his</em> way, so please sing it as it is written."</p>
