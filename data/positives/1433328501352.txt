At the concert in April, 1892, the society sung his fine part-song,
"The Zetland Fishermen." Of this performance it was said : " The bright and sparkling song of the 'Zetland Fishermen' by the veteran Sir George Elvey, who occupied a seat in the balcony, is full of clever and effective writing. The treatment of the phrases, ' We'll sing while we bait ' and ' We'll sing while we haul' is nautical in every sense of the word. The piece had evidently received very careful attention at the rehearsals; hence its many beauties were adequately portrayed.
