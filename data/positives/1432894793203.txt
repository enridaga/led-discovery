<p>The King, however, having heard it spoken of, very kindly arranged to go down to the Chapel, and sent, greatly to Mr. Elvey's alarm and surprise, the following message, " The King is in the Chapel, and you are to go at once." At this he rushed off, and upon learning the object of His Majesty's visit, ascended, in fear and trembling, to the organ-loft. He commenced to play, feeling sure that his music must be a failure when heard without the voices, and still lower sank his spirits when word was brought that the anthem was to be repeated. When once again the King demanded it, Elvey's spirits sank to zero. But this feeling was dispelled on descending the organ-loft stairs, around the entrance to which friends were waiting, eager to pour upon him their congratulations at his wonderful success in having so thoroughly pleased His Majesty.</p>
