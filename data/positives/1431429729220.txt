I have heard Yureneva sing on the radio several times. I have also heard her in chamber music concerts, and I really liked her singing. I have sent her my Blok settings and asked her to consider singing them. / I am a bit worried about her partners, however. I would be absolutely happy with, for instance, Mikhail Vaiman or Boris Gutnikov as violinists, but I don’t know about the cellist. Is there an outstanding cellist in Leningrad anything like Rostropovich? You move in musical circles; please let me know. Nadezhda Yureneva’s agreement, and only then put the ensemble together. Yureneva has absolutely captivated me with her musicality, her beautiful voice and her well-night impeccable diction.
