     Randy’s playing was incredible. I didn’t realize he’d held back at the rehearsals. His big sound, range, and jazz were overwhelming. He played about eight choruses of “Groovin High,” slowly building in intensity until he reached a climax on the eighth chorus. I never got tired of listening to him and he greatly influenced my playing.
