<p>I met my husband in 1949 and went quite often to the Royal Festival Hall. We have photos of ourselves taken at the Skylon on the South Bank in 1951. Our first concert was to see Claudio Arrau the Chilean pianist. Since then I have been going to the RFH non-stop including the National Theatre.</p>
