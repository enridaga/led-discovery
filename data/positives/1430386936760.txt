I also did a take-off on Lulu Belle. That was another Broadway hit, starring Lenore Ulric, that Edward Sheldon and Charles MacArthur wrote. I had met David Belasco, with his collar turned backward, who produced it. In the play Lenore Ulric played a Negro trollop who works her way up to a count and a boudoir in Paris by her diligent whoring. In my take-off on Miss Ulric I sang "You Can't Do What the Last Man Did," and this take-off was later in Africana.
