I am not fond of the insult of a triumph; but many of [Charles] Hewitt’s friends would not be satisfied without our parading about the town. I would not desert him, but went thro’ all the blackguardism of electioneering. We marched with the military band before us; stopped before old [Charles] Gray’s door, & treated him with a dead march. They intended to have given him a holla; but indignation converted it, as it came out, into groans and hisses. He has given immortal offence to his best friends by his conduct in this matter.
