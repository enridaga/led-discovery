<p>I got upon my feet and staggered&nbsp;to the window, peering nervously through which I took&nbsp;in the whole dread reality at a glance. There they were,&nbsp;forming a hollow double circle, in the centre of which&nbsp;stood the gorgeous bandmaster, leading with his hand in&nbsp;lieu of a b&acirc;ton &mdash; two score swarthy, wiry, deep-chested&nbsp;Arnauts, blowing, beating, and jingling at high pressure,&nbsp;and looking as if they could go on doing all these things&nbsp;for unnumbered hours without turning a hair. I may&nbsp;say with truth that I had never entirely realised what&nbsp;cymbals were capable of, in the way of poisoning human&nbsp;happiness, until I heard that band play. Nor had I been&nbsp;aware that any tune could be harmonised in such sort that its accompaniment should exclusively consist of discords. As "long I stood there, wondering, fearing,"&nbsp;I learnt all this and a good deal more, equally discomforting. Presently the bandmaster, looking upwards in&nbsp;a spasm of inspiration, brought on by a more than usually&nbsp;deadly dissonance &mdash; at that particular moment the brasses&nbsp;were playing simultaneously in at least six different keys&nbsp;&mdash; caught sight of my face at the window. Instantly a&nbsp;lurid smile illumined his tawny countenance; he waved&nbsp;his hand more firantically than before, and spoke some&nbsp;word of power to his bandsmen, the immediate result of&nbsp;which was an explosion of noise to which their previous&nbsp;achievements in that line had borne the relation of a&nbsp;whisper to an eruption of Vesuvius. By this time my&nbsp;kindly host, slippered and dressing-gowned, made his&nbsp;appearance in my room, and explained to me at the top&nbsp;of his voice that this abominable din was in the nature&nbsp;of a high compliment, paid to me by my august host of&nbsp;the preceding evening &mdash; that it would last for fully an&nbsp;hour and a-half longer &mdash; that etiquette required me to&nbsp;remain at my open window throughout the execution of&nbsp;the entire programme, and, finally, that the entertainment would cost me at least ten ducats (nearly five&nbsp;pounds), that being the smallest backshish one so highly&nbsp;favoured by the Pasha could offer to the garrison band.</p>
