What musical follies are daily perpetrated, for one shilling a head, in the Egyptian Hall! Michael Boai, a German, who hits his chin with his fists, producing thereby sounds in which a tune is discernible and variations thereon, and an Englishman who pretends he can produce two tones at once by humming like a clarionet and muttering a bass tone simultaneously. What rubbish all this! Equally ineffective is a band of Russian horn music, each member having a reed-pipe capable of producing but one note, which, in the performance of pieces, he brought in
with unerring precision.
