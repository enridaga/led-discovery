Toward the end they received valuable assistance in their studies from the veteran maestro al piano, Herr Saar, a well-known figure <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>at Covent Garden for upward of a quarter of a century. This excellent musician&mdash; a genuine type <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of the old German school&mdash; was the conductor at Strasburg, and familiar with every note of Wagner's scores. He shared my intense enthusiasm <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>on the subject of Jean de Reszke's <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;predestination'' for the great Wagner roles, and his joy over the approaching advent of the new Walther von Stolzing knew no bounds. I was often present when he came round to the Continental to do a morning's work with the great tenor. His good-humored face would be wreathed in smiles as he sat down to the piano; and when Jean sang the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;"</span>Probelieder" or the ''Preislied," with a charm <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that gave them a new meaning, the old accompanist would gaze heavenward through his spectacles with a look of ecstasy that was far more eloquent than words. He objected to the cuts; he cordially disliked the Italian text; but he was aware that both were indispensable, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that we all agreed with him. </span></p>
