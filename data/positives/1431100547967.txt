In the month of August one does not expect to hear much music in Leipzig or Berlin, but in the latter city I witnessed the most ludicrously bad operatic performance within my recollection, and that rendering of Die Braut von Lammermoor in the Royal Opera House deserves to be recorded. The name of the Edgaroâ€“Herr somebody, als Gast (as "star") has happily escaped me, but the extraordinary costumes worn by all concerned were a source of delight which amply recompensed the Scottish eye for the torture of the ear. The peculiar cut and brevity of these wonderful kilts were doubtless designed and specially adapted to an exceptionally hot summer. Nor did the renowned orchestra shine on that occasion.
