<p>Freddy Jenkins came to us from Wilberforce University in 1928. [...] He was a good reader, but he developed an extra dimension that earned him the nickname of "Posey." It really began with his sitting at the end of the trumpet section. He brought us a new kind of sparkle: his every move was a picture, in the groove, and right on top of the action. Even a clich&eacute; in his solos had an extra unique flare, a personality play. He was total "theatre"-<em>le plus jambon</em>. He dressed flashily, almost foppishly, and gained the attention veteran vaude-villians strove for--and bragged about whenever they attained it. Posey's showmanship was unforgettable. People still ask, "Whatever happened to that wonderful, left-handed trumpet player who used to sit out there at the end?"</p>
