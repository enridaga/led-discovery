It must have been through Mathilde Verne’s interest in chamber music that Solomon [Solomon Cutner] came to study the piano part of Dohnayi’s violin sonata in C sharp minor with her, for I played it with him at a public chamber music concert at Woodford in Epping Forest. His feet, at nine-and-a-half, barely reached the pedals, but he played quite astoundingly the very difficult piano part, not only technically but with mature musicianship.
