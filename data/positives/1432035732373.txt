Dr. R. A. Torrey once called on me and told me that while he and Mr. Alexander were holding
meetings in Belfast, one of the most enthusiastic helpers was a typical Irishman, well known as an active worker all over the city. " He was constantly bringing drunkards to the front and dealing with them," said Dr. Torrey, " and holding meetings in the open air all over the city. The story of his conversion was exceedingly interesting. At that time he was a prisoner in a cell in Belfast. The window of his cell was open. Mr, Sankey was singing ' Hold the Fort ' in another building. The words floated across through the open window into his cell and went home to his heart. There in his cell he accepted Christ under the influence of this hymn. I think he never saw Mr. Sankey in his life."
