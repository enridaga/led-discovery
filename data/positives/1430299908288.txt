My [Chris Murphyâ€™s] earliest musical memories are of the old 78s that my Mom used to play. I grew up on Bing Crosby singing Irish favorites and Christmas songs (I still get a catch in my throat when I hear "I'll Be Home For Christmas"), "Ghost Riders In The Sky"--a record I just about wore out--and Stephen Foster's songs, which I loved for their melodies and sadness.

Then, in the mid-fifties, something happened that changed everything: Rock and roll arrived. Our home, like homes all across the U.S., filled with the sounds of Elvis, Bill Haley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis.
