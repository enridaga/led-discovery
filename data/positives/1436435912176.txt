<p>After leaving Rome I went with Clement Scott to Naples, where we took our rooms at the Hotel Vesuvius, which stands on the long, beautiful esplanade facing the bay. The manager, who knew Scott from having been manager of the "Greyhound" at Hampton Court, was much pleased to see him, and very attentive to us. We drove together to Sorrento, which lies in the Bay of Naples a little way from the town, and had our lunch at a restaurant, sitting at the open window, to the accompaniment of some mandoline players, who sang Tosti's songs and folk-melodies and made us feel quite happy and contented. Before us was the Bay of Naples, with Vesuvius in the distance and the beautiful Island of Ischia. Scott was enchanted, and said he would like to live there for ever.</p>
