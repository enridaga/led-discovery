<p>I remember an evening while Fred was still working in his empty room downstairs, when he called me and Ida to hear a song he had written to words of Nietzsche. It was the 'Mitternachtslied' from Zarathustra: 'O Mensch! gib Acht!' etc. and formed the nucleus of the great 'Mass of Life'. It was quite wonderful. We sat on cushions on the floor, and Fred at the piano with a flickering candle played to us that solemn and intense song, '...Doch alle Lust will Ewigkeit..'; the greatest yearning of humanity was expressed so beautifully, and I was overcome with the wonder of it all, that in my house this had been created, that Fred was so gifted and had all his life before him to create such beautiful things.</p>
