...[A]t that Halloween party at Jack's [Rathskeller] I sang. In places like that, when there was a party, there was usually a three-man band - piano, guitar, and drums. At least one of the boys could sing and the drummer went in for original and spectacular effects. Some of those boys just out for a good time did all the wonderful things great modern drummers do now.

Joe Jenkins was at the piano in Jack's that night. He was a big, fat kid who could play anything, do anything wiht the keys. He knew every song, published and unpublished...

And that night at Jack's, Chippie [Ethel] Waters got up and sang the tearful ballad, "When You're a Long, Long Way from Home." The crowd liked my rich, young voice, and I had to give two or three encores.
