ï¿¼Sir George Smart for the first time raised his baton, and Handel's Coronation Anthem, performed by such a host, in such a place, was so grand that none present are likely to forget it; the newspapers talked of several ladies weeping, and some actually fainting. I was deeply moved by these sounds, and must confess I never heard such an effect before. We had the whole of the 'Creation', and a part of 'Samson'. The solo singers were old Bellamy, who had sung in 1784, E. Sequin, a young pupil of the Royal Academy of Music, and the admirable Phillips; the tenors were represented by Hobbs and the inimitable Braham; Miss Stevens and Madame Caradori Allan, both excellent, sang the soprano parts. The chorus and orchestra were first rate, and the first day might deserve to be called a perfect success.
