Another event that was celebrated on a large scale at Horsham was the coming-of-age, on Saturday, the 7th October, 1843, of C. G. Eversfield, Esq., of Denne Park. The whole parish was then one scene of rejoicing; a large white flag was fixed at the top of the Church steeple early in the morning, which was ushered in by a merry peal on the Old Church bells. The day was beautifully fine and not cold. At 12 o'clock the band paraded the town, and then marched to the Vicarage, where 750 children were waiting; all joined in singing the "Old Hundredth," accompanied by the band, and then marched to Denne Park.
