Glazunov himself loved to sit down at the piano, and once he started playing it was hard to stop him, in fact, it was almost impossible. He usually played his own works and he was capable of playing two or three symphonies in a row. I sometimes had the feeling that he went on playing because it was hard for him to get up. That’s how sedentary Glazunov was – it was easier to sit and continue playing.
