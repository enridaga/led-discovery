I had brought a few letters of introduction with me, one of which was to a most amiable man, a member of Parliament, who a few years later rose to a high position in the Government... He knew from the letter it was my wish to be heard, and as it so happened that he had a large evening party two days later, he proposed that I should play a few pieces during the evening, saying that I should meet many influential people, with whom I would certainly be glad to make acquaintance. I accepted readily...I did go [and] played two pieces.
