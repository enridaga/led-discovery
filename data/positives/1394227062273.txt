The next Sunday I went to church more I fear with the thought of hearing Mr Relfe (whose turn I concluded it was now to exhibit) than with those of devotion, but was greatly disappointed at finding the organ played again by Mr Wheatley, whose style I soon recogniz'd as he gave us 2 more Cornet pieces & so much like those play'd the preceeding Sunday that some of the boys who had not very discriminating ears as to music pronounc'd them to be the same pieces.
