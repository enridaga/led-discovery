<p>I first met Joya Sherrill backstage at the Paradise Theatre in Detroit during 1941. I asked her recently to refresh my memory with some details of our very happy musical association, and she remembers it like this:</p>
<p>"I had written a set of lyrics to &lsquo;Take the "A" Train&rsquo; and had come to the theatre to sing it for you. I had no thought of singing with your band, but only hoped you would like the lyrics I had written.</p>
<p>"You called Billy Strayhorn to the piano. He played, I sang, and you listened. After I had finished, you asked me to sing something else, and I sang three other songs.</p>
<p>&rsquo;That's Very Good&rsquo; you said&hellip;</p>
<p>"A few months later, a call came to me one evening in Detroit from Pittsburgh, from Duke Ellington. I shall always remember exactly what you said.</p>
<p>"I've been thinking about you&rsquo; your first words were. &lsquo;Sing something for me.&rsquo; I was so excited, tears were streaming down my face, and I tried to think of a song to sing.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>"I sang a few bars of &lsquo;I've Got a Guy.&rsquo; It was a long-distance call and I thought I should be brief. &lsquo;Sing the rest of it&rdquo; you said. So I finished the song, and I remember word for word what you said then:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would like to use you to broadcast and record. Your diction is perfect and you articulate so well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>What Joya doesn't say, of course, is that she did such a good job on "I'm Beginning to See the Light" that we have been playing it ever since. It is a tribute to her diction and articulation, too, that when I ask them to join in singing it with us, audiences all over the world seem to know the words.</p>
