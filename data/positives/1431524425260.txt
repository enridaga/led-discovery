One of the most impressive occasions on which this hymn was sung was in the Agricultural Hall in London, in 1874, when the late Right Hon. W. E. Gladstone was present. At the close of his sermon Mr. Moody asked the congregation to bow their heads, while I sang " Almost persuaded." The stillness of death prevailed throughout the audience of over fifteen thousand, as souls were making their decisions for Christ.
