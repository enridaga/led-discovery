<p>Orchestral concert last night at Curtis of the music of three of my four students: Bill Coble's hyperlush <em>Eulogy</em> conducted by himself, Gregory Hall's winsome two-minute <em>Interlude for Strings and Winds</em>, and Jim Helgesson's stylistically uneven but dashing <em>Divertimento</em> for Piano and Orchestra... Proud of them all. It's a semiannual luxury for the composition students to be offered such a program. It should be a biweekly necessity, at all schools.</p>
