<p>"Eisk&ouml;nigin"</p>
<p>At 1 o'clock I went to the Mercks to lunch. Afterwards, I drove with Dr M and the elder daughter to the Opera House. We had excellent seats in a box facing the stage. The performance began with my ballet [Gallimaufry, performed under the title Die Eisk&ouml;nigin]. It was conducted by Theo Ziegler (?). Orchestra fine! It all came off most splendidly. The staging and dancing all <em>delightful</em>. Then they did "Maria im Walde" (a lovely episode) and Stewelpeter by Norbert Schultze - a modern who has the courage to be simple! My work was quite <em>modern</em> in style by comparison. But Schultze's music is most delicate and charming - especially the Maria ballet - lovely on the stage too. Afterwards there was a tea-party at the Mercks', to which Helga Swedlund (?), Schmidt-Isserstedt and Schultze all came.</p>
