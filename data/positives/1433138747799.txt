In my early years in London I was a regular attendant at the concerts of the (now Royal) Philharmonic Society. Cusins was then the conductor, and I always thought that he did his work well. Among my very clear recollections are some hot
disputes over the merits of the "Meistersinger" Overture when it was first played.
