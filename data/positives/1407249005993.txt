About singing out of tune, I am not altogether displeased to hear the Italians do it, as the Germans do. Carl Rosa in an article on English Opera (=opera by anybody you like with the words in English, translated of course; not opera by English composers) remarks on the good ear of English audiences and amateur performers and says that he has witnessed Germans at a concert listen undisconcerted to a singer out of tune where in England half the audience would manifest signs of distress; and to the same effect of performers.
