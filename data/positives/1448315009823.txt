<p>&nbsp;It&nbsp;is just possible that Brahms himself could play them [Beethoven's sonatas] as&nbsp;they ought to be played, if he would take the trouble to&nbsp;practise them. This, however, he does not do &mdash; or did&nbsp;not when I was privileged to meet and hear him &mdash; and there are but few pianists living who combine the physical strength, manual skill, and intellectual quickness&nbsp;that may enable a performer <em>hors ligne</em> to overcome the&nbsp;formidable difficulties with which the works above&nbsp;alluded to teem. To sum up Brahms 'pianofort' playing&nbsp;in a few words, it belongs neither to the old nor to the&nbsp;new school; it is not coldly classical, nor ardently emotional; it lacks some of the qualities that constitute&nbsp;executant greatness of the first order; but it is original,&nbsp;and instinct with a genius that is reproductive as well as&nbsp;creative.&nbsp;</p>
