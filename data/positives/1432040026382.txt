When Mr. J. Denham Smith was holding a series of meetings in the Metropolitan Hall in Dublin, his own little boy about four years of age was very much interested, and deeply convicted of his sinfulness. He was very fond of singing, as were all the members of his father's family. One evening after
they returned from the children's meeting, his mother and sisters gathered around the piano and began to sing some of their familiar hymns, when his voice mingled with the rest. Though so young, he had caught many of the refrains and could join in them most heartily. Finally, they came to the hymn which he had often heard the congregation sing, commencing,

Now I have found a Friend, Jesus is mine ; 
His love shall never end, Jesus is mine.

Though all the rest of the family present united in singing these words, his little lips were closed ; at length he said, " Please, mamma, don't sing that hymn ; Jesus is not mine yet."
