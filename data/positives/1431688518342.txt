Last day of the festival, which began with Liszt's Cantata. It has much that is well thought and felt, as, e.g. the introduction of the Andante of the B major Trio, which is cleverly managed; there are also some good instrumental effects; as a whole, however, it is too fragmentary. Liszt, who was vehemently applauded, received an orchestral flourish. The Court arriving late, the Cantata was repeated, and the King made a selection from the programme of the concert, which he staid to hear. Overtures 'Egmont' and 'Coriolan' admirably conducted by Spohr. Violoncello solo, Ganz. Weber's Concert stück, Madame Pleyel. Air from 'Fidelio,' Miss Sabilla Novello. Liszt accompanied Fräulein Kratky in a song. Liszt's performance of Beethoven's Concerto in E flat major, almost entirely satisfied one: I can't imagine any one playing the energetic and spirited part of the work better than he did. In other parts I should have preferred a little more warmth and tenderness.
