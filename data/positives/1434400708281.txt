I go to a concert at the Y.W.C.A. (Grt. Russell St.) with Mrs. Bridge (actually go with Mr. & Mrs. Brosa in taxi as well) Brosa Quartet - Haydn Emperor, Beethoven C# (Miracle) & Debussy G. min.* They played superbly (except for a slip on part of new 'cellist - Meurice - in Beethoven). Brosa is, of course superb. Go back to a Mrs Pember(?) in Sussex Gardens, after for supper. A whole crowd goes including Bridges (+ Mr) Brosas & a very nice Miss Bowes-Lyons. Back before 2.0.
