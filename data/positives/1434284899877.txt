Go to dress Rehearsal of Benjamin's "Devil Take her" at College. (Trefor Jones & Sarah Fischer in chief parts - Beecham conducting) It is a very brilliant affair & comes off marvellously. Very effective on stage & humourous. Performance really very good. A very capable, amusing, if not great, work.
