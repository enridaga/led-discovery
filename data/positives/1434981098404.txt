<p>Taking Bix's place [playing horn with the Wolverines] was the biggest thing that ever happened to me. The Wolverines were THE jazz band in the country, so far as we were concerned. And Bix--as I say, I had never met him, but just hearing I'm play was enough.</p>
<p>I've heard many great trumpeters since those days, but I haven't heard another like Bix. Somehow or other his style, the cleanliness and feeling, was lovely.</p>
<p>Let's call him the master and leave it at that.</p>
