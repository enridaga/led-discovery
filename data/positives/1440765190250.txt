<p class="MsoNormal">Word was getting around that Louis [Armstrong] was a good trumpet player. So, one night Freddie Keppard came in to hear us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The bandstand was down low and Freddie stood there by the bandstand and he listened a while, and then said to Louis, &ldquo;Boy, let me have your trumpet.&rdquo; So, Louis looked at me and I bowed my head, so Louis gave him the trumpet. So, Freddie, he blew &ndash; oh, he blew and he blew and he blew and then the people gave him a nice hand. Then he handed the trumpet back to Louis. And I said, &ldquo;Now, get him, get him!&rdquo; Ooh, never in my life have I heard such trumpet playing! If you want to hear Louis play, just hear him play when he&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">angry</em>. Boy, he blew and people started standing up on top of tables and chairs screaming, and Freddie eased out real slowly. Nobody ever asked Louis for his trumpet again.</p>
