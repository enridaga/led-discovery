I passed through the narrow stage door with Professor Keneman. Blinded by the bright lights and deafened by noise, I stared at the tremendous audience. There was no applause to greet us. No one seemed to have such a notion â€“ they greeted each other instead. As soon as I sat down, Keneman proceeded with the Polonaise by Popper. It was surprising to hear such a restrained gentleman play suddenly with a devil-may-care gusto. I took over with no less bravura.
