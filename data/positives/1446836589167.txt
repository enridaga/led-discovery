<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Last summer we went with two friends to one of the free lunchtime concerts - The Ukele Orchestra of Great Britain - which was one of the most entertaining things I've ever seen. We love the free concerts, especially when people get up and dance. It's a great way to introduce children to a wide variety of music in an informal setting.&nbsp;</p>
