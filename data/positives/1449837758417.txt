<p>One evening we were booked to appear at the church hall in Little Weighton, a village to the west of the city. We arrived early and went for a drink in the local pub. As we started to drink, the sound of Oscar Peterson filled the bar. I checked with the barman.<br />'Is that Oscar Peterson?'<br />'The one and only.'<br />'I don't think I've ever heard Oscar Peterson in a pub.'<br />'It's strictly against regulations. I'm supposed to play official music supplied by the brewery, but it's all crap so I always play my own tapes in the early evening before the place fills up.'</p>
