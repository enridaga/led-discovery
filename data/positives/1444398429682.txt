<p>Yesterday being my birthday &amp; a clear bright day into the bargain showing many green &amp; yellow flushes on the trees, I went to South Kensington &amp; heard Mozart &amp; Beethoven.&nbsp; I don' t think I did hear very much of them, seated as I was between Katie and Elena, &amp; pitched headforemost into outrageous banter of the usual kind with the Countess.&nbsp; But the Countess was very affable &amp; jolly, invited me indeed insisted upon my coming, to tea with her. We turned our money under the new moon.&nbsp; She vibrated under the pleasure of a compliment - 'when Lady Cromer's there one feels &amp; c &amp;c -' a compliment to her beauty. But the room was clamorous with South Kensington.</p>
