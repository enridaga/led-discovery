He seizes the guitar, and, sweeping its strings with passion, causes it to wail like a zither, then peal out like the strains of a military band, and finally settle into the rich chords and settled cadences of a strong harp. All resistance and murmuring ceases as the astonished party follow him, spell-bound. His cravat flies loose, his coat-tails wave madly to and fro, he gesticulates like a maniac, and the irresistible music streams forth louder, wilder, more magical than ever he strides, leaps, dances forward with the guitar, which is no longer a guitar, but the very soul of NICOLO PAGANINI. A few days later still the mystery was cleared up. PAGANINI had been officially called to Florence by the Grand Duchess to superintend the Court concerts, and the whole of the town was soon ringing with his name.</span></p>
