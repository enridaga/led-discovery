<p>Go to B.B.C. Symphony concert, cond. so called, by A. Boult. Rimsky Korsakov's Easter ov. sounded dead. Bartok (a v. fine pianist) played his 2nd Conc. I don't want it. To finish with Bliss's truly dated Morning Heros. Massacre of fine words. Scherzo was best - but, what a concert! The Bridges bring Grace (who went with me) &amp; me back in their car.&nbsp;</p>
