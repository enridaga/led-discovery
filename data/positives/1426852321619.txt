Oh yes, Lord, Mama believed in going to church. Ours was the Shiloh Baptist Church, and I liked it best for the singing. 

Church was simple: Preacher sang or recited, and the congregation sang right back at him. Hardly an accompaniment-- we didn't have a piano in church until I became much older-- and the services were basic and raw. That's how I got my first religion and my first music.
