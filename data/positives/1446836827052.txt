<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In April 2001 was the first time I came to a concert here with my husband and a friend. It was for an orchestra led by one of the Buena Vista Social Club members, can't remember the name now&hellip;. We were sitting on the choir seats. I was 23 weeks pregnant with my first baby, the belly growing day by day. The sound levels were quite high and for the first time I felt the baby kicking. He was clearly hearing the music. As I rocked my body to the music he calmed down and we listened together.</p>
