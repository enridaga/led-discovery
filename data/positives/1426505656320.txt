I shall play my F minor Concerto and my Variations in B flat. Concerning these I received a few days ago a ten-page review from a German in Cassel who is full of enthusiasm for them. After a long-winded preface he proceeds to analyse them bar by bar, explaining that they are not ordinary variations but a fantastic tableau. In the second variation he says that Don Giovanni runs round with Leporello; in the third he kisses Zerlina while Masetto's rage is pictured in the left hand and in the fifth bar of the Adagio he declares that Don Giovanni kisses Zerlina on the D flat...I could die of laughing at this German's imagination.
