This was in some respects the most striking function of the series. The gathering was in every sense a representative one, and the famous abbe, as he went round chatting from group to group, seemed positively radiant with happiness. To repeat his own words, addressed to myself: &ldquo;You have so overwhelmed me with kindness in this country that I shall be quite sorry when the time comes for me to leave you.&rdquo; The programme comprised his &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; for strings, a chorus for female voices, a pianoforte piece, and some songs; and finally, amid a scene of great excitement, he himself played the finale of Schubert's &ldquo;Divertissement a la Hongroise&rdquo; and his own Hungarian rhapsody in A minor. This glorious treat furnished the crowning feature of a memorable evening&mdash; doubly memorable because it was the last time but one that Franz Liszt touched his instrument in the presence of a public or quasi-public assemblage.</span></p>
