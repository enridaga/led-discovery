<p>Julius&nbsp;Epstein, when I first made his acquaintance, was thirty-four years of age, tall, slight, and of a sallow complexion,&nbsp;with raven black hair, moustache, and whiskers, as carefully attended to as those of the most dandified "plunger"&nbsp;in the Vienna garrison...When he was seated at the piano his body&nbsp;never swayed or swerved in the least, even whilst his&nbsp;long white fingers were achieving marvels of agility, but&nbsp;preserved the rigidity and severe tenue of a model drill-sergeant under inspection. That such a type of deportment should be frugal in his dealings with the pedals&nbsp;was a natural consequence of the imperturbable sobriety&nbsp;characterising his every action... In one respect his playing was always a treat; in&nbsp;another, a disappointment. It was as nearly faultless as anything done by human hands could be ; but it never&nbsp;made the least apparent effort to awaken the sympathies&nbsp;of the audience for the composer, or to place the performer en rapport with those around him. That Epstein&nbsp;would play every note of the music assigned to him,&nbsp;exactly in conformity with all the author's indications&nbsp;touching time, accent, and emphasis, was a foregone conclusion to all habitues of Vienna concert-rooms ; but it&nbsp;was no less certain that his faithful rendering of what&nbsp;he saw, and nothing more, would be absolutely devoid&nbsp;of enthusiasm, warmth, or sensibility.</p>
