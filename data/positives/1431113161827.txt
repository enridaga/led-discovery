With all these melodious and attractive young women I made acquaintance when an Academy vacation permitted the acceptance of a short engagement as leader with George Cooper's Opera Company at Birmingham. The manager, Spohr's pupil and an excellent violinist, only entered the orchestra on one evening for a few minutes to play an obbligato in Lurline. His amiable wife–Madame Tunneller on the bills–was an accomplished singer and actress.
