Tonight there was a concert at the casino, which was quite good. Captain Johnson - one of our MOs who is a New Zealander - trained a gang of orderlies to do a Maori Haka dance, all with their faces made up ... I expect the orderlies felt a bit shy about it. There was a hospital sketch too, taking off everyone - Colonel, Major, the MOs, us, the orderlies - which was much enjoyed.
