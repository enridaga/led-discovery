These days leading toward Christ's rebirth have been scary and surrealistic, beginning with Les Noces which always leaves me feeling slight. Then a pointless dinner at Marie Blanche's where I played my new Sicili√®nne at two pianos (with Robert V.-L.) and nobody said they liked it because Sauguet hates me on account of Jacques Dupont, and that is Paris society, more babyish and spiteful than in America.
