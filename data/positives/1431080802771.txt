I know you came from a musical family. Is that what got you involved with the piano?

Oh, yes. My mother was a pianist and a piano teacher. When I was born, she was practicing all the time, as she was with her first two sons. Howard [a composer] is four years older than I, and Harry [a music teacher] is eleven years older. She believed in prenatal influence, so she practiced through all her pregnancies. When we were born, we were all put near the piano to listen to her practicing. I heard Chopin, Liszt, Mozart, and Bach from infancy.
