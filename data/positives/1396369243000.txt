Practise in morning & afternoon (11.30-12.30 & 2.15-4.15) - Beethoven Sonata in G. (op.49?) L'st Movement & Schumman "Pappillons". Write up to 11.30. Go to Dinner with Barbara, arriving at her flat at 6.0. Listen to the Wireless - especially to a concert of contemporary music - Schonberg - Heaven only knows!! I enjoyed his Bach "St Anne"; & quite liked his "Peace on earth" for Chorus - but his "Erwartung" - ! I could not make head or tail of it - even less than the "Peace on earth". Back at 10.50
