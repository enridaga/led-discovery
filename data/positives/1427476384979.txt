It was a fortunate thing for me [...] to have to listen to the 'Turco in Italia,' with its light, shallow music, for I could give myself up to entire enjoyment in the excellent singing of a Camporese, an Ambrogetti, and feast my eyes, as I sat in the pit, on the brilliant company in the boxes. This galaxy of charming and beautiful women, with their elegant toilettes and jewels, and the house brilliantly illuminated, formed a splendid scene.
