Practice Pft afternoon, no Madrigals write letters bet. tea & early din. Go to Philharmonic concert. Ov. Schwanda amusing. Rubenstein in Brahms concerto no. 2. He is really superb. His playing & the heavenly music makes me feel absolutely hopeless. After that the Schubert 7th symphony, disappointing although it's vandal to say so; this symph annoys me with its ceaseless repetitions. Beautiful in parts but 1000 times too long. Orchestra not too good, but L Goossens adorable; the man's a marvel. Back at 10.55. Hendersons out to theatre.
