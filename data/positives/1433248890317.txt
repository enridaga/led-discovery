A month later the Windsor and Eton Madrigal Society gave a performance before the Queen in St. George's Hall, Windsor Castle. At this, Sir George's motet, " Hark ! those voices," was sung. It is written for two choirs, and when the distant one, which was concealed, commenced, it created not a little surprise and interest among the audience present. 
At the close of the concert, the Queen spoke most kindly to Sir George, and said how much she had enjoyed the evening. H.R.H. Princess Christian very kindly wrote to him afterwards, saying she was sure he would like to know how pleased the Queen was with the singing, how highly she approved the programme, and especially admired Sir George's own two compositions, " The Zetland Fishermen," and " Hark ! those voices."
