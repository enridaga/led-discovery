<pre>In February 1801, the popular play of "Deaf and Dumb," was brought out at Drury <br />Lane. Miss Decamp's, John Kemble's, and Wroughton's acting in this piece were, <br />in my opinion, beyond all praise. Mrs. Mountain sang a song, of my composing, <br />in it, charmingly the poetry by Mr. M. G. Lewis; it was very popular, and always <br />encored. This piece was originally translated by Holcroft, and afterwards <br />altered and adapted to the English stage by Kemble.
