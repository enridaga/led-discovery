<p>My most memorable event was the concert on 28th January 1998 given by the Israel Philharmonic orchestra to celebrate their both anniversary. The IPO is Israel's Cultural ambassador- it is a unique combination of harmonious sounds of individuals and has always been an eloquent voice for peace. The conductor was, the now famous, Antonio Pappaneo and Murray Pariek was the pianist in Mozart's concerto No.25 in C. The concert started with Beethoven's overture Egmont and ended with the 5th Symphony. The performance was stunning. This concert and the fact that it is here where you can hear all the great orchestras and soloists of the world has confirmed me as a regular visitor for ever.</p>
