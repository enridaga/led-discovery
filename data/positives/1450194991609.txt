<p>In April, 1848, an orchestra which held together six years came to this country, and became quite famous, the aforementioned Germania Musical Society. It numbered about thirty artists, Mr. Lenschow being the leader. They played much classic music, their &ldquo;crack piece&rdquo; being <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">the Midsummer Night's Dream</em> overture. The orchestra was made up of genuine, fine artists, among them Mr. William Schultze, who became the first violin of the Mendelssohn Quintette on the retirement of August Fries in 1859.</p>
