Thorne, writes thus of the simple and touching little service : " I was much struck, a year or two since, when hearing him accompany a service in an iron church at Ascot, by the appropriateness of his accompaniments to the hymns, and by a charm in his playing peculiarly his own. Each hymn had its own proper tempo and
expression."
