<p>Balakrishna played the electric sitar. Originally called Joe Green, I believe, he was a sad-eyed, quiet black man who dressed in long Nehru shirts and silk pants and basically noodled away on his Coral electric sitar to provide a harmonic backdrop for the band. I never heard him take a solo, but he effectively added color to an already colorful band.</p>
