At first, it appeared to me a comical business; but, at last, I was astonished to see, that in a civilized country they should allow such cruelty, as to make game of a poor unfortunate creature, whom I took for a lunatic; and, if Mr. Crump had not acquainted me with the contrary, I should have remained in the same idea. He told me the man was a methodist [...] I did not wait for the conclusion of his chapter, but departed from him, and took my station in the street, to listen to the Methodist preacher. But, as I happened to make my appearance when they were singing a hymn, I caused a discord in their tune, by giving a sudden turn in their inspiration. As soon as they observed me, they all crowded to the place where I was, and left their pastor, with his book in his hands, to conclude the duty by himself.</p>
