<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have admired the work of many conductors during my long career as a listener. Felix Weingartner, for instance, was a near idol of mine in my youth, and a Beethoven cycle I heard him direct in Berlin in 1900 was a very great event in my life. In later years, too, I attended his concerts at every opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
