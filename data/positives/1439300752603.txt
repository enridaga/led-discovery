<p style="text-align: justify;">I had now (1871) a great ambition to write an opera. I found a libretto entitled 'K&ouml;nig und K&ouml;hler' (King and Collier) and set to work upon it. In due time I submitted the score to the manager of the National Theatre, who ordered it to be tried at rehearsal. I confess it was very Wagnerian. I had heard 'Die Meistersinger,' and the new influence was very strong upon me. My music was horribly difficult. At the piano rehearsals the singers could make little of it; with the chorus it was still worse - infinitely more difficult, they said, than Wagner. Ultimately everybody laughed at me, and my opera was refused. Four years later I completely rewrote the score, more in the national style, and made it easy to sing and play. It was then produced with great success, and helped my reputation materially.</p>
