<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Concerning the contributions of my &lsquo;arch-disciple&rsquo; [Pierre Boulez], on the other hand, may I say that it would be strange indeed if we had <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">not </em>put words into, or helped to get them out of, each other&rsquo;s mouths; after all, we have been working together for twenty-three years. What he is guilty of, however, is having introduced me to almost all of the new music I have heard in the past two decades (Boulez&rsquo;s included, for which I am ill-disposed to forgive him, my extravagant advocacy of it at one time having brought me nothing but criticism); and not only to the new music but to the new everything else &ndash; which is why &lsquo;disciple&rsquo;, arch or ordinary, is hardly apt. The plain truth is that anyone who admires my <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Agon</em>, my <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Variations</em>, my <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Requiem Canticles</em>, owes some gratitude to the man who has sustained my creative life these last years. </span></p>
