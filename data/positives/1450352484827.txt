<p>The blues medley gave me the biggest kick during the show. It was launched by Clinton saying, in character, and paraphrasing Shakespeare:<br />'It's time for the blues at midnight'<br />The challenge was to stop the audience applauding before the medley was completed.<br />'Do that,' I said, 'and it'll generate such an emotional charge the audience will blow the roof off at the end.'<br />And most nights, at the end of the twenty-five minutes of classic songs, the audience did exactly that.</p>
