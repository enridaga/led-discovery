The following day, being Sunday, I visited the two cathedrals and most of the churches, which are not half filled, while the catholic chapels are crowded with devotees. In the choir of Christ Church [Dublin] I expected to find Sir John Stevenson and Doctor Spray, but both were gone into the country. I heard an anthem of Dr. Croft’s, by two contratenors and a bass, ‘Sing unto the Lord,' more than half an hour long, attentively listened to by the congregation. The organist, whose name I do not recollect, was an admirable performer, and played me a learned fugue at the conclusion of the service. This choir has the richest endowment of any in the Queen’s dominions.
