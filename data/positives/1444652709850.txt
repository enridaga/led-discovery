<p>1970's I was at a concert when Glen Campbel was the "star" but Ann Murray ( then unknown) was supporting and she went on to greater things after that. 1980's I went to a concert staring Tammy Wynnette. My companion, a TV presenter at the time, was reharsing at London Weekend Television, but managed to arrive in the interval before she began, which was a great relief to me. Both were marvellous concerts.</p>
