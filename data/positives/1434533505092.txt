Another memory which often comes back is the singing of the women of the neighboring village. There were a great many of them, and regularly every evening they sang in unison on their way home after the dayâ€™s work. To this day I clearly remember the tune, and the way they sang it, and how, when I used to sing it at home, imitating their manner I was complimented on the trueness of my ear. This praise made me very happy. / And it is an odd thing that this occurrence, trifling though it seems, has a special significance for me, because it marks the dawn of my consciousness of myself in the role of musician.
