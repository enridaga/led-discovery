<p>&hellip;I spent from 11.30 &ndash; 1.00 to-day queueing for tickets at the Cairo Opera House but all in vain &ndash; it shut at 1.00 when I was about 5 places from the front&hellip;</p>
<p>I went to the Symphony concert with my A.T.S friend on the 9th, it was very good: I&rsquo;m going to try to get a copy of the Bach Concerto in E &ndash; I like it very much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure whether I sent you the other programme before: the best parts of it were Cesar Franck and the Chausson &ndash; the rest of the stuff was a bit &ldquo;Picassoish&rdquo; in my opinion.&nbsp; The songs by Schiffer and Petry were completely atonal&nbsp; - no key at all: the two efforts by Dr. Hickman however were very very good in contrast to the others&hellip;</p>
