<p>I am sending you four tickets for my concert on the 7th, for both of you and the Souvtchinskys. You will see how well my&nbsp;<em>Chansons</em>&nbsp;<em>gaillardes</em> - already fifteen years old - have stood the test of time. / We are also doing&nbsp;<em>Histoires pour enfants&nbsp;</em>by Igor. It is slight but divine, and at least his name, for once, will appear on our programme.&nbsp;</p>
