<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">To a certain extent, I feel that the formula &lsquo;the end justifies the means&rsquo; is permissible in music. All means? Yes, if they convey the required meaning. As a rule, when I listen to music I do not think about how it is written&hellip; I do not analyse it, but rather perceive it emotionally. I normally think of analyzing music only if it appears cold and leaves no impression (to understand why this is so, what is the reason for its failure) or if it is so gripping that one would like to know how it is &lsquo;made&rsquo;. But even such an analysis contains more intuition than theory. </span></span></p>
