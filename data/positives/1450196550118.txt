Their venture was a fiasco. The orchestra numbered about twenty-five. They did not play so well as the Germania, consequently did not have the elements of a possible success. About the only souvenir I have of their visit is the hour I spent at the first rehearsal of the new waltz <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Traum des Oceans</em>&mdash;a fine waltz, probably Gungl&rsquo;s best, which was written while on his voyage to America. Gungl did not give many concerts in Boston, and I think that shortly after his visit he returned to Germany. It is my impression that he did not take many of his men back with him.</span></p>
