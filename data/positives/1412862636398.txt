    Of the operas that were performed in my early days two were especial favourites, “Rob Roy” and “The Colleen Bawn.” “Rob Roy” was a strange mixture of a piece. It was half Jacobite and half Burns, and very Glasgow in atmosphere.
    The story was turned and twisted so that songs that were particular favourites might be brought in. The working people of Glasgow loved it.
    Bailie Nicol Jarvie and Rob Roy were the leading figures, but all the best songs were for the tenor, who acted the part of Francis Osbaldiston. John Child, Durward Lely, J. M. Hamilton, and, above all, John Hedmont, were our pets.
