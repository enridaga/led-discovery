I have been helping these last two days to sell at a Belgian Lace Sale held at Mrs John Astor’s in Grosvenor Square. It was most interesting. Lady Winifred Elwes... is one of the patronesses of the Association of Lace Workers, and she asked me to help her.   
     ...We did very well, I think. We took in £150 yesterday, besides many orders for lingerie, and I don’t know what today’s record is. Gervase Elwes, Lady W’s husband, the great singer, sang most delightfully yesterday and was a great draw.
