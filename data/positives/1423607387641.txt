My wife and myself went to the Royal Festival Hall in the May of 1970, and saw the "Great" Francis Albert Sinatra, accompanied by (in our opinion) the greatest big band of all time Count Basie. The two greats went together like Jack Daniels and soda, when they done that great standard "I Get A Kick Out Of You" and others. We saw F/S at other venues over the years but found that the Festival Hall gave out was the best. We won't forget.
