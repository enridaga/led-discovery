Two days ago, Galina Vishnevskaya, David Oistrakh, Mstislav Rostropovich and I had our first rehearsal of my Blok settings. For a first time it was quite respectable. The rehearsal gave me much joy, and for a time I stopped experiencing acutely painful feelings about all kinds of acutely painful events.
