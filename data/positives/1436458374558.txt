<p>IT is a strange fact that M. Jean de Reszke first came out in London as a baritone. He sang, under my direction in 1874, at one of the New Philharmonic Concerts, the aria " Sei Vendicata," from Dinorah, and his first appearance at Covent Garden was in the opera Les Huguenots, in which he played the role of the Count de Nevers a baritone part. Signer Cotogni, who was in the same opera, helped him to dress and make up, and gave him some good advice about the part, little thinking that in after-years he would become the great tenor who would captivate all his hearers not only by his marvellous voice, but by his clever and most intelligent acting.</p>
