<p>It was in the year 1868 that I first became acquainted&nbsp;with Anton Rubinstein at the chambers of my friend&nbsp;Hofkapellmeister Joseph Hellmesberger, on the topmost&nbsp;floor of a cruelly lofty house in the Tuchlauben, nearly&nbsp;opposite the Conservatorium of those days...I was exceptionally lucky&nbsp;in hearing the gifted Moldavian play almost daily for&nbsp;several weeks in succession, in private as well as in public...Rubinstein's orchestral&nbsp;effects and variety of tone production on my favourite&nbsp;instrument, therefore, surprised no less than they&nbsp;delighted me. During his sojourn in Vienna he played&nbsp;&mdash; more particularly at the houses of his musical friends,&nbsp;where I most frequently met him &mdash; music of every period&nbsp;and description; a great deal of his own, more freely,&nbsp;but less carefully, than that of others... he excelled nearly every other pianist of&nbsp;the day.&nbsp;</p>
