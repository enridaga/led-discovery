<p>The Organ Concerto [<em>Choral Fantasia</em>] is IT all right, - there is only one place where I have any doubts - &amp; that is - I think - where the chorus first enters in harmony; [it] sounds a little bit respectable &amp; out of the picture - I shd like very much to talk about that place one day. The organ part is magnificent. . . .</p>
