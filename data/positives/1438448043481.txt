<p class="MsoNormal">During our Wagner chats she would often ask me about Bayreuth, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and I begged her to seize the first opportunity of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>attending the festival. She did not do so, however, until after her marriage with Baron Cederstrom, who is extremely fond of traveling, and, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>beside taking his wife to Sweden every summer, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>introduces her to many interesting European resorts. The following letter tells its own tale: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

I never could have imagined anything so perfect <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>as the mise en scene, and I thought the "Ring" simply <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>divine. There are no words to express it; it is all so <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>wonderful and beautiful. I thought "Parsifal" was <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>glorious, especially the last act, and I am indeed glad to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>have heard all these marvelous works.</span></p>
