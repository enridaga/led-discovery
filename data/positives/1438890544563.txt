<pre>It was at the suggestion of Malibran that [Sir Julius] Benedict left Paris and <br />went to England in 1835. He quickly made his mark as an operatic composer, and <br />successfully competed with Michael Balfe and Vincent Wallace in the race for <br />fame. Like them, he wrote and produced many operas; like them, he left only one <br />that really promises to survive. Indeed, Benedict's "Lily of Killarney" is the <br />sole English opera of the so-called "ballad" type that still shares popularity <br />with "The Bohemian Girl" and "Maritana." Although such a mediocre conductor, he <br />was an admirable accompanist. He had studied under Hummel at Weimar before going <br />to Weber, and was a quite capable pianist. His reputation in this capacity was <br />not a little enhanced by his association with Jenny Lind on her memorable tour <br />in the United States (1850-52). At any rate, after his return to London his <br />services "at the piano" were in request at every kind of musical function, and <br />he was practically the sole accompanist employed at the Monday Popular Concerts 
during the first twenty years of their existence. </pre>
