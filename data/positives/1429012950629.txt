Beecham was invited to lend lustre to one of these Galas by conducting a performance of "Tamara" by Balakireff [sic]. It was a favourite piece of his in the concert hall but natural the dancers needed it to be taken at a fairly moderate tempo.

As they took their bows, gasping and streaming with sweat, their regular conductor, Effrem Kurz, could be seen peering down, ashen-faced, from a box while Tommy murmured to us with a happy smile: " That made the buggers hop!" I went down in the lift at Covent Garden station afterwards with Effrem Kurz who had still not recovered and kept staring and muttering: "It was terrible, terrible!"
