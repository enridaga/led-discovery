[A]t Hiller's house, where we usually met, I became acquainted with the Scotch symphony, then unpublished, of which he had just finished the admirable arrangement as a pianoforte duet, which we played over and over again from the manuscript. There I heard also for the first time his ' Variations Serieuses,' and some of the then unpublished ' Lieder ohne Worte,' amongst them the now so popular ' Fruhlingslied.'
