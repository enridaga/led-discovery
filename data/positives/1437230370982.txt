<pre>The composer and eminent teacher, Signer Ferrari, who resided many years in <br />London, was in Paris at this period, and visited his old master Paesiello daily. <br />I requested him to introduce me into Paesiello's apartments without mentioning <br />my name, and accordingly was ushered up stairs ; and when I came to the <br />drawing-room door, where Paesiello and Signora Luigia his wife were, I sang on <br />the outside, the favourite song which he had composed for me at Vienna ; and <br />although fifteen years had elapsed since he wrote it, he recollected the tone of <br />my voice, opened the door, and embraced me, saying, "Bene venuto, mio caro <br />O'Kelly." I stopped with him and dined, and passed a charming day.
