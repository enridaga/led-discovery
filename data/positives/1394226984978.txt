An officer of the name of Rose now joining the 25th, who was a very pretty fiddle player, on the 1st. of June Mr Shaw sent soon in the morning to know if I was inclined to join in a musical party at his house that evening, which having acceeded to, he afterwards sent to invite the rest of us & desire me to call in & assist at a little rehearsal in the morning, which I did, when I found Mr Rose far to excell me in taste & neatness of execution as to modern music, but as to that of the old school he seem'd to know little about it. As therefore we co'd not think of leaving out Corelli, it was settled that I sho'd lead in that & he in what modern music we played; besides w'ch he play'd a concerto of Madam Syrmen's in a very good style. At this concert the Lennoxs & all the officers were present amongst whom my friend Lord Bellenden chose to make himself conspicuous by taking a fiddle, tho' by no means wish'd so to do, as it added nothing to the harmony of the concert, he being a vile scraper tho' he had been a pupil of my old masters little Wafer.
