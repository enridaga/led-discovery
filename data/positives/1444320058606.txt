<p>My first visit here was on November 11th 1966 to hear Mahler Symphony No.2 'Resurrection' with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. I've always felt its very special atmosphere. I love this hall so very much and wish it every success for the future. Looking forward to the re-opening next year 2007.</p>
