22 January: Anchored off Port Said at 7.00am... [The] Battalion disembarks at 1.00 am and pitch camp on a desert patch near the docks and close to [an] Arab town. No NCO or man was allowed to leave camp until orders were given to that effect; nevertheless thirty men succeeded in evading picquets and police and got drunk in quick time on spirits... Of course it is very hard to restrain men who have been cooped up in a hell like Gallipoli for months.
     The Band of the 11th Battalion East Lancs played selections from 6.00 until 7.00 pm in the evening (I believe it was the 11th Battalion).
