By Jay C, but if you were here I’d play you a record of Wild Bill Davison’s Tishomingo Blues I’ve sneaked from the College Jazz Library!   Tremendously slow, powerful, summery: two chorused only, with Davison not wasting a note & taking a fearful split-toned break that sounds like Russell on a cornet.  Then we could put some beer into us, tho’ I’m not in great beer-drinking form these days.
