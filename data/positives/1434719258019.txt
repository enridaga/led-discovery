<p>Another of the thrills in my life was when Louis [Armstrong] asked (or allowed me, I should say) to sit in and play "Big Butter and Egg Man". Well, just no one in the world can play it like Louis, and no one in the world can improve on the way he plays it, so I'm frank to say that as nearly as possible (because I heard him play it so much and listened so intently) I've always tried to do those famous breaks as Louis did them.</p>
