Practise here, 11.0–1.0, & in N.S. of M. 3.0–4.0. Go to College [illegible] after lunch to see Lauricella. Go to Prom. in evening with Floud’s sister (he cannot come). Beethoven 3. Leonoras – (I think I prefer 2. it is so dramatic), An de Ferne Geliebte, beautifully sung by Steuart Wilson as we[re] 3 Kodaly Songs in second ½ of programme. 5th Symphony (of which I am not v. fond – rather weary). Respighi’s Fountains of Rome – brilliant but not very deep. Orchestral playing – still moderate, with most astonishing slips!
