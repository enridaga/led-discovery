<p>[Asked about melodic ear-training, Wilson replied]</p>
<p>I depended a great deal on two pianos. We'd take turns accompanying each other. I'd play accompaniment and the student would play strictly melody. I got wonderful results with this method. I'd also play recordings of Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, [saxophonist] Coleman Hawkins&mdash;all one-line players&mdash;and the student would start by imitation.</p>
