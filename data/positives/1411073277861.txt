While at Belgrave Charles Pochin, Esq., of Barkby, complimented her [Madame Catalani] by giving a grand banquet, to which the first families of the county were invited to meet her. At supper she was placed at the head of a large horse-shoe table, so that every one could see her; and as she sat gave us a song, calling upon me to join her in the droll effusion of Malbroke, but I declared my inability. However, she began it with her husband, Valibrique. Not recollecting the words, he stopped at the third verse, and Sir Gerard Noel struck into the tune, and accompanied her through the remaining verses, ten or twelve, to the end. This produced great merriment, and exhibited her comic powers.
