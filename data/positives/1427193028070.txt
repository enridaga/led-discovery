For some months I hardly ever left my rooms, and only when I received invitations to houses where I knew I should meet, and perhaps hear, Chopin. There were not many of them in Paris, for Chopin, impelled by growing weakness, began even then to lead a very retired life. He used still to visit principally Count de Perthuis, the banker August Leo, Mallet, and a few other houses. Fortunately for me I had been introduced by letters to the above three gentlemen, and enjoyed the privilege of being invited to their ' reunions intimes,' when Chopin, who avoided large parties, was to be present. With greater familiarity my admiration increased, for I learned to appreciate what before had principally dazzled me.
