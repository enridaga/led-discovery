Everything goes off well, the President comes to the second concert [with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Redentor Romero in Manila] and afterwards there is an important reception organized by a group of musicians who have a compatible band. I play a couple of tunes with them, but there is a piano player present, a young boy, who is so good that I am not at all particular about following him! However, his mother--an outstanding singer and a charming lady--insists that I do.
