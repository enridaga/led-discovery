Now he [Eugen D’Albert] was coming to Warsaw to play the Emperor Concerto. When I saw a tiny, mustached old man walking toward the piano, I could not believe it was D’Albert. He was very small indeed, but what a titan as an artist! We spent an evening together. Elly [Kochanski] suggested that I play one of the Mendelssohn sonatas with him. D’Albert played extraordinarily loudly, yet he must have heard the cello – he said so, and wanted to play more.
