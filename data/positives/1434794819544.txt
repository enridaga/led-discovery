On the death of Sir Charles Hudson, Mr. Heyrick, a gentleman of family and considerable taste in music, who had married Mr. Greatorex's youngest sister, continued to entertain the London party once a-year, and afforded a great treat to his musical friends. I remember a rich evening we had when the two Misses Harrison were there. In the principal room where the company sat some sounds were heard of an organ and melodious voices streaming from a distant apartment. When Bartleman started up, and in an under tone of voice, singing in his impressive way, began with the words, 'Methinks I hear the full celestial choir;' then, stopping to listen, the company, amazed, stretched their ears, and drank in the pleasing sound. On his coming to the words 'Now chanting clear,' the distant door was opened, and the magic swelling of the sounds enraptured the audience.
