<p>Listen to Berlin Phil. orch. from Queen's Hall after dinner. Bach D maj. Suite; Schumann's 4th, &amp; Beethoven's 7th Symphonys. Superb orchestra - enormously energetic; &amp; extraordiarily well disciplined. I didn't like everything that Furtw&auml;ngler did. But most of the Schuman was magnificent.&nbsp;</p>
