<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock on the following morning I repaired to the church of S. Nicholas, where I found, as usual, the organist, Dr. Papperitz, true to his appointment. The instrument in this church is one of the largest and most varied in its character of the notable modern organs of Germany, and has four manuals and ninety registers. The organist kindly showed me its varieties of tone in a short improvisation, and afterwards, at the particular request of Dr. Papperitz and the musical persons present, I had the pleasure of playing for nearly an hour, and making my hearers further acquainted with English music, of which their knowledge seemed to be rather limited. Notwithstanding the great size of this instrument, I found its arrangement so good that manipulation was comparatively easy.</p>
