Dearest Lenny
Yesterday I had the enormous pleasure of hearing you conduct at Tanglewood.  You were simply wonderful.  I felt so proud of you.  I made a darting trip up to “welcome” you back along with the enthusiastic thousands to whom you bring inspiration and joy and so much of your innermost being.  Unfortunately I had to rush back and didn’t have the opportunity to rush back stage, see those eyes wide open very wide with delight and give you a great hug.  I do so now.
You were simply magnificent.  The Haydn Mass in Bb was so joyous I was ready to embrace the church, something I am sue would horrify you.  I heard the chorus rehearsing as I came on the grounds, only one half hour before the performance!  I thought: just like Lenny.
I was a little apprehensive about the Shostakovich on such a steaming afternoon.  You made it absolutely riveting, with all its prolix fascination and strangeness as well as introspective qualities.  I was as thrilled as the audience and found a joyous  release in joining the ovation.
