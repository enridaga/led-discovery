A nice autumn. Even prettier as seen from Poulenc's apartment overlooking the Luxembourg at the fall of a clear day. I spent the late afternoon there yesterday with Henri Hell in order to hear the maître sing us the first three and a half tableaux of his opera... Then Francis played us what's written of the Carmélites and I was disappointed. Usually I love his music and feel he's the only one here who has not tumbled into that touchy masterpiece-complex trap. Yet this whole Carmelite idea seems so Catholic and wearisome that I just can't be moved. I didn't know what to say...
