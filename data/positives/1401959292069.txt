Get up early & go to St. Matthews with Mummy at 8.0. Spend all morning (11.0–1.0) & afternoon (2.30–4.45) with lunch back here – at Bach Choir, St. Matthew Passion, cond. A. Boult, with D. Silk, M. Balfour, S. Wilson, H. Eisdle, K. Falkner & A Cranmer. A very good performance on the whole, & very moving. Keith Falkner & St. Wilson were great & Dorothy Silk also. Choir quite good – oh, it’s a great work! Tea with Barbara; back here for supper. Write to Pop afterwards. Early bed, by 10.0
