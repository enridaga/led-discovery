<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I was pleased by the performance of my First Piano Concerto. The orchestra, conductor, and solo trumpeter showed much skill and talent, and I am sincerely grateful to them. But perhaps I would have preferred to hear one of my other compositions at such an important and interesting festival, rather than my First Piano Concerto, which I do not count as one of my best works. I would not say that I am completely dissatisfied with the work, but still it might have been pleasanter to have heard something else on the opening day of the festival. </span></p>
