Walk with Mum before Lunch Go to John Nicholson’s to tea at 2.45. & to hear Gramophone records on his new Radio-Gram Hear. Brahms. Pft. Concerto Mov. 1. (Rubenstein) Tchaik. Pft. Con. (Solomon). Hear my prayer (E. Lough – beautifully sung) & Schubert Bb Trio (v. well played by D’Aranyi, Salmond, & Hess). Play Pingpong also after tea. I am reading Drinkwater’s Abraham Lincoln; marvellous play.
