You ask me how the revival of Katerina Izmailova went. My answer is: extremely badly. So badly, in fact, that I suffered heart pains during the performance. It is obvious that nobody currently in the Stanislavsky- Nemirovich- Danchenko Theatre pays the slightest attention to the letter of the musical score. The singers were as shamelessly inaccurate as they were when Provatorov was on the podium. The conductor now is Kitayenko, a Karajan Competition prizewinner. / To the shamelessly sloppy singing he added equally shameless, obscenely sloppy orchestral playing. The whole thing was an unprecedented insult to Katerina Izmailova.
