Nat [Cole] had a trio on The Street [52nd St., New York] in the early 'forties, and other trios began to follow. 

The Stuff Smith Trio at the Onyx Club in 1944 was one of the greatest trios I ever heard. He had Jimmy Jones on piano; John Levy on bass. Just three guys and no drums! It was one of the most rhythmic trios I ever heard. Their only records were made for Asch, but they didn't show what the trio could do. They had worked up some things for the session, but then Stuff goofed and played some other things instead, as he was likely to do.
