<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My friend and I particularly liked to attend concerts conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, both for the performances musically and vocally. He always addressed the audience before a concert. On one occasion he waddled on, rather like a penguin, and addressed us: "The BBC has&nbsp; invited me to conducted this concert. The BBC has selected the programme; so if you have any comments or complaints, please send them to the BBC, not me". We roared with laughter&nbsp; and applauded, in happy, convivial, intimate mood to enjoy the music that followed.</p>
