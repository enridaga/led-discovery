<p>No more&nbsp;startling, and at the same time ludicrous, examples of&nbsp;stage "business " had hitherto met my gaze than when&nbsp;I saw Faust, upon Mephistopheles claiming the fulfilment&nbsp;of his bond, snatch up a promiscuous Bible (for the presence of which upon his library table there is certainly&nbsp;no warrant in Goethe's tragedy) and hold it up menacingly before the very nose of the terror-stricken fiend,&nbsp;who cowers, shrinks, and shivers, subjugated by its uncalled-for interference, and ultimately vanishes through&nbsp;a practicable panel of the laboratory "set," driven from&nbsp;his legitimate prey by a shower of rose-leaves, rained&nbsp;upon the expiring voluptuary by seraph hands in the flies. This amazing anti-climax,&nbsp;however, was, not&nbsp;greeted by the audience with shouts of derisive laughter,&nbsp;according to its intrinsic merit, but with vociferous&nbsp;plaudits, reiterated recalls of the leading actors, and a&nbsp;thundering summons to the composer, who came on&nbsp;between the Devil and Faust whilst the celestial petals&nbsp;were still falling ! It should be remembered that this&nbsp;performance took place in one of our two great opera-houses.</p>
