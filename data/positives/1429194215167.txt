Also before I went on tour, Jack Goldberg, a white agent, had been coming around to Edmond's. He must have recognized in my singing whatever it is that the world since has called artistry. Mr. Goldberg wanted me to sign a contract with him. He said he'd guarantee me seventy-five dollars a week for the first six months, with big boosts coming so fast that by the end of two years I'd be making five hundred dollars a week. He wanted to put me on the white time and drove me all over town to show me the wonderful-looking Keith theaters I'd play in under his careful management.
