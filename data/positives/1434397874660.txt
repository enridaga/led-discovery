Go to B.B.C. concert Queen's Hall (area). Beethoven's miserable King Stephan ov. miserably played under Boult. Brahms Vln conc. (Busch - marvellous technically but as hard as nails with little feeling for music). Ireland's magnificent Mai-Dun - quite well played for the B.B.C. orch. Max's new Winter Legend's (Harriet Cohen) longwinded rambling boring stuff - so feeble and dull after the Ireland.* Orchestra bad all evening; Boult worse. Come back via Bridges at 11.15.
