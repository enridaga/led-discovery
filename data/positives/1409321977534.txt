    At the Pavilion I had the perfect pleasure of hearing Layton and Johnstone perform. Everyone knew of them, because they were so often on the wireless but seeing them putting over their very individual songs was something approaching ecstasy. In case any of my readers don’t know, Tumer Layton and Clarence John¬stone were a coloured couple and they sang with dark chocolate voices.
