<p class="MsoNormal">And it was one of the most exciting things I ever did to play music and go through another band that was playing. The main band was lined up on both sides and we had to go between them and keep playing. I remember the first time it happened. My snare drum was a four-inch drum, and this fellow has a six-inch snare drum. When we got going through I couldn't hear my drumming any more so I didn't know what I was doing. And I picked up with the other drummer who was playing six-eight in contrast to the two-four time we had been playing. I should have displaced the other fellow&rsquo;s drumming with concentrating on what I was doing, but that time I heard the other guy&rsquo;s part and not my own, and of course we were playing altogether different numbers. But it's those experiences which make you know what music is, and it's the hard way of learning.</p>
