My last memory of playing with the Wigmore before it disbanded in about 1963 is of a concert one Sunday afternoon at Dartington Hall, in the West Country. It was a stormy day, with floods on the way down which made progress slow. At 2.20 p.m. there wasn't a player in sight. Between then and 2.25, no less than six cars arrived full of players. At 2.30 the concert started as if it had been rehearsed for weeks. It hadn't - not for weeks, and weeks. At 3.30 it was announced that the eastern exit to Dartington was flooded, but that the western was expected to hold out for a bit. Therefore there was a report handed in after each movement. At 4.30 the concert was successfully over, and at 4.35 the last of the six cars was safely outside the gates and on the way to London. It was a tight fit, but at at [sic] any rate it worked.
