So I have at last played in Vienna, and may say that I have every reason to be pleased. I played Beethoven's Concerto in E flat and three pieces by Chopin, and after each performance I was recalled five times to the platform. People are very complimentary, and if we were not so near Easter I might certainly play again; as it is, I may be sure to be welcomed another time...Here the calls do not mean an 
'encore,' they are merely complimentary.
