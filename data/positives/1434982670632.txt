<p>Bix Beiderbecke, bless his soul, was crazy about the modern composers--Schoenberg, Stravinsky, and Ravel--but he had no time for the classics. One night I took him to the opera. It happened to be SIEGFRIED. When he heard the bird calls in the third act, with those intervals that are modern today, when he began to realise the leitmotifs of the opera were dressed, undressed, disguised, broken down, and built again in every conceivable fashion, he decided that old man Wagner wasn't so corny after all and that swing musicians didn't know such a helluva lot.</p>
