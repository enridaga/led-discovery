<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">18 October 1959:&nbsp; concert performance of "Don Giovanni" conducted by Colin Davis with Sutherland, Schwarzkopf, Wachter, Alva, etc.&nbsp; As a 14 year old on pocket money I had bought the cheapest seat available, in the Choir, behind the orchestra and soloists.&nbsp; On entering the auditorium (not actually my first visit, but it was an early one) the usher looked at my ticket and said apologetically: "There's been a mix up - please would you accept this one instead?"&nbsp; When I looked I had been given a top price stalls seat.&nbsp; I was so pleased someone had forgotten that the chorus needed a place to sit too!&nbsp; And the concert was fabulous.</p>
