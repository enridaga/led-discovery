Today is Dominion Day for the Canadians - which probably accounts for the band and cheering I heard a short while ago at 6 a.m. Yesterday a procession of sisters, officers and men, headed by their band, marched to all the cemeteries where Canadians are resting, where they held a short service and sounded the Last Post. The sisters marched well and looked rather pretty in the distance - quite a long line of them four deep, all in their bright blue dresses and white caps.
