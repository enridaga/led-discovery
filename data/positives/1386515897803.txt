I attended that ceremony [a parade of the King's Guards] one morning, and was greatly pleased…by the performance of the band, who, amongst other pieces, played one in which each instrument had an obligato [sic] variation. I was not however equally gratified with the new mode of dismissing the men by double-quick time, which, while it in some measure resembled the breaking-off of a boys’ school, ill accorded with the dignity of the army.
