<p>That fall I again worked for Edmond. Adelaide Hall, who was then rehearsing for Shuffle Along, came to see us almost nightly. She would do a number on the floor. Adelaide had a lovely, soft voice, and after singing a sentimental song she'd go into a flatfoot-time buck with much beating and stomping. Also in the show was Chippie Hill, who was so recently "discovered" by a lot of Johnny-Come-Lately Columbuses. Poor Chippie was killed in a car accident only a few days before I wrote these words. Her acclamation, unfortunately, came too late to do her much good.</p>
