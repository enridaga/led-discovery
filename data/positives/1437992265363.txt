Every thought of the stage had vanished nothing was further from my own thoughts than play-acting. I was sitting as I should sit at an oratorio, in devout and rapt contemplation. Before my eyes had passed a symbolic vision of prayer and ecstasy, flooding the soul with overpowering thoughts of the Divine sacrifice and the mystery of unfathomable love.</span></p>
