<p>Richter always conducted on Wagner nights, and it was in Vienna that, with the exception of <em>Lohengrin</em> and <em>Tannha&uuml;ser</em>, I heard most of his great operas. That is one of the things in my musical life for which I have always been truly grateful. I remember, as though it were but yesterday, the tremendous impression made on me by the performance of <em>Tristan and Isolde</em>. What affected me most of all that first time, was the beautiful music in the second Act where Brang&auml;ne keeps watch for the two lovers. It is extraordinarily, almost magically, suggestive. The voice of the faithful friend outside reaches the man and woman&mdash;who, in an ecstasy of love, are clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms - through a wonderful haze of sound that like nothing else I have ever heard suggests not only ineffable, undying love, not only its surroundings during those immemorial hours - the touching beauty of the lovely summer night, the dark-blue, star-strewn sky, the haunting perfume of sweet flowers - but a growing apprehension, a stealthy approach of danger &ndash;</p>

Richter was a magician when he conducted Wagner&rsquo;s operas.</p>
