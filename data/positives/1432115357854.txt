Eight months later I had the gratification of introducing that Path√©tique (No. 6); its immediate success leading to a repetition by special desire at the next concert (February 28 and March 14, 1894). Whether the composer's intentions were faithfully reproduced or not, the effect was sufficiently striking to secure an exceptional success.
