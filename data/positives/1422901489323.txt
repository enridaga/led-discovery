I get W. Walton’s Viola Concerto from O.U.P. It’s a fine work but difficult. Walk with Beth before lunch. Go with Beth & 4 Chartres (– Gordon) to “Hell’s Angels” at Marina in aft. Marvellous photography spoilt by Slop. Stuff. Listen on a hired wireless to Brahms prom. Rhapsody – wonderful work, spoilt completely by atmospherics, as was rest of concert. D’ble Concerto, Arthur Catteral, good, L. Kennedy wonderful – tone comparable to Casals. Magnificent 4th Symph to wind up with.
