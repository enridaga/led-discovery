<p><em>[Letter from George Sand to Carlotta Marliani]</em></p>
<p>They gave Nourrit a very scanty funeral service here since the bishop made a fuss [on account of Nourrit's suicide]. I don't know whether the choristers did it on purpose, but I have never heard such out-of-tune singing. Chopin sacrificed himself by playing the organ at the Elevation-- and what an organ ! Anyhow our boy made the best of it by using the less discordant stops, and he played Schubert's <em>Die Sterne</em>, not with the passionate and glowing tone that Nourrit used, but with a plaintive sound as soft as an echo from another world. Two or three at most among those present felt its meaning and had tears in their eyes-- the rest of the congregation, which had come in crowds and had pushed curiosity to the point of paying 50 centimes for their seats (an unheard- of price at Marseilles), were very disappointed, for they expected Chopin to kick up a devil of a row and to break at least two or three stops.</p>
