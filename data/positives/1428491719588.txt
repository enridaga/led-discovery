What are all concerts compared with that given by that charlatan Bochsa, the harp-player? I have heard only one short sample of it, but copy out for myself the programme, although even this in itself is a gigantic work. Indeed, the incredible length of the concert deserves to be marked and catalogued as a curiosity.
