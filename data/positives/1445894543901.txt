<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&ldquo;Mum said you wanted to hear me sing.&nbsp; Well, if you&rsquo;ll give up being cross, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she did.&nbsp; Putting the keyboard cover round her shoulders, as a stole, she sang a sentimental ballad named &lsquo;Because&rsquo;.&nbsp; The voices in the kitchen died away, except my father&rsquo;s, but even his was reduced to a whisper, his flow of reminiscence being punctuated by a &ldquo;Bravo, Maudie&rdquo; here and there, to prove that he was listening, in spite of being the victim of his own volubility.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I still sat at the tea-table, leaning over the debris of the Cornish pasty, my head in my hands.&nbsp; The girl&rsquo;s voice was a gift from God; a pure mezzo-soprano, pouring out from a full throat and strong lungs, without a trace of <em>vibrato</em> (that symptom of the mal-trained and usually ruined English singer).&nbsp; With a complicated irony, I accepted the banal words, &ldquo;Because you sing to me, in accents sweet,&rdquo; bowing my head to let them pass.&nbsp; The thrush-throb of that voice, reduced almost to demi-voce in the tiny, over-furnished room, conquered me instantly. &ldquo;Sing something else,&rdquo; I pleaded.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She half-turned, studying me with a new interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you like that song?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I liked the way you sang it.&nbsp; I agree with Hubert Parry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Huh!&nbsp; My word!&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t we high and mighty!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she was flattered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next song was by Sterndale Bennett, a lyric in the manner of Mendelssohn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, refresh my aching eyelids with thy cooling drops of dew&rdquo; it began, and I took the words to myself, as an intoxicant.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Maudie.&nbsp; But by this time I was incapable of response.&nbsp; The hypnosis was absolute.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not asleep, are you?&rdquo; she teased.&nbsp; And with that, after I had roused myself sufficiently to shake my head, she began to sing Dvor&agrave;k&rsquo;s &ldquo;Songs my Mother Taught me.&rdquo;</p>
