<p>Soon after my memorable visit to Elgar&rsquo;s birthplace, I listened to a most beautiful performance of his violin concerto. The soloist was Alfredo Campoli with the B.B.C. Scottish Orchestra conducted by James Loughran. Among the numerous times I have heard this wonderful work, so full of lyrical moments that stir one to the depths, this performance of Campoli&rsquo;s was certainly the best I have ever heard.</p>
