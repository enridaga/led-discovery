... I have performed a lot of chamber music in recent times in company with that superb oboist Leon Goossens, and it was a particular facet in the playing of this great artist twelve years ago that gave me to serious thought. I may add that I have his permission to transfer this thought, as it were, to our own instrument.

... He was broadcasting the Concerto by Gordon Jacob, and it was the intensity of sound when playing piano that made me realize that I had never heard the same relative sound from a clarinet, and I dismissed it as an oboe characteristic.

I now realize, without any intention of implying that I am the one and only serious performer ever to produce the sound, that this valuable contribution led me to a new understanding of breath control in terms of the diaphragm, and the government of breath weight from diaphragmatic pressure.
