At the end of two months, when it was time for summer vacation, I’d recovered sufficiently to go and address the orchestra. I thanked them for the faith they had shown in me and told them I looked forward to working with them in the fall. Now, I knew, they understood I was serious./ That fall we began rehearsing in earnest. Those musicians who were inexperienced in orchestral playing had much to learn; and those with some experience had- because of bad habits to overcome – perhaps to learn even more! The only solution was work.
