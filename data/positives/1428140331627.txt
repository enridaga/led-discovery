But to return to myself. It is really curious to observe upon what trifling circumstances the greatest and most important events of our lives depend. I was walking one evening, with my friend Blake, through the Strada di Toledo ; and when passing some billiard-rooms, he recollected that he was likely to find a person in them whom he wished to see. We went up stairs, and in the room 
found the famous soprano singer, Signer Giuseppe Aprile, who was allowed to be the greatest singer and musician of the day. He was called by the Italians, and indeed every where, " II padre di tutti i cantanti," the father of all singers. Blake introduced me to him, and he very kindly invited us to take chocolate with him the next morning. When we went, he received us with great cordiality, 
and after hearing me sing, said, " This boy has both taste and expression, and I think so well of his abilities, that if his friends approve of it, I will take him with me to Palermo, and instruct him without any remuneration ; indeed, I have no 
doubt but that in a short time I can make him capable of earning his bread any where."
