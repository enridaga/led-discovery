Last night there was great dissipation in the shape of a grand 'do' at the Officers' Mess, a celebration of the hospital's anniversary.... We were received cordially by the Colonel and staff and the party soon broke up, some to play bridge in one of fine large rooms, while others went off to play roulette and gamble with nothing more serious than counters. Another little party kept round the piano and discussed music at intervals. C[hristie] sang and Sister Wellstead played.... At about 11.30 Matron made a move to go and after one or two more songs and then 'God Save the King', we all got our wraps again and set forth...on our journey home, having had quite a lively evening.
