<p>In the afternoon we attended church at St Martin&rsquo;s-in-the- fields; but as this communication is already sufficiently long, we will only speak of the organ-playing. It was in legitimate style, and formed a striking contrast to the Foundling Hospital organ.

Truly the organ is a noble instrument, but it may be awfully degraded and sadly abused!</p>
