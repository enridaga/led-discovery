I had the honour of directing the music at the lying in state of King Edward in Westminster Hall, taking the Abbey Choir and having a military band to supply
the accompaniments. The deep solemnity, the simple majesty of the scene form an arresting picture that I can readily summon again ; and standing there, as I stood eight years ago, comes anew the refrain of the lamentation of the Preacher, in mournful cadence, "because man goeth to his long home." Sir Arthur Bigge, by command of King George, sent me the following letter in appreciation of the music performed on that memorable occasion :

Marlborough House,
Pall Mall, S.W.,
June 2nd, 1910.

DEAR SIR FREDERICK, 
The King commands me to express to you his entire satisfaction with the
arrangements made by you for the musical portion of the service in Westminster Hall on May 17th. His Majesty thought that the choir sang beautifully, and that the combination with the band in the last hymn
was most striking and impressive. His Majesty sincerely thanks you and all who
worked with you in achieving what was in every way worthy of the great and solemn occasion.
Yours very truly,
ARTHUR BIGGE.
