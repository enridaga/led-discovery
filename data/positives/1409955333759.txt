No twentieth-century musician could help but appreciate one of the great accompanists of our time, the Englishman Gerald Moore. Moore – now regrettably retired – used always to surprise me: given the size and width of his fingers, the extraordinary delicacy of his playing could not be foreseen; judging from his appearance as he sat at the piano, one felt it would be heavy and solid, but I doubt whether a more sensitive accompanist has ever existed.
