I have found a bass soloist for the Fourteenth Symphony: a singer on Moscow radio by name Yevgeny Vladimirov. The voice is strong and beautiful, and the only problem is his physical appearance. He is small, weedy, and somewhat unprepossessing. But he is musical, and he is studying his part with enthusiasm.
