<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was lucky enough to go to several of the Robert Mayer Saturday morning concerts for children in the late 50s. At first I went with a group from school, always with great anticipation and much excitement. When I became old enough, I was allowed to go to one of those concerts by myself, travelling solo to London for the first time. The concerts were designed especially to introduce young people to classical music - and the live performance thereof - and I left the beautiful concert hall even more excited than when I went in! There was a large selection of music played but I remember especially Benjamin Britten's "Child's Guide to the Orchestra". Inspired, I later went on to play the French horn, and even later to sing with a choir in the Hall itself. My memories of music at the Festival Hall continue to this day. I'm so glad the Festival Hall is being regenerated and celebrated.</p>
