At my concert in 1886, given at my residence 
in Harley Street, Isidore de Lara, who was 
then the rage, sang one of his own popular 
compositions. He was the first singer to make 
a special feature of sitting down to the piano 
and accompanying himself at concerts. He used 
to gaze round the room when singing, and wear 
a very intense expression, which charmed his 
fair hearers.
