<p>The other day I happened to hum the theme&nbsp;of the Andante from his Quartet in C Minor.&nbsp;He seemed rather to like my doing so, for when&nbsp;it came to the place...he accompanied my humming with gentle&nbsp;movements of his hand, as if beating time to&nbsp;it. At last he smilingly said : "I am not at&nbsp;all ashamed to own that it gives me the keenest&nbsp;pleasure if a song, an adagio, or anything of mine, has turned out particularly good. How&nbsp;must those gods : Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,&nbsp;have felt, whose daily bread it was to write&nbsp;things like the <em>St. Matthew Passion</em>, <em>Don&nbsp;Giovanni</em>, <em>Fidelio</em>, <em>Ninth Symphony</em>! What I&nbsp;cannot understand is how people like myself&nbsp;can be vain. As much as we men, who walk&nbsp;upright, are above the creeping things of the&nbsp;earth, so these gods are above us. If it were&nbsp;not so ludicrous it would be loathsome to me&nbsp;to hear colleagues of mine praise me to my face&nbsp;in such an exaggerated manner."</p>
