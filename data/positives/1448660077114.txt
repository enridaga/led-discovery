<p>At the close of the performance the crowd gradually dispersed, moving slowly back into the town, which was now splendidly illuminated. The singing societies again formed in order, and each person bearing upon a rod six or eight feet in length a colored light, the whole moved through the principal streets, in grand torch-light procession, brilliant and dazzling. This being ended, the singers retired to a large hall, where things good to the palate and quickening to the spirits had been bountifully provided, and which were (even in Germany) summarily disposed of. Toasts and speeches followed, which we cannot record here; except that we will merely mention that Herr Capellmeister G. Reichardt of Berlin, in reply to one of the toasts, gave a brief history of the origin and progress of the men-singing festivals in Germany. He said they were commenced in Berlin in 1809, when the great Zelter first called them into life. After he had finished his remarks, the whole company sang one of Reichardt&rsquo;s patriotic songs. The evening&rsquo;s entertainment was continued until it was no longer evening; and not until the light of day had arisen upon these sons of song, did they disperse to seek for a few moments&rsquo; rest before the duties of the day, already began, should call them again to contend for the prize.</p>
