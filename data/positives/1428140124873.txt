The Five Spot café was in a non-descript railroad flat down in the Bowery [New York, 1958]. It was the home of avant garde jazz… It was dark  and steamy, a typical jazz club of the era…

Lester Young had been the central and driving force of the Count Basie saxophone section for many years… [He] made himself readily available to me… to photograph him…

Lester may or may not have had a love affair with the great blues singer Billie Holiday but for certain they were soul mates. There is a record of Billie singing and Lester playing ("A Musical Romance,"--Columbia Legacy), and the music is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes.
