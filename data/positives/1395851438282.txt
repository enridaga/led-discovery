This morning our new harmonium was played in Church for the first time. It is a very beautiful instrument with a soft sweet tone and Fanny managed it very well. I think the people were pleased and Mrs. Ashe and Syddie whom we saw after the service said they liked the instrument very much. The singing of the Choir and the congregation in the Old Hundredth Psalm and the Trinity Hymn was especially good and hearty.
