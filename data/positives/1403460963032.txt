We perform Beethoven's E flat Trio opus 1, and Schumann's first trio in D minor, in an afternoon concert. Both go really well, but somehow 5 p.m. is a subdued time for the audience. They've been at a morning masterclass, a midday concert, our afternoon concert, and they still have a huge evening concert at 8.30 p.m. and a late night concert at 11 p.m. ahead of them. Consequently you can almost feel them saving themselves up, leaving space in their hearts for more impressions and reactions later in the day.
