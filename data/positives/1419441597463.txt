<p>The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra is a surprising phenomenon which reveals some remarkable facets when one starts to look into its history, achievements and activities. It is the oldest orchestra in Britain... and I still recall the delightful surprise with which I first saw it in 1944, on leave from the RAF. It was at the time far better than anything else in the country, especially since London's Queen's Hall had disappeared in the Blitz.</p>
