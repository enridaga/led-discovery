On the 15th. we got the Master of the 25th Band (Mr Hayes) & another clarinet player to join us at our musical club, on w'ch I had promised myself & the other gent'n much gratification from such an accession (which enabled us to try an overture or 2 of Abel's) instead of w'ch coming to pass, they play'd so loud & harsh upon their clarinets & hautboys in particular (w'ch they also attempted) that the effect of the whole instead of being improv'd as we expected, was quite disagreable. After this we had only Mr Hayes at our meetings, who play'd the clarinet pleasantly enough, w'ch instrum't we desir'd him now to keep to, he being much more used to that ins't than the hautboy.
