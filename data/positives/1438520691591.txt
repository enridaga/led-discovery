He slaved at it steadily from May till December, and put into it only of his best. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>For weeks before he finished it he was inaccessible; the Christmas of 1890 was no holiday for <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>him. The rehearsals had begun long before the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>orchestration was ready, and the opera was to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>be produced on January 31, 1891, at the latest. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>By the first week in the new year the score was <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>completed. Then Sir Arthur told me I might come to Queen's Mansions to hear some of the music. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>To my great delight, he played several of the numbers for me. I found them picturesque, dramatic, original, and stamped throughout with the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>cachet which the world understands by the word &ldquo;Sullivanesque&rdquo;. I was particularly struck by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the Oriental character of the harmonies and &ldquo;intervals&rdquo; in Rebecca's song, &ldquo;Lord of our chosen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>race," and I told Sullivan that I thought nothing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>could be more distinctively Eastern or even Hebraic in type. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Let me tell you where <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I heard it. Wlien I was the 'Mendelssohn scholar'<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and living at Leipsic, I went once or twice to the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>old Jewish synagogue, and among the many Eastern melodies chanted by the minister, this quaint<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>progression in the minor occurred so frequently <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that I have never forgotten it&rdquo;. It certainly comes<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>in appropriately here.</span></p>
