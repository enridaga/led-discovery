Extract from a letter written by a Daughter of Bunsen, 9 Carlton Terrace: 25th August, 1851 -
Wichern makes good use of his time; every minute of the day that is left unoccupied in his present business (of examining establishments and institutions, taking cognisance of what is accomplished and what is wanting) makes him unhappy, as his active and almost restless mind has been so long accustomed to be bent strongly in one decided direction. We directed him yesterday to the church of St. Barnabas, as he wished to witness the Puseyite worship ; and he came back with a headache, from having heard one uninterrupted chant in unintelligible succession during two hours and a half.
