<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">July 26th, 2000 - RFH - the Keith Jarrett trio. Booked many months before, not knowing that come the date I would have had emergency major surgery and still be an in-patient at the Whittington, with stitches in, catheterised, and starting to go stir-crazy. I asked the surgeon if I might be allowed out for a few hours to go to this concert. He said that he insisted I should go to it, and so I did (with Andy's loving help) And it was great, and it was a reminder that there was life outside the hospital and it is very well worth living!</p>
