The second event each weekend took all Sunday afternoon and evening, for rehearsal and performance with  rather good concert orchestra at Whitley Bay, a seaside place some five miles from home, once more across the stormy waters of Tyne. I can remember the delight of setting out for these concerts, winter and summer, never knowing what new thrill there would be in the black folder on the desk under the red-and-blue floods of the stage in this rather pleasant seaside concert hall. Always there was something new, because that was really the purpose of this orchestra; they were popular concerts, but both the conductor, Arthur Jacobson, and his thirty-five players, looked upon it was the best thing in the week.... Thus the standard of the programmes was always being stealthily advanced from the Strauss waltzes and Gilbert and Sullivan selections, which were obligatory, to ballet music suites and finally movements from some of the finest symphonies.
