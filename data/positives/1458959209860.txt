<p>I am very happy that the Moscow Kamerny Musical Theatre has now decided to include <em>The Nose</em> in its repertoire. It is an excellent production. The talented conductor Gennady Rozhdestvensky is in charge of the music. And I must say that Boris Pokrovsky's production deserves the highest praise. He has lots of inventive details and humour, but in spite of this there is a great deal of depth in his production. I am very glad that my opera has been revived.&nbsp;</p>
