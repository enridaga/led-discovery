Horowitz’s reactions to criticisms were as complex and contradictory as his personality. […] I remember in the early thirties we were living in a pension in Carlsbad. Horowitz often played Mozart for me, among other music, and I began telling him not very pleasant things. “Volodya, how can you play Mozart like that? It’s not Romantic music! You have to keep the rhythm in Mozart, and in general keep it simpler, simpler!” Almost anyone else would have been hurt, or angry, but Horowitz actually agreed with me!
