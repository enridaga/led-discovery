The first number on the programme was Schumann's overture to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Manfred</em>, which opens with an impetuous &ldquo;forte&rdquo; phrase, syncopated, quick, and requiring a very decided, strong down-beat. I had raised my baton to attention and&mdash;except the garland of flowers which friendly hands had wound around my desk nothing seemed to indicate an unusual state of things&mdash;was just on the point of letting it come down with a will, when&mdash;shall I ever forget the peculiar sensation it gave me&mdash;I saw, as in a dream, the leader and, with him, the whole orchestra rise to their feet, and before I could realise what was happening, the familiar, affecting strain of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; filled the vast hall, played by those dear fellows of the orchestra and sung by the audience, which I noticed, in turning round bewildered and embarrassed, had risen too. I was touched to a degree, far too much so for thinking of speaking.</span></p>
