Continue with my choral movement a good deal in morning, after lunch & tea. Practise with the Italian boy in afternoon - he's jolly good. Go to Wigmore Hall in evening with Barbara (see yesterday) to hear Pirani Trio. A very good concert. Beethoven Bb Trio - marvellous work, beautifully played. Casella - Siciliana & Burlesca - very beautiful & amusing. Tchaikovsky A minor Too long, & much too orchestral although beautiful in it's sentimental way. All v. excellently played.
