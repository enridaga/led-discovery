Villa Piccolomini, 13 Oct., 1825.... We...received an invitation to hear an Improvisatore at the Casino Piccolomini. The name of our host is Angiolotti, a rich possidente, or farmer, from whom and his wife we have received great civilities.... We had our friend Reisiger of the party, and he played, and sang German, and the vigneroli sang Italian.
