" It was Sunday night, November 18, 1883," writes Mr. S. W. Tucker, of Clapton, " when I heard you sing ' Almost persuaded ' in the Priory Hall, Islington, and God used that song in drawing me to the feet of Jesus. I was afraid to trust myself in His hands for fear of man. For six weeks that hymn was ringing in my ears, till I accepted the invitation. I came, and am now rejoicing in the Lord, my Saviour. How often, with tears of joy and love, have I thought of those meetings, and of you and dear Mr. Moody, who showed me and other sinners where there was love, happiness and joy."
