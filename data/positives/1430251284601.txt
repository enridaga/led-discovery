In the evening [I had a ] choral rehearsal at the Concert Hall for the ' Elijah ' which takes place next Tuesday. In precision of intonation the chorus leaves much to be desired, but I have tried to give them an idea of the importance of nuances, and in this I have partly succeeded. At any rate, they have become more attentive. But, so long as the chorus does not have regular practice, good results cannot be expected.
