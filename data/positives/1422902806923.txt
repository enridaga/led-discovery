Finish an arrangement of Haydn’s D maj. ’cello concerto in morning for viola, & practise it. Walk with Beth also, & in afternoon Play tennis with her 5.30–6.30 on court opposite. Listen to a section of Beethoven Prom; Marvellous Leonora no 2. (In many ways I prefer this to no. 3; there is no anticlimax); Concerto no. 2. beautifully, & joyously played by Cyril Smith. “Thou Monstrous Fiend” (Fidelio) sung by Stiles Allen; – a wonderful organ, naught else. At this moment we were cut off for a wretched babble from Snowdon.
