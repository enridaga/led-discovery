In the evening we have the clarinettist Janet Hilton as a guest. This concert is not quite typical of Domus concerts, as the afternoon one was also not; long substantial pieces instead of a compilation of little ones. But the audience transforms itself rapidly into a Domus audience; though perhaps older than our usual audiences, and consisting partly of people who couldn't get tickets for an official festival concert, they respond almost instantly to whatever it is in that dome audiences respond to and become beaming and kindly listeners, smiling benevolently when we catch their eyes as we bow and go on.
