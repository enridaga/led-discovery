<p>Being around Sid [Edwards] got me even more interested in music. I used to love the way he whistled. He was about one of the best whistlers I ever heard. He could whistle most any song, like "The Tennessee Waltz" or "Blue Moon of Kentucky," and he would whistle a lot of blues songs. He could even whistle the sound of a bird. All through the day when I'd be around with him, he'd be doing his work and then he'd whistle tunes for me. He loved teacakes, so when we would stop by the house, Mama would fix him teacakes with ginger and cinnamon in them.</p>
