Aaron Copland came to lunch today, having read the fifth volume of my journal  and we spent the afternoon listening to records of my music. He says the journal expresses the unexpected violent side of my nature, while the music is the less inventive serene side. The music doesn't seem as necessary and varied (particularly rhythmically) as with a composer who has only this means of speech, especially considering I grew up (I too) in the jazz era.
