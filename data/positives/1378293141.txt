The concert opened with a symphony of Haydn's that he brought with him, but which was not known in England. It consisted of four movements, pleasing, lively, and good. Our singers were Mara and a very interesting young woman, a Miss Chaun, David, and Tasca, and others of the day…. Among the instrumental solo or quartett performers were Madame Krumpholtus and Dussek….

The second act invariably opened with a new symphony composed for the night. Haydn of course conducted his own music, and generally that of other composers, in fact all through the evening….

Now the anxious moment arrived, and Salomon having called `attention' with his bow, the company rose to a person and stood through the whole of the first movement.

The effect was imposingly magnificent. The instruments might all be said to have an obbligato part, so perfectly was the whole combination conceived and carried out. One of the movements was to imitate the London cries, and `Live cod' was to be traced through every instrument that could produce the effect. The cry began the piece and ended it, and Salomon was wound up to a pitch of enthusiasm beyond himself. The applause was great. The public were satisfied, and Haydn was very properly taken up.
