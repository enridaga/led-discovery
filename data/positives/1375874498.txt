14 Dec., 1827. - On Wednesday, our new carpets being down, I invited several people whom I thought myself bound to ask in some form or other. Therefore I got together some musicians. Sardi was pleased to come, and to sing admirably something from the Creation of Haydn: besides him there was Rostell's little Corinaldesi, whose singing was much admired, and a harp-player named Fraziani: the Vannitelli played admirably on the pianoforte, and altogether it was an abundant feast of music, so that the evening passed off extremely well.
