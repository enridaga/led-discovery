<p>The Wagner Concerts at the Albert Hall were composed entirely of his works, and he conducted the first part of the programme himself. Unfortunately, he was no longer at his best, and had lost something of his great skill as a conductor. The second part of the Wagner programme was conducted by Dr. Hans Richter, who, when he mounted the conductor's desk, was received most enthusiastically by the members of the orchestra. That was Richter's first appearance in London, and everybody knows what a wonderful career he has had during so many years of activity, and how greatly he has improved orchestral concerts not to mention his numberless performances of Wagner's operas at Drury Lane Theatre and Covent Garden. The singers engaged for this festival were principally those who sang in Wagner's operas in Bayreuth. They were Frau Materna, Herren Scaria, Grimm, Schloesser, Unger, and others.</p>
