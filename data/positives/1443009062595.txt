<p>I spent the evening tearing upstairs to hear Maria Kallas [sic] in Norma. <em>Casta diva</em> is everything he meant it to be, &amp; so is the finale of the last act; and the two women (Ebe Stignani the Adelgiza) were lovely together, playing like race-horses.&nbsp; The bald straightforward classicism - peut-etre je l'ai senti, said Pasta; and Bellini felt it, though he made such comic druids &amp; such excruciatingly inept modulations.&nbsp; Incidentally, the shindy of the chorus in the last scene is louder and more overwhelming than any recondite effects of clamour.&nbsp; It is just loud &amp; threatening, like a cat-fight.</p>
