<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">The concerts given by the Soviet delegation in Prague were played to packed halls, the tickets having been sold out well in advance. Particularly astounding success was enjoyed by our violinist David Oistrakh. It has to be admitted that he really was in brilliant form and played immaculately at each of his concerts. The Prague audience was impatient to see Yevgeny Mravinsky again, whom it remembered from the previous year&rsquo;s festival. The time round, his concerts were even more successful. </span></p>
