<p>To my mind, the controversy about the two different styles of playing, Eastern and Western, came to a head when Louis Armstrong joined Fletcher Henderson [early 1920's], taking Joe Smith's chair. It was a real jazz feud with all the musicians taking sides. Louis represented the Western style of jazz, while Joe Smith was the Eastern. It was the most terrific thing I ever heard--that midnight show at the Apollo Theatre when Henderson showed off Louis. I don't remember if anybody knew about it in advance, but Joe Smith was sitting in the pit with the house band, and, believe me, when he opened the show, it tore the house down. He did five or six encores and probably played better than he ever did before in his life. I guess he did it just to prove that he was still THE Joe Smith.</p>
