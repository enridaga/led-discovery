About the year 1786 Nicolo Sempieri, an Italian, came to Leicester, and, for the first time, I was treated with a specimen of Italian music. The Portamento, or sustaining of the voice, the force and delicacy of his touch upon the piano-forte, produced a language quite new to me. He had been brought up in one of the Neapolitan conservatorios, and was educated as a soprano, for the service of the Church. It was ridiculous to hear such a piping voice from a tall broad-shouldered man.
