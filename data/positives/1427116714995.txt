In an adjoining room were musicians and actors, among them Ponchard, Levasseur, Dugazon, Panseron, Mlle. de Munck, and Mad. Livére, of the Theatre Français. The most interesting of their performances, which I attended merely as a listener, was a vocal quartet by Cherubini, performed under his direction. Later in the evening, the whole party armed itself with larger or smaller ' Mirlitons ' (reed pipe whistles), and on these small monotonous instruments, sometimes made of sugar, they played, after the fashion of Russian horn music, the overture to Demophon, two frying-pans representing the drums.
