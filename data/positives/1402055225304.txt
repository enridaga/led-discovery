We officers were living in a marvellous chateau filled with fine furniture, and I remember my delight at finding a newish violin, which I was able to play. That was a great joy to me because I hadnâ€™t touched a violin for so long. In this chateau we were absolutely in the lap of luxury - and this was only a few hundred yards from the gun position.
