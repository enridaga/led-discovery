<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I remember my first visit here, on a Saturday lunchtime to see some live jazz. I thought it was absolutely fantastic, everyone was so full of so much life. The audience was buzzing. It was the first time I had ever seen people swing dance, and I loved it. After that first Saturday I tried to go back every week and every time I went to join in on the dance floor, but never had enough confidence, but maybe once it reopens, I will give it a go!</p>
