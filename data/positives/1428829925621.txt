Carl Mangold, the violinist, and I have become intimate friends, and as often as we are together, we play duets; sometimes, with the addition of an excellent violoncellist from the Court apothecary, no ! I mean from the Court orchestra, we play trios. I have thus got acquainted with many works hitherto unknown to me ; for instance, I now know all Beethoven's sonatas for piano and violin, nearly all his trios, further, six trios by Reicha, and three trios by Prince Ferdinand of Prussia, which are very fine, and many other things besides.
