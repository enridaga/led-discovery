<p>The Berlin Opera-house is a marvel of discomfort.&nbsp;Not the slightest provision is made by its directors&nbsp;for the comfort of the public, which is expected to&nbsp;contribute its money gratefully for inferior performances&nbsp;and wretched accommodation. There is no <em>foyer</em>, no&nbsp;<em>tabagie</em>, no ventilation. For the privilege of being&nbsp;slowly boiled and listening to third-rate singing you&nbsp;have to pay from six to nine shillings, if you select the&nbsp;stalls &mdash; into which officers are forbidden to enter &mdash; as&nbsp;your abiding-place for the evening, and the prices of&nbsp;seats in the other parts of the house vary between&nbsp;one and five marks. The temperature, about ninety&nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit when the overture begins, rises to one&nbsp;hundred and ten degrees or so by the time the performance is ended. The only concession made to public&nbsp;convenience by the directors of this torture-chamber is&nbsp;a regulation by which the evening's entertainment is&nbsp;punctually brought to a close at half-past nine, ten&nbsp;o'clock being the supper time of the eminently respectable class that delights to mortify its flesh at the Opera&nbsp;house.&nbsp;</p>
