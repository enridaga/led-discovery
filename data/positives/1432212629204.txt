I sang this hymn for the first time in the Free Trade Hall, in Manchester, in 1883, at one of Mr. Moody's meetings. The service was held at eight o'clock on a gloomy winter morning. The hall was densely crowded and filled with mist, so much so that the people could hardly be discerned at the farther end of the hall. I felt the need of something to brighten up the meeting, and then and there decided to launch this new song. It was received with much enthusiasm, and at once became a favourite of Mr. Moody's, and continued to be so until his death.
