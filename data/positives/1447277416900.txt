<p>I have&nbsp;heard hundreds of masses with orchestral and organ accompaniments in Roman churches, and can confidently&nbsp;assert that nine-tenths of them were by old and comparatively obscure composers, such as Morales, Carpentrasso, Ruffo, Festa, Pierre de la Rue, Vittoria and&nbsp;Anerio, the remaining tenth being chiefly by ancient&nbsp;and distinguished writers; for example, Palestrina, Carissimi and Allegri. I do not remember hearing anything,&nbsp;belonging to this class of work, more modern than Jomelli&nbsp;and Paisiello. But, in the matter of voluntaries, almost&nbsp;unbounded license was allowed to the organist, who&nbsp;might and did, as his fancy happened to prompt him in&nbsp;that direction, introduce airs from nineteenth-century&nbsp;operas, and even popular melodies, into his reminiscences&nbsp;or arrangements of sacred strains.&nbsp;</p>
