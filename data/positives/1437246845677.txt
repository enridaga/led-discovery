<pre>On the 25th July, Colman produced his translation from "La Folie," of "Love <br />laughs at Locksmiths," for which I composed the music. It was very strongly cast, <br />and well represented in all its parts. Elliston's Captain Beldair was full of <br />buoyant gaiety. Mathews's Risk was an inimitable piece of acting ; he had two <br />songs, " The Farm Yard," and "Miss Bailey," both of which were always encored; 
"Miss Bailey" was a universal favourite, and the piece ran the whole of the <br />season.
