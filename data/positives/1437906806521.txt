<p>Listen to F.B. conducting B.B.C. orch at 9.5. Orchestra not on form. Bach's 3rd Brandenburg wasn't very satisfactory - uncontroled. Haydn's Clock Symphony was better. Kathleen Long plays 'Phantasm' again; not such a good show as the Queen's Hall, but the great work redeemed it. A riotous performance of Capriccio Espagnol ends the programme. Rhythm excellent.&nbsp;</p>
