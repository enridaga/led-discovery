I write “Aspatia’s Song” in morning, quite successful, & also begin a de la Mare, unsuccessful. Practise as usual. Begin “Hymn to Pan” before meeting Uncle Sheldon at Queen’s Road and bringing him back here to dinner with Barbara. He takes us to the Royal Tournament at Olympia – marvellous show. I enjoyed every moment of it. The P.T. Squads were superb, & the musical drives. It quite makes me long to be a soldier!
