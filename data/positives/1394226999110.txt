As I was not a boarder at the Academy, I on a Sunday of course went with the rest of the boys to church, where my father had also now a pew, & where my musical feelings were excited by another organ, which however I did not by any means like so well as that I had been used to at the Chapel, it being in fact an old one & in bad condition, besides which it was also vilely play'd; the organist (Mr Dyer) being an old superannuated dancing master, who was now become blind & paralytic, so that he co'd hardly make shift to do the duty.
