I was much pleased last night with Pacchierotti at the opera.... His voice was in god order, & he sang divinely - his 1st song a Grasiosa - or rather mezzo bravura Air of Bertoni, which I had never heard before; but so elegant & fanciful that I shd have been less surprised had I been told that the Catilena was Pacchierotti's - his 2d Air a Cantabile in the gran gusto by Anfossi - and the 3rd air, Rasserena il mesto ciglio, of Gluck, wch we got encored. He sang in a truely grand style the whole night - with too little applause & attention - though there was some of both - The first woman Lisini [1], has a brilliant toned voice - a little shrill - but in tune and of a bel metallo, but rough, course, & unfinished in all her Passages - she is often near right, but never quite right in anything. The 2nd woman [2] is not sure of singing one note in tune - The 1st Tenor [3] the worst in voice, figure, & manner of singing I ever heard at the opera. I think he has less voice than Piozzi - & far less taste - it seem[s] a worse & Courser Voice in decay - there was a most Charming Quartet by Sarti at the End of the 2nd act, full of new passages & Effects, which was wholly ruined by the Tenor, who sang the lowest part or base. He wanted strength to support the harmony of the other parts, & when he was heard it was only to make one execrate his intonation - the other 3 parts in the harmony were charming, that is the 2 1st men 1st woman [4]. But the Dancing! what extacy, exclamation & acclamation at the sight of young Vestris! I sickened with disdain when I recollected how little had been bestowed on our friend...
