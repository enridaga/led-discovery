By and by down to the Chappell again, where Bishop Morly preached.... The sermon done, a good Anthemne fallowed, with vialls; and then the King came down to receive the Sacrament, but I stayed not; but calling my boy from my Lord's lodging and giving Sarah some good advice, by my Lord's order, to be Sober and look after the house, I walked home again with great pleasure.
