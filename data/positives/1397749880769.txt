We went to the first Richter concert and a more magnificent one I never heard—there was not a dull note from beginning to end. Wagner’s 'Vorspiel' to the Meistersinger which even Rainald might call 'a nice noise', it is so tuneful and easy to understand: ditto to Parsifal, which I should like to hear again before one can understand it; Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony, with such a lovely Adagio, one of Liszt’s wild Hungarian Rhapsodies and Beethoven’s C minor Symphony, which I should like to hear regularly every Monday for 3 months. I know the Adagio well which makes it extra delightful.
