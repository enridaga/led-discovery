<p>We were playing at the Sutherland in Chicago once, when Trane [John Coltrane] was just finishing one of his thirty-minutes solos. I was feeling so tired of playing so long that a drumstick flew out of my hand and whipped by Trane&rsquo;s head, just missing him. When we finished the set, I told him, &ldquo;I'm sorry, man, it just slipped out of my hand.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I thought you finally threw something at me for playing so long.&rdquo;</p>
