<p>Friday 4. A pleasant day. How relieved I feel when Friday afternoon comes no lessons until Monday. Out looking at a Regiment of Soldiers drill. They look well marching along to martial music with the stars &amp; stripes flying. Writing letters all afternoon. To hear Paul S. Dickenson lecture on the State of the Country. Very good.&nbsp;</p>
