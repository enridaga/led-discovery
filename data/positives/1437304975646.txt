<pre>[Hale] wrote a very pretty comic opera, entitled "L'Amant Jaloux," and <br />"Midas," which was in high favour with the Parisians. I saw it twice played 
at the Theatre Rue Favart : the subject is differently treated from ours ; and, <br />in my opinion, Kane O'Hara's burletta is worth a million of it. In Paris, it in <br />a great degree gained its popularity by the acting of the inimitable Monsieur <br />Trial, who represented the Singing Shepherd ; his imitation of the old school of <br />French singing (which he caricatured with irresistible humour) was admirable. <br />"L'Amant Jaloux," "Les Evenemens Imprevus," and "Midas," were all composed by <br />Gretry, and beautiful music he gave them, although not sufficiently effective <br />for the English taste; which, in the musical way, requires more Cayenne than <br />that of any other nation in the world. </pre>
