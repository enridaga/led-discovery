<p>&hellip;I might be able to buy some sort of suit out here, or I should say in about 2 months time, because I&rsquo;ve just purchased a brand new violin complete with case and bow for about &pound;8&hellip;whether I shall be able to collect it depends entirely on the behaviour of the students in Cairo.&nbsp; They are behaving rather awkwardly at the moment, agitating against the government&hellip;</p>
<p>I enclose program of concert I went to at &ldquo;Music for All Club&rdquo; on Saturday; All the players except &lsquo;Hoenner&rsquo; (?) are German Prisoners.&nbsp; There is also a Symphony orchestra, here comprised of German prisoners.&nbsp; They give very very good performances.&nbsp; The club is marked on the map I sent you.&nbsp; The first two items were very very good.&nbsp; The pianist was very good, but I didn&rsquo;t like the piece he played&hellip;.</p>
