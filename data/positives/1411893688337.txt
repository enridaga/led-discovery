<p>I attended my very first concert at RFH for Vladimir Horowitz's amazing recital. There were no seats except for one in a box on the left of the stage. It was an electric occasion. I can still hear the way Horowitz started with the beautifully but incredibly simply played Mozart Sonata. I don't recall the number but it was breathtakingly stunning. He also played Chopin's Polonaise in A Flat Major and to this day I am convinced he found himself having to repeat the LH octave section because of a memory lapse but it was brilliantly played.</p>
