<p>Extract from a Contemporary Notice, Monday morning: 30th April; Totteridge - Yesterday we dined at the Palace&mdash;the dinner-party and no one else,&mdash;heard in the evening a set of German singers and musicians, part of a company who will perform German operas, to which I look forward with great pleasure. To-morrow we are to go to the Queen's Concert&mdash;and those not included in the invitation will enjoy the first German opera, for which we have taken a box, as in duty bound.</p>
