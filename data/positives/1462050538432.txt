<p>I have of course revived my own enthusiasm first and foremost for the deep poetry of the "Trunkene Lied"; I was particularly captivated by No III of the 1st Part "In dein Antlitz sah ich j&uuml;ngst"; in fact the wonderful poetry revelaed by your music was a continual delight to me. I have a slight misgiving over the fact that so many adagios follow on from each other; I wonder whether they do not work to the detriment of each other and in particular spoil the effect of that incomparable final piece? -&nbsp;</p>
