It was about this time that the unusual combination of Beecham and the world of film-making came to fruition. It was an illuminating experience - an illustration of the immense versatility of this unique artist. The film studio itself was no new experience for him, because in 1947 he conducted Brian Easdale's  ballet sequence for The Red Shoes. We enjoyed this, and felt that it was a landmark in British film music. The rest of the music was conducted by another conductor who was an expert at fitting score to film - by no means a simple task, and one which has, over the years, defeated many fine composers and conductors.
