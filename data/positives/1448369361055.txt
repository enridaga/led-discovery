<p>We attended the service on Sunday at the &ldquo;Hotel des Invalides,&rdquo; to witness the manner of worship provided for the old and disabled soldiers, who find their support here. They were formed in two single columns, one on each side of the centre aisle, each man bearing a flag-staff, which was &ldquo; carried,&rdquo; &ldquo;ordered,&rdquo; &ldquo; presented,&rdquo; &amp;c., at the word of command.</p>
<p>The religious exercises commenced by a grand voluntary, by the military band in attendance, which was nothing more or less than the overture of the Caliph of Bagdad, by Boieldieu.</p>
