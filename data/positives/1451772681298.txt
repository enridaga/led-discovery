<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">My last visit to the traditional &lsquo;Prague Spring&rsquo; Music Festival was a great event in my life. I had thought I knew Czech music fairly well, but in Prague I realised that my knowledge was in fact quite scanty, and mainly restricted to the past.
