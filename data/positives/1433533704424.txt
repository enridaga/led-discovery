<p>Oh that music sounded so good ... In that [Joe Oliver's] band he had Buddy Christian on the piano - Professor Nicholson on clarinet - Zue Robertson on the trombone - himself on cornet and Henry Zeno on drums ... Ahh - there was a drummer for ya ... He had a press roll that one very seldom hear nowadays ... And was he popular ... With everyone&nbsp;[...]&nbsp;[Henry Zeno] was great in a street parade ... He also played in the Onward Brass Band which was made up of top-notched musicians, featuring on the cornets Manuel Perez and King Oliver ... And you never heard a brass band swing in your whole life like those boys ... Ump Ump Ump ... I'll never be able to explain how they would swing like mad - coming from the cemetery - after playing funeral marches to the cemetery with the body and after the Preacher sez - ashes to ashes and dust - et cetera - Henry Zeno would take his handkerchief off of the snare [...] so every member could get in his place and get ready to march back to the hall with some of the finest swing music pushing them... And with Black Benny on the bass drum and Henry Zeno laying that press roll on the cats (the second line) that was a musical treat in itself. P.S. the second line (cats) was consisted of raggedy guys who hung around poolrooms and et cetera.</p>
