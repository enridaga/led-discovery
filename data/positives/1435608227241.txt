<p>The castle is placed on a rock so high that we could see it soon after we got out of Glasgow... Within the courts we were present when a regiment of Highlanders were reviewed, who wore the kilt, and ancient dress. This costume, as well as some of their music, no doubt was left by the Romans. The band played so well that it led me to inquire if it was possible that a Scotchman could be at the head of it. I learnt, not with surprise, that the leader was a German. I was disappointed in not hearing a band of four bagpipes. As the instruments were of different sizes I concluded they would play in parts, and that I might hear some genuine Scotch music, but on learning that they all played the same tune, without any other harmony than their horrible drones, I considered it a lucky escape.</p>
