<p>And how marvellously Horowitz played! I&rsquo;ll never forget one of his appearances in Chicago, when he played a short song without words of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Shepherd&rsquo;s Complaint&rdquo;. As soon as he began &ndash; just twelve bars! &ndash; my heart was in my throat, he played so naturally and with such feeling. Horowitz was a born poet of the piano.</p>
