Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: 22nd January -
I am writing on as fine a spring day as can be imagined ; blue sky—one window open, the other with the blind drawn, that the sun may not shine into my eyes. The good school boys have been enabled to sing their chorale without icy wind and snow, such as we had recently. On the King's return
from Potsdam on the 15th, two of his outriders were frostbitten in the face, owing to 20° of Reaumur. . . . The cold diminished to 6° by Sunday, the 20th, when the Festival of the Prussian Orders with that of the Foundation of the Monarchy (the 18th) were celebrated. At the beginning was sung, 'Come, Holy Ghost,' and at the close the 'Te Deum,' versified by Luther to the melody of ' O Roma nobilis,' to the great satisfaction of the King, and therefore to the admiration of all.
