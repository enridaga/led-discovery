Shortly after we had to dress to drive to Government House, where dinner was at 7 o'clock, to enable us to attend the second part of the Liedertafel's Jubilee Concert. Lord and Lady Carrington had been at our concert the previous evening, but could not speak with us, as they were perched high up in the gallery over the clock. It is impossible to be more nice, hearty, and amiable than they were. After dinner we drove to the Exhibition Building, waited a few minutes in the carriages for the end of the first part, and then made our entrance, Lord Carrington giving his arm to Wilma, and I to Lady Carrington, the people standing up, and 'God Save the Queen' being played. The Liedertafel, about 120 strong, sang uncommonly well, but the solos were not to our taste. The Exhibition Building has a railway on 
one side, and a tramway, worked by steam-engines, on the other, both whistling almost every minute, which spoils the effect of music considerably.
