<p>Feb. 12, London Theatre Concerts, Fritz Heinig, Brosa &amp; K.U. Schnabel</p>
<p>The transcription of the Fantasie in F minor (K.608), originally announced for Jan 8 and then transferred to to-nights programme, was not forth-coming, but the Idomeneo overture is sufficient of a rarity in itself and made a noble introduction to the concert. The violin concerto in G (K 216) is a gracious work and Brosa played it graciously. I don&rsquo;t think I have heard the C minor wind serenade (K.388) for a long time, if at all but it seemed quite familiar, I presume because I have heard twice in the past year the string quintet which is adapted from it. The programme talked about &ldquo;intense seriousness, gloom and passion&rdquo; which seems an exaggeration. Certainly it isn&rsquo;t light &amp; sprightly but one can be serious without being gloomy and in its wind version it is not at all forbidding.</p>
<p>Young Schnabel played the E flat P. Concerto (K.449) very well &amp; it sounded even more impressive than on Kathleen Long&rsquo;s records, especially the first movement. Why isn&rsquo;t it played oftener? I wouldn&rsquo;t put it in my first 3 &ndash; but not lower than 6 or 8. And to crown all we had as good a performance of the G minor Symphony (K.550) as one is likely to hear except from Beecham or Walter in an inspired mood.</p>
<p>Considerable credit must be given to Fritz Heinig who was making his first public appearance in this country, tho&rsquo; he has lived here for four years. In rapid, energetic passages, he looked at first sight, too officiousness [sic] but when one observed his quiet and restrained watchfulness elsewhere, one could see that he had the root of the matter in him.</p>
