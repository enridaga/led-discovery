I have a friend who used to sing in the Bach Choir.  Most years my husband and I would travel to the Royal Festival Hall to hear one of their pre-Easter performances of the St. Matthew Passion conducted by David Willcocks.  Being all-day event the concert was memorable from many points of view: the deeply spiritual quality of Bach's music, the rapt attention of the audience, and the happy atmosphere amongst friends and families picnicking during the lunch break.  A truly memorable occasion!
