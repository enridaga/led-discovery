My first singing masters were Signor Passerini, a native of Bologna, and Signor Peretti, who was a vero musico. He was the original Artaxerxes when the opera of that name was first performed at Covent Garden; he taught me the beautiful air, " In infancy our hopes and fears," which was composed for him, and it made an impression on my mind never to be forgotten. He had a fine contre altro voice, and possessed the true portamento so little known in the present day. He also taught me the song of Arbaces, " Amid a thousand racking woes," which I executed with the greatest facility : but the songs which delighted 
me most were, " Oh too lovely, too unkind," and " Oh, why is death for ever late ?" I never sang those without tears.
