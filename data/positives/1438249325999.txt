I am under Frau Schumann's roof at last and in spite of the awfulness of it am wildly happy. I really meant to stay only two days but then dear kind Frau S. proposed doing the Quintet tomorrow and my staying till Monday. As that fell through I proposed going tomorrow (Sunday). This she wouldn't have, so I stay till Monday after all. As ill-luck would have it I was out both yesterday and today at her practising time, but this evening she is sure to play. </span></p>

I had never heard the opera, and she not for a long time, and we were so amused. [&hellip;] Yesterday we two went to the Museum concert, an awful programme; a Saint-Saens symphony, another novelty of an awful description, Arie out of the Meistersinger and Euryanthe, sung by the "exquisite" Gotz, .and . . . thank God for all His mercies . . . the G moll of Mozart.</span></p>
