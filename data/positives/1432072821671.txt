We had the pleasure of hearing him play frequently in private, notably on one Sunday evening when he gave a brilliant Recital (no less!) when Henry Irving and Ellen Terry came to Westwood House.

Those present could truly say that they have heard Liszt, for probably this was the last time he ever ventured on so long and physically exacting a programme: and much more than mere flashes of his former supremacy were exhibited that night.
