Yesterday's concert began at the equally stupid hour of 4.30 o'clock, and we ended in perfect darkness, no arrangements having been made for lighting the gas. The crowds of roughs, through which we have to fight our way to and from the concerts, always on foot, are most unsavoury. The processions seem remarkably stupid. So, altogether, I am not in the best of tempers.
