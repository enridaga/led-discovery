"Good old Isaac," as Aldridge was called, besides following his trade, that of carpenter, held other offices in the town. Up to about 1840, when the Fire Brigade was organised, with tradesmen in pot hats as firemen, Old Ike was Horsham's only fireman, and had sole charge of the small squirting apparatus that we boys admiringly called an engine. [...] He was also organ-blower and bell-ringer at the Old church till he died. He further undertook the repairs of the Church steeple, putting new shingles where wanted. But important as these offices seemed to us, it was as big drummer to the old Band that Ike used to afford us the greatest satisfaction. When there was a band job on he would be sure to have sought inspiration in an extra glass or two, and then he would delight us boys by his extraordinary drumstick flourishes, and his industrious accompaniments to the band's favourite melodies - "Hearts of Oak," "Bonnie Dundee," "Bonnets of Blue," "Rory O'More," "The Brighton Camp," &c. These tunes, with perhaps a few others, used to constitute the Band's repertoire. Music in band parts being in manuscript only was hard to get and very expensive. It appeared, too, to be the subject of much misunderstanding among the bandsmen, and some of the harmonies were certainly rather hard for the public to appreciate, especially towards evening at the Broadbridge Heath and other club feasts where the Band was engaged to play.
