I met... [George] at dinnertime and he asked me about...[going to the Opera House], I am going to meet him about seven. I liked it very much indeed but we could not understand it because they sang in Italian. Miss Gaylord taken the part of Mignon well, George asked me if I wished I could sing as well as she did and whether I should make use of my voice then, I rather think I should.
