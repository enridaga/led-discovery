Another Christmas over and gone. Last night's fancy dress party was a first-class affair, a quite brilliant display of costumes.... A large proportion of the company were in male dress of some sort, but being a ‘hers’ party, it didn’t matter the least. All the windows were well covered over and the curtains pinned down to prevent any peeping Toms from spying on our goings on. If it got about widely that Matron had dressed up, especially in Colonel’s clothes, there might be a great commotion at headquarters. Sister Robertson and Sister Blandy dressed up as ‘Scotties’. Kilts both very good too. We danced in the big Mess room, cleared of tables and chairs, to the tune of the gramophone and had refreshments in the anteroom. Really enjoyed ourselves immensely and had a ripping time. Feeling now rather as though we had several nights out. Weary about the feet and eyes. Anteroom this p.m. a very soporific place.
