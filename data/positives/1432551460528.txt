Friday morning we left for Ballarat...The concert was a curious affair, the house crammed to suffocation, in the cheaper places by crowds of miners who actually roared their applause. Unfortunately we had again much to suffer from draughts, the place being a theatre, and a rather dilapidated one; I was most anxious on account of Wilma, but fortunately she has not suffered much from it.
