We haven't seen much yet of the new Matron. Yesterday thought of a good name for her - 'Black Mumbo' - because she is so small and tubby and dark. Am sure she must have a dark strain in her. She is very musical indeed and yesterday when C[hristie] was singing in the anteroom, she went in and was most affable and played some of C's accompaniments for her.
