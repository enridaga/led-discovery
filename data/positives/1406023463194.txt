From as early as I can remember, Mum entertained us with music. She was always singing, playing the piano, clapping and stepping rhythms. Music was a wonderful game. As she played, we would skip and dance around the room, making shapes in the air according to the phrase shapes. We curled into the tiniest forms when the music was soft, and burst out jumping into the air when it was loud. We tiptoed and crouched for creepy music and skipped to dotted rhythms. We had to convey ferocity and tragedy and all as a spontaneous reaction to her playing.
