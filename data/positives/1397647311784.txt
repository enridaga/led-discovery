Went to choral practice last night and did so enjoy it. Kept pretty hard at work but the performance is next week, so the cantata had to be taken right through, as if we were singing in public. We are doing Stainer's â€˜Crucifixion' as it is suitable for Easter. Parts of it seemed to go very well but some parts seemed to need a good deal of rubbing up. The soloists are quite good. Mr Higgins has one solo. The other soloists are Capt. Brown from No. 3 and an orderly from the Canadian camp who has a very good voice. Got back at 10.15, but the rehearsal didn't seem a bit too long.
