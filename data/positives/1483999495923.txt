<p>That you have turned to music again fills me with joy. Yes, the andante of the&nbsp;<em>Jupiter</em> is the height of unbelievable perfection. It has everything: line, freshness, grandeur, and what orchestration!!! Try to follow the score so as to savour the writing for woodwind. After hearing that, one wonders why one bothers to compose at all. I have become so hard on myself that there are days when, had I total faith, I would close my piano and retire to a monastery.&nbsp;</p>
