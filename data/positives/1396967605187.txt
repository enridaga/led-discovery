To cement and keep up the liberal interest [in Leicester], the Revolution Club was formed; at the head of which was the Whig member, the Hon. Booth Grey. They had an annual feast on the 4th of November, to commemorate the Revolution. Charles Rozzel, a stocking-maker, a man of extraordinary poetic talent, furnished every year a patriotic ode. It is to be lamented that these spirited effusions, in the style of Churchill, are lost. I luckily retain the sixth ode, which was written upon the centenary of the Revolution, November 4, 1788, and addressed to the stewards of that year.... This was first recited by the bard, and then sung. The best vocalists attended, and the Duke of Rutlandâ€™s band was always ordered to assist in playing patriotic airs in the procession through the town, and during dinner.
