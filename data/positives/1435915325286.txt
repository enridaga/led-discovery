<p>Another operatic star at that time was the great basso, Signor Lablache. He always enjoyed singing the part of Leporello in Mozart's Don Giovanni, and I remember an amusing incident that happened in connection with it. It was in his first song "Madamina," when he recounts Don Giovanni's easy conquests of admiring ladies, putting the number at <em>mille e tre</em>. On this occasion, when the phrase came again he repeated it in English "a thousand and three" and the whole house roared with laughter. Lablache was never vulgar in these buffo parts.</p>
