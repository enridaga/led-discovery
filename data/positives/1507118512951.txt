<p>The twentieth day of July was goodly wedding in parish of Mr. [Edmond] Cooke and Mr. [John] Nicolls's daughter, for there were the lord mayor and all the aldermen and many ladies and many worshipful men and women. And after the wedding was done, they went home to the Bridge House to dinner, for there was a great dinner as ever was seen, and all manner music and&nbsp;dancing all day long. And at night, goodly supper, and after, a goodly masque at midnight.</p>
