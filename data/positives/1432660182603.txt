We know that Fritz Kreisler “made” the Elgar Concerto, but we forget that he has done more than his share for ephemeral works as well; I heard him, for instance, play a sonata by York Bowen – not much more than a mane nowadays. And I was once proudly told by that amiable gentleman, Baron Frederic d’Erlanger, composer of the Hundred Kisses Ballet, that Kreisler had given the première of his Violin Concerto early in the century.
