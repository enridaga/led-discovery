On the eve of the 'Festa di San Rocco' a 'Musica a Grand Orchestra' was performed at the church; but how?  Pretty waltzes and polkas were played upon the organ, then a fugue full of discordant fifths and octaves, with occasional utterances from a priest's hoarse voice at the high altar, and the tones of a wheezy and discordant organ! The Director marked each rhythm by thrashing his desk as heartily as the poor saint may have been beaten in his lifetime, often drowning the sharp metallic ring of the orchestra, and murdering the effect of the solo, which was sung by a fine tenor, with the usual 'tremolando.'
