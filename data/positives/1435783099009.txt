<p>[Mrs Crouch and I] returned to York, on Wednesday, the 1st of September, and had for our benefit, " The Haunted Tower," " and " Richard Coeur de Lion." The house overflowed. The next day I dined with my friend Tate, who gave me a calf's head, with the skin on it, admirably cooked by Mrs. Wilkinson ; and the day after, we set off for London.</p>
