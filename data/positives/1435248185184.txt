In 1934, in Pittsburgh, I heard and saw the Ellington band perform for my first time. Nothing before or since has affected my life so much. In 1939, I became his protege, enabling me to be closer and see more. 

His first, last and only formal instruction for me was embodied in one word: Observe. I did just that and came to know one of the most fascinating and original minds in American music. 

Ellington plays the piano, but his real instrument is his band. Each member of his band is to him a distinctive tone color and set of emotions, which he mixes with others equally distinctive to produce a third thing, which I like to call the 'Ellington Effect."

Sometimes this mixing happens on paper, and frequently right on the bandstand. I have often seen him exchange parts in the middle of a piece because the man and the part weren't the same character. 

Ellington's concern is with the individual musician, and what happens when they put their musical characters together. Watching him on the bandstand, the listener might think that his movements are stock ones used by everyone in front of a band. However, the extremely observant may well detect the flick of the finger that may draw the sound he wants from a musician. 

By letting his men play naturally and relaxed, Ellington is able to probe the intimate recesses of their minds and find things that not even the musicians thought were there.
