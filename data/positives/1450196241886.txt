<p class="MsoNormal">The Germania held together about six years &mdash;most of the time in Boston. They made many short trips in New England, and one <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">tournde</em> with Jenny Lind. Their summers were profitably spent in Newport In the last two seasons they added as stars the famous girl violinist, Camille Urso, and Alfred Jaell, pianist Madame Urso is too well known to need any eulogy at my hands. She is one of the very few young wonders who developed into great artists at maturity. Jaell was a splendid pianist. If he were playing at the present day, he would bear comparison with the greatest living players. When the Germania disbanded, he went to Paris, made his home in that city, and won a popularity which he never lost. He died very recently.</p>
