About noon the English legate commenced the high mass De Trinitate.  The first introit was sung by the English chanters, the second by the French.  They had arranged that when the French organist played, the French chanters should sing, and vice versa.  Pierre Mouton played the Kyrie, then the English the Gloria in Excelsis; the Patrem was sung by the French, with the King's band of cors de sabuttes and fifes, the Sanctus by the English, and the Agnus Dei by the French, who concluded with several motetts.
