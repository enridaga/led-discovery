<p>I learned from everyone [using a new record player in the 1940's to listen to jazz], not necessarily piano players or singers. Charlie Christian, for example, was a bitch of a guitarist. Listening to his records I educated myself about phrasing and ad-libbing. Same went for the great drummers. They taught me the importance of keeping time. And as far as I'm concerned, there's no greater lesson.</p>
