Lordsday. To my Lord; and with him to Whitehall chapel, where Mr. Calamy preached and made a good sermon up[on] these words: "To whom much is given, of him much is required." He was very officious with his three reverences to the King, as others do. After sermon a brave Anthem of Capt. Cookes, which he himself sung, and the King was well pleased with it.
