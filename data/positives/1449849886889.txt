<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="font-family: Cambria; font-size: medium;">I can assure you that few paintings have ever had such a profound effect on me as Murillo&rsquo;s larger works in the Louvre. It is possible to glean some idea of their merit from reproductions, but the actual pictures reveal a colour harmony such as you can see in no other paintings. When I look at them, I feel as if I was being touched by a magic wand. It is an experience to be classed along with seeing a performance of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Tristan</em> or <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Zarathustra</em>, attending the first Weingartner concert in Berlin, hearing Dohn&aacute;nyi play the Beethoven concerto in Vienna this year or catching my first glimpse of the Stephanskirche when I was in Vienna 3 or 4 years ago. </span></span></p>
