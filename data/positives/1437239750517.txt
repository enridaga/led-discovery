<pre>On the 16th of May, I went to see the first appearance of my friend Mathews, at <br />the Haymarket, in the characters of Jabel, in Cumberland's comedy of the "Jew," <br />and Lingo, in the "Agreeable Surprise:" he was received by a crowded house with <br />unanimous applause. He came from the York Theatre, where he had been a <br />distinguished favourite of the eccentric Tate Wilkinson (who knew well how to <br />value his talents), as well as of the York audience, and the other theatres of <br />the circuit he belonged to.
