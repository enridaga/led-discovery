<p>Nessa's wedding day.&nbsp; Reflections suppressed.&nbsp; I must describe Cambridge. We walked from the station, past Rattee &amp; Kett, cold, starry, dismal; then familiar; King's College Chapel, hasty wash &amp; dress, &amp; dine with Sheppard. He was in evening dress.&nbsp; He carries a knobbed cane.&nbsp; Maynard, Norton &amp; Betty to dinner.&nbsp; A good deal of raw time had to be manufactured. I had romanced so much about Cambridge that to find myself sitting there was an anti climax...And so to bed; with King's bell saying very pompously all through the night the hour.&nbsp;</p>
