<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1861 I wrote my first two serious compositions, the string quintet in G and the quartet in A minor. I persuaded some friends to play the quintet, and they were rather pleased with it. It reminded them of Haydn, Mozart, and early Beethoven. Thereupon I showed it to my teacher, Krejci, and was very proud when he expressed himself contented.</p>
