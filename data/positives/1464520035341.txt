<p>One jolly little tune from&nbsp;<em>Matelots</em> we liked very much; we sing it to Svyatoslav and it makes him laugh. When I asked Auric if it was some kind of folk song, he candidly revealed that he had taken the rhythm from a Tchaikovsky tune he particularly liked and fitted a new melody to it. Then and there he played the Tchaikovsky melody to us, which incidentally was completely dissimilar to his own. Auric is a nice lad, a bit of a daft bumpkin, but with his heart in the right place.</p>
