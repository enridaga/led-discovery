The music I heard sung to night was all in the old coral style of the 16th century. After this full performance in the great choir, there were others in in different chapels, where boys sung in the organ loft, with tenors and bases below. Night - the people are all surely mad here - there is such a noise of whistles, little bells, trumpets etc in the streets as I never heard at Barthol'mew Fair.</span></p>
