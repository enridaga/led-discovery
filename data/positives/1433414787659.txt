<p>How did I happen to play "High Society", the famous chorus? Well, I was seventeen at the time. I was playing at that time with John Robichaux, and before that I was playing with the Manuel Perez band, and he used to get all that old-time music--what they are asking for right now.</p>
<p>He bought that "High Society" for me. It was a march tune. We were at Mahogany Hall then. I took the piccolo part and transposed it to my instrument [clarinet]. It made a wonderful hit. So the next night we had to play at another hall where they had all the Creole meetings. At that time they didn't allow a dark man to come in. If you were dark you had to stay out. I was there, and Manuel Perez liked the way I played "High Society" and he says, "Come on in"--when a crowd was there--"Come on and play "High Society" and they let me play that solo by myself. I made a wonderful hit--Lord! They played "High Society" all night.</p>
<p>I played parades with Manuel Perez and the Onward Brass Band, also with Joe Oliver and Kid Rena. I played funerals too.</p>
