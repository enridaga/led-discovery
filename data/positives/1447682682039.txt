<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">1950'S - My father, also Geoffrey Hadwick , travels down from Manchester, where he is an architectural student, to visit the Festival of Britain. He loves the RFH. He tells me about it as a child. He travelled as a motorbike sidecar&nbsp; passenger- deaf in one ear by journey's end. 1970's- I come to RFH as a student to see my first ever classical concert with student girlfriend + her father. I fall in love with RFH too. 1980's- I marry her and we bring our children to the RFH. 1990's - We see Pretsner's Requiem for a Friend, Meltdown + BaabaMaal&nbsp; and marvel at the range of wonderful experiences. 2000's- I buy a Hadwicke seat in memory of it all</p>
