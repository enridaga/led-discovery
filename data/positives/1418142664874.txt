I drove to Troy, New York, to visit my brother Simon, who was attending Rensselaer School Of Engineering. While there, I sat in and played trombone at a club with his small jazz combo. My trombone playing began at 16, so I had a lot of catching up to do as far as jazz improvisation was concerned, but I was slowly improving as a jazz player. Listening nightly to Sonny and all those fine jazz musicians in our band really helped. It was a marvelous learning opportunity.
