<p>I remember going with 3 school friends when aged 16 to hear<br />Stockhausen's Gruppen played twice! I will never forget the sight of<br />Stockhausen appearing alternately in an orange and then white<br />shell-suite. One of my friends swore at me after the first half and<br />refused to ever go to music with me ever again. All the same it was an<br />exciting event and not a spare seat was to be had - what an<br />atmosphere!</p>
