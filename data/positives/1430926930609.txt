Casti was a remarkably quick writer ; in a short time he finished his drama, entitled " II Re Teodoro." It was said, Joseph II. gave him the subject, and that it was intended as a satire upon the King of Sweden, but the fact I believe was never ascertained. The characters of the drama were Teodoro, Signer Mandini; Taddeo, the Venetian innkeeper, Bennuci ; the sultan Achmet, Bussani ; his sultana, Signora Laschi ; Lisetta, daughter to the innkeeper, Signora Storace ; and Sandrino, her lover, Signor Viganoni ; all these performers were excellent in their way, and their characters strongly pourtrayed ; but the most marked part, and on which the able Casti had bestowed the most pains, was that of Gafferio, the king's secretary. This character was written avowedly, as a satire on General Faoli, and drawn with a masterly hand. Casti declared, there was not a person in our company (not otherwise employed in the opera) capable of undertaking this part. It was 
decided, therefore, by the directors of the theatre, to send immediately to Venice, to engage Signor Blasi, at any price, to come and play it. This 
delayed us a little, and in the interim, Storace gave a quartett party to his friends. The players were tolerable ; not one of them excelled on the 
instrument he played, but there was a little science among them, which I dare say will be acknowledged when I name them : 

The First Violin .... HAYDN. 

Second Violin . . . BARON DITTERSDORF. 

Violoncello .... VAN HALL. 

Tenor MOZART. 

The poet Casti and Paesiello formed part of the audience. I was there, and a greater treat, or a more remarkable one, cannot be imagined.
