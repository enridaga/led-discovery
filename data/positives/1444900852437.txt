Duke's band - and Manzoli and Varole who are singing birds of passage excepted Florence is worse off than any great town in Italy - there is worse music at the theatres, the accademias, in the churches and in streets than elsewhere, and less frequent. Not one great harpsichord player or good lesson could I find, or one celebrated and standard Florentine composition.</span></p>
