It was a very agreeable interlude. I still remember the scent of the broad beans and it still brings back the memory of that period whenever I smell them growing today, a lovely sweet smell. I have pictures of Pitcairn and Captain Harris, the pipe band and boxing matches between the troops, as well as pictures of the men advancing in open order and practising their musketry. Apart from training, the battalion went on several route marches. In hot weather these route marches were exhausting and we had a rest of ten minutes in the hour when, on a signal, all the men flopped down without removing their packs and just lay there until the order came to get on their feet again. And the band would strike up, the bagpipes, and off we went for another part of the route march, and very glad we were too to see the billet again.
