<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I used to come every summer (Aug.) To the International Festivals, i.e. Asian one year, Africa the next, etc. Gps came from Cuba, etc to perform and we went in relevant attire playing relevant music walking and singing all around [the] area. Also boats went down the Thames drumming, dancing to the relevant music with food! I never went on hol. in Aug. as I did not want to miss the summer fun at Fest. Hall and embankment.</p>
