<p class="MsoNormal">One of the most notable accomplishments of Mr. Lang was the bringing out of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Passion-Play</em> of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Parsifal</em> by Richard Wagner. At great expense he brought from New York the entire Seidl Orchestra, which had recently played the work in that city. It was a bold and brilliant stroke.
