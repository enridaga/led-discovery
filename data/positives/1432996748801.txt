Dr. Elvey therefore sent in an application for Exeter Cathedral, which was then in want of an organist, and proceeded there by coach to compete for the post, which he won. On this occasion, as on the previous one when he competed at Windsor, he received many excellent testimonials one, to which he attached especial value, being from the late Bishop Selwyn to this effect : 
"He will not only discharge the duties of such a situation in a merely formal and devout manner, but he will do his utmost in his particular department to add to the solemnity and devotion of the Church Service.

"G. A. NEW ZEALAND."
The trial took place just before Dr. Selwyn went out to New Zealand, and he has left on record the great pleasure he experienced in listening to Dr. Elvey's rendering of his favourite anthems.
