<p>In the matter of open-air music, we Englishmen are&nbsp;heavily handicapped by our perfidious and malignant&nbsp;climate... In other&nbsp;lands, as northern as our own, where the seasons display&nbsp;a certain sense of order and decorum, proprietors of&nbsp;public gardens are enabled, year after year, when the&nbsp;buds begin to crack their cases and the birds have done&nbsp;their courting, to advertise al fresco instrumental performances at stated intervals throughout the warm&nbsp;months &mdash; say, from May 1 to September 30 &mdash; with a&nbsp;tolerable certainty that they will not be prevented from&nbsp;fulfilling their pledges to their patrons by any untimely&nbsp;marvel in the nature of a transposition of the seasons. In the famous Volksgarten, at Vienna, Edward Strauss's&nbsp;inimitable stringed orchestra, or some scarcely less renowned military band, such as that of the Koenig von&nbsp;Wuertemberg regiment &mdash; equally efficient with strings&nbsp;or brass and wood &mdash; plays every evening in the open&nbsp;during the summer, except when a thunderstorm drives&nbsp;musicians and audience alike for shelter into a straggling&nbsp;wood and glass shanty which stands hard by for their&nbsp;accommodation. There are bands on Sundays and holidays &mdash; that is, about four times a week throughout the&nbsp;pleasant time of the year &mdash; at the three Kaffeehaeuser,&nbsp;or chief refreshment-stations of the Prater, at the Neue&nbsp;Welt in Hietzing, and at cognate establishments in the&nbsp;other great suburbs : good military bands, if you please,&nbsp;not scratch orchestras like those to which one listens&nbsp;with dismay in English watering-places and the minor&nbsp;German Bad-Orte.</p>
