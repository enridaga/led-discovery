Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, at Mrs. Granville's, at Gloucester, Clarges Street, 18 Nov., 1743 -
I was at the opera of Alexander, which under the disguise it suffered, was infinitely better than any Italian opera ; but it vexed me to hear some favourite songs mangled. I think I may say my pencil has produced a good piece. I have bought a very fine head ruffles and tucker of Mrs. Carterâ€”new fashioned Brussels, it comes to near fifty pounds : is not that extravagant ? Tis very pretty
as well as fine.
