<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">The premi&egrave;re was unsuccessful only in the sense that it failed to provoke a protest. Musically and visually, the production was excellent. Monteux conducted capably; the singers &ndash; particularly Death and The Nightingale &ndash; were good; and Alexander Benois&rsquo;s costumes and sets were stunning. Boris Romanov composed the dances, and Alexander Sanin was the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">metteur en sc&egrave;ne</em>. The opera was sung in Russian, and that is all I remember about the premi&egrave;re. </span></p>
