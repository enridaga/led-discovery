<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In 1953 my mother took me age nine and my sister, eleven, for our first visit to London. We were taken to a matinee performance of Tchaikovksy's 'The Nutcracker'. I will always remember after the interval, the curtains opening to a most magical scene. Glittering snow was falling and at the rear of the stage raised on a dias, shimmering in the lights was the Sugar Plum Fairy, poised on pointe and as still as a statue. My mother often recalled the 'Ohhhh' gasped in wonder. As an adult I have attended many wonderful performances at the Hall, including the 50th anniversary concert in 2001, but none can compare to that magic experienced as a child. It was the beginning, for me, of a love of the live performance.&nbsp;</p>
