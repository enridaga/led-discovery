<p>In evening listen to an E.M. Delafield play 'the Little Boy' which began well, but petered out rather badly. Also a Contemporary concert of Hindemith - Concert Musik for Pft, Brass &amp; Harps. (which contains some of the best Hindemith, &amp; Mathias the painter, a new symphony* - hard to judge, thro' wireless, &amp; because of a scratch performance. I get so sick of these shows without any precision or conviction - technically not bad, but that's all. (The work had some nice things but seemed to wander at times).</p>
