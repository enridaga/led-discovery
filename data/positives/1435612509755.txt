<p>Early in June I applied to my friend Sir George Smart, hoping by his interest to procure a place at the Coronation [of Queen Victoria]. He very kindly appointed me to the semi-chorus, and my place was near the front, on the left-hand side of the orchestra, where I had a fine view of this astonishing sight...</p>
<p>The music was the service of the church as performed in the cathedrals, solemn and grand, heightened in its effects by a band of one hundred and fifty instrumental performers, and nearly three hundred voices. The parts usually sung by a single voice were performed by six of the most eminent English singers to each part. This was a delicious treat ; under no other circumstances could such a rich mixture of voices have been heard. During the performance of Handel's anthem, describing the crowning of King Solomon, the Queen was conducted by her ladies behind the purple and gold tapestry into Henry the Seventh's Chapel, where she was robed for her coronation. She soon returned under a canopy of gold. It then wanted three minutes to two o'clock. A telegraphic communication was made from the floor through the roof, and a rocket announced that the crown was placed on her head. The cannon instantly thundered from the Park and the Tower, and the five hundred instruments and voices poured forth '<em> The Queen shall rejoice in her strength, for the Lord hath set a crown of pure gold on her head</em>.'</p>
