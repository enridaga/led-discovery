shore to shore. I cannot describe how I enjoyed 
the voyage, nor what good it did me: but on the 
Banks I caught friend catarrh. In New York and 
then in Newport I was pretty ill; but on my return 
to New York, lying in bed most of the time, with St. 
Gaudens the sculptor sculping me, and my old friend 
Low around, I began to pick up once more. Now
