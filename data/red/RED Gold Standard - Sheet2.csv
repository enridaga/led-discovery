But it was a very pleasant time. One of my fellow guests was Dr. Stone, a wellknown amateur who played the contra-fagotto* at the Festival, and we made a good deal of music at the Deanery. Dr. Stone's instrument was an enormous affair (Santley once told him that it resembled the stand-pipe at Chelsea Waterworks!). We arranged a duet for contra-fagotto and piano, the theme being that of the well-known round, ""Three blind mice."" Stone played the tune at an incredible depth, and my part was to demonstrate the scamperings of the mice. The composition had a great success. It was never printed, nor do I think there is any record of its performance in the annals of the Festival.</p>"

He was an excellent conductor, without any tricks or oddities. As a conductor of choral music he was just as successful as with the orchestra, which is not always the case. He did not train the choir, that being done for him by a chorus-master of splendid energy and resource, Charles Hecht. The choir worshipped Hall&eacute;, the Lancashire lads and lasses coming entirely under his sway. I think he was never nonplussed but once. This was during one of the many performances of Berlioz's ""Faust"" (a work that Hall&eacute; had really restored to life, at least in England). In the well known Serenade for Mephistopheles there is a dramatic and dangerous part for the choir, who have to come in with a sudden satirical ""Ha !"" in the course of the song. An enthusiastic tenor in the choir was always very alert and on the spot to those who watched him, as I often did. But on this occasion he was a little too alert, and just a moment before the whole choir should enter, he came in alone with a loud nasal ""Ha !"" The effect was fearful, the choir could hardly go on, the audience were convulsed, and Hall&eacute; well he would have killed the man, I am sure, if he could, and he tried to do so with his eye.

As already mentioned, when living at Windsor I had made a musical setting of ""Christmas Bells,"" a poem from ""In Memoriam,"" and this being sung in the Abbey at Christmas-time had attracted the attention of a friend of Lord Tennyson, Mr. Baillie-Hamilton. He had also heard privately a performance of a setting of mine of Tennyson's humorous poem, ""The Goose."" Through Mr. Baillie-Hamilton's introduction, I got to know the Hon. Hallam Tennyson, and it was decided that the two settings should be performed at an evening party at the house of Lord Tennyson in Eaton Square. I took a portion of the Abbey choir with me, and we sang these two compositions before a large company. ""The Goose,"" with its humorous words, and, I think, fairly humorous music, seemed to please the audience very much. Indeed, I know it gave satisfaction to the Poet in one point.There is a verse in the poem describing the old owner of the goose getting prosperous with the results of her poultry-keeping, and the lines run : And feeding high and living soft Grew plump and able-bodied, Until the grave churchwarden doffed, The parson smirked and nodded. This is set in a mock sentimental way, and it produced considerable merriment, the Poet saying in my hearing, evidently with some satisfaction, ""That 's the poem the critics said showed I had no sense of humour."" It seemed to me that he had for the first time been quite easy in his mind on this subject. Another observation which I must record also came from the Poet in connection with this song. Mr. Frederick Locker, who was one of the guests, and himself a poet of no mean order, congratulated me before Tennyson on the way in which I had set the words, saying: ""I hope that your name will go down to posterity associated with the poem and its author.""

0.0,PILGRIM.txt-510,"I cling tenaciously to every remembrance of my childhood days at Rochester. For me the change from the Midlands to the ancient city on the Medway was a delightful experience. The neighbourhood of Rochester was then quite rural and very picturesque with its numerous hop-gardens and cherry orchards. It was a custom at my home for the children to be taken to the hop-gardens during the hop-picking season, to spend a happy day. The hop-pickers in those days were mostly poor people from Rochester, many of whom my parents knew. The migrant crowds from London were not then a feature. We would take up our station with, I suppose, the capriciousness of children, beside the bin at which some poor woman would be picking, and devote ourselves to what was for us the delightful game of picking hops. By this means we amused ourselves, and added to her earnings. The days spent in those gardens have a treasured corner in my memory. But possibly we enjoyed ourselves even more in the cherry orchards than in the hop-gardens. Our excursions were generally made to an orchard owned by a friend at Gillingham (then a village, now a large town), one or more fellow choristers making up our party. It was all a fruit-growing country, stretching from here to Faversham. The delight of us boys at being allowed to climb ladders into the very heart of the trees, and eat as many cherries as we could (and sometimes, I fear, more than were good for us), may be imagined. Those black-hearts and bigaroons are a luscious memory. I recollect we resolved artful boys that we were to throw the stones, if possible, into the next field so that our host would not know how many we consumed. The subtlety of this little trick has been in my mind more than once in later years, when I have been shooting grouse and probably expending a great many more cartridges than was justified by the few birds there were to show for so much ammunition. On several occasions I have been tempted to resort to a furtive strategy, and hide my failure by distributing the empty cartridge-cases as remotely as possible in the heather!"

I had the honour of rehearsing these two distinguished pupils, and they each accepted a Book of the Music from me as a reward for their keen attention to their studies ! The Processional anthem ""I was glad"" made a splendid effect, the Westminster boys' ""Vivats"" coming in with superb effect. And they had an extra chance also, for in consequence of His Majesty the King not entering the Choir until some time after Her Majesty the Queen, the ""Vivats"" had to be repeated. It was here that the value of Dr. Borland's system of signals, already referred to, was fully revealed, and my precaution in adopting them amply vindicated. The signals to the choir and band worked admirably, and I must add that Dr. Alcock (now organist of Salisbury Cathedral) at the organ extemporised so effectively that the whole affair, which might have proved an awkward moment if not a catastrophe, passed off as if it had been rehearsed as a part of the programme. Sir Walter Pariatt sat on the conductor's platform with me, taking his share in conducting the orchestral music and directing the performance of his own anthem. Concerning my Homage anthem no cut was necessary. The aged Archbishop Temple was a little slower over the ""Homage"" than we had anticipated, the music in its entirety being required to accompany this picturesque function. A striking feature of the ceremony was the Procession of the Regalia, which formed an early and interesting item in the day's proceedings. The Abbey clergy charged to bear the regal symbols from the Jerusalem Chamber into the Church were accompanied in procession by the choir. Traversing the Cloisters, singing the hymn ""Rejoice to day with one accord,"" to the grand old tune ""Ein' feste Burg,"" a pause was made for a short service in Edward the Confessor's Chapel, and another pause near the Chapel of Henry VII., while Tallis's Litany was sung as above described; then, supported by two trumpets and three trombones, the procession was resumed, to the strains of ""O God, our help in ages past."" At the last verse, as the singers comprising the choirs of the Abbey and the Chapel Royal neared the great West door, the hymn was taken up by the Coronation choir and the vast congregation, producing an unrehearsed climax of overwhelming majesty that will never be forgotten by those present.</p>"
0.0,PILGRIM.txt-512,"While speaking of the school, I may as well tell a final story of those old days. At a later period of my school life we were removed to yet another room, in a house inhabited by the school-master in the Precincts. It was a rambling old place, with an enormous roomy cellar. The master was about to punish a boy his own son for some misdemeanour, when the young gentle- man suddenly slipped out of the door, across the hall, and out into the yard at the back. His father, after a moment's surprise, followed him cane in hand, and arrived in the yard just in time to see the culprit dis- appear into the capacious cellar. He felt perfectly certain that his bird was trapped, and followed without undue haste. After a time he reappeared in the school, and to our surprise said, "" Have you seen Willie ? "" "" He went out into the yard, Sir,"" we replied. "" Oh, yes,"" said the master, "" and into the cellar, but I have thoroughly searched and he has most unaccountably disappeared."" I do not remember when the boy reappeared, but his method of escape, somewhat original, was as follows : The master, not long before, had purchased a barrel of apples, which was placed in the cellar. The barrel and its contents had been discovered by his children, and the apples consumed. The empty barrel, well-known to the runaway, he quickly turned over, and as his father, cane in hand, prowled around, the boy within it watched him, with some anxiety, through the bung-hole. Our schoolmaster used the cane pretty freely, and he had one refinement of punishment which was very original, which he would resort to if a boy's fault was very heinous. In his eyes the most serious faults were prevarication and falsehood. One boy was particularly prone to these (I will not give his name, but he became a very good member of society all the same). This boy seemed always to be undergoing verbal reproof for his infirmity, and if in the service there occurred one of the Psalms referring to lies such as the 58th, "" The ungodly are froward . . . they go astray, and speak lies;"" or the loist, ""There shall no deceitful person dwell in My house "" the master would say to the boy : "" Master , did not your conscience prick you ? "" , and the boy always answered "" Yes, Sir."" The method I have referred to, and to which such admonitions were the prelude, was to send the delinquent down the High Street to purchase a good, stout cane with which he was to receive chastisement when he returned ! This occurred more than once in the experience of the same boy who never failed to bring back the cane, so that if he lacked the grace of truth, he certainly did not fail in fidelity. "

I was rather taken aback by this unexpected query, and for a moment hardly knew what to reply. In point of fact, the particular concert was one of a special character. We had given a selection of Wagner, including ""The Last Supper,"" a very difficult work which had not been done in London for, I think, some twenty-five years indeed, very few choral societies had been able to tackle it. Pulling myself together, I said to the expectant cabby, ""Oh, I think pretty fair."" My friend at once replied, ""Well,for myself I don't understand Wagner [pronouncing it in familiar English], he is too abstruse and athematical for me."" This amused me very much, and after a little more conversation I said, ""Well, you know who I am. If you like to look out for me I shall be glad to employ you to take me to and from the rehearsals."" He thanked me, and said he would not forget. True to his word he turned up on the next occasion of a rehearsal. Afterwards I employed him often. He constantly came to the rehearsals, and also to the concerts, and on not a few occasions honoured me by adversely criticising my conducting. For example, he said, after a performance of ""Messiah,"" ""It was very good, Sir Frederick, very good : but what makes you take the 'Hallelujah Chorus' so fast?"" ""Fast,"" said I, ""I didn't take it fast."" ""Oh, yes, you did,"" he observed, shaking his head, adding, as he drove off, ""It may gain in brilliancy by your method, but it loses in majesty. Good-night!""</p>"

Our most pleasant fishing excursion was to Cooling Castle, with its beautiful I2th century gatehouse, still in an almost perfect state of preservation. The tale of its defence in 1554 by the then Lord of Cobham, against Wyatt's rebellion, was an interesting one to us boys. It was about seven miles from Rochester, and the moat contained roach and carp. We generally made up a party of five or six boys, rewarding the kind residents of the Castle by singing a part-song or two. Maas and I often went to the village of Snodland, where there was a good trout stream. It was in this stream I landed my first trout. I confess it was not with a fly, but the more humble worm ! Other fishing excursions were made to Farleigh, a delightful place above Maidstone, where we would sit all day beside the Medway throwing in huge lumps of ground-bait, and gentles, pulling out as a rule a very good basket of perch and roach. I believe I brought more zest to this sport than is now the case in my sometimes toilsome efforts to land the lordly salmon. Poor Maas loved fishing till the last, and it was a cold caught on a fishing excursion that brought on the illness that terminated fatally in 1886.

The Tchaikovsky number, in C minor, was accompanied by organ only; but in the other items the organ was supplemented by brass and drums. The service commenced with the penitential verses of Psalm 51, as set by Sir John Stainer. These were sung in procession, by priest and choir alternately. An instrumental interlude followed, viz., Beethoven's "" Trois equals"" for four trombones, which, played in the Triforium, had a magnificent effect. Handel's fine anthem, ""The ways of Zion do mourn,"" and Goss's ""The souls of the righteous,"" which I had specially arranged for this service, were sung. The hymn, "" O God, our help in ages past,"" sung very slowly by choir and congregation (except verses five and six, which were sung very softly by choir alone), provided an inspiring moment. Gibbons' Amen the same that had been rendered at King Edward's Coronation completed the service, and I played the Dead March in ""Saul,"" accompanied by brass and drums.

Before being very long at the Abbey it fell to my lot to play the Dead March in ""Saul."" I played it as I had heard Hopkins and other musicians play it, but to my surprise found that the Dean was much disappointed by my performance. I took the opportunity of seeing him and asking him what was wrong. He said it did not sound like the Dead March in ""Saul"" which he had been accustomed to from Turle, nor at all like the Dead March as played by Dr. Buck, of Norwich, which he had heard some thirty years before. I could not help replying that I did not suppose it did sound like Dr. Buck's performance, as I had never heard that Dr. Buck was a capable organist, although an admirable teacher of boys, but promised to take the opportunity of asking Turle what his particular version was. This I did, and soon found that it included the introduction of some remarkable drum effects, which I had somewhat modified.then told the Dean that if he would come and hear me, I would play it again. He came into the Nave one evening, when I gave him a supply of drums far exceeding whatTurle had done (I must admit for that occasion only), and he wrote me a note saying he was quite satisfied. Since then I have played the Dead March many times, and fancy I am somewhat celebrated for my drum effects, although these, I am afraid, are not approved by some of my brother organists.</p>"

A reward had been offered for his head — a well-known ancient custom. He had been caught, duly decapitated, and the head-money paid. At the rising of the curtain for the third act, the ghastly, dead head could be seen on the magistrate's table. In order to have the scene very realistic, the actor who had been the robber was hid under the table, which had a valance reaching to the floor, and through a hole cut in the table-top the robber's head could come up and lie as naturally on it as any dead head The piece had had a rather long run and the gallery gods were tired of it. The table with the head was placed near the front of the stage. The aforesaid gallery gods — creatures without a conscience — procured some very old, strong Scotch snuff, and through a little blow-pipe they easily blew the snuff down towards the head. Oh, it was a cruel sight to see that poor dead head, with the eyes closed, sneeze and sneeze and sneeze ! Actually in the lifting of the head in the sneezing act, we could hear the poor fellow's chin thump the table on the down-stroke. That ended the robber piece. "

I answered truly, that had I known the seat to be his, I would not have taken it. His reply to this pacific speech, was a thump on the head, which I repaid with interest. But in an instant, I was seized ; and, for the heinous crime of returning a blow, was hurried to prison, and left there amongst culprits of every description. My entree seemed to create a bustle amongst them, and I felt myself a personage of importance. About a dozen of them messed together, and invited me to sup with them ; and I can say, with justice, I never passed a more jolly night in my life I They had some good pesce spada for supper, arid plenty of wine."

The night of my debut, the Earl of Uxbridge was the Director ; the songs allotted to me by his Lordship, were "" Jephtha's rash vow,"" and the laughing song from L' Allegro, "" Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee."" The late Mr. Linley heard me sing it over and over again, and to his masterly instruction I owed the indulgence which I received. In singing sacred music I was aware of its value, and fagged at the tenor songs of Handel with unremitting assiduity. Mr. Joah Bates conducted those concerts, and was supposed to understand Handel perfectly ; he was an excellent performer on the organ ; Cramer was the leader, and Cervetto principal violoncello. The concerts were then held in Tottenham Street, and their Majesties and the Royal Family were constant attendants ; but, although it was difficult to become a subscriber, the room was always crowded. I was lucky enough to meet with the approbation of Mr. Bates, in the recitative of "" Deeper and deeper still;"" my next song was the laughing one. Mr. Harrison, my predecessor at those concerts, was a charming singer : his singing "" Oft on a plat of rising ground ;"" his "" Lord remember David ;"" and "" O come let us worship and fall down,"" breathed pure religion. No Divine from the pulpit, though gifted with the greatest eloquence, could have inspired his auditors with a more perfect sense of duty to their Maker than Harrison did by his melodious tones and chaste style ; indeed, it was faultless ; but in the animate songs of Handel he was very deficient. I heard him sing the laughing song, without moving a muscle ; and determined, though it was a great risk, to sing it my own way, and the effect produced justified the experiment: instead of singing it with the serious tameness of Harrison, I laughed all through it, as I conceived it ought to be sung, and as must have been the intention of the composer : the infection ran ; and their Majesties, and the whole audience, as well as the orchestra, were in a roar of laughter ; and a signal was given from the royal box to repeat it, and I sang it again with increased effect. Mr. Bates assured me, that if I had rehearsed it in the morning, as I sang it at night, he would have prohibited my experiment. I sang it five times in the course of that season by special desire.</p>"

He told us many of his exploits, and something of his education. When a boy, he had been placed at a school, where his trade was regularly taught. A large figure, made of straw, was placed in the middle of a room, about which were arranged watches, trinkets, pocket handkerchiefs, &c. &c. The master of the school (and a very great master of arts he was), stood by and gave instructions. No one was allowed to be an adept, or fit to take the field, till he could rob the figure without being observed, or deranging a single straw. They recounted many anecdotes ; the following one of the celebrated Gabrielli, though well known, I cannot refrain from repeating, as she had, in consequence, remained several days in the very room we then occupied. Gabrielli, though beautiful, generous, and rich, had a most capricious temper. She was the idol of the Palermitans ; notwithstanding^ one evening, on which a new opera was to have been performed, as they were going to begin, the house being crowded, and the Viceroy and court present, she sent word she had a head-ache, and could not perform. Every endeavour of the manager and her friends to induce her to fulfil her duty, only rendered her the more obstinate ; and even the threat of a dungeon, from the Viceroy, had no effect ; at length, after exhausting every other method to restore her to reason, a guard seized and conducted her to prison. She told the captain of the guard, with the greatest sang froid, "" Your Viceroy may make me cry, but he shall not make me sing. 1 ' After remaining two days in confinement, she was released."

She was reckoned a deep blue, and very well versed in all the arts and sciences: The great poet Metastasio had lived sixty year in her brother's house, upon the most friendly terms, and died in it. The colleges of Bologna and Pavia gave her the title of Dottoressa ; and deputations came from both those places, with her diploma. When I was admitted to her conversaziones and musical parties, she was in the vale of years, yet still possessed the gaiety and vivacity of a girl, and was polite and affable to all. Mozart was an almost constant attendant at her parties, and I have heard him play duets on the piano-forte with her, of his own composition. She was a great favourite of his.</p>"

It is said that this mountain discharges a greater quantity of lava than either Etna or Vesuvius, and never ceases roaring ! On the third morning, I was roused by a dreadful noise on deck; when I went up, all was uproar ; at last the captain told me we , were pursued by a Turkish galera ; the crew, instead of working the vessel and endeavouring to escape, were on their knees, each praying to his patron saint ! some one of which, however, was propitious, for a stout breeze springing up, we got close in shore, and lost sight of the terrible galera.

It was represented to her that he had retired with a fine fortune to his estate, in the interior of Calabria, and had declared his determination never to sing again. "" Then"" said the reasonable young lady, "" <em>I</em> declare my <em>determination</em> never to take the veil unless he does. He sang six years ago, when my cousin was professed ; and I had rather die, than it should be said, that she had the first singer in the world to sing for <em>her</em>, and that I had not !"" The fair lady was firm ; and her glorious obstinacy was such, that her father was obliged to take a journey into Calabria, when, with much entreaty, and many very weighty arguments, he prevailed on Cafarelli to return with him to Naples. He sang a <em>salve regina</em> at the ceremony ; and the Signora having gained her point, cheerfully submitted to be led, like a lamb to the sacrifice, to eternal seclusion from the gay and wicked world.</p>
<p>In justice, however, to her taste it must be said, that Cafarelli was one of the greatest soprano singers Italy ever produced. He was a Neapolitan, and the Neapolitans were very proud of him. He amassed a great fortune, and purchased the Dukedom of Dorato for his nephew</p>"

To her astonishment, I answered in the same language, "" You are mistaken, Miss, I am a very proper he animal, and quite at your service !""

There was to be seen the whole population of Rome, high and low, rich and poor,<em> en masque</em> ; the nobility and ladies in their most slendid equipages, all masqued, throwing sugar-plums to the motley groupe below, which was composed of mountebanks, pulcinellas, cardinals, harlequins, &amp;c. with music, dancing, singing. In short, I was in a delirium of pleasure ! Every evening, we visited the theatres : - there are two for serious operas, the Aliberti and the Argentina, where the best performers are always found; indeed, should the manager attempt to introduce any thing inferior, woe be to him ! and, as these theatres are only allowed to be open during the carnival, he is obliged to pay enormous salaries to procure the first singers ; for the Romans will have the best or none. There are also two theatres for comic operas, La Capranica and La Valle. The Romans assume that they are the most sapient critics in the world ; they are, certainly, the most severe ones : they have no medium, all is delight or disgust. If asked whether a performance or a piece has been successful, the answer, if favourable, is, "" &egrave;&nbsp;andato al settimo cielo,"" - "" it has ascended to the seventh heaven."""" If it has failed, they say, "" &egrave;&nbsp;andato al' abbisso del inferno,"" - "" it has sunk to the abyss of hell."" The severest critics are the Abbes, who sit in the first row of the pit, each armed with a lighted wax taper in one hand, and a book of the opera in the other ; and should any poor devil of a singer miss a word, they call out "" bravo, bestia,"" "" bravo, you beast !"" It is customary for the composer of an opera, to preside at the piano-forte the first three nights of its performance, and a precious time he has of it in Rome. Should any passage in the music strike the audience as similar to one of another composer, they cry, "" Bravo, il ladro,"" "" bravo, you thief; or, "" bravo, Paesiello ! bravo, Sacchini !"" if they suppose the passage stolen from them, "" the curse of God light on him who first put a pen into your hand to write music !"" This I heard said, in the Teatro Aliberti, to the celebrated com-poser Gazzaniga, who was obliged to sit patiently at the piano-forte to hear the flattering commenda-tion. Cimarosa, who was their idol as a composer, was once so unfortunate as to make use of a movement in a comic opera, at the Teatro della Valle, which reminded them of one of his own, in an opera composed by him for the preceding carnival. An Abbe started up, and said, "" Bravo, Cimarosa ! you are welcome from Naples ; by your music of to-night, it is clear you have neither left your trunk behind you, nor your old music ; you are an excellent cook in hashing up old dishes !"" Poggi, the most celebrated buffo singer of his day, always dreaded appearing before those stony-hearted critics ; however, tempted by a large sum, he accepted an engagement at the Teatro della Valle. He arrived in Rome some weeks previous to his engagement, hoping to make friends, and form a party in his favour ; he procured introductions to the most severe and scurrilous, and thinking to find the way to their hearts through their mouths, gave them splendid dinners daily. One of them, an Abbe, he selected from the rest, as his bosom friend and confidante ; he fed, clothed, and supplied him with money ; he confided to him his terrors at appearing before an audience so fastidious as the Romans. The Abbe assured him, that he had nothing to fear, as his opinion was looked up to by the whole bench of critics ; and when he approved, none dare dissent. The awful night for poor Poggi at length arrived ; his ficlus Achates took his usual seat, in his little locked-up chair in the pit. It was agreed between them, that he was to convey to Poggi, by signs, the feeling of the audience towards him; if they approved, the Abbe was to nod his head; if the contrary, to shake it. When Poggi had sung his first song, the Abbe nodded, and cried, "" Bravo ! bravissimo"" but in the second act, Poggi became hoarse, and imperfect ; the audience gave a gentle hiss, which disconcerted the affrighted singer, and made him worse : on this, his friend became outrageous, and standing up on his chair, after putting out his wax-light, and closing his book, he looked Poggi in the face, and exclaimed, "" Signer Poggi, I am the mouth of truth, and thus declare, that you are decidedly the worst singer that ever appeared in Rome ! I also declare, that you ought to be hooted off the stage for your impudence, in imposing on my simple and credulous good nature, as you have done."" This produced roars of laughter, and poor Poggi retired, never to appear again, without even exclaiming, "" Et tu, Brute,"" which he might most appropriately have applied to his guardian crony. A circumstance something like this took place at the Teatro Argentina. A tenor singer of the name of Gabrielli, brother of the great female singer of that name, was engaged there. Before he had got through five bars of his first song, the critics began to hiss and hoot, (and very deservedly so, for he was execrable), saying, "" Get away, you cursed raven "" Get off, you Goat !"" On which he came forward and addressed the audience very mildly, "" You fancy you are mortifying me, by hooting me ; you are grossly deceived ; on the contrary, I applaud your judgment, for I solemnly declare to you, that I never appeared on any stage without receiving the same treatment, and sometimes much worse !"" This appeal, though it produced a momentary laugh, could not procure a second appearance for the poor fellow.</p>"

A supper of the most exquisite kind, prepared by the famous Ude, and accompanied by the best wines in the world, together with every luxury of the season, was furnished gratis. The members of the club included all the celebrities of England, from the Duke of Wellington to the youngest Ensign of the Guards ; and at the gay and festive board, which was constantly replenished from midnight to early dawn, the most brilliant sallies of wit, the most agreeable conversation, the most interesting anecdotes, interspersed with grave political discussions and acute logical reasoning on every conceivable subject, proceeded from the soldiers, scholars, statesmen, poets, and men of pleasure, who, when the "" house was up "" and balls and parties at an end, delighted to finish their evening with a little supper and a good deal of hazard at old Crockey's. The tone of the club was excellent. A most gentlemanlike feeling prevailed, and none of the rudeness, familiarity, and ill- breeding which disgrace some of the minor clubs of the present day, would have been tolerated for a moment. Though not many years have elapsed since the time of which I write, the supper-table had a very different appearance from what it would present did the club now exist. Beards were completely unknown, and the rare mustachios were only worn by officers of the Household Brigade or hussar regiments. Stiff white neckcloths, blue coats and brass buttons, rather short-waisted white waistcoats, and tremendously embroidered shirt-fronts with gorgeous studs of great value, were considered the right thing. A late deservedly popular Colonel in the Guards used to give Storr and Mortimer £25 a year to furnish him with a new set of studs every Saturday night during the London season. The great foreign diplomatists, Prince Talleyrand, Count Pozzo di Borgo, General Alava, the Duke of Palmella, Prince Esterhazy, the French, Prussian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Austrian ambassadors, and all persons of distinction and eminence who arrived in England, belonged to Crockford's as a matter of course ; but many rued the day when they became members of that fascinating but dangerous coterie. The gi-eat Duke himself, always rather a friend of the dandies, did not disdain to appear now and then at this charming club ; whilst the late Lord Eaglan, Lord Anglesey, Sir Hussey Vivian, and many more of our Peninsula and Waterloo heroes, were constant visitors. The two great novelists of the day, who have since become great statesmen, Disraeli and Bulwer Lytton, displayed at that brilliant supper-table the one his sable, the other his auburn curls ; there Horace Twiss made proof of an appetite, and Edward Montague of a thirst, which astonished all beholders; whilst the bitter jests of Sir Joseph Copley, Colonel Armstrong, and John Wilson Croker, and the brilliant wit of Alvanley, were the delight of all present, and their bons mots were the next day retailed all over England. In the play-room might be heard the clear ringing voice of that agreeable reprobate, Tom Duncombe, as he cheerfully called, ""Seven,"" and the powerful hand of the vigorous Sefton in throwing for a ten. There might be noted the scientific dribbling of a four by ""Kino-"" Allen, the tremendous backing of nines and fives by Ball Hughes and Auriol, the enormous stakes played for by Lords Lichfield and Chesterfield, George Payne, Sir St Vincent Cotton, D'Orsay, and George Anson, and, above all, the gentlemanly bearing and calm and unmoved demeanour, under losses or gains, of all the men of that generation. The old fishmonger himself, seated snug and sly at his desk in the corner of the room, watchful as the dragon that guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, would only give credit to sure and approved signatures. Who that ever entered that dangerous little room can ever forget the large green table with the croupiers, Page, Darking, and Bacon, with their suave manners, sleek appearance, stiff white neckcloths, and the almost miraculous quickness and dexterity with which they swept away the money of the unfortunate punters when the fatal cry of "" Deuce ace,"" "" Aces,"" or "" Sixes out,"" was heard in answer to the caster's bold cry of "" Seven,"" or "" Nine,"" or "" Five 's the main."" nodes ccenceque detim ! but the brightest medal has its reverse, and after all the wit and gaiety and excitement of the night, how disagreeable the waking up, and how very unpleasant the sight of the little card, with its numerous figures marked down on the debtor side in the fine bold hand of Mr Page. Alas, poor Crockey's ! shorn of its former glory, has become a sort of refuge for the destitute, a cheap dining-house. How are the mighty fallen ! Irish buckeens, spring captains, ""welcners"" from Newmarket, and suspicious-looking foreigners, may be seen swaggering, after dinner, through the marble halls and up that gorgeous stair case where once the chivalry of England loved to congregate ; and those who remember Crockford's in all its glory, cast, as they pass, a look of unavailing regret at its clingy walls, with many a sigh to the memory of the pleasant days they passed there, and the gay companions and noble gentlemen who have long since gone to their last home.

He was remarkably fond of punch, of which beverage I have seen him take copious draughts. He was also fond of billiards, and had an excellent billiard table in his house. Many and many a game have I played with him, but always came off second best. He gave Sunday concerts, at which I never was missing. He was kind-hearted, and always ready to oblige ; but so very particular, when he played, that if the slightest noise were made, he instantly left off. He one day made me sit down to the piano, and gave credit to my first master, who had taught me to place my hand well on the instrument. He conferred on me what I considered a high compliment. I had composed a little melody to Metastasio's canzonetta, "" Grazie agl' inganni tuoi,"" which was a great favourite wherever I sang it. It was very simple, but had the good fortune to please Mozart. He took it and composed variations upon it, which were truly beautiful ; and had the further kindness and condescension to play them wherever he had an opportunity. Thinking that the air thus rendered remarkable might be acceptable to some of my musical readers, I have subjoined it. Encouraged by his flattering approbation, I attempted several little airs, which I shewed him, and which he kindly approved of; so much indeed, that I determined to devote myself to the study of counterpoint, and consulted with him, by whom I ought to be instructed. He said, "" My good lad, you ask my advice, and I will give it you candidly ; had you studied composition when you were at Naples, and when your mind was not devoted to other pursuits, you would perhaps have done wisely; but now that your profession of the stage must, and ought, to occupy all your attention, it would be an unwise measure to enter into a dry study.

The battle is real, and contested with the most inveterate obstinacy, many of the combatants being desperately wounded, and sometimes killed. Surely this barbarous custom is unworthy a civilized nation. Previous to the exhibition of this extraordinary spectacle, Viganoni took me to see the baths, which are considered extremely efficacious in pulmonary complaints. They are admirably constructed, and are visited by invalids from all parts of Europe, amongst whom are many English. While there, a man was pointed out to me, whose head was shaved, and who wore the dress of a galleyslave, sweeping the baths. He did the most laborious work by day, and at night was chained on board a Tuscan galley, which lay in the Arno. This man was the well-known Giuseppe Afrissa, who had visited and been received at all the courts of Europe; and at Vienna, had been in such favour with the Emperor Francis I. and his Empress, Maria Theresa, that he sat at their table, and was appointed Master of the Revels at Schoenbrunn and all the royal palaces ! He was banished from Vienna for some disgraceful act, but not before he had contrived to lose at the gaming-table every shilling of a large fortune, which he had originally acquired there. He returned to Turin, his native place, where he joined with four notorious swindlers, who travelled into various countries, committing forgeries. In England and Holland they were particularly successful. At length Afrissa was arrested in his career at Pisa, by a Dutch merchant, on whom he had committed a forgery to an immense amount; he was tried, and condemned to hard labour as a galley- slave for life. When seized, he w r as in company with one of his associates, a Genoese, who instantly took a small phial from his pocket and swallowed the contents. He died in great agonies. Of the fate of the rest of the gang, I never heard any thing. "

The first performance was "" The Messiah, which I was to open on the Thursday morning. I was to quit town on the Tuesday, but on Monday night I received an order not on any account to leave London, for Mr. Sheridan had sent a peremptory message to have Richard Coeur de Lion performed ; and against his decree there was no appeal. John Palmer, the excellent comedian, was with me when I received the message ; he said to me, "" My valued friend, Richard will be over by eleven o'clock ; if you choose to have a carriage and four horses at the door, you will get with ease to Norwich by twelve, on Thursday, in time to open "" the Messiah. Norwich is the city that first cherished me, and where I married my beloved wife; how I should like to accompany you, if you would give me a seat in your chaise. I said it would make me very happy to have the pleasure of his company. He told me he was perfectly acquainted with every inn on the road, and would write immediately to those where we were to change horses, to have relays prepared for us, that we might not meet with any delay on the road. I was much pleased with the promised arrangement, and wrote to Madame Mara that I should be at Norwich on Thursday in time, requesting her to secure two beds at the Hotel where she was ; one for my friend Palmer, and one for myself. On Wednesday evening, as I was dressing for Richard, my friend Palmer came to me, with the countenance of Joseph Surface, and sighing, said, "" My best of friends, this is the most awful period of my life; I cannot leave town; my beloved wife, the partner of my sorrows and my joys, is just confined."" I said, under such circumstances, of course I could not expect him to leave Mrs. Palmer, but I hoped there would be no mistake about the horses, which were ordered to be ready at each post ; he sat down, and deliberately wrote down the names of all the places where he had ordered them to be in readiness. About eleven o'clock, having merely taken off my Richard's dress, I got into the carriage ; and accompanied by a Scotchman, who was my valet and hair-dresser, rattled off full speed to Epping, where we were first to change, at the inn marked down by my excellent friend ; we knocked and bellowed for Mr. Palmer's horses ; at last out came the ostler ; Mr. Palmer had no horses there ; he had not sent any orders ; nor did they even know who Mr Palmer was. I never in the course of my life experienced a greater disappointment ; in short, all the way down I had to wait for horses, as Palmer had not written to any one of the inns ; however, the road was excellent, and by paying the boys well, I got on at a capital pace without the smallest accident. It was market-day at Norwich, and as I drove in, the good folks stared and wondered to see me getting my hair dressed in the carriage; however, I reached the church-door just as the overture to "" the Messiah,"" was on the point of commencing. I took my seat in the orchestra, opened the "" Oratorio,"" and never was in better voice, although naturally much fatigued. We had two more morning performances in the church, and three evening performances in the grand assembly room. At the conclusion of the festival I returned to town, and when I charged Palmer with neglect and deception, he swore that he had ordered all the horses exactly as he had stated. I thought it of no use to be at variance with him, and pretended to believe him.</p>"

There was also a Mr. Faulkner, who was very kind to me, and who feasted the Florentines sumptuously. Florence is a delightful place to live in ; the climate is pure, the country charming, and the city magnificent. In my time, the Trinita Bridge (the most beautiful bridge in the world, built entirely of white marble, and adorned with four fine statues, representing the Seasons,) was the constant place of resort for serenaders of all descriptions. Every square, street, indeed every corner of this superb city, is filled with statuary, architecture, and paintings, by Michael Angelo, Bandinelli, Benvenuto Cellini, &c. &c. In the fifteenth century, a rich merchant called Pitti, built the fine palace which still bears his name ; but overwhelmed by the expense, he became a bankrupt, and the palace was purchased by the Medici family. It has continued ever since the residence of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. The Dominican church was richly hung with striped silk, red and yellow. The monks of the convent had in it an apothecary's shop, in which they made up medicines of the best quality, and sold them at a very cheap rate : they also sold all kinds of perfumery. The church of St. Marc is a very fine structure ; the remains of the celebrated Politian are buried there. The Casano Wood, something resembling our Hyde Park, is a delightful ride, where the nobility drove their own carriages ; on the holidays particularly, the whole population of Florence assembled there ; and there II Commandatore Pazzi, a nobleman of immense fortune, used to exhibit his coachmanship, driving his phaeton with six cream-coloured horses, which he managed with great dexterity. The Baboli Gardens were much frequented in the evening, and were very beautiful. The peasantry of the environs of Florence are considered rich, and all, in a greater or less degree, gifted with a talent for poetry. No young man would dare to approach his mistress if he were not able to declare his passion in verse, or improvvisare on her beauties ! During my idle time, I went with a large party to Forligani, about twenty-five miles from Florence, in the Upper Val di Arno, to witness the grand festival, in honour of Santa Massinina. It is a curious fact, that for months, sixteen or seventeen thousand of the peasantry are kept in training to represent the story of David and Goliath. They form two grand armies, the Philistines and the Israelites. Their kings, princes, &c. are all dressed magnificently in ancient costume, with ancient martial instruments, &c. on both sides. The programme was very clearly made out, and well executed. The whole of the challenge, David's acceptance of it, his breaking his adversary's head with a stone, and then cutting it off with his own sword, were all performed in very excellent pantomime. After the general battle and route of the Philistines, the Israelites return, and place David in a triumphal car ; his prisoners following, amidst the clang of martial instruments, and the shouts of between twenty and thirty thousand people.

0.0,REMKEL1.txt-723,"<p>My object, while in Paris, was to see all the theatres, and I therefore visited one or other of them every evening. I went, first, to the grand opera, and was delighted with the magnificence of the scenery, decorations, and dresses, and, above all, with their choruses ; in that department they decidedly bear away the palm from every other country the orchestra was most minutely attended to, and more numerous than even that of San Carlo at Naples : but the principal singers (God save them) made a shriek louder than I thought any human beings capable of producing. The opera was Gluck's Iphigenia, which we had performed at Vienna ; but for decorations and effect, Paris beat us out of the field. The chorus and procession, where Pylades and Orestes in chains, were dragged on by Gardel, Vestris, and a host of first-rate dancers, were beyond any thing I could have conceived. I went the next night to the same theatre, and saw the first representation of the grand serious opera of ""Oedipe a Colon ;"" the music by Sacchini, was delightful and enchanting. I there heard, for the first time, the celebrated bass singer, Cheron, who played the part of Oedipe, and sang in a delightful style ; it was quite different from the performance of the night before, indeed I could scarcely imagine myself in the same theatre. I saw, too, the opera of Phedra, and had great pleasure in seeing Madame St. Auberti perform the part of Phedra ; she was a great actress, and when she sang in a demi voice, was quite charming. This unfortunate lady and accomplished actress subsequently married, and with her husband, the Count d'Entraigues, was robbed and murdered by their servant when in England. In this opera I felt much gratified by hearing Monsieur Lais, possessing a fine baritone voice, with much taste and expression ; but his greatest praise, in my opinion, was, that he was very unlike a French singer. The next theatre I visited, was the Francais. Their great tragedians, at the time, were on leave of absence in the provinces ; I had not, therefore, an opportunity of seeing a tragedy, but I was amply compensated by their excellent comedians ; their comic acting is always natural. I saw Mole act the part of Duretete, in Farquhar's Inconstant, admirably. Fleury was inimitable in Le Pupile (the guardian) ; and Madame Contare in Susan, Beaumarchais' Marriage of Figaro, exquisite. Dugazzon was a fine low comedian ; indeed, I thought all the actors good ; but my favourite theatre of all was the Theatre Italien, in the Rue Favart, where French comic operas were performed ; the orchestra was very good, and the actors and singers equally so, a Mademoiselle Renard had a most delightful voice, and was a sweet singer.

To render the ""King"" perfectly happy, one little item was wanting — money. His estates, if he ever had any, had long passed from him, and he had much difficulty in making the two ends meet. When, for economy's sake, he was obliged to retire for a short time to Dublin, he had a very large door in Merrion Square, with an almost equally large brass plate, on which his name was engraved in letters of vast size ; but it was very much doubted whether there was any house behind it. He was a great diner out ; and one spiteful old lady, whom he had irritated by some uncivil remarks, told him that his title was as good as board wages to him. Strange to say, this mauvais sujet was a great friend of the late Sir Eobert Peel, when Chief Secretary for Ireland ; and on one occasion, when they were proceeding in an open carriage to dine with a friend a few miles from Dublin, in passing through a village, they had the misfortune to drive over the oldest inhabitant, an ancient beldam, who was generally stationed on the bridge. A large mob gathered round the carriage ; and as Peel and the Tory Government were very unpopular at the period to which I refer, the mob began to grow abusive, and cast very threatening and ominous looks at the occupants of the barouche ; when* the ""King,"" with a coolness and self-possession worthy of Brummel, rose up, displaying an acre of white waistcoat, and called out, ""Now, postboy, go on, and don't drive over any more old women."" The mob, awe-struck by ""King"" Allen's majestic deportment, retired, and ""the industrious and idle apprentices "" went on their way rejoicing. The "" King "" was not a very good-natured person ; and as he had a strong, inclination to, and some talent for, sarcasm, he made himself many enemies. To give an idea of his "" style."" When the statue of George III. was erected in front of Eansom's banking-house, Mr Williams, one of the partners, commonly known by the name of "" Swell Bill,"" petitioned the Woods and Forests to remove that work of art, as it collected a crowd of little boys, who were peculiarly facetious on the subject of the pigtail of that obstinate but domestic monarch, and otherwise obstructed business. Lord Allen, meetin o-Williams at White's, said, ""I should have thought the erection of the statue rather an advantage to you, because, while you are standing idle at your own shop door, it would prevent you seeing the crowds hurrying to the respectable establishment of Messrs Coutts & Co., close by in the Strand."" The "" King "" did not possess much wit, but no one could say more disagreeable things at the most disagreeable moment. I remember his setting down the late Lady N , daughter-in-law of a celebrated legal functionary of that name, in rather an amusing manner. She was a vulgar Irish grazier's daughter, extremely plain, and clipped the King's English in a vain attempt to conceal a mellifluous King's County brogue.

The post was in an hour to set off for Paris ; so before I went to bed I wrote a letter to Dick England, at that city, informed him of the proposition made to me, and the intention of Mr. B to follow my friend to Dunkirk, and pillage him. I added? that my Quaker friend was an open-hearted, good-natured, unsuspicious Irishman, and entreated him to write to Mr. B -, and lay his injunction on him to avoid following young Sad Boy, and stated that I would wait at Boulogne, at Parker's Hotel, till I received his answer to my letter, which I entreated might be immediate.

When revived for the opening of the season, on the 9th of March 1844, it was supported again by Madame Persiani; Corelli, the new tenor, appearing in the part originally sustained by Conti. Persiani, though now somewhat on the wane, was one of the favourites of the day. Corelli was generally pronounced a pleasant tenor, fitted for the Nemorinos of the stage, and so far an acquisition. But ""Adelia,"" although ""backed up"" by one of the most successful choreographic displays ever witnessed on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, would not, could not attract. It lingered on for a few nights, when it was deemed advisable to bring out the promised opera of ""Zampa,"" even without Fornasari.</span></p>"
0.0,REOPER.txt-830,"It was this cabal, amounting in the little kingdom of the Opera to a revolutionary conspiracy, continually fighting for mastery over the master, which, it will be seen, led the way to the memorable "" secession,"" and to the establishment of a second Italian Opera. From all the evidence afforded by the annals of the theatre at this period, it would scarcely be unreasonable, much less cruel, to suppose that the constant insubordination, the incessant annoyances, and the wear and tear of mind, occasioned by the habitual conflicts between manager and artists, materially hastened the death of M. Laporte. "

That it excited the general enthusiasm awarded to it so lavishly in Italy, cannot be asserted; that it was a failure, may be emphatically denied. The general result of this first introduction of Verdi to the English public was a feeling of hesitation and doubt; or as some one drolly said at the time, the ""Well! I don't know's"" had it!&rdquo; The English are tardy in the appreciation of any kind of novelty, and the reception of Verdi's opera was only in accordance with the national habit. It is well-known that a taste for this composer's music has survived all the opposition of an earlier period, and that he is now generally popular among the musical amateurs in this country. Whatever their intrinsic merits, his operas have achieved a widely-spread success, as pro- vincial theatres and music halls can testify throughout the land; and there can be no doubt that whatever his alleged short-comings in some respects, he has at command passion, fire, and strong dramatic effect.</span></p>"
0.0,REOPER.txt-832,"It is sufficiently well attested that the director Was scarcely allowed a voice in the selection of operas, or even in the choice of the artists to be employed. Opportune ""colds"" and ""indispositions"" had to be accepted as reasons for change of performances and refusal of ""parts,"" whenever it suited caprice, or desire to thwart, on the part of any one of the powerful cabal ; until the term ""singer's illness"" passed into a proverb. This distracted state of government, or mis-government, M. Laporte was destined to leave to his successor as one of many difficulties to be overcome ; and the "" History of a Management "" will have to dwell frequently, and at some length, upon the intrigues of a clique, then generally termed, in operatic . circles. La Vieille Garde. For in assuming the reins of government, he found himself at the very outset obliged to guide a ""team,"" the individuals composing which were always rearing, plunging, and "" kicking over the traces,"" at the imminent risk of upsetting the whole opera chariot at any moment.

It was in those days a rare event for an English singer to venture upon the boards of the Anglo-Italian stage; and the force of fashion and prejudice made the venture one of unusual difficulty. But with his advantages of Italian training and style, Mr. Sims Reeves was entitled to be fairly considered as an Italian singer. He had not only a beautiful natural organ, but expression and passion were at his command, and there can be little doubt that he might have permanently justified the enthusiastic welcome of what might be termed the ""national"" portion of the audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, and might have battled successfully against prejudice, had not difficulties, created by himself, arisen, and caused his secession for the remainder of the season.</span></p>"
0.0,REOPER.txt-834,"Before concluding this chapter, I may be allowed a digression in the shape of an anecdote of Severini, director of the ItaUens in Paris, which will illustrate the tyranny of artists. Severini had occasion to be greatly displeased with Madame Malibran, and animadverted on her conduct in severe terms. The Diva, conscious of her power over the subscribers and the public, and believing that the theatre could not go on vrithouther, observed — "" Sir, if you are dissatisfied vnth me, the remedy is easy. Let us cancel our engagement."" "" Tres bien, Madame,"" replied Severini, drily, and, sending for his "" double"" of the engagement, he requested the astonished Diva to hand over her own duplicate, or counterpart thereof, and having placed one within the other, he coolly and leisurely tore them into pieces. Kossini, whose direction of the music spread a lustre over the establishment, observed to the manager — "" You have sacrificed 100,000 francs a year."" ""That may be,"" said Severini, "" but I prefer to secure my peace of mind."" "

The success of this great singer was necessarily triumphant; and the season, in appearance at all events, could not have commenced under happier auspices. The public is a child in many respects&mdash; in many respects, too, a spoiled child, a very spoiled child. It cried still for its favourite toy &mdash; Jenny Lind. However brilliant the new toy placed before it for its delectation and amusement, it would not take to it as, under other circumstances, it might have done. The favourite image and idol of the last two years was ever in its thoughts. However eminently successful as was the debut of Mademoiselle Alboni at Her Majesty's Theatre, it hardly carried with it that prestige to which it was fairly entitled.</span></p>"

This period, indeed, almost furnishes a clue to the history of my future rule, and must be fully dwelt upon, just as the latter years of a reigning sovereign must in some degree be taken into consideration in any account of the accession of his heir.

She appeared on the 28th of March, in ""Linda di Chamouni,"" and with her now habitual success. The representation offered no novelty, beyond the debut of Mademoiselle Gaetanina Brambilla, a pleasant young contralto, in the part of Pierotto. Though bearing the same name, she was no relation, it was stated, of the more celebrated Marietta Brambula; nor, although in many respects a clever and agreeable singer, did she threaten to rival her fame. Later, however, she made her way in Italy, and was esteemed an excellent Azucena.</span></p>"

The working of the volcano was displayed before the public in an explosion, familiarly known, at the time, as the "" Tamburini row,"" but never understood in all its hidden bearings, except by a very few initiated in operatic matters.

Doubtless there was a great charm in the new version given to the character by the gifted young singer, who made an unextinguished love for the faithless Pollione more conspicuous than the rage of the deceived and slighted woman &mdash; in the bursts of emotion, which were rather those of agonised reproach than of implacable revenge &mdash; in the mournfulness rather than the passion of her despair, and in the tender resignation of her self-sacrifice there shone the great artist. But the English public, ever loyal to their idols, had been accustomed to another delineation of the slighted Druid Priestess. It had long gazed with emotion upon the burning passion, the withering indignation, and the imposing grandeur of Grisi, and could not be taught to relish a new ""treatment."" The interesting picture of womanly devotion, womanly anxiety and suffering, even of womanly forgiveness, as painted by Jenny Lind, however touching to behold, was evidently contrary to stage tradition. Dilettanti disputed, with psychological acumen on both sides, as to the respective truthfulness of the rival impersonations of Grisi and Jenny Lind ; but the public remained comparatively unimpressed. The attempt, in face of a recognised and familiar type, was thought to have been a mistake. At all events, ""Norma"" could hardly be counted among Jenny Lind's unquestionable triumphs.</span></p>"
0.0,REOPER.txt-840," Instinctively aware, probably, of the force and truth of the old parable of the bundle of sticks, the clique of artists had determined that the best way of ensuring to themselves supreme power in the government of the opera, was to found a close coalition, and a conspiracy to "" stick together."" It was resolved that they should announce their determination to resist every effort of the director to vary the composition of the Phalanx, by declaring that not one of them would engage singly — in other words, that M. Laporte must agree to take them collectively, or not at all. The prima donna, who was looked upon as the "" head and front "" of the coalition, had confessed as much to the manager, although she declared that she had reserved to herself the right of acting separately whenever she chose. The plan appears to have been based upon the prospective engagement of all the artists in a body by M. Marliani, on behalf of the Paris Director, a combination which would have compelled M. Laporte to refer and defer entirely to that gentleman. Fully cognisant of this arrangement, worried beyond all powers of endurance, by the annoyances, the obstructions, and the insolence of "" the Cabal,"" M. Laporte had, at one time, determined to commence the season of 1842 with an entirely new company. In one of his extant letters, he writes of his intention to get rid of the "" blessed lot."" Meanwhile, as early as 1840, he resolved upon making a beginning towards breaking up the clique and foiling their schemes, by the non-engagement of one of their number.More than all was the influence of the powerful clique of artists, already mentioned in the preceding chapter, fated to give a direct bias to the fortunes of the succeeding management. The latter period, then, of the Laporte management was a stormy one within doors. The working of the volcano was displayed before the public in an explosion, familiarly known, at the time, as the "" Tamburini row,"" but never understood in all its hidden bearings, except by a very few initiated in operatic matters.

Much credit was due, I had heard, to the talent of this celebrated pupil of the great Paganini, and at once I decided to bring him to England. He was received by the opera-frequenters with admiration, even with enthusiasm. The instrument he played upon was the magic violin bequeathed to him by his dying master, and the fanciful legends of Italy having set afloat a notion that the soul of Paganini had taken refuge in the instrument, the popular ear, charmed by the young artist, listened credulously to the fable. Even in England the press declared that ""Sivori was not Sivori &mdash; it was Paganini restored to another generation in a renovated and younger form.""</span></p>"
0.0,REOPER.txt-842,"The manoeuvres of la vieille garde, which produced this strange and violent result, have yet to be explained. Instinctively aware, probably, of the force and truth of the old parable of the bundle of sticks, the clique of artists had determined that the best way of ensuring to themselves supreme power in the government of the opera, was to found a close coalition, and a conspiracy to "" stick together."" It was resolved that they should announce their determination to resist every effort of the director to vary the composition of the Phalanx, by declaring that not one of them would engage singly — in other words, that M. Laporte must agree to take them collectively, or not at all."

Whether he had been too much hurried in the study of his music, or whether he lacked capacity for his task, poor Felice completely broke down. Fever was failure more complete. The public was not even able to arrive, under the circumstances, at any judgment of the music, and ""Zampa"" was necessarily withdrawn after only one night's performance.</span></p>"
0.0,REOPER.txt-844," The prima donna, who was looked upon as the "" head and front "" of the coalition, had confessed as much to the manager, although she declared that she had reserved to herself the right of acting separately whenever she chose. The plan appears to have been based upon the prospective engagement of all the artists in a body by M. Marliani, on behalf of the Paris Director, a combination which would have compelled M. Laporte to refer and defer entirely to that gentleman. "

All former differences had been amicably arranged with the management, and he came again to assert his true position as one of the best of European tenors. His task was a severe one. He had still to contend with the ill-judged fastidiousness and one-sided prejudice of a class of opera-goers who will never allow any singer, whatever his merits, to be great in his own country. But Reeves accomplished his task with admirable artistic skill, and won his golden spurs in the battle with prejudice in the part of Ernani. His whole performance, dramatic as well as vocal, was one of eminent merit in the opinion of all unbiassed hearers, Parodi was the Elvira of the evening.</span></p>"

Laporte had, at one time, determined to commence the season of 1842 with an entirely new company. In one of his extant letters, he writes of his intention to get rid of the "" blessed lot."" Meanwhile, as early as 1840, he resolved upon making a beginning towards breaking up the clique and foiling their schemes, by the non-engagement of one of their number."

The opera of ""Ernani"" was selected, to enable Madame Pasini, Signor Castigliano (a pupil of Rubini), and Signor Bencich to appear, as soprano, tenor, and baritone, in the principal characters of that opera. All three failed, Signor Bencich alone being voted tolerable. </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> <br /></span></span></p>"

In spite of the quiet charm of Madame Sontag's Susanna, there was an evident unfitness of Mademoiselle Parodi for the part of the Contessa, as well as of Miss Catherine Hayes for that of Cherubino. The latter part requires a contralto, not a soprano; and this chef d&rsquo;oeuvre accordingly flagged, in comparison with those operas which had preceded it. Nor was Coletti, who had been already welcomed back to his post as an old favourite, seen or heard to his customary advantage as the Count.</span></p>"

These, then, were the skirmishers, ready to aid the campaign of a commander who could direct the manoeuvres, although unable to appear openly in the field. For this purpose no better "" Lieutenant "" could be desired than the noble Lord already referred to ; and it is M'ell known that the plan of attack was arranged in the House of Commons, of which he was at that time a member. Thus Madame Grisi, "" like another Helen, fired another Troy,"" by the hands of her allies, who, it is to be presumed, were proud of the rank they held in the encounter. "

This opera had been one of the items of the original programme of the season, but although it had been produced at almost every continental theatre, even out of Italy, it never was calculated to make a favourable impression on the London boards. It made its appearance towards the close of the season, but even had it been brought forward at a more auspicious date, it is questionable whether it could ever have maintained its ground. A heavy opera, based upon a dull libretto, had little chances in its favour with an excitement-seeking London audience, and ""Corrado d'Altamura"" was only performed on one single night.</span></p>"

To judge from the dissatisfaction expressed at the tardiness of Laporte in providing a new and striking ballet for the opening of the season of 1841, and from the bitter complaints of ballet-master and scene-painter that "" they had nothing to do,"" it might almost be supposed that financial success vfas to be built upon the ballet alone."

A few special words must be given to this occasion. Already Fornasari had ceased to hold the supreme position which had been hastily and generally granted him during the previous season, and though he was still enthusiastically received by the general public, a few ""carpings and cavillings"" began to be heard. Doubts timorously indeed were whispered here and there, and it became gradually evident that Fornasari was not exactly the ""conquering hero"" which previous trumpetings had so loudly proclaimed him. In spite of his efforts on this occasion, backed by the advantage of Lablache's name and the singing of Persiani, in spite of the catching melodies, the vigorous chorusses and the dramatic style of Herold, ""Zampa"" failed in establishing itself upon the Anglo-Italian boards. After a very few nights, on which it was lustily applauded, it wholly disappeared from the bills. However, in behalf of the fame of Herold, it should be mentioned that a considerable portion of the frequenters of Her Majesty's Theatre only admitted at this period, as acceptable on its boards, the Italian school, pur et simple, and looked with coldness and mistrust on any names, how's ever accredited, which revealed a French, a German, or, still worse, an English origin.

For some years previously, when once I conceived that I had placed the interests of the opera on a sound financial basis, I had desired to detach myself from occupations which interfered with other and more solid pursuits ; I had been . withheld from putting this desire into practice, solely by the entreaties of Laporte, who protested, that, without my aid as coadjutor, the theatre would relapse into its former state of confusion, and that he himself would be obliged, thus deserted, to throw up all, or expect only ruin and disaster.

""LaFavorita,"" although not entirely new to England, having been already performed at London both in French and English, was new to the Italian boards; and in its Italian form had all the interest of a novelty. Perhaps, thus given as it was with singers far superior to any heard in it in this country, and with a far more correct and powerful ensemble, the opera gained in popular favour rather than lost, through the familiarity of opera-goers with its melodies. Apart from the unwonted interest attached by all the friends and habitues of the long-cherished establishment, to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre in face of the new opposition, considerable sensation was excited by the first appearance on the Anglo-Italian stage of Signor Gardoni. Much had been said of the strange adventures that had befallen the handsome and gentlemanlike young tenor during his brief musical career. His first appearance on the stage raised a battery of opera-glasses from every part of the house; a murmur of gratified expectation followed. The success of Gardoni on this occasion was undoubted. Both his principal solos, sung in the purest taste and with perfect feeling, were encored with enthusiasm. The attraction of his performance was felt by all. Voice, style, and expression were there. His talent as an actor was alone disputed; for these were already days when a singer, however great his merit as a vocalist, was expected (and justly, on the lyrical stage) to be a histrionic artist also. It became the fashion among some dilettanti to say that Gardoni was no actor. Still, even as an actor he was pleasing. His manner, his bearing, his feeling, his conception of parts were blameless. He lacked only one element &mdash; power; he was not capable of bursts of passion.</span></p>"

This communication was followed by earnest solicitations to the same effect from various other quarters. The assignees, as holders of the property, urged me in every way to undertake the concern, on the ground that I was the man most deeply versed in all the complicated affairs of the establishment, and most cognisant of the intricacies of its management. The temptation was great ; but I still hesitated. Not only my earnest desire to devote all my time once more to my profession held me back — there was another consideration that with equal force, probably, deterred me from giving my immediate consent. I could not shut out from my mind the bitter and harassing annoyances to which Laporte had been subjected by certain of the artistes, comprising Grisi, Persiani, Tamburini, and others, composing the so-called vieille garde. The dread of finding myself in a similar position of humiliation and distress was among the gravest of my objections. But the man, not less than the woman, who deliberates, is lost.

On the contrary, an expectation of fresh disappointment hung over the minds of all. Under these circumstances, Baucarde may be said to have taken the town by surprise. According to a current story, young Baucarde had been originally employed in the palace kitchen of the Grand Duke of Tuscany; and, like the celebrated composer Lully, he first attracted the attention of his superiors by his talents for cookery. His manifest vocal advantages caused him to be placed in a position to acquire a sound musical education, and thus to become one of the most agreeable tenors of his time. Nothing was expected, yet great results were achieved. With a charmingly sweet, bnt still robust voice of wonderful extension; with a style wherein the use of the falsetto was at once sparingly and judiciously employed, this young artist won easily upon a public accustomed to give a preference to natural gifts over the display of skill.

After dinner, the weather being warm the party strolled in the garden attached to the Embassy &mdash; Catalani and Jenny Lind talking much together. In the evening, some little embarrassment arose about asking Jenny Lind to sing, because, as no one ever refuses a request made by the representative of majesty, the Marchioness considerately forbore to place the young Swede in a position of difficulty. But Catalani, who was burning vsdth curiosity to hear Jenny Lind sing, perceived that there was some hesitation, went up to the ""Nightingale,"" and asked her with grace and earnestness to oblige the company with a song, adding, ""C'est la vieille Catalani qui desire vous entendre chanter, avant de mourir !"" </span></p>

Jenny Lind's beautiful voice was consequently heard under sensible disadvantage; moreover, she had to sing in a sitting posture instead of standing up. Nevertheless, the many obvious merits of her style, taste, and execution enchanted the Italian ear of Catalani, who sat on the ottoman in the centre of the room, enjoying the rare treat, rocking her body to and fro with delight and sympathy, and murmuring (loud enough to be overheard by Mrs. G, who sat by her side), ""Ah! la bella cosa che la musica, quando si fa di quella maniera !"" &mdash; and again, ""Ah ! la carissima ! quanto bellissima !"" Of course expression of cordial thanks and admiration on the part of all present followed the performance; and before separating for the night, Jenny was good enough to sing one or two more ""arias"" (among which ""Ah! non Giunge"" was included), to the renewed gratification of the interesting ""ex-prima donna.""</span></p>"

I had soon learned to liken the stage before me to a little state, where jealousies, intrigues, and factions Avere constantly called into play ; where the spirit of revolution was ever ready to lift its head, and where the opposition of enemies, with fancied causes for grievance, was ever at hand to crush the embryo of an adverse plan, or strangle it, if maturing towards execution. I had learned at the same time to oppose to these evil elements of anarchy a policy of silence and reserve, and I determined rigidly to abstain from all direct interference in matters not immediately belonging to my own functions. This policy, while it gained for me among the artists the soubriquet oi ""L' Homme Mysterieux"" enabled me to exercise the influence which inscrutal)ility and mystery often do command, especially with the demonstrative and impatient foreigner.

One star shone with too powerful a light in the operatic sphere to allow any other star, however radiant, to sparkle within its legitimate lustre. It was difficult, indeed almost impossible, both for Cruvelli and Tadolini to shed their really bright rays, whilst the great planet Jenny Lind was in the ascendant. Of the two ladies, Cruvelli had the better chance of winning fame in England, since she had commenced her career earlier in the year, before the arrival of the all-absorbing ""Jenny.""

0.0,REOPER.txt-884,"Another advantage which I may flatter myself I possessed, was an innate spirit of order. By virtue of this faculty indeed, my position had been strengthened, long before the reins were placed in my own unwilling hands. The greatest difficulty to be surmounted was the incessant attempt to grasp supremacy on the part of the oft-men^ tioned clique; and I knew, by the sad experience of Laporte, that, whatever might be the inconveniences of firmness, concession to unjust exigences would infallibly lead to further encroaclimeiits and eventual ruin. To resume my narrative. Terms Tvere arranged with the assignees of Mr. Chambers for the rental of the theatre until the sale could be completed. The necessary capital was forthcoming, and the season of 1842 opened under my sole direction. Before entering, however, into the history of my management, it might be well to set in a clearer light the real position which a director of the opera must occupy in England. It has been already observed, that no assistance is afforded to our theatres by Government. Any one designing to enter upon the management of one, especially of the Italian Opera, has to provide capital, to make advances, and to defray his expenses beforehand, trusting to overtake all by a successful season, or rather by a series of such. The man himself should possess the sort of talent and knowledge adapted to the enterprise, and ought like-wise to be endowed with fortitude, hopefulness, patience, and .power of self-controul, coupled with strong health and ability to endure fatigue. Now, supposing a courageous and competent person to present himself in the position of a director, uniting the requisites sketched above, with what feelings do we find him regarded by the theatrical section of the public? The answer will suggest itself to most of those who have had experience of the habits of London society. "

She was to appear as the chief ""star"" of the pre-Easter period, and considerable excitement was awakened in musical circles by the announcement that Pasta's favourite pupil would sustain the character of Medea, one of the parts of that great singer that were most strongly stamped upon the memory of a former generation of opera-goers. So, with the ""Medea"" of Mayer, and Mademoiselle Parodi as the enchantress, the theatre once more opened its doors. That I had been judicious in producing this opera, as a lure to curiosity, was attested by the result. But it never could have been expected to occupy a permanent position on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre. The music of Mayer was of the ante-Rossinian school, and was consequently entitled to the respect of the old opera- goers, who in their early days had looked upon Rossini as a mere tune-maker. But it was not one of the best specimens of the early period of the present century, and it had owed its reputation to the correctness of its cold classicality, and, on the Anglo-Italian stage, to the powerful acting of Pasta. To modern ears it seemed tedious and almost commonplace &mdash; at all events, deficient in the dramatic warmth of later composers. The ""mantle"" of Pasta however, even to the literal acceptation of the word, had descended to her pupil; Parodi's performance created a lively interest, stamped, as it was, with the traditions of the great vocal Siddons of the Italian stage. It was powerful, impressive, and, of its kind, brilliant. The ""cast"" included Beletti and Calzolari &mdash; both sure, steady, and satisfactory singers of another school; Madame Giuliani; and, lastly, a new tenor, Micheli, who made his first appearance as Giasone, but failed utterly to obtain a favourable verdict from the critical audience of ""Her Majesty's.""</span></p>"

Admissions ""gratis"" are sought with importunity by those who can set forth the slightest claim to the favour. Artists themselves show no consideration for the director's purse, but clamour for boxes and tickets for friends without limit. Such is the wide-spreading feeling among the opera-going public, on the opening of a new season. No one thinks of the outlay : but everyone calculates the gains. Who ever expresses pleasure at the thought that the manager is making a profit ? He is, to speak openly, the "" common enemy"" in the eyes of both public and artists. The latter feel injured if he reaps the harvest of their labours, and think he ought to pay them higher ; the public feel displeasure at the prices required for admission, and argue, that, if the theatre ""pays,"" the tariff ought to be lower. Lastly, the difficulties of the director, when they become notorious, excite no compassion. A few rich noblemen tender a certain amount of support, on the understood condition of being allowed to influence the administration ; and when, induced by these flattering hopes of friendly assistance, tlie manager parts with his independence, he becomes powerless to recover his losses, and finally meets his ruin at the hands of the aristocratic ally, who relentlessly presses for repayment out of an empty treasury.

The Sontag once more trod those boards which had been the scene of her early triumphs. The sympathy her reappearance had created was evidenced by the enthusiastic, and it may be said, affectionate reception with which she was greeted by an overcrowded house. The cheering was universal, genuine, unusually prolonged. That she herself should be at first deeply affected, even to tears, at a greeting so heart-felt and spontaneous, was well conceivable. The revival of old memories, at those exciting and once familiar sounds, joined to the thought of the causes which had placed her in that arena, must have moved her pro- foundly. A glance at the box where sate the husband and children for whose sake this great and noble sacrifice had been made, gave her the necessary courage. Sontag subdued her emotion.

It was as the artist alone that she had come to earn the suffrages of the public &mdash; as the artist alone that she desired to be judged. It was to sound judgment, and not to mere curiosity and sympathy, however legitimately awakened, that she appealed. And in that judgment she found her reward. Her return to the stage was one long triumph. </span></p>

Yet the marvel was here &mdash; an unquestionable fact. Her voice was ""as fresh, pure, and beautiful as ever."" Madame Sontag brought back an artistic skill, matured and perfected by the continued study which, since her retirement, had been to her a labour of love. The beauty, which had exercised so great a fascination over an elder generation, was, strange to say, but little changed. It was remodelled rather than effaced, whilst the figure seemed almost untouched by time. The pleasing contour of the face, the beaming and expressive eye, and, above all, the winning smile which formerly had stolen away so many hearts, were all there. Men declared that with the most clear and searching of opera- glasses they could not give her more than five-and-twenty. She was, in truth, a living marvel! And, more strange than all, the Sontag who had been deemed by a former' generation somewhat deficient as an actress (although the most exquisite of soprano singers), was discovered to have warmth, animation, expression, even power, as a dramatic artist! The fascination of her histrionic talent came to be as great as that of her faultless execution. The public is said to be a ""wayward"" creature; but, on the contrary, it is extremely difficult to be moved from prepossessions once formed for good or for evil. Whatever change may supervene in an artist, the public is loath to admit a change into its own formed opinions. Sontag left the stage with the reputation of being ""no actress."" On her return, it was almost impossible to persuade this public, wedded to traditions, that she was (what really was the case) one of the most finished and exquisite histrionic artists.</span></p>"

And be it always borne in mind, that in the case of Italian Opera, the season, properly so called, lasts no more than four or five months out of the twelve. The principal source whence a director derives support, encouragement, and satisfaction in his career, apart from pecuniary profit, is to be found in the character and behaviour of some of the more distinguished artists, with whom the reputation of the opera has been intimately associated. Very many of the great names, which have illustrated the period of my management, are set down on the list of my attached friends and well- wishers. Having called attention to the circumstances that might utterly discourage any one disposed to enter upon the position of an opera manager, it will be a more pleasing task to mention the advantages and accidental aids which fell to my lot in addition to the personal qualifications which are emxmerated above, and which, I flatter myself, I brought to the services of my enterprize. One of these advantages I must especially mention : the professional education which I had gone through, enabling me to comprehend many legal intricacies which, to a "" layman"" (as one may say) would have been a hopeless puzzle. Again a distinct view of liabilities, contingencies, risks, and, on the other hand, of prospective privileges and advantages, was brought more clearly within the scope of my vision than was possible in the case of previous managers. To show that I was not a merely nominal lawyer, but had been sincere in the pursuit of my profession, I may state that, about the time of M. Laporte's death, I published a treatise on ''Parliamentary Practice,"" which became the standard work on the subject, and which, by shewing, in juxtaposition, the clashing rules of the two Houses with respect to private bills, led to their assimilation. I may add, that my respected friend and tutor, Mr. Basil Montagu, dedicated to me a work which he published on the "" Law of Election."" Not to dwell longer upon this point, I will now turn to the social position which I already occupied, and to the friendly consideration shewn towards me by persons of high standing in this country, as well as by distinguished foreigners. Noblemen were not backward in tendering support, and also pecuniary assistance (if such were needed), when it became a question whether I would or would not venture upon the step of taking the opera. And many of the leading men of fashion encouraged me to take it, prompted by the partiality felt for me as the zealous co-adjutor of poor Laporte — now no more. When at length I braced up my courage to the venture, the nobility, headed by a distinguished connoisseur belonging to their order, realized, by rallying round me, the promise which had encouraged my decision. Not only was a liberal "" subscription "" entered into for boxes and stalls for the season of 1842, by the aristocracy and gentry, but the list was graced with the namesof Her Majesty Queen Victoria, theQueen Dowager, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, besides those of many foreign diplomatists and visitors.

He could rarely be induced to talk about himself ; but in his opinions he was firm almost to obstinacy, and a prejudice once formed was as difficult to remove as a liking. In argument he was a close reasoner, and would be either a doughty opponent or a warm advocate. The middle line never attracted him. But at all times he was a true, stanch, and loyal friend. Fortunately, Signor Garcia took a considerable fancy to me. He was fond of discussing politics, but, having little time to read the papers, would generally ask me for the latest news. He openly expressed his disgust with the policy of the Liberal Government of that day, and found in myself a sympathetic supporter of his views."

<p class=""MsoNormal"">My dear Friend: <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In an artist's life every new role is a stage in that <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>long journey toward the summits of art, toward the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>beautiful, the infinite. ''Werther,"" the other night, <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>was for me one of those unanimous successes wherein <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the heart &mdash; the science of causing it to beat in one's audience and before one's audience &mdash; stood in true proportion <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>to every artifice. The true path &mdash; that of emotion &mdash; that <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>goal for which I am striving all my life &mdash; was reached <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>in the presence of a public which did not understand<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the words, but which divined by instinct that my conception of the character arose from that simplicity, that <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>pure, unexaggerated truthfulness which age and maturity alone can confer upon the thinking artist. . . . <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>I am sending you the cuttings from the newspapers<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>here; show them to Harris, who, I hope, will mount the<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>opera for me. Mancinelli conducted the orchestra admirably. Eames and Arnoldson are two adorable little <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>sisters. In a word, I believe that to the cultivated <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>London public, accustomed as it is to novelties, it will <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>come as a delightful surprise. I sing regularly three <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>times every week, and my voice is excellent. At this <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>present moment I am reaching my forty-first performance. Accept, my dear friend, from Edouard and myself, a thousand affectionate remembrances, together <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>with a hearty shake of the hand. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

0.0,GLOVER.txt-904,"THE one believer in the future Drury Lane was its present managing director. He received from Augustus Harris' executors an option which passed through many vicissitudes. It was yearned after by dozens of people, City syndicates, actor, managers, vStock Exchange speculators, et hoc genus omnc. The eleventh hour arrived in due course (time was, naturally, the essence of the option), and although there was no date for completion, he foresaw a crisis imminent, and it duly arrived in the form of a request from the deceased manager's executors that the sum of one thousand pounds would be required in forty-eight tours on account of the purchase, to keep the option alive (this option carried the remainder of Harris' lease and the entire theatre equipment, lock, stock and barrel) . One thousand pounds ! ! ! None of us had it, or knew for the moment where to find it. "

In the earlier year I heard for the first time Anton Rubinstein and Pablo Sarasate, and witnessed the debuts of Etelka Grerster and Gayarre. With the exception of a brief visit in 1876, Rubinstein had not been in London for seven or eight years. I now heard him at the Philharmonic, at the Crystal Palace (where I saw him conduct&mdash; with all the &ldquo;extra"" movements included&mdash; his grandiose but interminable &ldquo;Ocean&rdquo; symphony), and at some recitals at St. James's Hall. He was then in his forty-eighth year, and had attained the fullest measure of his extraordinary powers.</span></p>"

The fine music of this work deserved more enduring success. The cast comprised Mme. Albani, Miss Meisslinger, Philip Brozel, David Bispham, and Richard Green ; but, unluckily, there was a lack of distinction (and distinctness) about the general rendering that was scarcely calculated to engender in aristocratic auditors any particular love of opera in the vernacular.</span></p>"

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Don Jose of Jean de Reszke has been variously criticized. I hold the opinion, however, not <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>only that it was, and still is, a superb embodiment, <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>but that it did a great deal to restore to the character the musical and histrionic value which it had <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>gradually been losing in inverse ratio to the ever-growing prominence of the central figure of the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>opera. For this reason I quote some lines that I <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>penned anent M. de Reszke's impersonation at the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>time: <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">He showed us that it was as easy for one great artist <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>to revive the importance and enhance the interest of a <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>good role as for twenty mediocrities to drag it down to <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the level of their own talent. It goes without saying <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>that the Polish tenor copied nobody's Don Jose in particular. He knew the traditions of the character, just <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>as he learned those of Sir Walter von Stolzing by visiting Bayreuth. He read his Merimee and carefully studied <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>his libretto; but like an artist of individuality and resource, he also thought the part out for himself. The <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>result, curiously enough, was a conception more closely <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>resembling Campanini's than any we have seen since. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>It was free from the melodramatic exaggeration into <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>which other tenors had fallen. Take, as an instance, the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>last act. M. de Reszke did not make himself up like a <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>starved ghost, neither did he rush about like a savage <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>animal in a cage. He looked the picture of despair, and <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>he made his piteous appeal to Carmen with the tone of <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>a man who is yearning for love, not for an excuse to <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>commit murder. When at last driven to extremities, he did not gloat over his revenge nor chase his victim from <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>corner to corner as a cat might chase a mouse. He simply stood at the entrance to the bull-ring, and when <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Carmen made her attempt to escape, he seized his dagger as by a sudden impulse and stabbed her as she was <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>endeavoring to pass him. An instant later he was leaning over her lifeless body in tears, horror-stricken at the deed he had committed. This surely was the true reading of the episode. Nor was it the only scene upon which <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>M. Jean de Reszke, with rare artistic insight, contrived <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>to throw a new and consistent light. He depicted with <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>wonderful subtlety and skill the gradual stages by which <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Don Jose is drawn under Carmen's fascinating influence. Fierce and absorbing passion revealed itself in <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>his facial expression, his gestures, and, above all, the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>thrilling tones of his voice. Never before has the beautiful passage where Jose brings forth the flower that Carmen gave him and tells her how it cheered his lonely <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>prison hours, been invested with such charm of voice and <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>such tenderness and warmth of delivery.</span></p>"
0.0,WESLEY.txt-940,"“This was the beginning of my present practice. Other people’s coming and joining with us was merely accidental. Our lad told his parents: they first desired to be admitted; then others that heard of it begged leave also: so our company increased to about thirty, and it seldom exceeded forty last winter. “But soon after you went to London last, I lit on the account of the Danish missionaries. I was, I think, never more affected with anything; I could not forbear spending [1] good part of that evening in praising and adoring the divine goodness for inspiring them with such ardent zeal for His glory. For several days I could think or speak of little else. At last it came into my mind, Though I am not a man nor a minister, yet if my heart were sincerely devoted to God and I was inspired with a true zeal for his glory, I might do somewhat more than I do. I thought I might pray more for them and might speak to those with whom I converse with more warmth of affection. I resolved to begin with my own children; in which I observe the following method: I take such a proportion of time as I can spare every night to discourse with each child apart. On Monday, I talk with Molly; on Tuesday, with Hetty; Wednesday, with Nancy; Thursday, with Jacky; Friday, with Patty; Saturday, with Charles; and with Emily and Suky together on Sunday. "

A native of Glasgow and educated at The National Training School for Music in London, he might with all fairness have been termed a British product. He preferred, however, to call himself a German, and had not stood upon an English concert platform since boyhood till he appeared at Queen's Hall under Felix Mottl (April 28, 1896), and gave a magnificent performance of Beethoven's E flat or &ldquo;Emperor"" concerto. He had a cold reception, but after he had played it became evident that the old grievances had been forgotten in the presence of a legitimate virtuoso, of a true artist possessing the fire of unmistakable genius. Personally I admire his playing immensely; and as an interpreter of Beethoven, it is upon the shoulders of d'Albert that the mantle of Rubinstein, to my thinking, has fallen. His place as a composer will have to be decided by a future generation.</span></p>"

I do not speak of any concern I am under, barely because so many are present; for those who have the honor of speaking to the Great and Holy God need not be ashamed to speak before the whole world; but because of my sex. I doubt if it is proper for me to present the prayers of the people to God. Last Sunday I would fain have dismissed them before prayers; but they begged so earnestly to stay, I durst not deny them."

Nevertheless, he possessed vocal and histrionic attributes of a very distinguished kind, and chance so willed it that he was destined to ""bridge over&rdquo; to a large extent the interval that separated the final retirement of Mario from the advent (as a tenor) of Jean de Reszke. By birth a Spaniard, and hailing from Pampeluna (the town in which Sarasate was born), Giuliano Gayarre had studied and won his early successes in Italy. He was an exponent of the new quasi-nasal Thirty Years of school of tenor singers, which already had Tamagno for one of its leading protagonists. To my ears his production, on the night he made his debut at Covent Garden (April 7, 1877), sounded strange and not wholly pleasant. Still, the voice traveled well, and he sang the music of Gennaro with so much tenderness, so much charm, allied to genuine dramatic feeling and expression, that the crowded house forthwith accorded him a splendid reception. I declined to join in the general chorus of &ldquo;Another Mario!&rdquo; It struck me as little less than sacrilege to compare with the divine voice of that tenor an organ which could occasionally descend, or ascend, to the utterance of tones that quickly earned the name of the &ldquo;Gayarre bleat.""&nbsp; </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""><br /></span></span></p>"

This was done to bring them to a regular course of sleeping, which at first was three hours in the morning and three in the afternoon; afterward two hours, till they needed none at all. “When turned a year old (and some before), they were taught to fear the rod and to cry softly; by which means they escaped abundance of correction they might otherwise have had; and that most odious noise of the crying of children was rarely heard in the house, but the family usually lived in as much quietness as if there had not been a child among them. “As soon as they were grown pretty strong, they were confined to three meals a day. At dinner their little table and chairs were set by ours, where they could be observed; and they were suffered to eat and drink as much as they would but not to call for anything. If they wanted aught, they used to whisper to the maid which attended them, who came and spoke to me; and as soon as they could handle a knife and fork, they were set to our table. They were never suffered to choose their meat, but always made to eat such things as were provided for the family. “Mornings they had always spoon-meat; sometimes at nights. But whatever they had, they were never permitted to eat, at those meals, of more than one thing; and of that sparingly enough. Drinking or eating between meals was never allowed, unless in case of sickness, which seldom happened. Nor were they suffered to go into the kitchen to ask anything of the servants, when they were at meat: if it was known they did, they were certainly beaten, and the servants severely reprimanded. "

Well-known musicians came from distant parts of the country to be present. It was to do honor to the illustrious violinist whom he had known long years that my own venerable master made the journey from the metropolis&mdash;to witness the bestowal upon him of a distinction similar to that which had already been conferred upon himself as the inventor of the laryngoscope. And never has the Public Orator of Cambridge University employed terms more felicitous or more eulogistic than he contrived to put into his Latin speech in this instance. Dr. Joachim's ""exercise"" consisted of his fine overture in memory of the celebrated poet Heinrich von Kleist, which was played under his own direction. He also gave a superb performance of the Beethoven violin concerto, of which work he is, by common consent, admitted to be the greatest of all interpreters.</span></p>"

True, this was the work of an Englishman; but it was composed to a French libretto and performed by French artists, and it owed its hearing exclusively to foreign influence. Its success, despite the glamour of its picturesque Roman setting, and notwithstanding the art of Heglon, Alvarez, and Renaud, must perforce be described as equivocal. The story at best is revolting; and the music combines with a few fine moments many dull quarts d'heure.</span></pre>"

In each case the general verdict was emphatically ratified.

He was five years old on February 10; the next day he began to learn, and as soon as he knew the letters, began at the first chapter of Genesis. He was taught to spell the first verse, then to read it over and over, till he could read it offhand without any hesitation, so on to the second, and so on, till he took ten verses for a lesson, which he quickly did. Easter fell low that year, and by Whitsuntide he could read a chapter very well; for he read continually and had such a prodigious memory that I cannot remember ever to have told him the same word twice.

As soon as they knew the letters, they were put first to spell, and read one line, then a verse; never leaving till perfect in their lesson, were it shorter or longer. So one or other continued reading at schooltime, without any intermission; and before we left school, each child read what he had learned that morning; and ere we parted in the afternoon, what they had learned that day.

The season of 1885 had been almost wholly barren, and that of 1886 was little better. Incapacity and indifference reached their climax with the disgraceful and humiliating scene that occurred at Her Majesty's Theatre on the night of March 6, 1886. Some unknown person, evidently without experience as a manager, had there started a season of Italian opera with a company of incompetent artists. On the fourth night it completely collapsed under circumstances unprecedented in the annals of opera in a great city. I quote my own description of what occurred. </span></p>

Their claims were partly satisfied, and, after an interval of inordinate length, in the course of which the audience displayed the noisiest impatience, the opera proceeded for another act, with the accompaniment of about half the band. But the crisis had only been deferred. After the curtain had fallen again there was another long ""wait,"" and the disturbances recommenced. At length, in response to deafening calls, the stage-manager came forward and announced that it was impossible to proceed. The stage-carpenters had refused to set the next scene, and the opera could not, therefore, go on. A howl of derision and anger greeted this statement; but the audience, having made up its mind to the worst, was preparing, amid a fearful din, to depart, when the curtain rose once more and a whole army of stage assistants came down to the footlights with outstretched arms and aprons, as though to implore the charity of the house. The gestures were understood, and, with one accord, the remaining occupants of the gallery and upper tiers began flinging a shower of coppers and small silver coins down on to the stage, uttering the while all sorts of satirical and uncomplimentary epithets. However, the occupation was too expensive to last long, and in a minute or two this disgraceful episode came to a termination, ending also a night of horrors that will never be forgotten by those who witnessed it.""</span></p>"
0.0,WESLEY.txt-964,"“There was no such thing as loud talking or playing allowed of; but everyone was kept close to his business for the six hours of school: and it is almost incredible what a child may be taught in a quarter of a year by a vigorous application, if it have but a tolerable capacity and good health. Every one of these, Kezzy excepted, could read better in that time than the most of women can do as long as they live. “Rising out of their places or going out of the room was not permitted, unless for good cause; and running into the yard, garden, or street without leave was always esteemed a capital offense. “For some years we went on very well. Never were children in better order. Never were children better disposed to piety or in more subjection to their parents till that fatal dispersion of them, after the fire, into several families. In those days they were left at full liberty to converse with servants, which before they had always been restrained from; and to run abroad and play with any children, good or bad. They soon learned to neglect a strict observation of the Sabbath and got knowledge of several songs and bad things, which before they had no notion of. The civil behavior which made them admired when at home by all which saw them, was, in great measure, lost; and a clownish accent and many rude ways were learned which were not reformed without some difficulty. “When the house was rebuilt, and the children all brought home, we entered upon a strict reform; and then was begun the custom of singing Psalms at beginning and leaving school, morning and evening. Then also that of a general retirement at five o’clock was entered upon; when the oldest took the youngest that could speak, and the second the next, to whom they read the Psalms for the day and a chapter in the New Testament; as, in the morning, they were directed to read the Psalms and a chapter in the Old: after which they went to their private prayers, before they got their breakfast, or came into the family. And, I thank God, the custom is still preserved among us."

How that purely artificial vogue ever came to extend beyond the walls of the Italian churches no one knows. At least it should have stopped short at Paris, which was as far as the youthful abbe himself contrived to get on his road to London. But for a time the &ldquo;craze"" raged in England with the virulence of an epidemic, and many sane musicians persuaded themselves that the new oratorio composer was a genius of the first magnitude. His &ldquo;Transfiguration"", his &ldquo;Raising of Lazarus,"" and his &ldquo;Resurrection of Christ"" were all performed at the London Musical Festival which Robert Newman started at Queen's Hall in May; while his &ldquo;Passion of Christ"" was given at the Norwich Festival in the autumn. In each instance, however, there was felt a keen sense of disappointment. At best Perosi's works could appeal only to the ear amid ecclesiastical surroundings, and even there their woeful lack of originality was bound to irritate the critical listener.</span></p>"

It is inhabited by colliers only, and such as had been always in the first rank for savage ignorance and wickedness of every kind. Their grand assembly used to be on the Lord’s day; on which men, women, and children met together to dance, fight, curse and swear, and play at chuck ball, spanfarthing, or whatever came next to hand. I felt great compassion for these poor creatures from the time I heard of them first; and the more, because all men seemed to despair of them. Between seven and eight I set out with John Healy, my guide. The north wind, being unusually high, drove the sleet in our face, which froze as it fell and cased us over presently.  When we came to Placey, we could very hardly stand. As soon as we were a little recovered I went into the square and declared Him who “was wounded for our transgressions” and “bruised for our iniquities.” The poor sinners were quickly gathered together and gave earnest heed to the things which were spoken. And so they did in the afternoon again, in spite of the wind and snow, when I besought them to receive Him for their King; to “repent and believe the gospel.”"
