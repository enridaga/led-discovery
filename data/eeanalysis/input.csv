There was a congregation of perhaps three hundred men occupying the lower part of the house, and a few scattering women were seen in the gallery. The men all sit or stand with heads covered; and although four of us Americans took off our hats when we entered, we were told to put them on again, and obeyed orders. There was very little appearance of reverence or solemnity; indeed, none that could be observed. The appearance of the assembly was somewhat like that of a New England town meeting, after having been called to order by the chairman. There was a choir of about twelve or fourteen boys, with men for tenor and bass, and the harmony parts were sung. All the service was chanted, in a responsive manner, by priest or priests, choir and people, with the exception of two airs and melodies, which were sung by the choir. These were both modern, and even the chants did not seem to come from David or Solomon, but were more like the common chant, somewhat modified by a kind of recitative or declamatory manner of utterance. On the whole, the Jewish service here was not one of much interest, considered either religiously or musically.</p>",,

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1439032598718,https://archive.org/stream/thirtyyearsofmus00kleiuoft,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">[In 1877] later Richard Wagner came to London to take part in the series of Wagner Festival Concerts at the Royal Albert Hall, which had been arranged with a view to paying off the debt on the new theatre at Bayreuth...To make matters clear, I must premise that the adversaries and supporters of Wagnerian art in London were then ranged in three distinct camps. There were (1) those who refused to accept his music under any conditions; (2) those who would accept all he had written down to ""Tannh&auml;user"" and ""Lohengrin""; and (3) those who worshiped both at the temple and from afar, accepting and rejoicing in everything. The first of these sections was gradually dying out, or was being absorbed by the second, as the beauty of the operas heard in London within the previous two years slowly but surely forced its way into the heart and understanding of the people...The final rehearsal for the opening concert of the festival took place at the Albert Hall on May 5. Wagner had himself chosen the programmes. He was to conduct each first part, consisting of selections from all his operas, from ""Rienzi"" to ""Tristan""; while Hans Richter, who now made his first appearance in England, was to direct the excerpts from ""Der Eing des Nibelungen"" that formed each second part. Most of the preliminary work had been done under Mr. Dannreuther, in whom Wagner reposed great confidence. All that remained was to give the finishing touches and for the composer-conductor to accustom himself to the vast auditorium and the huge crescent-shaped phalanx of orchestral players spread before him. From the outset, as it seemed to me, he failed to place himself en rapport with either. The abnormal conditions appeared completely to upset him. In a word, he succumbed there and then to a severe attack of Albert Hall stage fright, an illness familiar to nearly every artist on stepping for the first time upon the platform of that gigantic amphitheatre. However, after a glance of astonishment round the empty hall, and a few whispered words to Wilhelmj, and yet a few more to Hans Richter (who was posted beside the conductor's desk), the great man raised his baton and gave the signal for the start. The inaugural piece was the ""Kaisermarsch,"" and it was well chosen for the purpose. Its pompous and sonorous strains, proceeding with stately rhythmical movement throughout, were perfectly calculated to show off the imposing volume of the big orchestra in such a building as that. It gave no trouble, and the effect was superb. But, unluckily, instead of imbuing Wagner with a little confidence, this preludial essay left him more palpably nervous than before. The second piece on the list was the overture to the ""Fliegende Hollander."" Here, I confess, I looked for something exceptional. I had always understood that Wagner was a fine conductor, at least of works with which he was in true sympathy, and I expected his reading of the ""Dutchman"" overture to be in the nature of a revelation. Imagine, then, my disappointment and sorrow when it resulted in a complete breakdown! Twice nay, thrice did he make a fresh start, while Mr. Dannreuther and Mr. Deichmann (the faithful leader of the second violins) took it by turns to translate his complaints and instructions to the orchestra. But it was of no avail. He utterly failed either to indicate or to obtain what he wanted, and at last, in sheer despair, he threw down his stick and requested Richter to do the work for him. Well do I remember the sharp round of applause with which the band greeted the Viennese conductor as he mounted the rostrum. It was thoughtless unkind, if you will; for it must have smote with unpleasant sound upon the ears of the sensitive composer. But the overture went without a hitch. It was played as I had never heard it played before. After this Wagner decided that he would con- duct only one or two pieces at each concert, leaving all the rest to Richter. But would the public be satisfied? They were paying to see Wagner as well as to hear his music. The matter was discussed, and it was suggested, as a compromise, that when he was not conducting he should sit upon the platform in an armchair facing the audience. This course was actually adopted. At each of the six concerts comprising the festival scheme, after he had conducted the opening piece and acknowledged a magnificent reception, he sat down in his armchair and gazed at the assemblage before him with a sphinx-like expression of countenance that I shall never forget.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Albert_Hall
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436262032838,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>The concert on June 12th was noteworthy for the first appearance of Herbert Sims Reeves, son of the famous tenor. When he came on the platform there was such a storm of applause, lasting for at least five minutes, that it quite unnerved him. However, he pulled himself together and sang his first song, which was the recitative ""Nel fragor della festa,"" and the aria ""Alma soave,"" from Donizetti's <em>Maria di Rohan</em>. He sang it extremely well, and was several times recalled, but one could see he was very nervous at the ordeal. His second song was Schubert's ""Ave Maria,"" and his third ""Refrain thy Voice from Weeping,"" from Sullivan's Light of the World, which the composer kindly conducted to give eclat to young Reeves's singing. Herbert Reeves is the image of his father, though somewhat smaller, being short and slender. He had a small tenor voice, but sang with great taste, and, having been well taught in Italy, pronounced his words clearly and well.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

Catalani 
asked me what the meaning of it was ; I answered, that it was nothing but a <br />peculiar manner of applauding.

Only the distant onlooker could perceive how large a place the master was beginning to fill in the hearts of English music-lovers. Failing the opportunity for hearing his complete works upon the stage, they had perforce to be content to hear them, either whole or in part, upon the concert platform. The demand for this kind of thing became remarkable, and it was satisfied by the most conservative as well as the most advanced musical institutions. Imagine two concert performances of ""Parsifal"" (with very few cuts, moreover) being given in London only a couple of years after the first production of that glorious music-drama at Bayreuth! Yet this was actually done in the autumn of 1884 by the Royal Choral Society, under Joseph Barnby, with Therese Malten (the original <em>Kundry</em>), Gudehus, and Scaria in the principal parts. And really the exacting work was very creditably interpreted.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Jenny Lind retired in earnest, not, it is true, from the exercise of her profession, but from the theatrical boards, and this in the very zenith of her powers. Never perhaps during the whole of her career was there an occasion on which she bore away so great a triumph as when she appeared in the true sphere of her vocation for the last time This was a night of even unwonted sympathy and enthusiasm &mdash; a night of applause that seemed to know no bounds &mdash; a night of recalls, and again recalls, and one more last recall, as though the public could not part from her, or bear the thought of never looking upon her again. And so, with such heartfelt adieux, was Jenny Lind finally lost to the stage.</span></p>",,

The one left in April; the other came in May. Within a period of six weeks we heard and saw, for the last time, the two greatest pianists that the world had then known. The leonine Russian gave at St. James's Hall that wonderful series of ""Historical Recitals "" which has since become historical in every sense that marvelously comprehensive cycle wherein he illustrated the progress and development of pianoforte music from its earliest epoch down to the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century. It was, alike mentally and physically, an extraordinary <em>tour de force</em>. No one save Rubinstein would have attempted the Herculean feat involved in the execution of such programmes. What must the task have been for the executant, if the bare labor of listening was an exhausting process! But Rubinstein was a giant, and the considerations that applied to ordinary pianists did not arise in his case. These recitals yielded the largest sum ever taken at St. James's Hall for a series of seven concerts, the gross receipts amounting to &pound;6000 ($30,000). An extra recital was given, and out of the proceeds Rubinstein divided &pound;300 ($1500) among various charitable institutions.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

The songs chosen by the Concordia were both very excellent and popular, a circumstance of much importance to their success.</p>",,

Three years later (October 13, 1877) his rendering of Mendelssohn's violin concerto at the Crystal Palace fairly took the town by storm, and he repeated his triumph at the Philharmonic in the following spring.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Crystal_Palace
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436182942743,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>The concert was under the patronage of H.R.H. Prince Frederick William of Prussia, who married the Princess Royal in 1858, and afterwards became German Emperor. I well remember their marriage, at which I was present, through the kindness of the Countess Bernstorff, who gave me a ticket for a seat on a stand which was erected in one of the courtyards in St. James's Palace, where about seven hundred people were seated. I saw the various court processions and the bridal cortege pass, and heard the music which was being performed at the Chapel Royal. It was an unforgettable occasion.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448709417506,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>At the close of the concert, the most exciting scene perhaps of the whole four days was witnessed, namely, the announcement of the successful competitors in song, and the presentation of the prizes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A half-circle was formed around the prize committee, who had taken seats around the stage just in the rear of the table on which were placed the shining vessels of gold and silver. Amidst the loudest shouts the Burgermeister Hammers ascended the tribune to announce the decision of the judges.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Each of these announcements was received with the waving of banners, the blast of trumpets, the rolling of drums, and the loud cheering of the multitude, which continued while the Mayor took from the table the prize, as it was announced, and handed it to the President of the Society to which it had been awarded. As soon as the cheering would permit, the President of the Bonn &ldquo;Concordia&rdquo; jumped upon the tribune and called for three times &ldquo;Hurrah, and long life and prosperity to the friends in Dusseldorf,&rdquo; to which a most enthusiastic response was given. These ceremonies were all over by about ten o&rsquo;clock[.]</p>

He has already given me 55 and I believe I will receive more than I asked for - which was one for each year I have lived. Gus McLees did the preaching. Wardlaw the singing. We are happy over the results.&nbsp;</p>,,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinton,_South_Carolina"

We stopped long enough to visit the Cathedral, and the Church of St. James, where we heard a part of a mass sung by the priests, with organ accompaniment. The effect was solemn at the early morning hour, but there was nothing in the performance peculiar, or differing from what one hears in all Roman Catholic places.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antwerp
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436281535809,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>Wagner did not allow any of the artists to bow their acknowledgments at the end of each act ; he allowed it only when the opera was finished (I think quite rightly too), and it was but natural that when they did appear the audience applauded them enthusiastically. I also remember that, in the intervals between the acts, the principal male singers sat in their costumes outside the stage door, at the back of the theatre, refreshing themselves with Bayrisches Bier (Bavarian beer) a very curious sight ! The audience also had a chance of refreshing themselves during the intervals, which were very long, lasting one hour. Special restaurants were built in the grounds of the theatre; they were thronged by a hungry and thirsty crowd, and one had great difficulty in being served. Dr. Hans Richter conducted the Trilogy, and he performed a great feat in conducting them without having the score before him, entirely from memory, such a thing having never been done before in the musical world. I have already mentioned that my father conducted the classical operas by heart, but this was child's play compared with Dr. Richter's accomplishment of conducting the difficult and complicated music, vocally and instrumentally, of the Ring, and in those days it was extraordinary that a work so intricate and difficult should be memorised by one man. Dr. Richter, like the members of the orchestra, was in his shirt-sleeves as the heat was so great.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bayreuth

Yet this was actually done in the autumn of 1884 by the Royal Choral Society, under Joseph Barnby, with Therese Malten (the original Kundry), Gudehus, and Scaria in the principal parts. And really the exacting work was very creditably interpreted.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Then again, under Anton Seidl 's magic wand, the performance touched at all points a very high level of excellence. Finally, I derived immense pleasure from the novel sensation of hearing Jean and Edouard de Reszke as exponents of Wagner's own text. Their conscientious enunciation of each syllable, their accurate diction, and their admirable accent seemed to impart an added dignity alike to the music and to their impersonations. Even the more cultivated listener might easily have imagined them to be native German singers. Mme. Nordica, too, handled the German words with remarkable facility and confidence. Altogether, it was a most meritorious achievement.</span></p>",,

In the part of Amina, in ""La Sonnambula,"" she surpassed all previous expectations. In simplicity, tenderness, and grace, in perfect impersonation, these qualities being combined with exquisite delivery of the music, she was universally declared to have beaten all her compeers ""out of the field."" Not only was she the Sonnamhula, but Amina was generally looked upon as the culminating point of her unprecedently successful season. Ably seconded by Gardoni, she stamped the part as her own, and threw a fresh charm over an opera, always beautiful, it is true, but yet ""hackneyed"" to the last degree.</span></p>",,

A year or so later she married a well-known traveler and writer, Baron Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg. It was in 1880 that she joined the Carl Rosa troupe, and appeared at Her Majesty's in ""Lohengrin,"" ""Aida,"" and ""Mignon"" when these operas were given for the first time in English; also she made an admirable Katharine in Goetz's ""Taming of the Shrew."" In Wagner's opera she was ably supported by Herr Anton Schott; in ""Mignon,"" by that admirable singer, Joseph Maas, the best English stage tenor since Sims Reeves. In fact, these were all representations of the rarest excellence; and they all threw into a strong light the singular versatility of Minnie Hauk, who could bring out the poetry of Elsa or the deep passion of Aida as completely as she could the diablerie of Carmen or the petulant tempers of Mignon and Katharine.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Jean de Reszke, who received the cross of the &ldquo;RVO&rdquo; (fourth class) after a performance of &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; at Windsor Castle on the Queen's eightieth birthday. May 24, 1899.

To begin with, only the first and third acts of &ldquo;Lohengrin"" could be given. There was hardly time to include the second, as these royal functions do not commence until nearly ten o 'clock at night. The plot, however, was fully explained to the Queen, who had never heard Wagner 's opera, and the temptation of Elsa (Mme. Nordica) by the perfidious Ortrud (Mme. Schumann- Heink) and her spouse (David Bispham) was easily &ldquo;taken as read&rdquo;. Mancinelli conducted, and everything went capitally until the fall of the curtain. Her Majesty then retired to one of the drawing-rooms and requested that the principal artists be presented to her, together with Mr. Maurice Grau as managing director of the Royal Opera. The awful discovery was then made that neither Jean nor Edouard de Reszke had with him any but the operatic garments in which they stood. It was the first time that the brothers had ever appeared in opera before the Queen, and, not knowing that it was usual to don evening dress for the subsequent presentation, they had clothed themselves as Lohengrin and Heinrich der Vogler before leaving London, and had traveled to Windsor in dark cloaks of sufficient amplitude to conceal themselves from the gaze of an inquisitive Cockney crowd. The situation was duly explained to Her Majesty, who laughingly declared that it did not matter in the least; for once court etiquette should be disregarded, and the two artists brought before her in their picturesque stage attire. The command was forthwith obeyed, and the Queen, in course of conversation with the brothers, &ldquo;expressed the delight that it had afforded her at last to hear them in opera and listen to the beautiful music of Wagner's work&rdquo;.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windsor_Castle

When Miss Wilson appeared at Drury Lane Theatre, in ""Artaxerxes,"" Mr. Elliston wished me to hear her, and give him my opinion of her. I was, at the time, too ill with the gout, to be able to attend the theatre. My old and valued friend, Madame Mara, was then in London. I wrote to her to call upon me, and requested her to go and hear Miss Wilson, to give me her true and candid opinion of her abilities, as I could not go myself; and after the performance, to return to me, and make her report ; which she did, and a favourable one it was.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

It is a very difficult task to enter upon the subject of this once admired basso. His first appearance in Donizetti's ""Belisario"" was justly hailed with rapture. Day after day the critical notices of the press teemed with eulogiums of the strongest kind. The unanimity of the critics was wonderful. Nothing was to be seen but the most abundant praise of his ""admirable voice,"" his perfect execution,"" his ""great dramatic genius,"" his ""wonderfully handsome person."" No such debut had been witnessed, they all assured the world, in the memory of man; and points in acting were noted as traits of noble genius, of which the artist himself was ignorant. ""Words of sufficient superlative import could scarcely be found to proclaim his triumph. He was ""the great success of a successful season."" So spoke the almost unanimous voice of the press, and I am bound to admit that the success of Fornasari in ""Belisario,"" and some other parts, was unquestionably great. His looks, stature, costume, and ""make up,"" rendered him the beau ideal of the victorious Roman General in the first act. No painter could have represented a personage more admirably calculated to satisfy the imagination and secure the sympathies of the spectator. As soon as he appeared the audience seemed struck as by an electric shock, and a genuine burst of applause, speedily warming into enthusiasm, recognised and welcomed the artist.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

But it was a very pleasant time. One of my fellow guests was Dr. Stone, a wellknown amateur who played the contra-fagotto* at the Festival, and we made a good deal of music at the Deanery. Dr. Stone's instrument was an enormous affair (Santley once told him that it resembled the stand-pipe at Chelsea Waterworks!). We arranged a duet for contra-fagotto and piano, the theme being that of the well-known round, ""Three blind mice."" Stone played the tune at an incredible depth, and my part was to demonstrate the scamperings of the mice. The composition had a great success. It was never printed, nor do I think there is any record of its performance in the annals of the Festival.</p>",,

Then, however, she was just approaching the tragical climax of her brilliant career. When I first heard her, at one of the general rehearsals for the festival of 1866 (some eight years after her debut in England), her voice was not only fresh, powerful, and penetrating, but it possessed in a greater degree than then that sympathetic charm&mdash;that curiously dramatic &ldquo;human"" quality&mdash;which was perhaps its most notable attribute.</span></p>",,

On the 22nd of September it opened, under John Kemble's management, with a prelude written by Cobb, for the occasion, called "" Poor Old Drury,"" ""The Haunted Tower,"" and "" The Pannel;"" the prices were raised, the boxes to six shillings, and the pit to three and sixpence. The doors were not opened at the hour announced in the bills of the day ; the crowd was immense, and when they entered the house, they could not find their way to the different places; all was hurry, bustle, and confusion. The prelude began with Palmer and Parsons, who attempted to address the infuriated audience in vain; they were obliged to retire; the manager was called for, and Kemble came forward ; a paper was given to him from the pit, stating, that the cause of their disapprobation was the delay in opening the doors, and the great inconvenience of the passages. Kemble stood the fire well, and assured them, those inconveniences should be remedied on the next evening's performances. The storm then ceased; the handing up the paper (which was done by a friend of the management) was a lucky ruse, and did great credit to the projector, General John Kemble himself. The prelude contained some comic points, alluding to the size of the Opera House, compared with Old Drury, and some beautiful scenery, particularly Mount Parnassus, by Marinari. ""The Haunted Tower"" followed: I had to sing the first song. I was in good voice, and it filled the theatre well, which was by far the best for sound I ever sang at, not even excepting St. Carlos, at Naples. All the performers were welcomed with applause, and Mrs. Jordan, in the afterpiece of "" The Pannel,"" came in for a great share of it. Madame Mara was prevailed upon to perform for a few nights, and Artaxerxes was got up for her in great style. Kemble at this time had to fulfil an engagement which he had previously made at Newcastle. Mrs. Siddons and Mrs. Jordan were also going away, and Signora Storace was confined with severe illness ; all this crippled the theatre very much.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haymarket,_London"

The Processional anthem ""I was glad"" made a splendid effect, the Westminster boys' ""Vivats"" coming in with superb effect. And they had an extra chance also, for in consequence of His Majesty the King not entering the Choir until some time after Her Majesty the Queen, the ""Vivats"" had to be repeated. It was here that the value of Dr. Borland's system of signals, already referred to, was fully revealed, and my precaution in adopting them amply vindicated. The signals to the choir and band worked admirably, and I must add that Dr. Alcock (now organist of Salisbury Cathedral) at the organ extemporised so effectively that the whole affair, which might have proved an awkward moment if not a catastrophe, passed off as if it had been rehearsed as a part of the programme. Sir Walter Pariatt sat on the conductor's platform with me, taking his share in conducting the orchestral music and directing the performance of his own anthem. Concerning my Homage anthem no cut was necessary. The aged Archbishop Temple was a little slower over the ""Homage"" than we had anticipated, the music in its entirety being required to accompany this picturesque function. A striking feature of the ceremony was the Procession of the Regalia, which formed an early and interesting item in the day's proceedings. The Abbey clergy charged to bear the regal symbols from the Jerusalem Chamber into the Church were accompanied in procession by the choir. Traversing the Cloisters, singing the hymn ""Rejoice to day with one accord,"" to the grand old tune ""Ein' feste Burg,"" a pause was made for a short service in Edward the Confessor's Chapel, and another pause near the Chapel of Henry VII., while Tallis's Litany was sung as above described; then, supported by two trumpets and three trombones, the procession was resumed, to the strains of ""O God, our help in ages past.""

"" Decidedly, Sir,"" was the reply; ""we are both fully convinced of the correctness of your statement.""

Her welcome of the 4th of May previous could scarcely have been surpassed in the amount of rapture and enthusiasm to which a great theatre could give vent; but yet it was almost ""o'ertopped"" by the tumult of applause, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs, and the long protracted lingering, and still lingering cheer which bade farewell to the great singer on this night. The curtain at last fell on Jenny Lind, and in falling, closed a season of unexampled interest.</span></p>",,

It had many comic incidents, smart <br />dialogue, and some sweet songs. One called ""The Spartan Boy,"" was truly poetical; <br />the piece was performed a number of nights, and was much liked. Colman grounded <br />it upon a French comic opera, entitled ""Les Evenemens Imprevus,"" one of the <br />pieces I had brought with me from Paris. The author of the French drama, strange <br />to say, was an Irishman of the name of Hale, an officer in the French military <br />service ; all his songs were versified for him, as he could not compose French 
poetry, though he furnished all the subjects.</pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

She made <br />her first appearance in the serious opera of ""Ferdinand in Mexico,"" by Nassolini, <br />a charming composer ; and in the month of May, Winter composed, expressly for her, <br />the opera of "" Calypso,"" the music of which she sang delightfully, and looked the <br />character divinely. </pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

""Roberto il Diavolo"" was duly licensed, and the eventful night arrived. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">Rarely was ever seen such an excitement even at that focus of excitement &mdash; Her Majesty's Theatre. The crowd at the doors might have led to the suspicion of an emeute, in a capital less orderly than London; and the struggle for entrance was violent beyond precedent &mdash; so violent, indeed, that the phrase, ""a Jenny Lind crush,"" became a proverbial expression. Nor was this crowd the result of a hasty gathering. From an early hour in the afternoon, the Haymarket became so thronged as to be impassable to pedestrians. As for the file of carriages, it seemed as interminable as it was dense. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">The brilliant appearance of the house inside was increased by the presence of the Queen and Prince Albert, the Queen Dowager, and Duchess of Kent, who had all come to witness the debut of Jenny Lind. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">On the entrance of the new prima donna as Alice, the welcome given to one who, though unknown, had already won renown, was unusually enthusiastic. For a few moments she appeared bewildered and ""scared,"" but her self-possession returned. Her very first notes seemed to enthral the audience. The cadenza at the end of her opening air &mdash; the whole of which was listened to with a stillness quite singular &mdash; called down a hurricane of applause. From that moment her success was certain. The evening went on, and before it ended Jenny Lind was established as the favourite of the English opera public. Voice, style, execution, manner, acting &mdash; all delighted. The triumph was achieved. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">At the end of the performance, the Queen, who during the entire evening had repeatedly manifested her extreme satisfaction, expressed to me her admiration in a tone and manner that showed how deep an impression had been made upon her. ""What a beautiful singer!"" ""What an actress!"" ""How charming!"" ""How delightful!"" Those were the exclamations that fell from the lips of Her Majesty, whom I had never before seen thus moved to enthusiasm.</span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436195369775,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>I first knew Joachim when I was a boy of sixteen; I met him at a soiree given by Balfe at his house in Bruton Street. I remember that, on one occasion, when he played the ""Kreutzer Sonata"" with Anton Rubinstein, at one of Ella's Musical Union Matinees, he was very angry with Rubinstein for taking the last movement at such a terrific rate, and said he would never play it with him again. I was present at the time, and I think Joachim was quite right. Rubinstein was of such an exuberant disposition that he really could not help himself, and was carried away by his enthusiasm.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436280456835,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>The Wagner Concerts at the Albert Hall were composed entirely of his works, and he conducted the first part of the programme himself. Unfortunately, he was no longer at his best, and had lost something of his great skill as a conductor. The second part of the Wagner programme was conducted by Dr. Hans Richter, who, when he mounted the conductor's desk, was received most enthusiastically by the members of the orchestra. That was Richter's first appearance in London, and everybody knows what a wonderful career he has had during so many years of activity, and how greatly he has improved orchestral concerts not to mention his numberless performances of Wagner's operas at Drury Lane Theatre and Covent Garden. The singers engaged for this festival were principally those who sang in Wagner's operas in Bayreuth. They were Frau Materna, Herren Scaria, Grimm, Schloesser, Unger, and others.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Albert_Hall

Mademoiselle Lind returned to her wonted triumphs (as did the theatre to its wonted ""crushes""), by resuming the parts in which now, as heretofore, she was sure to be rapturously hailed by the public. To these was added the Susanna of the ""Nozze di Figaro,"" to which character she brought not only her customary and recognised qualities as an accomplished singer, but the true Mozartian traditions. With these her early training had rendered her familiar, and subsequent study had confirmed the lesson. It was new to the public to listen to a singer so thoroughly imbued with the genius of Mozart, in one of his chefs d'oeuvre. Unlike many Italian singers, who considered that, in faithfully executing Mozart, they sacrificed themselves to the exigencies of an old- fashioned English predilection, Jenny Lind revelled in her music. Her whole soul was in the work.</span></p>",,

His success in this character (for which indeed he had been expressly engaged) was as great as it was merited, although his pronunciation of the Italian language was defective. He was proclaimed the Bertram of the Italian stage, as he had been of the German, Still it was impossible for him to occupy his merited position in the operatic ""talk"" of the day, when the public mind was wholly and exclusively absorbed by one object &mdash; Jenny Lind.</span></p>",,

There is but one place where a good choir is sustained, namely, the &ldquo;Chapel of All Saints.&rdquo; This a beautiful building, about one hundred and fifty feet in length, ninety in width, and seventy in height. There are a number of fine carvings ; and the whole interior is finely covered with fresco paintings, on a gold ground; so that the appearance, as one enters the building, is very splendid. We attended at this chapel on two occasions, on each of which high mass was performed, viz., Ascension-day and the Sabbath morning following. The music on the first day was by the director, Aiblinger, well known as a composer of Masses, Motets, &amp;c. The choristers numbered about twenty-four, or six voices on a part, being composed of the best professional vocalists, or opera singers, in Munich. The organ was well played, but never as an accompaniment, as the vocal music was without any accompaniment whatever. There was, in the performance of this choir, all the full, dear, and certain delivery and union of vocal tones that the most fastidious critic could desire; though less of the crescendo and diminuendo than in the Dom choir at Berlin; but in one respect, the Munich choir had a great advantage, &mdash; the Soprano and Alto parts were sustained by femail voices. Consequently, there was a fulness, richness, and maturity of voice, and a blending in the chorus; neither of which can be obtained in choirs where boys sing the Soprano. There is a disagreeable effect always resulting from the predominance of boys&rsquo; voices in a choir. The attempt to unite them with adult voices, is like the attempt to mix oil with water; they will not coalesce.</p>

I looked out at the window, and saw a crowd of people at my door, and, in the middle, a man with a book in his hand. At first, it appeared to me a comical business; but, at last, I was astonished to see, that in a civilized country they should allow such cruelty, as to make game of a poor unfortunate creature, whom I took for a lunatic; and, if Mr. Crump had not acquainted me with the contrary, I should have remained in the same idea. He told me the man was a methodist [...] I did not wait for the conclusion of his chapter, but departed from him, and took my station in the street, to listen to the Methodist preacher. But, as I happened to make my appearance when they were singing a hymn, I caused a discord in their tune, by giving a sudden turn in their inspiration. As soon as they observed me, they all crowded to the place where I was, and left their pastor, with his book in his hands, to conclude the duty by himself.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ballinasloe

He has now a worthy successor in Signor Sammarco, the most admired baritone at Covent Garden.

As a matter of fact, however, Seidl scarcely had an opportunity of displaying his powers in London as a concert conductor. His appearances there were solely in connection with opera&mdash; the &ldquo;Nibelungen "" performances at Her Majesty's in 1882, and the German representations at Covent Garden in 1897. In the course of the latter I saw him frequently, and one night he accompanied me to a Richter concert at St. James's Hall. He had not seen his great Viennese rival upon the platform for many years, and was especially curious to hear his rendering of Tschaikowsky's &ldquo;Pathetique "" symphony. He was delighted with every feature save one. Directly after starting the second (5-4) movement, Richter laid down his baton and allowed the band to proceed without guidance to the end of the piece. Seidl knit his brows and looked stern, but did not utter a word till the room was ringing with applause. Then he turned to me and said: ''I wish he had not done that. It was to show that, in spite of the awkward rhythm, his men could keep perfectly together without the beat, and maintain the necessary precision all through the movement. So they did; but the result was a very machine-like performance. It was much less crisp and animated than it would have been if Richter had conducted it with his arm as well as with his eyes!'</span></p>",,

I conducted the concert, and had a small orchestra, and Madame Nellie Armstrong (that was her real name in those days, as she adopted the name of "" Melba "" later on when she appeared in opera in Brussels and at Covent Garden) sang the two songs which I had heard at my house, and she was encored in both of them.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Mademoiselle Lind returned to her wonted triumphs (as did the theatre to its wonted ""crushes""), by resuming the parts in which now, as heretofore, she was sure to be rapturously hailed by the public. To these was added the Susanna of the ""Nozze di Figaro,"" to which character she brought not only her customary and recognised qualities as an accomplished singer, but the true Mozartian traditions. With these her early training had rendered her familiar, and subsequent study had confirmed the lesson. It was new to the public to listen to a singer so thoroughly imbued with the genius of Mozart, in one of his chefs d'oeuvre. Unlike many Italian singers, who considered that, in faithfully executing Mozart, they sacrificed themselves to the exigencies of an old- fashioned English predilection, Jenny Lind revelled in her music. Her whole soul was in the work.</span></p>",,

Different choirs had contended for a prize which had been offered for the best vocal performance, and the news had already arrived that a choir from this place had been the winners; and the multitude had assembled to give them due honors and a cordial reception on their return home. They came soon after, but unfortunately a violent shower of rain prevented the procession through the principal streets that had been intended. But it did not prevent the performance of Mozart&rsquo;s Don Juan, which was given in a very respectable manner in the evening.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aachen

His acting and singing pleased me so much, that I wrote the next day to Mr. Arnold, recommending him as a most promising subject, more particularly for his own theatre, the English Opera House; and strenuously advised him to engage Harley without delay. By return of post, I received Mr. Arnold's reply, enclosing his proposals for an engagement, which Mr. Harley accepted. The rapid strides he has made, and is still making, in the good opinion of the public, and his employers, prove that my early opinion of his merits was not without foundation; and I am happy to have been, in some degree, instrumental in introducing so useful an actor, and worthy a young man, to the London stage. He made his first appearance in London, at the English Opera House, on the 15th of July, 1815, in the part of Marcelli, in the opera of ""The Devil's Bridge.""</p>",,

The church contained a good-sized organ, which was indifferently played. There was no choir. The organ led, and was followed by a very nasal precentor&rsquo;s voice, with a few of the congregation joining in humming under tone;- one of the worst specimens of Congregational singing we have heard, yet interesting by association, for it carried us in imagination to our home country (beloved) where we have sometimes heard similar attempts. At this, and the associate churches, the old psalms of Clement, Marot, and Theodore Beza, with the tunes originally set to them, are still sung. But the tunes have recently been much injured, nay spoiled, by a rythmical arrangement by Wilhelm. He has introduced dotted notes, which, with other things, makes them so difficult, that a congregation cannot keep together in singing them.</p>",,

Increased prices, crowded houses, wreaths, bouquets and showers of flowers, greeting her whenever she appears, all testify to the high stand which she takes as an artist I have repeatedly seen her recalled after singing, three times, and even then the delighted multitude were hardly satisfied.</p>

On my taking the first cup, I heard a bell passing in the street, of which I did not take any notice, till it approached the door of Mr. McMahon; upon which I instantly made the sign of the cross, and bent my knees; from which circumstance, he and his friend (a comedian who was in company) immediately knowing me to be a stranger in the country, determined to amuse themselves at my expence, and accordingly, they began their devotions. The bells in the street never ceasing, we of course continued our prayers, till at length I observed the countenance of the comedian most wonderfully distorted, as if he had received a paralytic stroke, or got some disorder in his body, causing the most horrid grimaces. I endeavoured in vain to resume my cup of coffee; for, no sooner had it reached my lips, than tinkle tinkle again went the bell; down I dropt on my knees, and I could not finish a single cup. At length, I was induced to enquire into the reason why so many priests were employed in the streets; and you will imagine, that the answer did not prove at all satisfactory to me, when Mr. McMahon informed me, that I had arrived just at the commencement of the plague, and that the whole town was in a state of grievous desolation and trouble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst I was listening to this information, the comedian was rehearsing his part of the joke in an adjoining room, and began to cry out, in the most piteous tones, ""Lord have mercy upon us, there are four fallen down dead in the street;"" and made the sign of the cross with such contortions, that he appeared to me to be possessed with a devil. but when I observed the wonderful change in his countenance, I concluded that he was affected by a spasmodic complaint, and I repeatedly requested him to send for a doctor; but whilst I was speaking, the bell again began; our prayers of course followed; and I immediately declared my determination of quitting the town, since I was not yet in a hurry to join the dead. [...] He concluded with intreating me, no more to regard the bells that I heard, which only served to announce the postman's passing by. Although this information composed my mind at the moment, yet it was a considerable time before I became perfectly familiarized to the sound of the bells. At length, however, by habit, and with the well-timed raillery of my friend, I became as reconciled to it as the English themselves.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haymarket,_London"

To this drama, also, I composed the music. Elliston was the representative of the merry monarch, and it was an excellent piece of acting. Connected with my recollections of this play, is an anecdote relative to my deceased friend, Lady Hamilton, so characteristic of that talented, but unfortunate woman, and at the same time so demonstrative of her warmth of feeling, that I cannot suffer it to pass unrecorded. I had composed a plaintive ballad in the second act, for a Miss Wheatley (formerly a pupil of Attwood's), who possessed a fine deep contre alto voice: the poetry was descriptive of a warrior, who had fallen in recent battle. Upon the fifth representation of the new play, Lady Hamilton, with a party of friends, occupied one of the stage-boxes, appearing all gaiety and animation. Scarcely, however, had this ballad commenced, when she became tremulous and agitated; and at its conclusion, upon the encore being loudly demanded, she exclaimed, ""For God's sake, remove me I cannot bear it.""

Among other arguments to draw her from her purpose, I told her what happened to Mombelli, one of the first tenors of his day, who lost all his well-earned reputation and fame, by rashly performing the part of a lover, at the Pergola theatre, at Florence, in his seventieth year, having totally lost his voice. On the stage he was hissed ; and the following lines, lampooning his attempt, were chalked on his house-door, as well as upon the walls of the city : ""All' eta di settanta, Non si AMA, ne si CANTA.""

It was not entirely due to common interests in life or a similar outlook; it seems rather to have grown gradually, each man finding that the tastes of the other interested him and were worth acquiring. For instance, Southwell's idea of music at the time was musical comedy; White introduced him to Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, and there was an amusing discussion one night when Southwell complained bitterly that 'no one had told him of these men before', whilst he was wasting his time at Oxford with musical comedy music.

Before being very long at the Abbey it fell to my lot to play the Dead March in ""Saul."" I played it as I had heard Hopkins and other musicians play it, but to my surprise found that the Dean was much disappointed by my performance. I took the opportunity of seeing him and asking him what was wrong. He said it did not sound like the Dead March in ""Saul"" which he had been accustomed to from Turle, nor at all like the Dead March as played by Dr. Buck, of Norwich, which he had heard some thirty years before. I could not help replying that I did not suppose it did sound like Dr. Buck's performance, as I had never heard that Dr. Buck was a capable organist, although an admirable teacher of boys, but promised to take the opportunity of asking Turle what his particular version was. This I did, and soon found that it included the introduction of some remarkable drum effects, which I had somewhat modified.then told the Dean that if he would come and hear me, I would play it again. He came into the Nave one evening, when I gave him a supply of drums far exceeding whatTurle had done (I must admit for that occasion only), and he wrote me a note saying he was quite satisfied. Since then I have played the Dead March many times, and fancy I am somewhat celebrated for my drum effects, although these, I am afraid, are not approved by some of my brother organists.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

The visit of Her Majesty had been expected. The opera house was filled in every part to overflowing; and on the entrance of the Queen the expression of enthusiasm was electrical. The whole audience rose to its feet, and one loud deep burst of congratulatory applause burst forth from the vast concourse of human beings. Hats and handkerchiefs were waved. Many ladies sobbed aloud. During this demonstration the Queen stood at the front of her box and curtsied repeatedly, while Prince Albert bowed in reply to the deafening congratulations. The audience would not allow the opera to proceed till the ""National Anthem"" had been sung, and, as a mark of especial respect, Lablache and Persiani joined the rest of the company. At the words ""Scatter her enemies,"" in particular, the most deafening acclama- tions arose, and one cheer more was raised when Her Majesty resumed her seat in the corner of the box. </span></p>

One evening, over our fried tripe, I was condemning them for indulging their laughing propensities on the stage, and said I thought it was positively disrespectful to the audience. "" For my own part,"" said I, ""I enjoy your comicalities and humour as much as any one, when in the front of the house ; but were I on the stage with you, nothing that you could do, would make me so far forget the character I was acting, as to indulge in misplaced mirth."" "" Do you think so ?"" said he ; "" well, perhaps you are right."" Five or six nights after this conversation, we were acting in "" The Doctor and Apothecary."" I was to sing a song to him, beginning, "" This marriage article, in every particle, is free from flaw, Sir."" A full chord was given from the orchestra to pitch the key ; just as it was given, and I was going to begin the song, he called out to Shaw, the leader, "" Stop, stop ;"" and putting his head into my face, and kicking up his heels (a favourite action of his) he drove me from one end of the stage to the other, crying out all the time, "" I'll be hanged if you shall ever have any more fried tripe, no more fried tripe, no more fried tripe,"" and completely pushed me off the stage. I could not resist this unexpected attack, and naturally burst out laughing. The audience were in a roar of laughter too, for it was enough that he held up his finger or his heel to make them laugh. When we got off, he said, "" I think you must own, my serious lad, that I have conquered ; ""then taking me by the hand, he dragged me upon the stage to the spot whence he had before driven me, and looking down into the orchestra, said, "" Now, Sirs, begin,"" which they did, and I sang my song, which was much applauded ; but the audience were, of course, ignorant of the joke of the fried tripe, or what he meant by it : however, he is gone, poor fellow, and many a pleasant hour have I enjoyed in his society.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

I always accompanied them on these occasions.</p>",,

He was a born ""leader of men,"" and if I had not formed this impression on my early visits to Exeter Hall, when he was directing the performances of the old Sacred Harmonic Society, I should assuredly have done so at my first Handel Festival in 1874, when he took command of the army of four thousand singers and instrumentalists who obeyed his ample beat with such marvelous rhythmic swing and precision. From the institution of the festival in 1857, Costa alone had trained and directed this army; and so universal was the idea that he alone was capable of keeping it under control, that when the announcement of his serious illness came, just before the festival of 1883, there was an expression of dismay on all sides. The musician who filled the breach happily proved to be in the end as good as his predecessor. Indeed, August Manns, the esteemed and talented conductor of the Crystal Palace Concerts, did much to improve the quality of his vast choir and to raise its level of efficiency and intelligence. Still, he would be the first to admit that the honor and glory of the most striking executive achievement known to music stands principally, if not exclusively, to the credit of Michael Costa, the man who created the machine and left it in perfect working order.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

I then heard her sing on two occasions. The first time was in the ""Messe Solennelle"" of her beloved teacher and friend, Rossini, which the master had rescored for full orchestra some four years previous, in fact, only a few months before he died. Thirteen years had elapsed since Alboni was last heard in London, and some time since she had retired from the stage altogether. Even then she was only in her forty-ninth year, and, despite her unusual stoutness, her tones retained well-nigh all their pristine charm of quality and organ-like richness of volume. What a magnificent voice it was ! How marvelous for a pure contralto its evenness and range! Mr. Julian Marshall, in his article on Alboni in Grove's Dictionary, describes her compass as ""fully two octaves, from G to G."" To be correct, he should have added quite another half-octave to the head register and nearly as much below; for Alboni sang with perfect ease to the upper C, and could descend when she pleased to the middle space of the bass clef altogether a scale extending not far short of <em>three</em> octaves ! The purity and fluency of her style were indescribable. She was one of the last great exemplars of the old Italian school. The second time I heard Alboni was at a concert given in a private house in Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, by Alessandro Romili, a young Italian who, prior to the war, had acted as accompanist in Paris to the well-known singer and teacher Delle Sedie. I recollect how perfectly she sang some French pieces and a new romanza (""Il primo amore,"" I think it was called) expressly composed for her by Romili. But what dwells most vividly in my memory in connection with this concert is her extreme kindness to my brother Max, who was down in the same programme for a violin solo. The great artist insisted on sitting among the audience to listen to the little English fiddler (then about thirteen); and he had just started his solo when one of his strings broke. He gave one glance of consternation round the room and then incontinently burst into tears. The audience looked half amused; but Alboni rose from her seat, walked to my brother, and, kissing him upon the forehead, said, loudly enough for every one to hear, ""N'importe, mon petit ami; ne pleurs pas!

It seemed as if all the beauty and fashion of the kingdom, all the colors of the rainbow, and all the resources of embellishment, had been called in to enliven and give effect to the brilliant spectacle. Not the least interesting was the organ gallery, choir, or orchestra; its towering seats being so arranged as to bring within the view of almost every spectator the whole number (nearly five hundred) of instrumental and vocal performers. As the time for beginning approached, the organ poured forth its full and prolonged chords in the majestic and solemn key of D minor, setting the whole atmosphere in motion, and filling the space with a torrent of sound. This continued for three or five minutes, and afforded an opportunity for the instrumentalists to tune and prepare for action.</p>",,

I was to have gone, but the Duchess of Queensberry sent me a ticket to go to a ball in Soho Square, and I went with my Lady Cowper. It is a very fine room. The Duke of York was there, and he began the ball ; I danced but two dances ; it was so hot ; there was not any minuets. The French horn, fiddle, and other instruments, played till the ball began, which was about nine.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436192694272,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>A remarkable concert took place in 1872. Among the artists who lent me their aid was the great Teresa Titiens, and also Miss Clara Louise Kellogg, an American soprano, and Mlle Marie Roze. Mile Roze was a very pretty woman, and Auber wrote the principal part in his latest opera, Le premier jour de bonheur for her, which was produced at the Opera-Comique in Paris. She became very popular, and a great favourite at Her Majesty's Theatre. Signor Fancelli, the tenor, and Signor Agnesi, the baritone, also sang at this concert, but one of its sensations was the singing of the new tenor, Signor Italo Campanini, brother of Signor Cleofante Campanini, lately the principal conductor at Covent Garden, who created as great a furore on his first appearance at Drury Lane in 1872 as Cennaro in Lucrezia Borgia as Giuglini did at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1857.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanover_Square_Rooms

Of these gorgeous, and at the same time tasteful embellishments, a general approval prevailed; whilst the aspect of the vast and elegant interior, in its fresh and magnificent array, struck every eye. Curiosity had been more legitimately, although perhaps less eagerly, excited by the striking novelties which the first night of the season was to produce. The ""Nabucco"" of Verdi, a work which was popular on the Continent, and had in some places caused a perfect furore, was selected to inaugurate the new salle. That Verdi had already made way against his wholesale detractors, was rendered evident by the generally better feeling with which the music of ""Nabucco"" was accepted. In a popular sense, the opera was a decided success; the choral melodies especially suiting the public taste. The libretto, although faulty in many respects, was dramatic, and afforded scope for fine acting and artistic emotion. ""Nabucco,"" in short, floated on the sea of the Anglo-Italian stage, where, whilst one current was always rushing towards novelty, another tended to wreck all novelty whatever in the interests of so-called ""classicism."" Much had been done to place the opera with splendour on the stage, but though it pleased as a whole, no decided success attended the venture of the two new ladies. Sanchioli, wild, vehement, and somewhat coarse, attracted and excited by her ""power, spirit, and fire,"" but she failed to charm. As a ""declaiming, passionate vocalist,"" she created an effect; but the very qualities which had rendered her so popular with an Italian audience, acted somewhat repulsively upon English opera-goers. The lack of refinement in her style was not in their eyes redeemed by the merit of energy. The electric impulse that communicated itself to the Italians, fell comparatively powerless on the British temperament. Sanchioli, however, was in many respects the ""right woman in the right place,"" in this melodramatic opera. The other lady, Mademoiselle Corbari, though destined in after times to please greatly as an altra-prima on the Anglo-Italian stage, and though she was considered from the first, charming, even ""fascinating"" in her simplicity and grace, was not yet acknowledged as a leading vocalist. The nervousness and inexperience of a novice, which she showed at this stage of her career, somewhat lessened the success due to a sweet voice and feeling style, though the prayer allotted to her character, Fenena, was encored nightly. Fornasari pleased those who remained of his old enthusiastic admirers, by his emphatic dramatic action and vigorous declamation, and thus far worked towards the success of Verdi's new opera. It is not unworthy of record that, in compliance with that repugnance which is prevalent in the English mind against any dramatic subject referring however remotely to biblical history, and which had already transformed ""Mose"" into ""Pietro L'Eremita,"" the ""Nabucco"" of the Italian stage was condemned to assume on this occasion an alias under the title of ""Nino Ee D'Assyria."" That the opera thus lost much of its original character, especially in the scene where the captive Israelites became very uninteresting Babylonians, and was thereby shorn of one great element of success, present on the Continent, is undeniable.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

One night, when going to bed, his Lordship's attention was attracted by some one singing an air, from an opera then in vogue ; the person was seated on the steps of a church, opposite to his Lordship's palace: the prodigious quality of the voice, the fine ear and excellent taste displayed, astonished his Lordship. He ordered his valet to inquire who the extraordinary performer could be ; the valet replied, "" that he knew very well ; it was young Giovanni, one of his Lordship's volantes. His ear for music is so perfect,"" said the valet, "", that whatever he hears, he catches instantly : he often sings to the servants, and is the delight of us ail.""' The following morning, Giovanni was ushered into his Lordship's breakfast room, where he sang several songs, in a style and with execution to surprise him still more ! His Lordship ordered Signor Mansoli, Signor Verolli, and Camparini, Maestro di Cappella to the Grand Duke, to hear him : they all declared it the finest voice they had ever heard, and that he only wanted instruction to become the very first bass singer in the world ! "" Then,"" said Lord Cowper "" that he shall not want long, from this I take him under my protection, and he shall have the best instruction Italy can afford."" His Lordship kept his word ; and for two years, Morelli had the first masters that money could pro-cure. At the end of that time, he was engaged as primo buffo at Leghorn. He then went the round of all the principal theatres with great eclat. At the Teatro della Valle in Rome, he was perfectly idolized, often singing at the Carnival. He was engaged at the Pergola theatre ; and his success,on his return to Florence, was triumphant indeed !</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence

was a favourite. </pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

The fine music of this work deserved more enduring success. The cast comprised Mme. Albani, Miss Meisslinger, Philip Brozel, David Bispham, and Richard Green ; but, unluckily, there was a lack of distinction (and distinctness) about the general rendering that was scarcely calculated to engender in aristocratic auditors any particular love of opera in the vernacular.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

We had Sullivan's setting of ""Onward, Christian Soldiers,"" and I remember seeing the King singing in the manly, hearty fashion that was so characteristic of him, as he stood forth prominently in his place near the bier. My mind went back to my boyhood days; again I heard the stirring tale of that grim fight on Guy Fawkes' day, sixty-five years ago, when . . . all day long the noise of battle roll'd Among the mountains by the winter sea, and every man in the thin British ranks bore himself as a paladin, not least him who now brought into the Abbey on his way to his last resting place had so gallantly maintained himself amid the carnage near the two-gun battery. The Dean afterwards told me that His Majesty had expressed his great satisfaction with the conduct of the service, and the manner in which it was rendered.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

He intends a professional visit to the United States.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448394636895,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>On Sabbath last we attended public worship at the Scotch Church, under the pastoral charge of Dr. John Cumming. Dr. Cumming is a very popular preacher; his house is generally crowded, and it is not easy always to obtain seats &mdash; which favor, however, we procured, through the politeness of the leader of the singing, Mr. Purday. The order of exercises observed in this church is an excellent one, and I therefore copy it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I. Singing &mdash; a Hymn by the Congregation.</p>
<p>II. Prayer, half as long as the Prayer usually is in Presbyterian Churches.</p>
<p>III. Choir Singing. An Anthem.</p>
<p>IV. Reading Scriptures, with Exposition.</p>
<p>V. Hymn, sung by the Congregation.</p>
<p>VI. Prayer, about the length of the first.</p>
<p>VII. Sermon.</p>
<p>VIII. Singing by Congregation. Notices.</p>
<p>IX. Concluding Prayer, and Benediction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The standing position was observed in the singing exercises, and the sitting posture in all others. I will not attempt to report the sermon, but will only observe that one more plain, faithful, and edifying can hardly be imagined. The text was</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good for me to draw near unto God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It will be observed that the singing exercise occurs four times; thrice by the congregation, and once by the choir exclusively. The people generally united, although the tunes, (with the exception of the last, which was York,) were too difficult to justify the expectation of the best congregational singing. The old tune of Martyrdom was sung; but in singing it, the people could not keep together, on account of the triple measure, and the crotchets in the fourth line. The other tune (we do not know its name) was so high that many could not reach the pitch. A congregational tune should not go higher than D, or E flat.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

I never expect to hear it surpassed.</p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448286451685,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>A charming Quartette performance was recently given by a few of the very best artists here, as David, Dreyschock, (violinist,) Rietz, and others whose names are less known. They were assisted by a pianist from Munich, Herr Speidl. The following pieces were played. 1st. Trio for pianoforte, violin and violoncello, by Beethoven, (op. 70,) by Speidl, David, and Rietz. 2d. Quartette for strings, composed by David. 3d. Variations for pianoforte, by Mendelssohn. 4th. Quartette by Beethoven, (op. 59,) performed by Dreyschock, Rongen, Hermann, and Rietz.</p>
<p>There are only four of these concerts in the annual series, so that they are much more rare here than in Boston. They seem not to be so popular as the concerts by full orchestra, yet they draw out a musical audience of great intelligence, and on this occasion the learned ones were there. It is indeed a great luxury to hear these choice works of Beethoven and others, so perfectly given. The Quartette above mentioned (op. 59) is well known, is always a favorite, and was on this occasion the crowning piece.</p>",,

Among the musicians present there were Dusseck and Cramer, who played on the piano, and were accompanied by Viotti and Jarnowickz, the celebrated violin players. Lady Flint's desire to gratify her friends, however, was often frustrated by the annoying conduct of those who had no taste for music, who disturbed the enjoyment of some of the most beautiful pieces by the rattling of their cups and saucers, and the tone in which their conversation was carried on. Jarnowickz, the violin player, having upon one occasion commenced a concerto by Beethoven, accompanied by his little orchestra, consisting of Cramer, Spagnoletti, Lindley, and Dragonetti, suddenly ceased playing, and apologised for so doing by stating, that the discord caused by the tea-drinkers was such as to mar the effect of the immortal composer's music. He added, that those who thus showed that they did not understand music, would perhaps appreciate better the piece which he was about to play,&mdash;viz., ""God save the King,"" to which they would listen at least with respect. The reproof had a good effect, for always afterwards a complete silence reigned during the performance.</span></p>",,

The shout of joy uttered by the students when he sat down at the piano was something to remember. It was followed by an intense silence. Then the aged but still nimble fingers ran lightly over the keys, and I was listening for the first time in my life to Franz Liszt. To attempt to describe his playing, after the many well-known Weimar pupils and distinguished writers who have tried to accomplish that task, would be mere presumption on my part. Even at seventy-five, Liszt was a pianist whose powers lay beyond the pale to which sober language or calm criticism could reach or be ap- plied. Enough that his greatest charm seemed to me to lie in a perfectly divine touch, and in a tone more remarkable for its exquisitely musical quality than for its volume or dynamic force, aided by a technique still incomparably brilliant and superb.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Academy_of_Music

Two years later a much better rendering of the psalm was given at the Norwich Festival under Mr. Randegger.</p>",,

The Prince Saxe, a brother of the Queen, died a few days since, at his residence in this city; and to-day the body was removed from the house to the railroad depot, from thence to be taken to Altenberg, to the family vault. About three thousand cavalry, artillery, and infantry were called out to perform escort duty. There were seven fine military bands, a part of them being composed of mixed instruments, and a part of brass only. They played in admirable style.</p>",,

His songs and chamber pieces were tolerably well known, but of his orchestral works only three had so far been heard in London&mdash;namely, the symphony in F (April 12) and the symphonic poems, &ldquo;Till Eulenspiegel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Also sprach Zarathustra&rdquo;. He now brought with him the &ldquo;Tod und Verklarung&rdquo;, wherein is depicted the death struggle of a man before whose mental vision there passes the panorama of a wasted life, followed by the man's transfiguration, as his redeemed soul passes out of earthly existence into a higher state. The second section of this remarkable work made an especially deep impression, and at the close the composer was overwhelmed with applause. Strauss's gifts as a conductor were made manifest in very positive fashion. In his own music startling contrasts, powerful crescendos, and exciting climaxes naturally abounded. In the inter-pretation of Mozart and Wagner he displayed an admirable command of dynamic effects, ranging from the most delicate to the most sonorous; and in everything alike he revealed the intellectual insight and authority, the artistic culture, the magnetic force, the strong individuality of a musician of genius.</span></p>",,

The view of the sea, on one <br />side, and a highly-cultivated country on the other, with the lofty mountain of <br />Penman Maur, towering to the skies, form indeed a splendid prospect; and to add <br />to the earthly beauties round me, the morning was serene, with a true Neapolitan <br />sky. 

I crossed the ferry in the carriage; and when passing Conway Castle, the place <br />where (in the ""Castle Spectre,"") it was supposed, ""Megin ho, Megin he,"" was sung, <br />it gave me great delight to recal the melody, nor could I resist singing it 
all through ; while the boatmen and passengers, who of course did not participate <br />in the feelings by which I was actuated, seemed much astonished, and, by their <br />silence, not ill pleased at the animated manner in which I was singing. </pre>",,

A principal point of attraction is always found in the Symphony, and on this occasion it was not a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Mendelssohn, but an original manuscript composition of a member of the Orchestra, Ferd. Hermann, that was performed. Herr Hermann directed his own Symphony. It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. There is always so much caution and incredulity, and sometimes suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to&nbsp;fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties.</p>
<p>Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner in which his work was received, and probably a young composer does not often obtain greater approbation. There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again.</p>
<p>Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, London, sang with approbation; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charmingly sung by Miss Mayer, coming seemingly fresh from the heart, on the tones of a sweet voice.</p>

He <br />placed it on one side of his music desk, and on the other, his first violin <br />part, from which he was to play ; and to my great astonishment, Madame <br />Catalani's, and that of all present, he sang every note of the song, at the <br />same time playing his own part on the violin, as leader ; thus killing, as it <br />were, two birds with one stone, with the greatest ease.<br />
The song was one of Portogallo's, in manuscript, and had never been out of <br />Madame Catalani's hands ; therefore, it was impossible that he could have seen 
it previously ; it was full of difficult divisions, of which he did not miss <br />one. Had I not been an eye-witness of this extraordinary exhibition, I could

A native of Glasgow and educated at The National Training School for Music in London, he might with all fairness have been termed a British product. He preferred, however, to call himself a German, and had not stood upon an English concert platform since boyhood till he appeared at Queen's Hall under Felix Mottl (April 28, 1896), and gave a magnificent performance of Beethoven's E flat or &ldquo;Emperor"" concerto. He had a cold reception, but after he had played it became evident that the old grievances had been forgotten in the presence of a legitimate virtuoso, of a true artist possessing the fire of unmistakable genius. Personally I admire his playing immensely; and as an interpreter of Beethoven, it is upon the shoulders of d'Albert that the mantle of Rubinstein, to my thinking, has fallen. His place as a composer will have to be decided by a future generation.</span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1439053076801,https://archive.org/stream/thirtyyearsofmus00kleiuoft,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the summer of the following year to be pre-ise, June 22, 1878 Signor Garcia accompanied me to the first performance in England of Bizet's ""Carmen."" It was not an easy thing at that time to persuade him to go to the Opera...I recollect that Signor Garcia was in a very critical mood, albeit prepared, with his customary impatiality, to allow the full meed of praise where praise was due. The opera was well cast and well staged. Mr. Mapleson had seen it at the Brussels Monnaie during the preceding winter, and it was on the strength of the success won there, alike by the work and by the exponent of the title-role, that he had determined to transfer both to the boards of Her Majesty's. The Carmen in question was no other than Miss Minnie Hauk, the young American prima donna who had sung at Covent Garden one autumn season when quite a girl, but had not been heard again in London until the present year, when she made her rentree as Violetta in ""La Traviata."" Her Carmen was already famous. It was considered as good dramatically as that of Mme. Galli-Marie, and in a vocal sense far superior. Garcia was simply delighted with the artistic finish, the vivacity and charm, of her performance. He thought she had caught with marvelous instinct and truth the peculiarities of the Spanish type, the coquettish manners and the defiant devilry of the wayward gipsy. He admired immensely the individuality of an assumption which, if it was subsequently followed upon more or less identical lines by many excellent artists, has been equaled only by three I mean Pauline Lucca, Emma Calve, and Zelie de Lussan. Nor since have I heard a sweeter, gentler, or more persuasive Michaela than Alwina Valleria (nee Miss Lohmann, of Baltimore), another American soprano who was just beginning to win her way into the affections of the English public. The Escamillo - and an altogether ideal one - was that remarkably fine barytone, Del Puente, who in after years settled down in New York as a singer and teacher; while Campanini sang and acted with superb dramatic power as Don Jose. It was a strong cast, therefore, and Sir Michael Costa conducted the opera with exemplary care, even if he failed to bring into full relief the manifold beauties and exquisitely delicate touches of Bizet's score. But Signor Garcia was simply enthusiastic, and he labored as effectively as any individual in the whole theatre to bring about the triumphant reception that greeted ""Carmen"" that night. The subject and its treatment alike appealed to him; he thought the story intensely dramatic; the degree of real Spanish color in the music quite astonished him. He had not imagined that any Spanish opera after ""Don Giovanni"" and ""II Barbiere"" could please him so much. I may be excused for thus dwelling at length upon the premiere of ""Carmen "" in England, because from that moment dates the real popularity of the opera in Europe a popularity, by the way, that has been exceeded by one opera only, Gounod's ""Faust."" It was further noteworthy in that it first brought into prominence the two American-born singers Minnie Hauk and Alwina Valleria who were to be most closely identified with the rapid upward progress of the Carl Eosa opera enterprise from 1880 to 1886.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

It was only in 1904, I remember, when Massenet's opera Herodiade was given at Covent Garden for Madame Calve, that the management were compelled by the Censor to change the title of the opera. The title chosen was Salome, as likely to give less offence to public prejudice! Herod was renamed Moriame, roi d'Ethiope, and Herodias was also renamed. But it was difficult to make the illusion complete. In the scene in the Temple the seven-branched candlestick was seen, and Madame Calve led a procession of girls carrying palms and singing "" Hosanna."" When the Roman prefect appeared and began his address to the Ethiopian crowd, he mistook their nationality and addressed them as "" Peuple juif "" !</p>",,

I remember going to see his debut with Madame Mara, who had known him when he was in a mercantile house at Manchester, and was very much interested in his success : he was received with great applause, his voice was good, and he sang with taste. Johnstone played the part of Edwin, and their voices blended well together in the duet of "" How sweet in the Woodlands."" Mrs. Billington was the Angelica, looked beautifully, and sang the simple ballad, "" I travelled India's barren sands,"" like a true Angelica. In the same box with Madame Mara and myself, sat Charles Bannister, who had originally acted the same part of Robin, Hood ; a person next to him, who was vehemently applauding Bowden, had the bad taste to say to Bannister (purposely, I suppose, to mortify him), "" Ay, ay, Sir, Bowden is the true Robin Hood, the only Robin Hood ;"" on which Bannister replied, "" Sir, he may be Robin Hood this year, but next season he will be robbing Harris.""

During the eight or ten years that he lived with us, I studied with him for nearly four, and heard him give many scores of lessons beside those which I received. To see and hear Garcia teach was ever a source of unqualified pleasure. Even when annoyed by a pupil's lack of ordinary intelligence, he seldom became abrupt or impatient; and he never worried or confused the student with technicalities not actually essential to the accurate understanding of his method. His voice had virtually gone, but he would liberally employ its beaux restes to impart he idea for the proper emission of a note or the phrasing of a passage. As often as not, the sounds that he produced would be positively ugly; but they never failed to convey the desired suggestion, and, though his own voice might tremble with sheer weight of years, he never, to my knowledge, brought out a pupil whose tones were marred by the slightest shade of vibrato.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

I had Lady Rich and her daughter. Lady Cath. Hanmer and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. Percival, Sir John Stanley and my brother, Mrs. Donellan, Strada and Mr. Coot. Lord Shaftesbury begged of Mr. Percival to bring him, and being a <em>profess'd friend</em> of Mr. Handel (who was here also) was admitted; I never was so well entertained at an opera ! Mr. Handel was in the best humour in the world, and played lessons and accompanied Strada and all the ladies that sung from seven o' the clock till eleven.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Delany,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

""One day he saw an announcement that Moody and Sankey were to open a mission at St. Pancras that evening. Instantly he resolved to go and hear the singing. He and a companion reached the hall in good time, as they thought, only to find it crowded to the doors. An overflow meeting was announced at a neighbouring church, and thither they went. By and by Mr. Sankey sang 'To the hall of the feast came the sinful and fair.' &nbsp;As Markham listened, his past life seemed to rise before him ; the tears rushed into his eyes ; his heart seemed broken. Coming out, he asked his companion what he thought of it. 'Oh,' &nbsp;was the careless reply, 'he is a nice singer.' 'Is that all?' &nbsp;'It has broken my heart.'</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_Borough_of_St_Pancras

A few special words must be given to this occasion. Already Fornasari had ceased to hold the supreme position which had been hastily and generally granted him during the previous season, and though he was still enthusiastically received by the general public, a few ""carpings and cavillings"" began to be heard. Doubts timorously indeed were whispered here and there, and it became gradually evident that Fornasari was not exactly the ""conquering hero"" which previous trumpetings had so loudly proclaimed him. In spite of his efforts on this occasion, backed by the advantage of Lablache's name and the singing of Persiani, in spite of the catching melodies, the vigorous chorusses and the dramatic style of Herold, ""Zampa"" failed in establishing itself upon the Anglo-Italian boards. After a very few nights, on which it was lustily applauded, it wholly disappeared from the bills. However, in behalf of the fame of Herold, it should be mentioned that a considerable portion of the frequenters of Her Majesty's Theatre only admitted at this period, as acceptable on its boards, the Italian school, pur et simple, and looked with coldness and mistrust on any names, how's ever accredited, which revealed a French, a German, or, still worse, an English origin. Thus Herold can in fact scarcely be said to have had ""fair play"" at Her Majesty's Theatre.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

It had been previously advertised that at this hour there would be preaching by a divinity student. I attended; the service had already commenced, although there were only three persons in the house. These three were the organist, the singer, and one other person who was in the organ-loft (where I ventured to go), and who seemed to be also a looker-on. The organ was playing with some sixteen or eighteen stops out, and the singer was singing a chorale by himself (in unison!) without a single person to hear or to be edified by the psalm. I was the fourth person. Soon, however, two or three others came in, and as the last stanza was drawing to a close, the minister entered the pulpit from a vestry door. By the time he began his sermon, which was as soon as the singing closed, the congregation numbered in all, including the organist, the singer, the minister and the sexton (who made his appearance when the minister came in), I believe, just twelve persons, six of whom were seated in the body of the house near the pulpit, and appeared to have come for the purpose of attending the service. A short prayer was read before the preaching. The sermon occupied about forty minutes, during which time several persons came in and others went away, so that from the beginning to the end of the exercises, from eighteen to twenty people may have been for a part of the time present. The preacher did not seem to be in the least disconcerted from the fact that he was almost without hearers, but went on as though the house had been quite full. The sexton seemed to enjoy it much, as he had nothing to do, and the singer and the organist, too, seemed to have no particular anxiety as to the effect of the psalmody. The moment the sermon was ended, the minister, preceded by the sexton, retired, and then, after they were out, came the concluding song, which was a grand chorale, performed vocally by the singer (in unison!) and instrumentally by the organist, on sixteen or eighteen stops of his organ. I suppose, too, that the six or seven persons below joined in the song, but they did not add so much to the power of the chorus as to enable me to say with certainty whether the singing was by the congregation, or by the choir only.</p><p>This account of the second service will appear so strange, that I fear some of your readers may doubt whether the writer is in earnest. I can assure them that it is strictly correct, and that the service, and the whole of it, has been described just as it occurred.</p>",,

In February 1879 it served as the subject of a rather interesting episode. The occasion was a soiree at Marlborough House in honour of the Prince Imperial of France prior to his departure for Zululand whence, alas, he was not to return alive. The inevitable &ldquo;Two Grenadiers&rdquo; was on the programme of the concert about to commence, when I was summoned to the Princess of Wales, who expressed a doubt as to the advisability of having that song, with the &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; at the end, in the presence of the Prince Imperial. I of course was quite ready to substitute another song, but as I was moving towards the piano, the royal host, having evidently been told by the Princess of the proposed change, and remembering perhaps not so much the melody as the words of that stirring final stanza of the ballad, bade me by all means sing it, as in his opinion it would be &ldquo;the very thing the Prince Imperial would like.&rdquo; And he was right. The young Napoleon, a very handsome young man, with most engaging manners, stood close to the piano whilst I was singing, and when he recognized the martial strains of the &ldquo;Marseillaise&rdquo; at the end with the wonderful climax on the words &ldquo;Then, fully armed, I will rise from my grave, the Emp'ror, my Emp'ror defending,&rdquo; his eyes flashed with excitement and, full of emotion, he came up to me and thanked me.</span></span></p>

There I had the gratification of hearing a sonata on the violin played by the great Nardini ; though very far advanced in years, he played divinely. He spoke with great affection of his favourite scholar, Thomas Linley, who, he said, possessed powerful abilities. Lord Cowper requested him to play the popular sonata, composed by his master, Tartini, called the Devil's Sonata. Mr. Jackson, an English gentleman present, asked Nardini, whether the anecdote relative to this piece of music was true, for Mr. de la Lande had assured Dr. Burney that he had it from Tartini's own mouth.</p>
<p>Nardini answered, that he had frequently heard Tartini relate the circumstance, which was neither more nor less than this : He said that one night he dreamed that he had entered into a contract with the devil, in fulfilment of which his satanic majesty was bound to perform all his behests. He placed his violin in his hands, and asked him to play ; and the devil played a sonata so exquisite, that in the delirium of applause which he was bestowing, he awoke, and flew to the instrument to endeavour to retain some of the passages ! but in vain, they had fled ! yet the sonata haunted his imagination day and night, and he endeavoured to compose one in imitation, which he called "" The Devil's Sonata :"" but it was so inferior to the sonata of his dream, that he has been heard to say, that if he had had any other mode of gaining a living, he would have left the musical profession. I hope my being able to add the additional authority of Nardini himself, as to the truth of this anecdote, will be my excuse for repeating what has been so ably related by Dr. Burney. Nardini was the favourite scholar of Tartini, and was allowed to possess more of his master's excellence than any other.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florence

When about 15 years old she was unfortunately injured accidentally in the back but seemed to take no special notice of the injury at the time. At night, however, she roused up her sisters and gravely informed them that the judgement day was at hand and bade them say their prayers. This created such an uproar that the family was brought together and then began a series of the most wonderful nightly entertainments on the part of the afflicted. Around the room there was a ledge about three feet from the floor which it seemed impossible for a cat to stand. She would mount that however and run rapidly round and round the room, without once tripping. Then she would imagine herself a racehorse and dash furiously up and down four flights of stairs and at such a rapid pace that other members of the family who would attempt to prevent her could scarcely mount one flight before she would be at the top. At other times she would give vent to strains of almost heavenly music or quote long pieces of poetry which not only the family but even she herself was utterly unacquainted with. She would at times imagine herself travelling in polar or tropical countries and would give most accurate and thrilling accounts of the scenes before her imagination, though otherwise she was perfectly unacquainted with the subject. But the most remarkable of her somnambulistic traits was this - that she could read the finest print in such darkness, that others could not distinguish faces;- and even Latin and French she would read and accurately pronounce, tho totally ignorant of the language. She was placed under the medical care of Dr. Moultrie and finally recovered after about six months;- at this date she is about forty-two or three and though somewhat nervous is otherwise in good health and dislikes extremely for anyone to mention the subject in her presence.</p>",,

He was then seventy-five years old, having been born on October 22nd, 1811, so one could hardly expect that his playing would have been so astonishing. He still had wonderful fire and technique, and one could easily imagine his former greatness, as the first pianist of his day. He may be said to have created a new school of pianoforte playing, and now his works are constantly being performed at all the recitals given by modern pianists, and his orchestral works, such as his symphonies and symphonic tone-poems, are in the programmes of most of the orchestral concerts in London and the provinces.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bond_Street

It seats, probably, from 1,200 to 1,500 persons, and was, when we were present, quite full. The centre of the house, below, was occupied by women; and the outside or wall slips, by men. The galleries, on both sides, were occupied exclusively by men. The organ is large, extending nearly across the end of the house; one man (precentor) leads the singing, aided by some twenty girls and boys, whose voices could hardly be heard. The organ was played in fine church style, with dignity, elevation, and firmness. It is certainly a great relief to hear these German organs (or many of them) played without the least attempt at showing off stops, or at that prettiness which seeks to please or tickle, without elegance or grandeur; and also entirely free from an ever-continued and sickening seesaw of the swell, thought to be so exquisitely fine by some organists in England and America.</p>",,

Intensely musical, he played the violin uncommonly well, and along with a friend the blind organist of a neighbouring church was employed at all the dances in the vicinity. It was a local saying that ""people liked to have blind men to play at the dances, because they would not know too much of what was going on""! Blind Fred had a great love for Church music, and would constantly come round from the bellows-side to the keyboard side of the organ to correct me for a wrong note or something that I had not noticed myself. He could do this, because I was only allowed to play softly, and the organ not being pneumatic it did not require a great amount of wind. I remember his delight when for the first time we had some of the more modern chants introduced, notably one by Turle, which is well known and usually sung to the `104th Psalm. There is a very striking chord in the second part. Old blind Fred would whistle this chant to me, accenting this chord with all his power ! He was always rather hard upon my extempore playing (which I admit was not very good), but once I tripped him up by taking a phrase from one of Mendelssohn's Lieder, using it as a subject. This brought him round to me, with the exclamation, ""Ah, Master Fred, that is something like""! I thanked him, but was artful enough not to tell him whose it was.</p>",,

The solo artists included three members of the original quartet, namely: Mme. Stolz, Mme. Waldmann, and Signor Masini. All possessed noble organs ; and the famous tenor, who has never been heard in opera in England, was then quite at his best.

Madame Ai'no Ackte, who had only a short time before arrived in England, promised at once to sing ; also Miss Maggie Teyte, Mr. Ben Davies, Mr. Gregory Hast, and Mr. Robert Radford. Mischa Elman, who had only the previous day returned from America, said he would play. Mr. Harold Bauer came specially from Paris, and M. Jean Gerardy from Brussels. Miss Ellen Terry, Miss Cecilia Loftus, Mr. George Alexander, and Mr. Henry Ainley consented to recite, and the conductors were Messrs. F. A. Sewell, Adolph Mann, Percy Kahn, and Alfredo Barili, Madame Patti's nephew. With such a splendid array of distinguished artists the suc- cess of the concert was assured. Much to my regret, I was compelled by my doctor's orders to stop at home ; but I was not alone, as I had asked my old friend, William Kuhe, to come and take tea with me. He arrived, and we chatted pleasantly together, when presently my daughter Georgina, who had gone to the concert, arrived in a taxi to tell me the news that Madame Patti had just finished her last song and that she was in wonderful voice. Her reception by the enormous audience, said my daughter, was something to be remembered ; they kept cheer- ing and applauding for at least five minutes, and Madame Patti was quite overcome by the ovation. She sang in the first part Mozart's ""Voi che Sapete,"" with Lotti's "" Pur Dicesti"" as an encore, and in the second part Tosti's "" Serenata,"" and for the encore "" Home, Sweet Home."" Many people had tears in their eyes, for nobody has ever sung this simple ballad with greater pathos than Madame Patti, and every syllable was distinctly heard by the vast as- sembly. Even the wife of the composer, Sir Henry Bishop, who sang it often to my accompaniment many years ago, could not equal Patti in the singing of it. The Diva received numerous bouquets, and I sent her a large laurel wreath, with the dates 1861 and 1911 on satin streamers, as a remembrance of her first appearance at Covent Garden fifty years before. She has indeed had a wonderful career, and has kept her voice as fresh and beautiful as when she first carried London by storm.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Instead, it was managed with exquisite showmanship by Alfred Butt, with the assistance of the late Augustus Moore. For years Moore had professed the belief that an insidious and insistent journalist could make the London public form any opinion he chose as to the merit of a performance. He put his theories into careful practice with Maud Allan. The result was that for a year all London, high and low, swarmed to the Palace to admire and applaud an artist of whom it had never heard before and whose antecedents proved, upon investigation, to be quite curious. Mr Butt's first step was to issue invitations to a private performance. So aristocratic an audience has never filled a music hall, save at the command of royalty, as that which filled the Palace that afternoon in 1908. What persons of such high rank had applauded, should any common creature dare criticise? </span></p>

But in one form or another Moore's work insinuated itself to every breakfast- table in London next day. The newspaper men had assimilated his ready-made raptures as readily as the dupe accepts the card chosen by the conjurer.

These were held in August and September, under the management of Messrs. A. and S. Gatti. My old friend Signor Luigi Arditi was the conductor for the first few seasons, and he was succeeded in turn by Sir Arthur Sullivan and Mr. F.H. Cowen; while later on came a popular Welsh bandmaster, Mr. Gwyllym Crowe. Much that was interesting and instructive the shilling habitue could hear at these ""Promenades""; but for me the most notable recollection associated with them is the occasion when Arditi gave the first performance in England of the ""Trauermarsch"" from ""G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung."" The new tubas had only just arrived, and there was not much time for rehearsing. Nevertheless, it seemed to me that the wonderful excerpt was fairly well played, though I was too breathless with amazement and admiration to be able to form a cool judgment.

Nevertheless, he possessed vocal and histrionic attributes of a very distinguished kind, and chance so willed it that he was destined to ""bridge over"" to a large extent the interval that separated the final retirement of Mario from the advent (as a tenor) of Jean de Reszke. By birth a Spaniard, and hailing from Pampeluna (the town in which Sarasate was born), Giuliano Gayarre had studied and won his early successes in Italy. He was an exponent of the new quasi-nasal school of tenor singers, which already had Tamagno for one of its leading protagonists. To my ears his production, on the night he made his debut at Covent Garden (April 7, 1877), sounded strange and not wholly pleasant. Still, the voice traveled well, and he sang the music of Gennaro with so much tenderness, so much charm, allied to genuine dramatic feeling and expression, that the crowded house forthwith accorded him a splendid reception. <br /><br />I declined to join in the general chorus of ""Another Mario!"" It struck me as little less than sacrilege to compare with the divine voice of that tenor an organ which could occasionally descend, or ascend, to the utterance of tones that quickly earned the name of the ""Gayarre bleat. "" My criticism drew forth several rejoinders, among them the following from the Covent Garden conductor, Signor Vianesi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wait to hear Gayarre two or three times. You will appreciate him as a true artist. If I can correct him of too much dragging (the present Italian style), he will be ""Number One""!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In a measure, this prediction proved to be correct. Of the operatic tenors heard in London during the succeeding ten years, Gayarre was easily the most interesting. Campanini and Fancelli had finer voices; while of the French school Nicolini and Capoul were perhaps more attractive. But in certain operas Gayarre stood, for the time being, upon an eminence by himself. As Fernando in ""La Favorita"" (his best part), as Jean de Ley den in ""Le Proph&egrave;te,"" as Enzo in Ponchielli's ""Gioconda"" (his original creation), and as Gennaro in ""Lucrezia Borgia,"" he was for a long time positively without a rival. He was an admirable Lohengrin, and was the first singer in this part to vary the charm of the love music in the bridal duet by the judicious employment of a particularly lovely mezza voce. He was also excellent in Glinka's opera ""La Vie pour le Czar,"" which he introduced to English audiences for the first time at Covent Garden in 1887.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

The season of 1885 had been almost wholly barren, and that of 1886 was little better. Incapacity and indifference reached their climax with the disgraceful and humiliating scene that occurred at Her Majesty's Theatre on the night of March 6, 1886. Some unknown person, evidently without experience as a manager, had, there started a season of Italian opera with a company of incompetent artists. On the fourth night it completely collapsed under circumstances un precedented in the annals of opera in a great city. I quote my own description of what occurred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The second act of ""Faust"" had concluded when the orchestra refused to proceed further unless their salaries were instantly paid. Their claims were partly satisfied, and, after an interval of inordinate length, in the course of which the audience displayed the noisiest impatience, the opera proceeded for another act, with the accompaniment of about half the band. But the crisis had only been deferred. After the curtain had fallen again there was another long ""wait,"" and the disturbances recommenced. At length, in response to deafening calls, the stage-manager came forward and announced that it was impossible to proceed. The stage-carpenters had refused to set the next scene, and the opera could not, therefore, go on. A howl of derision and anger greeted this statement; but the audience, having made up its mind to the worst, was preparing, amid a fearful din, to depart, when the curtain rose once more and a whole army of stage assistants came down to the footlights with outstretched arms and aprons, as though to implore the charity of the house. The gestures were understood, and, with one accord, the remaining occupants of the gallery and upper tiers began flinging a shower of coppers and small silver coins down on to the stage, uttering the while all sorts of satirical and uncomplimentary epithets. However, the occupation was too expensive to last long, and in a minute or two this disgraceful episode came to a termination, ending also a night of horrors that will never be forgotten by those who witnessed it.</p>

Indeed, &ldquo;Carmen&rdquo; was given only for Harris's &ldquo;benefit"" on the very last night of the season, <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>when the demand for seats was so enormous that <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>stalls sold for &pound;4 ($20) apiece, and many hundreds of people were turned away from the doors. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>The only disappointment was Melba's non-apppearance as Michaela, but this was almost <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>forgotten amid the triumphs of Jean de Reszke <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>and Lassalle, whose admirable impersonations <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>were well matched by the fascinating Carmen of Zelie de Lussan. Being a kind of gala night, Augustus Harris imagined it would be interesting to <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>have each of his three conductors engaged upon <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the one opera. Accordingly Mancinelli directed the first act, Bevignani the second, Randegger the third, and Mancinelli again the fourth. The effect upon the ensemble of the performance was simply disastrous, and, needless to add, the childish experiment was never tried again.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

When the lovely girl appeared on the balcony, she was applauded to the echo, and the magic of her voice and style captivated us in the opening air 'Una voce poco fa.' [...] I can't say which of her characters I consider the most successful, for her vocalization is always enchanting; if I feel the absence of grand dramatic effect, I am more than compensated by the beauty, natural grace, and the combined charm of her voice and person. Her variations on the 'Schweizerbue' are absolutely perfect in their own way, and it never occurs to me to ask myself 'How can she sing such trash?' because she sings it so perfectly.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

The first of these (May 4, 1872) took place at Drury Lane, and was remarkable not only for the exceptional beauty and grandeur of Tietjens's assumption, but because on that night Italo Campanini made his debut in London as Gennaro, and was forthwith hailed (somewhat prematurely, however) as the successor of Mario and Giuglini. The cast further included Faure as the Duke and the ever-delightful Zelia Trebelli as Maffio Orsini, while Sir Michael Costa was the conductor. That was a night of triumphs.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

I agreed to accompany them; and took Henry Horrebow, then quite a boy, with us. None of the party, with the exception of myself, could speak French. However, we had a delightful journey. We stopped a day and a half at Calais, where I hired an excellent roomy post-coach, with three horses; and made an agreement, that we should be set down on the fourth day at Paris, or be on the road eight days at our option; the latter seemed most agreeable to my party, as they wished to see every thing worth looking at on the road, and none of us were pressed for time. Our coachman, with whom I made the agreement, was very communicative. One part of the road, between Calais and Boulogne, was rather bad. Our coachman was walking by the side of the coach, and I was singing the romance, in ""Richard Coeur de Lion."" ""Bravo! bravo!"" exclaimed coachee; sur mon honneur, vous chantez tres-bien and sing as if you knew music too. Allans, done venire bleu let you and I sing a duet."" ""With all my soul,"" said I. He asked me if I knew the duet in the Opera of ""Nina."" I told him I did. ""Allans donc, commences? said he; and to it we went, pell-mell- he had a strong bass voice, and sang perfectly in tune. After the duet, he sang the songs of ""O, Richard! O, mon Roi!"" and the chanson, ""Je suis Lindor,"" with excellent expression, and much to our astonishment.</p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448660077114,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>At the close of the performance the crowd gradually dispersed, moving slowly back into the town, which was now splendidly illuminated. The singing societies again formed in order, and each person bearing upon a rod six or eight feet in length a colored light, the whole moved through the principal streets, in grand torch-light procession, brilliant and dazzling. This being ended, the singers retired to a large hall, where things good to the palate and quickening to the spirits had been bountifully provided, and which were (even in Germany) summarily disposed of. Toasts and speeches followed, which we cannot record here; except that we will merely mention that Herr Capellmeister G. Reichardt of Berlin, in reply to one of the toasts, gave a brief history of the origin and progress of the men-singing festivals in Germany. He said they were commenced in Berlin in 1809, when the great Zelter first called them into life. After he had finished his remarks, the whole company sang one of Reichardt&rsquo;s patriotic songs. The evening&rsquo;s entertainment was continued until it was no longer evening; and not until the light of day had arisen upon these sons of song, did they disperse to seek for a few moments&rsquo; rest before the duties of the day, already began, should call them again to contend for the prize.</p>",,

I could not speak their language. As a lamb among wolves, there I stood. Christ was with me. In Him I trusted ; He heard my prayer. Tuning my violin, I began singing and playing that precious hymn : <em>All hail the power of Jesus' name / Let angels prostrate fall</em>, etc. I closed my eyes while singing, and on reaching the verse, <em>Let every kindred, every tribe / On this terrestrial ball</em>, I opened my eyes, and every spear was dropped, tears were coursing down the cheeks of those warriors.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Siam_area

Had not Mademoiselle Schwartz, the contralto of the season, been unfortunately suffering both from mental affliction, and severe indisposition, and thus unable to do full justice to the Cherubino, this performance of Mozart's great opera might have been looked upon as one of the most complete ever witnessed.</span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448366107348,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>Just before leaving Frankfort, we had an opportunity of attending a matinee, or very select morning concert, in the saloon of the Mozart House. Such morning concerts are quite common in the larger German cities. An individual, having the means to do it, employs at his own expense an orchestra, or more probably a quartet, or quintet, makes out his own programme, and invites his friends to spend a couple of hours in listening to fine music. On the present occasion, an audience of perhaps two hundred persons (the most musical people of Frankfort) were brought together. Schindler, the biographer of Beethoven, Schmidt the pianist, and other distinguished persons, were present. The concert consisted of both vocal and instrumental music; and Music&rsquo;s sister, Elocution, was also brought in, and lent her aid in the exercises of the occasion. The programme contained the following pieces (though not in the order in which they are here put down), viz.:&mdash; &nbsp;Quintet (G. minor), Mozart, charmingly &mdash; I suppose it may be, said, perfectly played by Messrs. Wolff, Baldenecker, Posch, Drinnenberg, and Siedentopf. Quintet Movement, Mozart. This very beautiful movement by Mozart has not before been played since the year 1783. It has been recently discovered in Mozart&rsquo;s own hand-writing, among his manuscripts, which for some twenty years have been in the family of Andr&eacute; of Offenbach. It will shortly be published. Recitative and Air, with violoncello and obligato accompaniment, composed by John Sebastian Bach. This song is quite of a popular character, notwithstanding it is by Bach, reminding one somewhat of Handel&rsquo;s most popular songs. It is a sacred song, from an unpublished cantate; but the Recitative and Song will soon be published. Part-Songs, for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. Two songs were sung by a well-trained double quartet. A Poem on Mozart was well read by a lady, having a rich alto voice, Fraulein Gr&auml;emann. The effect of introducing this elocutionary exercise was very pleasing, and the example is a good one to be followed wherever a really excellent reader can be found to sustain the part. Strangers are sometimes invited to play in these concerts; and on the present occasion two pianoforte pieces, &ldquo;Amitie pour amitie,&rdquo; composed by the performer, and Doneyschock&rsquo;s Rhapsodie in C. Minor, were played by Mr. William Mason of Boston, U. S. A.</p>",,

Toward the end they received valuable assistance in their studies from the veteran maestro al piano, Herr Saar, a well-known figure <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>at Covent Garden for upward of a quarter of a century. This excellent musician&mdash; a genuine type <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>of the old German school&mdash; was the conductor at Strasburg, and familiar with every note of Wagner's scores. He shared my intense enthusiasm <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>on the subject of Jean de Reszke's <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;predestination'' for the great Wagner roles, and his joy over the approaching advent of the new Walther von Stolzing knew no bounds. I was often present when he came round to the Continental to do a morning's work with the great tenor. His good-humored face would be wreathed in smiles as he sat down to the piano; and when Jean sang the<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;""</span>Probelieder"" or the ''Preislied,"" with a charm <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>that gave them a new meaning, the old accompanist would gaze heavenward through his spectacles with a look of ecstasy that was far more eloquent than words. He objected to the cuts; he cordially disliked the Italian text; but he was aware that both were indispensable, and he had the satisfaction of knowing that we all agreed with him. </span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436352919472,https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofm02kellrich,"<p>At Drury Lane Theatre, March 12, 1796, was the first representation of the ""Iron Chest,"" written by my friend George Colman. The music, composed by Storace, was, I believe, the cause of his premature and lamented death. On the first rehearsal, although labouring under a severe attack of gout and fever, after having been confined to his bed for many days, he insisted upon being wrapped up in blankets, and carried in a sedan-chair to the cold stage of the playhouse. The entreaties and prayers of his family were of no avail, go he would; he went, and remained there to the end of the rehearsal. The agony I suffered, during the time, is beyond my power of description. He went home to his bed, whence he never rose again. The last twelve bars of music he ever wrote, were the subject of the song (and a beautiful subject it is), ""When the robber his victim had noted;"" which I sang in the character of Captain Armstrong. I called upon him the night of the day in which he had been at the rehearsal; he sent for me to his bedside, and pressing my hand, said, ""My dear Mic, I have tried to finish your song, but find myself unable to accomplish it; I must be ill, indeed, when I can't write for you, who have given so much energy to my compositions. I leave you the subject of your song, and beg you will finish it yourself; no one can do it better ; and my last request is, that you will let no one else meddle with it."" Saying these words, he turned on his side, and fell into a slumber; and never, never did I see him more! His memory will for ever live in the hearts of all who have heard his compositions ; for the drafts of true genius, though they may not be honoured so soon as they come due, are sure to be paid with compound interest in the end : this is an old maxim, and, I hope, a true one. He died March the 16th, in the thirty-third year of his age. It is a singular coincidence, that three such great musical geniuses as Purcell, Mozart, and Storace, were nearly of the same age when fate ordained them to their early graves.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

That <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Goring Thomas's charming opera would have <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>fared better&mdash; obtained an abiding-place in the active repertory&mdash; had it been presented in English by <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the same distinguished artists, is also a matter of <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>doubt. Experience has proved that Covent Garden audiences do not care for opera in the vernacular, whether the work be of native or Continental origin; and it is the same, I believe, with <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the audiences of the Metropolitan Opera House in <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>New York. Nor will the prejudice be overcome <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>until the leading singers of the English-speaking countries are perfectly trained in the enunciation of their native tongue and can coax <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>their compatriots into listening with pleasurable appreciation to first-rate native works rendered in the language &ldquo;understanded of the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>people.&rdquo;</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

At dinner he drank too much champagne, and after almost every piece he played he had to retire behind the scenes and be violently ill how he could have played under the circumstances, feeling so uncomfortable, is a marvel to me, as it was also to my father, who always spoke of him with the highest praise and admiration.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mainz

I dined at the Percivals, many enquiries after you from everybody.

Then again, under Anton Seidl 's magic wand, the performance touched at all points a very high level of excellence. Finally, I derived immense pleasure from the novel sensation of hearing Jean and Edouard de Reszke as exponents of Wagner's own text. Their conscientious enunciation of each syllable, their accurate diction, and their admirable accent seemed to impart an added dignity alike to the music and to their impersonations. Even the more cultivated listener might easily have imagined them to be native German singers. Mme. Nordica, too, handled the German words with remarkable facility and confidence. Altogether, it was a most meritorious achievement.</span></p>",,

Chilperic was the first production, with a cast including Herbert Standing, Paulus, Walter Wardroper, Harry Paulton, Camille D'Arville, Agnes Consuelo, Sallie Turner, Madge Shirley, and Sismondi. Hayden Coffin joined the company as a chorister. But opera and extravaganza failed to attract; ballet became the staple fare, with a liberal supplement of music hall ""turns&rdquo;.</span></p>",,

I recollect how perfectly she sang some French pieces and a new romanza (""II primo amore,"" I think it was called) expressly composed for her by Romili. But what dwells most vividly in my memory in connection with this concert is her extreme kindness to my brother Max, who was down in the same programme for a violin solo. The great artist insisted on sitting among the audience to listen to the little English fiddler (then about thirteen); and he had just started his solo when one of his strings broke. He gave one glance of consternation round the room and then incontinently burst into tears. The audience looked half amused ; but Alboni rose from her seat, walked to my brother, and, kissing him upon the forehead, said, loudly enough for every one to hear, ""N'importe, mon petit ami; ne pleurs pas! Get accident-la aurait pu arriver a Sivori lui-meme!"" Whereupon the boy dried his tears, mended his string, and went through his solo with entire success.</span></p>",,

She was the sister of Ferdinand David, professor of the violin at the Leipzig Conservatoire the intimate friend of Mendelssohn, who dedicated his Violin Concerto to him. I find in my diary: ""Sunday, March 10th. After tea went to Madame Dulcken, where I accompanied Steglich (the famous horn player) on the piano. Molique and Berlioz were there. She lives in a fine house; there is a good piano in every room.""</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hector_Berlioz,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harley_Street

He met an immediate response, in the three times &ldquo;Hurrah for Dusseldorf,&rdquo; which the assembled singers immediately raised, and in which they were joined by the multitude without, in cheering loud and long. As soon as silence was restored, the President of the &ldquo;Concordia&rdquo; Society from Bonn, replied to the speech of the Mayor, in the name of the assembled multitude. This speech was also followed with the flourish of trumpets and drums, and the merry shoutings &ldquo;Huzza for Dusseldorf,&rdquo; &ldquo;Huzza for the Burgermeister,&rdquo; &ldquo;Huzza for the singers,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1447880655126,https://archive.org/details/dublindiary00joyc,"<p>I like instrumental music best, better than songs, better than operas, and this seems to me strange as I have absolutely no knowledge of music or of any instrument, and am not much ear. I am very hard to please in operas, perhaps because my ear is confused. I generally look at the shoulders of the people under me so as not to see the acting. Operas seem to me literally screaming farces, and I like best those that are simple or those in which the melody is strange. I have no love for orchestration, and when it makes the voice difficult to hear I abominate it. I consider chiefly (when, that is, it is not playing by itself) as an accompaniment to the singer. I suspect that this is very vulgar, and that in Wagner, for instance, the orchestration is frightfully intellectual, but then I prefer a rich voice to an intellectual singer. In waltzes, polkas, chacones, nocturnes, fugues, bourr&eacute;es, sonatas, and even overtures, I take very genuine pleasure.</p>",,

The distance from her home was about twenty miles by rail, and all along the embankments crowds of miners stood with their wives and children, watching the train go by, and cheering her and waving their caps and handkerchiefs as she passed along. On her arrival at Swansea she was re- ceived by the Mayor and some members of the corporation, and a company of the local volun- teers with their bands playing. She drove in an open carriage with her husband, and other carriages followed with the rest of the artists and her friends staying at the castle, through the streets to the Albert Hall. The ships in the harbour were decked with flags, and on each side of the way, bunting with such mottoes as ""God bless the Queen of Song,"" ""Welcome,"" ""Long live Adelina Patti,"" etc., decorated the route. From the house windows the inhabitants cheered, and likewise the crowds of people in the streets. The Albert Hall at Swansea was crowded to suffocation. She sang several of her favourite songs, and ended with the ever-popular "" Home, Sweet Home,"" which made many of the audience shed tears. Numerous floral offerings which consisted of the choicest flowers were handed to her on the platform. At the end of the concert the Member of Parliament for Swansea made an eloquent speech, in which he thanked her for her generosity and kindness in coming so far to help the hospital. A suitable reply was made for her by a friend. Our return to the railway station was again a scene of enthusiasm and deafening cheering, her castle being reached in time for dinner, and the Diva was happy in having done such good work for the suffering poor.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swansea

It had been long talked of, long expected, and the musical dilettanti of the day were naturally excited by curiosity as to the result of its production. The ""Malek Adel"" of the same composer, although when it was brought out it attained a certain kind of celebrity (chiefly from the renown of a cavatina sung by Rubini), and was even repeated upon the Italian stage in Paris, had long since disappeared from the boards. Nevertheless considerable expectations were still afloat. ""Don Carlos"" was well ""mounted,"" and supported by Grisi, Mario, Lablache, and Fornasari. Like its predecessor, it utterly failed to maintain any prominence. It survived but a very few nights, and then, like ""Malek Adel,"" sank into the vast ""limbo"" of forgotten works. Whatever may have been the real merit of this production, from a managerial point of view it was undeniably a failure. That is to say, it neither attracted the public nor brought money to the treasury. It is by such tests alone that an operatic or a theatrical director can discover what is and is not conducive to the interest of an establishment. The subject of ""Don Carlos,"" it may be stated, was ""sombre"" and lugubrious, and on the first night, Mario and Lablache were both hoarse, wearied by long rehearsals. This could not be otherwise than detrimental to ""first impressions,"" but the artists gallantly supported their conductor's fame on the second night of performance.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

The orchestra of the Royal Opera House is of course excellent, and ranks with the best in Europe. Yet we did not see that it was much superior to that of the Leipzig Gewandhaus. It is somewhat larger, and its pianos are, perhaps, more piano, and its fortes more forte. The great points of excellence, as quality of tone, blending of the different instruments, Piano, Forte, Crescendo, Diminuendo, Sfortzando, Syncopation, &amp;c., are most perfectly brought out, and the most fastidious hearer seems to be compelled to say, enough.</p>",,

Grisi, Mario, Fornasari, and Lablache afforded an admirable quatuor for the performance of this genial opera buffa, the success of which was perhaps even greater than that of ""Linda."" I might now indeed deem myself fortunate, for bringing out in one season two new operas, each of which won such golden opinions. Warned by this second success, the press now grew lavish in their praise of Donizetti. He was declared to have composed his Parisian opera in his ""happiest vein."" It was studded with ""musical beauties,"" and contained ""more marks of originality that most of his works,"" &amp;c., &amp;c. In fact, the tide not only changed, but now flowed strongly in favour of the once despised composer. The racy comic humour of Lablache, and the spirit of Grisi, combined with the pleasant and careful execution of Mario and Fornasari, may have contributed sensibly to a success, nowise certainly promoted by the unusually meagre, flimsy libretto. But, in a musical point of view, the verdict was certainly favourable, and none could better recognise the fact than the fortunate manager.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1432375899241,https://archive.org/stream/recentmusicmusic00mosc,"<p>Yesterday there was a 'Serenata per Canale.' A great wooden vessel, gayly decked with red and white cloth, and illuminated with two pyramids festooned with lamps, floats down the canal when night begins to set in; it is large enough to receive a complete orchestra, two grand pianos, and solo performers; there is singing and flute, fiddle and pianoforte playing, but all in the commonest Italian hum drum style, nothing for the musically-cultivated ear, everything for the beauty-loving eye.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448658878157,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>At about eleven o&rsquo;clock, (Sunday,) the singing societies of Dusseldorf, together with such of the visitors as had already arrived, assembled at the Hotel &ldquo;Prince of Prussia,&rdquo; and at the railroad station near by, to receive the various societies as they came in by the different trains. When all had arrived, or at about twelve o&rsquo;clock, a grand procession was formed, numbering over sixteen hundred singers, which, accompanied by two bands of music, one at the head and the other in the centre, amid the ringing of bells, the roaring of cannon, the waving of banners, and the shrill sound of trumpet and drum, moved triumphant through various streets, to the &ldquo;Rath-haus.&rdquo; Beautiful faces were seen at the windows of the houses, and smiling and joyful countenances, and the waving of handkerchiefs, cheered the spirits of those who were already not a little excited. The square in which the &ldquo;Rath-haus&rdquo; is situated, was filled by the dense crowd, and presented a most brilliant appearance. It was everywhere decked with flowers and flags; and from its centre the statue of the Elector Johann Wilhelm, seemed to look on with approbation, participating in the general joy.</p>",,

The music was light and sparkling, and the selection had been made to afford the great Lablache the opportunity of appearing in a new buffo part; one, too, in which he had been received with delight in Paris. But matter for attack was made out of this piece forthwith. The unfortunate opera buffa (capitally sung and acted by Lablache, Mario, Fornasari, and Madame Castellan), was doomed to execration. ""Desecration of the stage,"" ""insult to the subscribers,"" ""disgraceful buffoonery&rdquo; were among the phrases launched against it with the force of a catapult. And so, ""Don Gregorio,"" with all Lablache's racy humour, could not hold its ground.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

It is some eighty or ninety feet tall with a gilded ball on the summit. Scarce had I reached the arena and secured a standing place before the cannon of the LaFayette Artillery boomed on the air amid the cracking of glass and the banner was unfurled amid the huzzas of the multitude, bearing a palmetto sprinkled with fifteen stars and the legend ""Animis Opibusque parati"" - the gift of the ladies of Charleston. After a prayer, the audience of five thousand was addressed by Theo. Barker amid immense applause. Suddenly one universal shout went up and the banner of the Mercury office, the first one in the city, spread together with a real palmetto were received and placed at the mast head. Dr. Robertson, Mr. Hammond and others spoke amid enthusiastic cheering and delightful music from the band. At one o'clock the crowd retired peaceably to their homes and I muddied (not muddled) went with them. Hurrah for noble South Carolina. She has begun good work. May she ever prosper.</p>

His mother, Lady Dufferin, and her sister, the Duchess of Somerset, were there, and his cousin, Captain Hamilton. Lord Dufferin was in wonderful spirits. He wanted to hear all about the new opera, <em>La Traviata</em>, which had been produced that summer and asked me to play some of the music. Then I had to play his favourite Chopin nocturnes and try over some Swedish and Danish songs he had brought with him from Copenhagen.</p>","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frederick_Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood,_1st_Marquess_of_Dufferin_and_Ava",

On Thursday the 11th of July she appeared (now ""for the last time on any stage"") in a selection of ""scenes"" from ""Anna Bolena."" The part of the afflicted queen had been one of the greatest among her characters. Curiosity had been stimulated to a very powerful degree, and the house was crowded in every part. Madame Pasta appeared, to be hailed with prolonged acclamations. There she stood once more, on the scene of her past glories, ""every inch a Queen."" The spectacle was deeply interesting ; yet it was melancholy, not to say painful, to all who could feel with true artistic sympathy. With the noble presence and the lofty air of the Pasta of old days, she moved like a mighty shadow of the past before the eyes of the spectators; but it was the ""shadow of a shade."" The qualities already mentioned &mdash; the faultless style, the finished phrasing, the grand declamation, were all greeted with something more than respect, whilst the imaginative among the audience may have figured to themselves, like clever geologists, out of the shattered remains of the great vocal Mammoth, a perfect creature of former times. But the general sentiment was one of disappointment and regret. ""Is this all that remains of so wonderful a past?"" was the regretful exclamation of the young. ""It had been better that our hopeful recollection had never been disturbed and dimmed by so sad a ghost,"" thought the old. The ""longing, lingering look behind "" had literally been taken by the great prima donna. That she damaged her great fame by taking it, cannot be said. Her ""last appearance"" was soon forgotten in the turmoil of operatic events; whilst her name still gleams with tra- ditional lustre in the annals of lyric fame.</span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1438857102755,https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofm02kellrich,"<pre>I cannot here refrain from mentioning a circumstance which occurred to me on <br />the 1st of January, 1822; and I sincerely trust there will not appear any <br />impropriety in my doing so, since it records a trait of gracious goodness and <br />consideration in His Majesty, which, although but one of hundreds, is but <br />little known, and richly deserves to be universally so. 

On that evening, the King gave a splendid party at the Pavilion; and His <br />Majesty was graciously pleased to command my attendance to hear a concert <br />performed by his own fine band. His Majesty did me the honour to seat himself <br />beside me, and ask me how I liked the music which I had that day heard in the <br />chapel, amongst which, to my surprise, had been introduced the Chacoone of <br />Jomelli, performed in the ""Castle Spectre,"" but which since has been called <br />the Sanctus of Jomelli, and is now used in all the cathedrals and churches in <br />England and the Continent, under that title. His Majesty was all kindness and <br />condescension in his manner towards me; but his kindness and condescension did <br />not stop there. 

I had taken with me to Brighton that year a god-daughter of mine, Julia Walters,<br />whom I have adopted, and whose mother has been, for years, my housekeeper and <br />watchful attendant during my many severe illnesses. This little girl, at five <br />years old, performed the part of the Child in the opera of ""L' Agnese,"" under <br />the name of Signora Julia. Ambrogetti was so struck with my little protegee, <br />that he begged I would let her play the character, which she did with grace and intel- 
ligence far beyond her years. This child asked me to procure her a sight of the <br />King, and fixed upon the evening in question to press her request, when she <br />might behold him in the midst of his Court, surrounded by all that was brilliant <br />in the land, and in a palace whose splendour, when illuminated, rivalled the <br />magnificence described in the ""Arabian Nights."" 

I told my worthy friend Cramer, the excellent master and leader of His Majesty's <br />private band, the earnest desire of little Julia, and prevailed upon him to <br />admit her behind the organ, with a strict injunction not to let herself be seen; <br />but female curiosity, even in one so young, prevailed; and after the first act <br />of the concert, when the performers retired to take some refreshment, Signora <br />Julia crept from her hiding-place behind the organ, and seated herself between <br />the kettle drums. The King was sitting on a sofa, between the Princess Esterhazy <br />and the Countess Lieven; and though the orchestra was at a distance, His <br />Majesty's quick eye in a moment caught a glimpse of the little intruder. 

""Who is that beautiful little child?"" said the King; ""Who brought her here?"" <br />and immediately walked to poor Julia, and asked her who she was. ""I belong to K,"" <br />said Julia. ""And who the deuce is K?"" said His Majesty. I was seated quite at <br />the farther end of the room, conversing with Sir William Keppell; and the <br />moment I saw what was going on, I requested Sir William to go to the King, and <br />say that the child belonged to me, which he with great good-nature did. 

His Majesty kissed poor little Julia; and taking her into his arms, threw her <br />over his shoulder, and carried her across the room to me, and placed her in 
a chair by my side, saying, with the greatest condescension, ""Why did you leave <br />the child in the cold? Why not bring her into the room? If she be fond of music, <br />bring her here whenever you like.""

This act of kindness, consideration, and goodness, was duly appreciated by all <br />who witnessed it, and by me will be ever remembered with the most respectful <br />gratitude. On the following evening, when I again had the honour of a command <br />to the palace, His Majesty was pleased to inquire after my pretty little girl. </pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brighton

An appointment was made, and one morning we found ourselves in the presence of the ""king of violinists"" at the house of his late brother, Henry Joachim, with whom he always resided when staying in London. I do not know which of us was the more nervous, Max or myself (I was there as his accompanist); but I do know that he utterly failed to do himself justice. After he had played a page or two of one of Rode 's concertos, Herr Joachim stopped him and asked whether he intended making ""fiddling"" his profession. ""Yes,"" meekly replied my brother. ""Well, in that case,"" continued the great man, in not unkindly tones, ""I don't think you need play to me any more for the present. You have still a great deal to do, apart from learning how to hold your violin properly, and how to keep your elbow to your side when you draw your bow across the strings. But you have talent. When you have studied hard for another year or two, I shall be glad to hear you play again."" After which, he came to see us out at the front door, and we left the house in a not altogether enviable frame of mind. Of myself he barely took any notice; but six years later we were destined to meet under more favorable circumstances, and to begin a friendship which, I am proud to say, has endured without break down to the present time.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Of this latter event a very vivid recollection is retained by all now living, who, as choristers, took part in the service ; for the kind old King presented them each with a guinea, ""to remember,"" as he said, "" that they had been there,"" and, hearing that one boy, through illness, was unable to be present, the King sent his guinea by a companion, saying that his was "" for a remembrance that he had not been there.""</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windsor,_Berkshire"

The part was considered the best, as it had been the most celebrated of all the great impersonations of Jenny Lind, whose last performance of it was recent in the memory of all the habitues of Her Majesty's Theatre. The task of Madame Sontag, under such circumstances, was bold, almost hazardous; but again she triumphed. Her charm in the part was so great, that all thought of comparison was effaced from the minds of her listeners. The new Amina was hailed as rapturously as if no rival &mdash; much less one who was considered beyond the reach of competition &mdash; had ever existed; and, in spite of all prepossessions, her powers as an actress were now universally declared equal to her finished style as a cantatrice. Her rapidly rising progress in public estimation was as steady and sure as her debut had been brilliant.</span></p>",,

There was a concert of music in the next room, which (the door being open) we heard in a very agreeable manner. The King walked backwards and forwards between the rooms; had a great deal of conversation with the Duchess of Portland; and did me the honour of sharing it with me sometimes. We had much talk, particularly about music; and his Majesty condescended to order those pieces of music to be played that he called my favourites. The Duchess of Portland sat on the Queens right hand, and I on her left.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Delany,http://dbpedia.org/resource/England

""The Germans, in composing, think too much of science, but are unmindful of that which touches the heart. This fault is also shared by the French composers: all their operas want grace and gaiety."" On the appearance of the opera ""L'Irato"" which is written in the Italian style, Napoleon, ignorant as to who the composer was, begged Mehul to be present. After some demur he consented. The overture was much applauded, and the Emperor observed to Mehul, ""Now, you see, there is nothing like Italian music."" The opera then proceeded, and was throughout much admired by the audience; and when at the end the authors of the piece were called before the curtain, Mehul, the composer, and Marsollier, the writer of the piece, appeared, and were received with boisterous applause. The Emperor, delighted, sent for Mehul, and cried out, in a tone loud enough to be heard by many present, ""Attrapez moi toujours de meme, mon cher Mehul, et je m'en rejouirai pour votre gloire et mes plaisirs.""</span></p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Napoleon,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

Despite her twenty-three years upon the stage, this brilliant artist was now also at her best; her voice had lost none of its freshness, and the piquant grace of her style and the marked originality of her conceptions were even more striking than before. Her Selika I can best describe in a single word as a &ldquo;dream&rdquo; &mdash; a supreme achievement to be mentioned in the same breath with the Bosina of Adelina Patti and the Marguerite of Christine Nilsson. Supported by Mierzwinsky as Vasco da Gama, Lassalle as Nelusko, Bagagiolo as Pedro, and Valleria as Inez, Pauline Lucca's performance in &ldquo;L'Africaine&rdquo; is to be folded in the lavender of one's memory.&nbsp; </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""><br /></span></span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

Good music is undoubtedly appreciated by a greater part, comparatively, of the people here, than in America; but if one may judge from appearances at this festival, the majority still prefer a good laugh to good music, and mere comic acting to classic song.

On joining him at Manchester the afternoon of the premiere, I found him in very low spirits. He was not satisfied with the Carl Rosa artists, and fully anticipated a fiasco for the English representation of &ldquo;La Boheme&rdquo;. I assured him that Carl Rosa singers (as distinguished from Carl Rosa &ldquo;directors&rdquo;) did not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;fail&rdquo;; the intelligence and ensemble of the company were bound to pull him through.

It is not a Papal, but a Protestant church; the Lutherans use the crucifix, candles, &amp;c., though less than the Romanists.

This was followed by a choir piece, sung without any accompaniment, by a choir of men and boys, and without much effect. The choir had not power sufficient for so large a building. An interlude of a few minutes upon the organ followed, when a chorale was sung by the congregation, accompanied with full organ. The congregation was not yet large, but the people were constantly coming in, and it was fast increasing. Still the effect of the general singing was quite animating. This being concluded, the minister began his part of the service, by chanting a short sentence, which was immediately responded to by the choir; and again the minister, and again the response. By this time the church was well filled. From an estimate that I made, I concluded that there could not be less than about twenty-five hundred people present. The organ loft, too, capable of accommodating, perhaps, a hundred, was completely filled with vocal and instrumental performers, including the common orchestral instruments, with trumpets and drums conspicuous. When the slow solemn chant was ended, the organ burst out in a loud minor voluntary, which continued three or four minutes, during which time the violins, violoncellos, double basses, and wind instruments tuned. Yet so carefully was this done, that it was hardly perceptible, for the organ was giving out its full progressive chords, so as to nullify the tuning process, at least upon the ears of the people. Tune being secured, the choir, with organ and orchestra accompaniment, sung a motette, or hymn by Beethoven. This had been announced in the newspapers of Saturday, and was, I suppose, with many an object of attention. It occupied, perhaps, fifteen minutes, and was very well done; the drums and trumpets especially doing fine execution in the great church in the forte passages. It closed with a short fugue, in which the points were distinctly taken up and marked. The choir did not number more than from thirty to forty persons, and had not sufficient power for the building; but still the performance was quite effective. I perceived that while most of the people gave close attention to the music, others were not so much interested, and one goodly-looking old man directly in front of me spent the time in reading over his psalm-book. As soon as the motette was concluded, the members of the orchestra took up their instruments and left the house, having nothing to do with the remaining service. And now came the grand singing &mdash; for the great congregation were now together. The organ gave out a choral, when all the people lifted up the loud chorus of praise. The whole house was filled with sound. It was sublime, and I found myself much more moved by this than by the previous choir and orchestra performance. The hymn (486) was indicated on tablets in different parts of the house, and every person had his book in his hand. Even the standers-up in the aisles (for there were hundreds of these) had their books and joined in the song. The singing was in unison; I could not tell, being at the opposite side of the house, whether the choir sang the parts or not; the organ did indeed pour forth full harmony, but even this was vastly overpowered by the multitude of voices &mdash; men&rsquo;s voices, and women&rsquo;s voices, and children&rsquo;s voices, mingled in one mighty torrent of sound, rolling through the high arches like the rush of many waters. At the end of each line of the stanza there was an interlude of a few chords upon the organ, but there was no long interlude at the end of the stanza, as in the American churches. Indeed the hymn seemed to flow along from beginning to end, as a whole, and without interruption. I observed, too, that in the hymn-singing I heard in England, the interludes between the stanzas were very short, and often omitted altogether. A very pleasing effect was produced at the close of this and every choral hymn, thus: as soon as the voices ceased on the last word of the last stanza, every head was inclined forward as in the attitude of prayer, while the organ died away piano, in a very short post-lude of perhaps half or three-quarters of a minute, the people retaining their position until the last sound was heard, when they gently resumed an erect posture. After this followed liturgical prayers, read by the clergyman, for a few minutes; and then the chorale was resumed, another stanza or two of the same hymn being sung to the same chorale as before. After this followed the sermon. I did not understand it, but if one might judge by the appearance of the people, it was good, for they all seemed to give close attention for at least three-quarters of an hour.</p>
<p>When the sermon was ended, and a short prayer offered, &ldquo;Vater unser,&rdquo; the hymn was resumed again, and still another stanza sung to the same tune as before; so that the same tune was sung three times in the same service. A closing prayer of a few words, and the great congregation gradually dispersed, amid the loud rolling of the diapasons.</p>",,

Soon after this I made the acquaintance of the gifted artiste and found her most charming and unassuming. One day when I called on her she asked me to try over some English songs with her, which she has since sung at concerts. When I gave my Diamond Jubilee Con- cert in 1908 she insisted on buying tickets for it, as she was very anxious to hear Madame Patti, whom she had never heard sing. She was, of course, enchanted with the great Diva, and spoke most enthusiastically of Patti' s singing, and was full of veneration for her.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

One of her songs was Gounod's "" Ave Maria,"" with Mademoiselle Anna Lang's violin obbligato.

I had engaged him to come over from Paris and play one of his own concertos, not previously heard here, the now well-known one in G minor, No. 2, which was afterwards to become a favourite piece of all the great pianists at home and abroad. Needless to say, the audience was enchanted. I was thus the first to have given Saint-Saens the opportunity of playing one of his concertos here, and I continued to engage him for three consecutive seasons. None of the London Orchestral Societies gave him the chance of being heard at their concerts, and I am therefore very proud of having brought him before the public.

We wondered what it could be like inside if already yards away we felt every nerve strangely excited At last, in a narrow, dirty little side street we came to some broad stone steps leading to what looked like a mosque [&hellip;] As we entered we faced a large court, ending in a semicircle and surmounted by a high cupola from which was suspended a large, many-armed chandelier, whilst two candelabra stood between the columns on the line between the large court and the two adjoining smaller ones on the right and left. In the middle court there were crouching four old Arabs, each with a little drum between his knees and a small cauldron with glowing coals before him, over which, from time to time, they warmed the skin of the drum to keep it taut. Around those four, also sitting on the floor with their legs crossed, were from fifteen to twenty young men, all dressed in white and turbaned like the rest. It was from those the chanting noise we had heard in the street, emanated. They were &ldquo;singing&rdquo; at the top of their shrill voices passages from the Koran, paying no heed to time or pitch, every one as he listed, whilst the drums unceasingly and in perfect rhythm repeated the one phrase that approached anything like music [&hellip;] </span></span></p>

At the feet of the priest there stood a mysterious-looking wooden chest with finely wrought brass corners. Louder and louder, quicker and quicker grew the noise of the drums and the chanting, and from the moving mass of the men on the wall of the left aisle, describing ever-larger half-circles with their bodies, there commenced to issue deep sighs and groans, ever increasing in frequency and force until the whole building resounded as with the agonized moans of souls in the torment of hell-fire, more terrifying almost than what was to come. </span></span></p>

serenaded on her birthday at Christmas with the strains of the &ldquo;Vorspiel""
to &ldquo;Parsifal,"" of which work he had then completed the first act. The only
question was how to obtain an orchestra. After some reflection, Wagner
determined to procure the services of the celebrated Meiningen performers, but
of course without their conductor, then no other than Dr. Hans von Biilow, Frau
Cosima Wagner&rsquo;s first husband. The project was kept a profound secret, and
young Anton Seidl was forthwith despatched to Meiningen to arrange matters with
the band. He arrived there early in the morning, and went direct to the hotel
at which von Bulow was staying. The worthy doctor was practising, and, being
unacquainted with Seidl, sent out word that he could not see him until eleven
o'clock. Accordingly, at that hour he presented himself at the great pianist's
apartment and was duly ushered into his presence. At the first mention of
Wagner's name von Bulow drew himself up and inquired in an icy tone what it was
that Herr Wagner wanted. Seidl explained the object of his mission.</span><br />The &ldquo;ambassador"" quickly found the leader
of the band, and, the Duke of Meiningen's permission being readily granted, it
was arranged that the men should be at Bayreuth by a certain evening. They
assembled in good time at the Sonne Hotel, where Wagner met them and conducted
a rehearsal of the &ldquo;Vorspiel&rdquo; Early next morning, while Frau Cosima was still
asleep, the heavier instruments were conveyed to Wahnfried, and the players
quietly stationed themselves at their desks in the vestibule and upon the
staircase. When all was ready, Wagner gave the signal, and his much-honored

The part was considered the best, as it had been the most celebrated of all the great impersonations of Jenny Lind, whose last performance of it was recent in the memory of all the habitues of Her Majesty's Theatre. The task of Madame Sontag, under such circumstances, was bold, almost hazardous; but again she triumphed. Her charm in the part was so great, that all thought of comparison was effaced from the minds of her listeners. The new Amina was hailed as rapturously as if no rival &mdash; much less one who was considered beyond the reach of competition &mdash; had ever existed; and, in spite of all prepossessions, her powers as an actress were now universally declared equal to her finished style as a cantatrice. Her rapidly rising progress in public estimation was as steady and sure as her debut had been brilliant.</span></p>",,

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448276340407,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>I have this evening had an opportunity of attending one of the famous subscription concerts in this city, known as the Gewandhaus Concerts.</p>
<p>The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance.</p>
<p>A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor&rsquo;s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven.</p>
<p>It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven&rsquo;s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse.</p>
<p>The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus &mdash; ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra.</p>
<p>Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one&rsquo;s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity.</p>
<p>The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera &ldquo;Aerio&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.&rdquo; It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances.</p>
<p>In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, &ldquo;Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn&rsquo;s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, &ldquo;Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, &ldquo;Der Wassertrager,&rdquo; by Cherubini.</p>
<p>Gade&rsquo;s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study.</p>
<p>The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause.</p>
<p>On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world.</p>
<p>I will mention one or two things about the audience:</p>
<p>1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus.</p>
<p>2d. Ladies were all in full dress.</p>
<p>3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places.</p>
<p>On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated.</p>

The performance was decided on and Victor Hugo was invited to come and hear it.</p>
<p>The performance was splendid-- a large orchestra, the magnificent organ, eight harps, and eight trumpets sounding their flourishes in the organ loft, and a large chorus for the peroration of such splendor that it was compared to the set pieces at the close of a display of fireworks. The reception and ovation which the crowd gave the great poet, who rarely appeared in public, was beyond description. The honeyed incense of the organ, harps and trumpets was new to him and pleased his Olympian nostrils.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

Signor Corri was the first singing-master in Edinburgh ; his wife and sister sang at the Subscription Concerts, which he carried on there with great eclat. They were natives of Strasburg and Alsace, and sang duets most pleasingly. Signor Corri had also a large magazine, for the sale of music and musical instruments ; he was in partnership with his brother, a very worthy man, married to a beautiful woman, a native of Rome. At these concerts, I heard a Signer Urbani, a good professor, and, like his countryman, David Rizzio, very partial to Scotch melodies, some of which he sang very pleasingly, though in a falsetto voice. There was also a young Italian, of the name of Stabilini, a first-rate violin; and a Signor Cecchi, a good violoncello performer. I used to meet them at the house of the great Scotch physician, Dr. Cullum, who was devoted to music, and gave the professors of it the greatest encouragement. His hospitable mansion was always open to them, and his much-esteemed professional advice always gratuitously at their service.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh

Who but Chopin was able to write nocturnes? He lived by night. He is returned to Paris from some revel that has been brilliant, and is standing at this hour in his attic looking out at the open-dormer window. The huge pulse of life is lulled, darkness like a heavy cloud lowers overhead, and straddled roofs shine beneath from recent rain. A melody is awake and moves with hushed weariness through the black harmonies of night, easily, almost inaudibly, changing to higher keys till light begins to be seen. It was associated in my mind with a memory. Aunt Josephine played it for me in her house on the North Strand when long after midnight I was about to leave to come home to Cabra.</p>",,

To repeat his own words, addressed to myself: ""You have so overwhelmed me with kindness in this country that I shall be quite sorry when the time comes for me to leave you."" The programme comprised his ""Angelus"" for strings, a chorus for female voices, a pianoforte piece, and some songs; and finally, amid a scene of great excitement, he himself played the finale of Schubert's ""Divertissement a la Hongroise"" and his own Hungarian rhapsody in A minor. This glorious treat furnished the crowning feature of a memorable evening doubly memorable because it was the last time but one that Franz Liszt touched his instrument in the presence of a public or quasi-public assemblage.</p>",,

The appearance of a negress singer had long been announced. In Paris, under the name of the ""Black Malibran,"" this ""lady of colour"" had certainly excited a considerable sensation. M. Theophile Gautier, who wrote to me respecting this interesting personage, thought she would suit England: ""Elle a surtout ce qui plait en Angleterre: l'excentricite, la nouveaute, et l&rsquo;originalite.""

Donna Maria Martinez, the ""Black Malibran,"" it was generally made known, was the child of freed negroes, had been carefully brought up and well instructed in a Spanish house, and early grounded in musical science. Wedded to a Spanish sea captain (not a ""gentleman of colour "" it may be presumed), she had suffered reverses of fortune, and had made her musical attainments avail- able by public singing. The ""Black Malibran"" figured in a new divertissement, entitled ""Les Delices du Strait,"" as ""a wandering minstrel,"" singing to the Sultana. Her Cuban, and more exclusively Spanish melodies, were full of original charm. She accompanied herself upon the guitar, of the powers of which she was evidently a mistress. Her execution was excellent; her spirit and animation were undeniable; her voice was sweet, pure, and true, although too weak for the vast arena of her Majesty's Theatre. She was vehemently applauded and encouraged. But the whole performance was ""small,"" almost to meagreness; and although it might well be regarded as a piquant musical curiosity, it failed in any real power of attraction. This black phantom flitted briefly over the stage, to disappear for ever, as a far more illustrious ""shade"" had recently done before her.</span></p>",,

The first change was made by the revival of the ""Montecchi e Capuletti"" of Bellini, for Madame Frezzolini as Giulietta, and Mademoiselle Parodi as Borneo. So many years had passed since Bellini's version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" had appeared on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, that it was received with a certain amount of curiosity, not to say as a novelty. Pleasing as are Bellini's, melodies throughout this opera, its disjointed and unsatisfactory libretto had always caused it to fail of securing a hearty welcome in a theatre where Shakspeare was involuntarily more or less in men's thoughts. But the combined attraction of Frezzolini and Parodi, both of whom were admirably ""suited"" in this opera, carried it through with very considerable eclat. The same occasion was used for the reappearance of Gardoni (the fourth successful primo tenore in my abundant list for the season), in the somewhat unsatisfactory part of Tebaldo; when this popular favourite was welcomed back with more than usual cordiality. Some of the enthusiasm demonstrated upon this occasion was due to a false report which had been spread about and had appeared in the public prints, respecting the death of this accomplished young tenor at St. Petersburg, where he had a winter engagement. The intelligence had been frequently given as authentic, although Gardoni had never had a moment's illness.</span></p>",,

It contains about sixty instruments, and we were truly glad to see that the use of the old-fashioned military band instruments is continued. Here were Oboi, Faggotti, Clarinetti, Corni, as well as all the modern brass instruments. The band usually play an overture and one or two smaller pieces daily, at the hour above mentioned; and in its performances, it is sufficient to say, that the characteristics of good orchestral playing are carefully observed.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Berlin

My friend Johnstone took great pains to instruct me in the brogue, but I did not feel quite up to the mark; and, after all, it seems my vernacular phraseology was not the most perfect; for, when the opera was over, Sheridan came into the green-room, and said, ""Bravo ! Kelly; very well, indeed; upon my honour, I never before heard you speak such good English in all my life."" This sarcastic compliment produced much laughter from the performers who heard him*.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

In the third act, when Young Meadows resumes his real character, and comes into the garden to meet Rosetta, I took out my watch to look at the hour, and sang, ""I wonder this girl does not come;"" the fat lady in the stage-box instantly set off in a horse laugh, and said to those around her, loud enough to be heard in the gallery, "" Why, look there ; la ! the fellow has got a watch."" I could not bear this ; I admit I lost my temper ; but I walked up to the box, and said, "" Yes, Madam, it is a gold watch, and reckoned one of the best in England,"" putting it close to her ; my friend Fawcett was standing at the side of the stage at the time, and often since has spoken of it : the lady was violently hissed, and ever after, when she came to the theatre, conducted herself with becoming decency. The same lady, I was told, behaved one night so rudely to Mr. John Kemble, that he was obliged to address her from the stage, and say that he could not proceed with his part unless she would cease interrupting him with her noise ; the audience insisted on her leaving the box ; a party of her friends took her part, and wanted Kemble to apologise to her, which he refused to do, and left the theatre.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wakefield

Imagine Jean de Reszke at this time as Raoul! Always remarkable for its refinement, distinction, and passionate warmth, his impersonation was just then peculiarly imbued with the spirit of the true Meyerbeer school. Alike in a vocal and a histrionic sense, it was supremely great. His ""velvety"" tones, fresh, clear, and mellow as a bell, were emitted with an unsparing freedom that would thrill the listener not once, but twenty times, in the course of a single scene. There was no saving up for the last act then; it was &ldquo;laissez aller"" throughout, with plenty to spare at the finish. And what tenderness, withal, in that famous grand duet of the fourth act! Not Mario himself had phrased the &ldquo;Tu m'ami, tu m'ami!"" (this was still an Italian performance) with a greater wealth of delicious surprise and pent-up adoration. Little wonder that Nordica nearly lost her head through nervousness and emotion. It was the very first time she sang Valentine; she had studied the part in less than a week, and for a young, inexperienced artist,&mdash; so youthful, so pretty, so winning that she fascinated others beside Raoul,&mdash; her achievement was in the highest degree creditable. The fifth act, generally suppressed in England, was on this occasion duly given, but the noise of the firing and the smoke from the gunpowder proved too much even for Augustus Harris.

Said Mr Stoll to me a while ago: ""I awaited the arrival of my star in terror; but he came not. I went round to his lodgings, and, in a sordid room, found him, huddled up in an arm-chair, half comatose. I shook him, and cried: 'Come, Mr Leyboume! All your friends are waiting for you.' I shall never forget the bitterness of his outburst. 'My friends!' he cried. 'I have no friends! Curse the men who called themselves my friends! 'I got him to the hall, and there, again, he just collapsed into an arm-chair. I thought it all hopeless. But when the band played his opening music, he sprang to his feet, a new man, full of life and charm. He sang five songs, and was applauded to the echo. George Leyboume was, to me, the exposition of the word' personality.' I had seen nothing like it before. I have seen nothing like it since. I suppose I never shall. It was wonderful. To me, in our brief intercourse, he had been disagreeable. But he took his audience in both hands; took it to his heart, charmed and helpless.""</span></p>",,

The night of my debut, the Earl of Uxbridge was the Director ; the songs allotted to me by his Lordship, were "" Jephtha's rash vow,"" and the laughing song from L' Allegro, "" Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee."" The late Mr. Linley heard me sing it over and over again, and to his masterly instruction I owed the indulgence which I received. In singing sacred music I was aware of its value, and fagged at the tenor songs of Handel with unremitting assiduity. Mr. Joah Bates conducted those concerts, and was supposed to understand Handel perfectly ; he was an excellent performer on the organ ; Cramer was the leader, and Cervetto principal violoncello. The concerts were then held in Tottenham Street, and their Majesties and the Royal Family were constant attendants ; but, although it was difficult to become a subscriber, the room was always crowded. I was lucky enough to meet with the approbation of Mr. Bates, in the recitative of "" Deeper and deeper still;"" my next song was the laughing one. Mr. Harrison, my predecessor at those concerts, was a charming singer : his singing "" Oft on a plat of rising ground ;"" his "" Lord remember David ;"" and "" O come let us worship and fall down,"" breathed pure religion. No Divine from the pulpit, though gifted with the greatest eloquence, could have inspired his auditors with a more perfect sense of duty to their Maker than Harrison did by his melodious tones and chaste style ; indeed, it was faultless ; but in the animate songs of Handel he was very deficient. I heard him sing the laughing song, without moving a muscle ; and determined, though it was a great risk, to sing it my own way, and the effect produced justified the experiment: instead of singing it with the serious tameness of Harrison, I laughed all through it, as I conceived it ought to be sung, and as must have been the intention of the composer : the infection ran ; and their Majesties, and the whole audience, as well as the orchestra, were in a roar of laughter ; and a signal was given from the royal box to repeat it, and I sang it again with increased effect. Mr. Bates assured me, that if I had rehearsed it in the morning, as I sang it at night, he would have prohibited my experiment. I sang it five times in the course of that season by special desire.</p>",,

This by the way&rdquo; &ndash; I placed all my hopes of satisfaction in my dealings with the orchestra, which is very devoted to me, and in the hope of a fine performance for its own sake. In particular I counted very much on being allowed two rehearsals for the next concert, as I hoped it would give me the opportunity of getting the orchestra really well in hand. But yesterday&rsquo;s first rehearsal dashed that hope as it showed me that two rehearsals are too few for my purpose. I had to pass over many important points and I see that I shall never be able to make up in just one more rehearsal, so I shall have to be satisfied with no more than a relatively good performance of the Ninth Symphony.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Wagner,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

First of all, nothing could exceed my surprise and admiration; his constant and venturesome flights, his newly discovered source of flageolet tones, his gift of fusing and beautifying subjects of the most heterogeneous kind; all these phases of genius so completely bewildered my musical perceptions, that for several days afterwards my head seemed on fire and my brain reeled. I never wearied of the intense expression, soft and melting like that of an Italian singer, which he could draw from his violin, and dazzled as I was, I could not quarrel with him for adopting the 'maniera del gatto', a term of opprobrium, showing how averse the Italians are to this style, which I dislike so intensely that I should only like to hear it once in every leap year. Suffice it to say, my admiration of this phenomenon, equally endowed by nature and art, was boundless. Now, however, after hearing him frequently, all this is changed; in every one of his compositions I discover the same effects, which betrays a poverty of invention; I also find both his style and manner of playing monotonous. His concertos are beautiful, and have even their grand moments; but they remind me of a brilliant fire-work on a summer's eve, one flash succeeding the other - effective, admirable - but always the same. His 'Sonate Militaire', and other pieces have a southern glow about them, but this hero of the violin cannot dispense with the roll of the drum; and completely as he may annihilate his less showy colleagues, I long for a little of Spohr's earnestness, Baillot's power, and even Mayseder's piquancy.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

One was the first production in London of Wagner's ""Lohengrin""; the other, the first appearance there of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. The former was regarded almost in the light of an experiment. Never before had an opera by Wagner been performed at Covent Garden. In 1870 his ""Fliegende Holl&auml;nder"" had been given at Drury Lane, under the Italian title of ""L'Ollandese Dannato"" (Luigi Arditi conducting), but without any very marked success. And now here was ""Lohengrin,"" a more advanced example of the composer 's method, about to claim the suffrages of a public still notoriously unprepared for the comprehension or enjoyment of what was generally described as the ""music of the future."" Yet, thanks to the growing numbers of the German community, the event aroused intense excitement, and the opera-house was packed to overflowing. I think it was the worst performance of ""Lohengrin"" ever seen in an important theatre. Albani (then in her third season) made a sympathetic Elsa; Nicolini presented a heroic-looking Lohengrin and sang wonderfully well, considering how completely out of his element he was in Wagnerian opera; and Cotogni did creditably as Telramund. But the remainder of the cast were beneath notice, while the chorus sang dreadfully out of tune, and the orchestra, under Vianesi, did its best to drown the singers throughout. Yet, in spite of these drawbacks, the beauty of the music exercised its inevitably powerful sway, and the opera was received with a warmth that grew and grew till it culminated in a tremendous climax of enthusiasm. The ""tooth-and-nail"" opponents of Wagner, who flourished exceedingly in London at this time, were simply dumfounded. In all probability, ""Lohengrin"" was as new to them as it was to Covent Garden habitues, and they did not know whether to be more astonished at the subtle fascination of the music or at the ease with which its charm and significance had been grasped by an ""unripe"" public.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

He lived in a house overlooking some public gardens not far from the royal palace, and on the way thither Harris confided to me for the first time that he was not quite sure whether he ought to have engaged the man we were then going to see, or his brother, Marino Mancinelli, who was the conductor at the Lisbon Opera-house, and, according to some people, the more gifted of the two. On this point I was happily able to reassure my friend. I had not seen both brothers ; but, when at Bologna in 1879, I had seen Luigi Mancinelli direct at the Teatro Comunale a remarkably fine performance of Gounod's &ldquo;Faust"" (with a Covent Garden soprano. Mlle. Turolla, as Margherita), and I had considered him a chef-d^orchestre of the first order. Harris was able quickly to confirm this opinion for himself by means of a representation of the selfsame work at the Royal Opera-house. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",,

Auber, the director, does not allow more than four or five minutes to each pupil for his playing at the 'Concours'; eight bars, therefore, are taken from the 'tutti' and the half of the first solo jumbled together with the second half of the third. How is it possible to test by such a process the capabilities of the performer?</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

Words or thoughts are not necessary in such a worship as this, which seems to be designed for mere external sensuous impression &mdash; yet there were a few words chanted by the drummers, towards the close of the solemnities.</p>",,

The 37th Division had shouted itself hoarse for days, and was not going to stop now. The 10th R.F. seemed especially hearty, but all did well, as the saying is. And let no man dare to say he knows of what songs the British soldier is really tired. In ordinary moments he will give you 'Here we are again!', 'Who were you with last night?', 'The old garden wall', and lately the almost national 'Keep the home-fires burning', 'When this bloody war is over', and the rest. Indeed we had them all to-night from regiment after regiment on the Plain. But, as I said before I hold it truth that in this war the British soldier, when really moved, will surely give you 'Tipperary'.</p>",,

Selecting "" Hold the Fort,"" then comparatively new in Edinburgh, the audience was requested to join in singing the chorus, "" Hold the fort, for I am coming,"" which they did with such heartiness and such power that I was further convinced that Gospel songs would prove as useful and acceptable to the masses in Edinburgh as they had in the cities of York and Newcastle.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ira_D._Sankey,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh

On the very day of our arrival, however, we had the pleasure of attending a very fine performance of &ldquo;The Musical Union.&rdquo; The following was the programme for the occasion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Quintet, G minor, Mozart.</p>
<p>Allegro, Adagio, Minuet, Finale.</p>
<p>MM. Sivory, Mellon, Vieuxtemps, Oury, and Piatti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Trio, E flat. Op. 70, Beethoven.</p>
<p>Adagio and Allegro, Allegretto, Minuet, Finale.</p>
<p>MM. Hall&eacute;, Sivory, and Piatti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Leider, Mendelssohn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Quintet, Op. 20, Beethoven.</p>
<p>Allegro, Adagio, Minuet and Trio, Presto</p>
<p>MM. Vieuxtemps, Mellon, Oury, Webb, and Piatti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here was a programme worth one&rsquo;s attention, whether the compositions, or the performers be considered. It was interesting to see such artists taking subordinate parts, that the compositions might be as perfectly rendered as possible. It is needless to add that the result did not disappoint expectation. This was the last concert of the Union for the season. Sixteen performances have been given; eight evening concerts, and eight subscription matinees. The Union have secured the very best artists; and three Italians, two Hungarians, two Bohemians, two Belgians, one Bavarian, three Prussians, one Austrian, one Frenchman, and five Englishmen, have been employed. So, it seems as many foreign artists are employed in London as in New York.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Nevertheless, he possessed vocal and histrionic attributes of a very distinguished kind, and chance so willed it that he was destined to ""bridge over&rdquo; to a large extent the interval that separated the final retirement of Mario from the advent (as a tenor) of Jean de Reszke. By birth a Spaniard, and hailing from Pampeluna (the town in which Sarasate was born), Giuliano Gayarre had studied and won his early successes in Italy. He was an exponent of the new quasi-nasal Thirty Years of school of tenor singers, which already had Tamagno for one of its leading protagonists. To my ears his production, on the night he made his debut at Covent Garden (April 7, 1877), sounded strange and not wholly pleasant. Still, the voice traveled well, and he sang the music of Gennaro with so much tenderness, so much charm, allied to genuine dramatic feeling and expression, that the crowded house forthwith accorded him a splendid reception. I declined to join in the general chorus of &ldquo;Another Mario!&rdquo; It struck me as little less than sacrilege to compare with the divine voice of that tenor an organ which could occasionally descend, or ascend, to the utterance of tones that quickly earned the name of the &ldquo;Gayarre bleat.""&nbsp; </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""><br /></span></span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

The late Mr. John Mitchell arranged a Concert Tour for her, of several weeks, in 1856, through the principal cities in England, Scotland, and Wales, and engaged me as accompanist. [...] The concerts on this tour were always crowded; the prices of the tickets were one guinea and half a guinea. In those days there were only a few big concert-halls; the Free Trade Hall at Manchester did not then exist, and Jenny Lind was obliged to sing in the small town-hall there. Perhaps the greatest enthusiasm was shown in the Potteries. The concert took place in the Market Hall, Hanley, before an enormous audience of about 5,000 people. I heard that 2,000 factory hands had paid 2s. 6d. each to hear Jenny Lind. Their applause was tremendous, and at the end they gave three cheers, upon which she waved her handkerchief and kissed her hand.</p>",,

This was the most affecting song of the day; it was indeed much aided by sight, but the effect was to ""enforce tears"" from many an eye.

We made up a little party, and having previously called on Herr Schneider, went by appointment to the Sophrine-Kirche, (the church of which he is the organist,) where we had the pleasure of hearing him for a little more than an hour. He played five of the fugues of John Sebastian Bach &mdash; he cares not to play other music. Bach is his musical Bible, and he has read him so much that he has ceased to take pleasure in inferior or uninspired writers. Bach is musical truth, unmixed with error; it is really interesting to see with what enthusiasm his works are spoken of, played, and heard by the German Musicians. Herr Schneider used no fancy stops, made no see-sawings with the swell, no contrasts of reeds and dulcianas, no high-diddle-diddles in his playing. His appeal is always to the intellectual musician. His great point of excellence, we suppose, is his legato touch, by which the chords are bound together, or melted into one continuous flow of harmony.</p>",,

This was Mme. Melba. For months we had been reading wonderful accounts of Mme. Marchesi&rsquo;s Australian pupil, and curiosity concerning her vocal powers had been roused to a high pitch. It was not actually her first appearance before a London audience. She had sung two years before, under her own name of Mrs. Nellie Armstrong, at a concert at Prince's Hall (now the Prince's Restaurant in Piccadilly) ; but, beyond admiring the quality of her voice, I had not been much impressed by her efforts on that occasion. Augustus Harris also heard her in 1886 at the annual dinner of the Royal General Theatrical Fund, at which he presided. She had been introduced by Mr. Wilhelm Ganz, and sang, of course without fee, the &ldquo;Ave Maria"" of Gounod. But it was not until nearly a year later that Harris was preparing his Drury Lane season, and then, naturally, he gave no thought to ""Mrs. Armstrong,"" who was working hard with Marchesi in Paris. Mme. Melba's initial success at Covent Garden was not wholly unequivocal. The audience, truly, ^ went into raptures and gave her an enthusiastic reception. But in the light of calmer judgment the critics took exception to certain &ldquo;mannerisms&rdquo; of style; and I, for one, while noting the extraordinary beauty of her timbre and her exceedingly brilliant vocalization, was fain to declare that her singing was &ldquo;to an extent deficient in that indescribable something which we call charm&rdquo;; that &ldquo;her accents lacked the ring of true pathos""; and that, despite admirable intelligence, ""the gift of spontaneous feeling had been more or less denied her."" As an actress she still had everything to learn. In point of fact, it was not during this season that Melba began to build up the pyramid of her real London triumphs. The raising of that structure commenced only after another twelve-months of hard study and practical stage experience. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

Like most disappointed geniuses, he was unable to perceive his own lack of originality. Once he played me a melody in mazurka rhythm a commonplace enough Neapolitan tune which he fondly regarded as an inspiration; and I shall never forget the old gentleman's horror when, a day or two afterward, he caught me strumming his piece by ear upon the piano.

A native of Glasgow and educated at The National Training School for Music in London, he might with all fairness have been termed a British product. He preferred, however, to call himself a German, and had not stood upon an English concert platform since boyhood till he appeared at Queen's Hall under Felix Mottl (April 28, 1896), and gave a magnificent performance of Beethoven's E flat or &ldquo;Emperor"" concerto. He had a cold reception, but after he had played it became evident that the old grievances had been forgotten in the presence of a legitimate virtuoso, of a true artist possessing the fire of unmistakable genius. Personally I admire his playing immensely; and as an interpreter of Beethoven, it is upon the shoulders of d'Albert that the mantle of Rubinstein, to my thinking, has fallen. His place as a composer will have to be decided by a future generation.</span></p>",,

From there I went to Brussels, where the Pro Arte Society had organized a concert of my music. The celebrated Quartet- know under that name (MM. A. Onnou, L. Halleux, G. Pr&eacute;vost, and R. Maas) - with its usual masterly seriousness played my Concertino and my &lsquo;Trois Petites Pi&egrave;ces pour Quatuor &agrave; Cordes&rsquo;, while I myself conducted my &lsquo;Octuor&rsquo;, &lsquo;La Suite de Pulcinella&rsquo;, and my opera &lsquo;Mavra&rsquo;, the vocal parts of which had been carefully studied and prepared by the singers before my arrival with the help of that enthusiastic Belgian musicians, Paul Collaer. I give all these details because I retain a grateful memory of the Pro Arte group for this concert, organized in a highly artistic fashion, which enabled me to present my work, especially &lsquo;Mavra&rsquo;, under conditions which I could not have wished better.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Igor_Stravinsky,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antwerp
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1431435429637,https://archive.org/details/mylifesacredsongs00sank,"<p>On Sunday evening, October 8, 1871, we were holding a meeting in Farwcll Hall, which was crowded to the doors. At the close of his address Mr. Moody asked me to sing a solo ; and standing by the great organ at the rear of the platform I began the old, familiar hymn, "" To-day the Saviour calls."" By the time I had readied the third verse, <em>To-day the Saviour calls /&nbsp;For refuge fly / The storm of justice falls / And death is nigh</em>, my voice was drowned by the loud noise of the fire engines rushing past the hall, and tolling of bells, among which we could hear, ever and anon, the deep, sullen tones of the great city bell, in the steeple of the old court-house close at hand, ringing out a general alarm.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago

""Roberto il Diavolo"" was duly licensed, and the eventful night arrived. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">Rarely was ever seen such an excitement even at that focus of excitement &mdash; Her Majesty's Theatre. The crowd at the doors might have led to the suspicion of an emeute, in a capital less orderly than London; and the struggle for entrance was violent beyond precedent &mdash; so violent, indeed, that the phrase, ""a Jenny Lind crush,"" became a proverbial expression. Nor was this crowd the result of a hasty gathering. From an early hour in the afternoon, the Haymarket became so thronged as to be impassable to pedestrians. As for the file of carriages, it seemed as interminable as it was dense. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">The brilliant appearance of the house inside was increased by the presence of the Queen and Prince Albert, the Queen Dowager, and Duchess of Kent, who had all come to witness the debut of Jenny Lind. </span></p>

For a few moments she appeared bewildered and ""scared,"" but her self-possession returned. Her very first notes seemed to enthral the audience. The cadenza at the end of her opening air &mdash; the whole of which was listened to with a stillness quite singular &mdash; called down a hurricane of applause. From that moment her success was certain. The evening went on, and before it ended Jenny Lind was established as the favourite of the English opera public. Voice, style, execution, manner, acting &mdash; all delighted. The triumph was achieved. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">At the end of the performance, the Queen, who during the entire evening had repeatedly manifested her extreme satisfaction, expressed to me her admiration in a tone and manner that showed how deep an impression had been made upon her.

I conducted the overture to Weber's<em> Euryanthe</em>, the C minor pianoforte concerto of Beethoven played by Mlle Marie Krebs (she was the daughter of Kapellmeister Krebs, of the Dresden Opera, and a very fine player), and the ""Friedensfeier"" overture by Reinecke, the conductor of the famous Gewandhaus Concerts at Leipzig, besides conducting the charming vocal pieces by Mlle Marimon and Mlle Scalchi, both from Covent Garden. Dr. Wylde conducted one of Beethoven's symphonies. Everything went without a hitch and I received kind congratulations from everybody, and was more than glad of the opportunity of conducting such a fine band of musicians.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span style=""line-height: 115%; font-family: Courier; font-size: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-family: Courier;"">The final rehearsal for the opening concert of the festival took place at the Albert Hall on May 5. Wagner had himself chosen the programmes. He was to conduct each first part, consisting of selections from all his operas, from &ldquo;Rienzi&rdquo; to &ldquo;Tristan""; while Hans Richter, who now made his first appearance in England, was to direct the excerpts from &ldquo;Der Ring des Nibelungen"" that formed each second part. Most of the preliminary work had been done under Mr. Dannreuther, in whom Wagner reposed great confidence. All that remained was to give the finishing touches and for the composer-conductor to accustom himself to the vast auditorium and the huge crescent-shaped phalanx of orchestral players spread before him. From the outset, as it seemed to me, he failed to place himself en rapport with either. The abnormal conditions appeared completely to upset him. In a word, he succumbed there and then to a severe attack of Albert Hall stage fright&mdash; an illness familiar to nearly every artist on stepping for the first time upon the platform of that gigantic amphitheatre. However, after a glance of astonishment round the empty hall, and a few whispered words to Wilhelmj, and yet a few more to Hans Richter (who was posted beside the conductor's desk), the great man raised his baton and gave the signal for the start. The inaugural piece was the &ldquo;Kaisermarsch,"" and it was well chosen for the purpose. Its pompous and sonorous strains, proceeding with stately rhythmical movement throughout, were perfectly calculated to show off the imposing volume of the big orchestra in such a building as that. It gave no trouble, and the effect was superb. But, unluckily, instead of imbuing Wagner with a little confidence, this preludial essay left him more palpably nervous than before. </span></p>

Here, I confess, I looked for something exceptional. I had always understood that Wagner was a fine conductor, at least of works with which he was in true sympathy, and I expected his reading of the &ldquo;Dutchman"" overture to be in the nature of a revelation. Imagine, then, my disappointment and sorrow when it resulted in a complete breakdown! Twice&mdash;nay, thrice&mdash; did he make a fresh start, while Mr. Dannreuther and Mr. Deichmann (the faithful leader of the second violins) took it by turns to translate his complaints and instructions to the orchestra. But it was of no avail. He utterly failed either to indicate or to obtain what he wanted, and at last, in sheer despair, he threw down his stick and requested Richter to do the work for him. Well do I remember the sharp round of applause with which the band greeted the Viennese conductor as he mounted the rostrum. It was thoughtless&mdash;unkind, if you will; for it must have smote with unpleasant sound upon the ears of the sensitive composer. But the overture went without a hitch. It was played as I had never heard it played before.</span></p>",,

These are not gilded, as with us, but are of the natural color of the metal. The choir for the ordinary service consists of a few boys; perhaps a man or two, though I believe usually only boys. By the ordinary service, I mean that which includes no music except singing of the hymns, or chorales, which is always done by all the people. There is always an introductory motette sung by the choir, without any accompaniment; and when this is sung there is an extra choir, numbering say forty or fifty, and all the parts are represented, boys singing soprano. There is also, every other Sabbath morning, a motette by some of the great composers, performed with full orchestral accompaniments; and for this the number of the choir is still increased. But as soon as the singing is over, the members of the orchestra and choir all leave, with the exception of the boys, retained for the leading of the congregational chorales.</p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448285913012,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>The last Gewandhaus concert was one of peculiar interest. The band was in the most perfect order, and the programme was unusually attractive; though great variety of music, both with respect to authorship and character, is always presented to the patrons of this celebrated series of concerts. The Symphonie was by Mozart in Eb major; it is less noisy, flighty and diffuse than some more modem compositions, but not less intelligible or beautiful. The adagio is particularly melodious, elegant and attractive.</p>
<p>A scene and arie from &ldquo;Orpheus,&rdquo; by Gluck, followed. Gluck is a decided favorite here, and especially as a dramatic writer stands among the very first.</p>
<p>The third piece was a concerto for violin, by Beethoven, performed by Herr Concertmeister F. David. This concerto, worthy the reputation of its author, was finely rendered by the violinist, and received with a hearty applause. It is very long, but it does not tire for it is full of variety, and there is enough to admire, both in the principal and in the accompaniment. Two quite long cadenzas, composed by the performer, containing each an ingenious recapitulation of the thoughts, or rather allusion to the various figures of the movement in which the cadenza occurred, were introduced, with excellent taste and skill.</p>
<p>The second part of the concert consisted of &ldquo;Die erste Walpurgisnacht,&rdquo; a ballad by Goethe, set to music by Mendelssohn. A choir of about one hundred and fifty voices sang the choruses (and there is much chorus in the piece) with admirable promptness and energy. The music is difficult, both for vocalists and instrumentalists; it is one of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s strong pieces, and is full of his peculiar harmonies. It is mostly very loud, with an abundance of instruments of noise, and extra double drums for earthquake, volcano, and thunder; though there is most acceptable relief in occasional piano passages. Although Mendelssohn does not belong to the noisy school, yet he has shown in the Walpurgisnacht, that if he had chosen to do so he might have cast quite into the shade, or thundered out of existence, all the Verdis of modern times.</p>",,

The performance was, as formerly, slightly dashed with some interpolated music; instead of the beautiful romance of the Page there was a sentimental vaudeville song, at the wedding a trivial march, anything but Spanish, but as entracte we had the genuine Mozart Romance. Roger had reappeared in the 'Favorita'; he is an admirable singer, with a full-toned voice, but he and all his colleagues here adopt that dreadful 'tremolo,' which they in professional language call 'vibrando'; in addition to that we often hear regular bawling, and the louder it is the louder they are applauded. The last duet was repeated three times, the bawling increased each time, and with it the applause.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

<p>I have been to day to hear Sir Gore Ouseley's little boy, and never was I so affected by anything in my life. I can find no words to express my astonished delight when I saw the little fellow, only six years old, sit down to the pianoforte, and commence an extemporaneous performance, which baffles all description. His large dark eyes lighted up, his whole soul seemed intent upon what he was about, and yet with all this there was such a genuine childish simplicity. I could not say half of what I feel.</p>
<p>I am afraid this will be thought an exaggeration, but I never was an admirer of wonderful children. I have seen many who had extraordinary execution upon an instrument, but God has given this child an intuitive knowledge of the most hidden mysteries of sound&mdash;a creative power perfectly organized that surpasses belief.</p>
<p>Read the accounts of Mozart's infancy and you have read this child's, I sat down to the piano, and while his mother held him at a distance, I endeavoured to puzzle him by the most intricate modulations, but he not only instantly named the key I was playing in, but followed every change (even when an enharmonic transition rendered it almost inappreciable to the ear) with the rapidity of thought,&mdash;he knew it, but he knew not why.</p>
<p>In the course of playing I struck the chord of the sharp 6th&mdash;the German 6th as called by some writers, and upon resolving it in the usual way he started up and cried out ""that is the sharp 6th in the key of C minor, and I can dissolve it another way."" He ran to the piano, and without a moment's hesitation struck the chord, and proceeded to resolve it in a most abstruse but perfectly correct manner, and then went on modulating till he brought it back to the original key. He played me numbers of the airs he had written, all distinguished by the exquisite taste and plaintiveness of their character, some marches loud and lively with an evident idea of orchestral effect in their arrangement ; indeed orchestral and dramatic effect pervades every note he plays.</p>
<p>I can never forget the impression this scene made upon me. I am not ashamed to say that it affected me to tears.</p>
<p>May he live to be a second Mozart is my sincere wish; may he live to prove that an Englishman can excel in the most divine of Sciences as he can in all the rest.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448923619461,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>Rev. Mr. Villiers, the clergyman of this parish, is not only a very popular, but a very excellent and evangelical preacher; he has a large congregation, and the service throughout, on Sabbath last, was highly interesting. Of course the common Episcopal liturgy is used. The psalms are read, but at the end of each psalm, as is very common here, the Gloria Patri is chanted. The Canticles are chanted; though this day the &ldquo;Jubilate Deo&rdquo; was sung in anthem form by the whole congregation. The music was very plain, and rather quick; that is, about as quick as it is convenient to speak the words and observe a distinct and solemn utterance. This Congregational anthem singing is not common, though it is quite practicable. The Canticles were chanted by the whole people, and quite well done. Cadences no slower than the utterance of the words on the chanting note. Both the chanting and the anthem singing this morning afforded sufficient proof of the practicability of these forms of music in congregations; but it must be understood that the anthem was, as we have already said, very plain. We know of but very few sufficiently plain, contained in our American singing books. Two metrical psalms were sung, both well done &mdash; everybody taking a part. The organ was not very well played; the organist seeming rather to adapt himself to choir than to Congregational singing, and making too much variation of stops and of piano and forte in different stanzas. The introductory voluntary was not more than three minutes in length, and there were no interludes between the stanzas of the hymns.</p>",,

That this debut was successful could not be gainsaid. With a fine person, a voice of excellent natural quality, considerable brilliancy of execution (slightly defective perhaps in finish), and energetic powers as an actress, the new prima donna displayed much to justify the warmth of her welcome, and the amount of encouraging applause which followed upon it. Still, the impression made by this great favourite of so many continental audiences was neither strong nor permanent; so hard was it to struggle with advantage against the absorbing prestige which surrounded Jenny Lind.</span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1438943907348,https://archive.org/stream/thirtyyearsofmus00kleiuoft,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Theresa Tietjens was one of the few leading sopranos of her time (Adelina Patti was also one; Emma Albani, another) who could be regarded as equally distinguished interpreters of oratorio and opera. If Lemmens-Sherrington, being a born Englishwoman, could claim to be the legitimate successor of Clara Novello, the position of the dramatic ""star"" of oratorio was no less truly shared by Rudersdorff and Tietjens, until the former took up her residence in the United States (1872), leaving her friend and rival to reign supreme. Hearing Tietjens as I did in oratorio, then, some years before I knew her in opera, I was enabled to judge even more accurately of the wonderful effect that resulted from the combination of her histrionic and vocal powers. On the stage she was a tragedienne in the highest sense of the term. The opportunity of arriving at that conclusion was afforded me by the artist herself when I was in my sixteenth year. And the memory of her glorious impersonation, on that occasion, of Valentine (""Les Huguenots"") has never faded, notwithstanding the profound impression subsequently created by her embodiments of Lucrezia Borgia, Norma, Medea, Donna Anna, Semir amide, Countess Almaviva, Ortrud (one of her later efforts), and, perhaps greatest of all, Leonora in ""Fidelio."" I witnessed two of her performances as Lucrezia Borgia which deserve special mention. The first of these (May 4, 1872) took place at Drury Lane, and was remarkable not only for the exceptional beauty and grandeur of Tietjens's assumption, but because on that night Italo Campanini made his debut in London as Gennaro, and was forthwith hailed (somewhat prematurely, however) as the successor of Mario and Giuglini. The cast further included Faure as the Duke and the ever-delightful Zelia Trebelli as Maffio Orsini, while Sir Michael Costa was the conductor. That was a night of triumphs.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/England

I rehearsed at Pa&euml;r's with Baillot for this evening; then I went, or rather ran, with him at full speed to the Court Chapel in the Tuileries, where we heard a glorious mass by Cherubini, admirably performed, as might be expected with the co-operation of such men as Kreutzer, Baillot, Habeneck. Plantade directed, and Cherubini, who talked to me, was among the audience.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448316411409,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>I have just returned from the morning service. Since Easter, the Motets with Orchestra have been resumed; and to-day, the musical exercises were somewhat different from what they usually are. A Chorale was first sung; but there were not many people to join in. The exercises commence precisely at eight o&rsquo;clock, whether anybody is there or not; and sometimes I have attended public worship, when there was no one present at the commencement, except the singers. After the chorale to-day, the first two movements of a mass by Cherubini were sung, &ldquo;Kyrie,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gloria in excelsis;"" sung, too, not in the vernacular language of the land, but in the original Greek and Latin. The &ldquo;Kyrie &nbsp;commenced with a short Violoncello solo; this is followed by a vocal solo for a Bass voice; after which the other parts join. There is much solo throughout the movement. The music, although very fine, did not appear to me to be very supplicating in its character, nor did it seem to urge the cry for mercy as one might suppose David urged it in the fifty-first psalm. At the close of the &ldquo;Kyrie,&rdquo; the minister, at the altar, chanted a few words of prayer, and then followed a brilliant &ldquo;Gloria in excelsis,&rdquo; mostly in chorus. A fugue is introduced, and the closing movement, to the word Amen, is very animating and triumphant. At the close of the &ldquo;Gloria,&rdquo; the minister chanted the collect for the day with response by the choir; afterwards followed prayer, and then came a very fine Motet or Hymn with Orchestra, composed by Spohr. The moment this closed, choir and orchestra scattered, and were seen no more. The organ instantly announced a chorale, and the loud congregational chorus arose, most cheering, most refreshing, Sabbath-like, a song of worship, solemn, grand, majestic, &ldquo;fit for an angel to play, or a martyr to hear;"" raising one&rsquo;s feelings, and bringing home thoughts of God, heaven, holiness, redemption, and eternity.</p>",,

Doubtless there was a great charm in the new version given to the character by the gifted young singer, who made an unextinguished love for the faithless Pollione more conspicuous than the rage of the deceived and slighted woman &mdash; in the bursts of emotion, which were rather those of agonised reproach than of implacable revenge &mdash; in the mournfulness rather than the passion of her despair, and in the tender resignation of her self-sacrifice there shone the great artist. But the English public, ever loyal to their idols, had been accustomed to another delineation of the slighted Druid Priestess. It had long gazed with emotion upon the burning passion, the withering indignation, and the imposing grandeur of Grisi, and could not be taught to relish a new ""treatment."" The interesting picture of womanly devotion, womanly anxiety and suffering, even of womanly forgiveness, as painted by Jenny Lind, however touching to behold, was evidently contrary to stage tradition. Dilettanti disputed, with psychological acumen on both sides, as to the respective truthfulness of the rival impersonations of Grisi and Jenny Lind ; but the public remained comparatively unimpressed. The attempt, in face of a recognised and familiar type, was thought to have been a mistake. At all events, ""Norma"" could hardly be counted among Jenny Lind's unquestionable triumphs.</span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448277167610,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>These [Musikvereins Euterpe] concerts are similar to the celebrated Gewandhaus Concerts. They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert.</p>
<p>At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power &mdash; a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied.</p>
<p>The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm &mdash; this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart.</p>
<p>The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction &mdash; and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard.</p>
<p>The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one&rsquo;s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber.</p>
<p>It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek&rsquo;s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played &mdash; a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte.</p>
<p>A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit &mdash; relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing &mdash; yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter.</p>
<p>There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert &mdash; it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl. She sang an air from Stradella by Flotow, and also two German songs, the latter by Franz Schubert. A pretty singer, but not superior to several American vocalists.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig

She was one of Mr. Mapleson's surprises. Beyond a very high register, no one expected anything extraordinary from the newcomer. Imagine, therefore, the delight of habitues when they heard for the first time a voice of exquisitely musical quality and bird-like tone, trained to execute the most difficult fiorituri and cadenzas with the utmost care, and capable of running up comfortably to the giddy height of an F in alt. Moreover, the Hungarian soprano proved to be a good actress and a conscientious artist, so that her success was never for a moment in doubt.</span></p>",,

I have been singing it all the morning, and I cannot get it out of my mind."" &nbsp;She then sang the notes over to us. The idea of [Mr.] Bliss, in writing the hymn, was to bring out the truth that the peace and comfort of a Christian are not founded so much upon his love to Christ as upon Christ's love to him, and that to occupy the mind with Christ's love would produce love and consecration&mdash;as taught in Romans v. 5: ""The love of God (to us) is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us.""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chicago

The prayers, litany, &amp;c. were all intoned or recited to the plain chant of the canons of the cathedral, with the usual responses by the choir. The psalms for the day were chanted by the choir, consisting of sixteen or eighteen boys and men, who also sung the canticles set in the service or anthem form, by Dr. Nares.</p>
<p>The chanting was poor enough, at least, for three reasons: 1st. Great rapidity of utterance. 2d. No two members of the choir kept together. 3d. The enunciation of the words was so careless that it was with difficulty one could keep the place and follow the performance, even with book in hand. There was of course, nothing like attention to the sense of the psalms - there was no appropriate emphasis, or any more expression, than would be given by a hand-organ or grind-stone. The great leading object seemed to be to hurry on, and get through as quickly as possible. One good point, however, in the chanting was the absence of all drawling in the cadences. The tones were not prolonged but were delivered in quick succession.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Worcester_Cathedral

Baptiste, the elder, played the Blind Old Man to <br />admiration. Indeed, the whole dramatis personae were perfect. I procured a <br />copy of the piece, and gave it to my friend George Colman, who, being pleased <br />with the subject, resolved to write a musical afterpiece from it ; and his <br />adaptation was far superior to the original, as indeed was every thing he did <br />in the same way. It was brought out on the 28th January, under the title of <br />""We Fly by Night ; or, Long Stories,"" at Covent Garden Theatre. I composed the <br />whole of the music. Munden's personification of the Old Story-teller was <br />perfect ; indeed, all the performers in the piece gave it their best support ; it was 
strongly cast. Liston and Fawcett were exquisitely comic ; the part of the <br />Englishman (in the French original so well performed by Baptiste the younger) 
was transposed into a Frenchman, and very well acted by Farley ; Miss Tyrer, <br />now Mrs. Liston, was truly comic in the Landlady, and sang with her usual <br />sweetness; Miss Bavies was the Heroine. The piece was eminently successful, <br />and had a great run. Both Miss Tyrer and Miss Davies were pupils of Mrs. <br />Crouch and myself. Mrs. Liston was always attentive to her profession, and <br />scrupulously honourable in fulfilling all her engagements.

A poor girl, an inhabitant of it, by an accident, was deprived of the use of her limbs, and reduced to the greatest distress. Mr. Phillips, the father of Mrs. Crouch, then lived at St. Peters, and took great pains to forward a subscription for the poor sufferer, and drew up a petition to the inhabitants and visitors ; the Honourable Wellesley Pole (now Lord Maryborough) and his lady ; the Honourable Mr. Villiers and his lady (Mrs. Pole's sister), were then at Margate, highly esteemed for their kindness and philanthropy ; and with their usual goodness, they undertook to promote the subscription ; and not only made a liberal donation themselves, but in the public library one evening, when the room was crowded with visitors, they went round to every individual to request their charity for the poor girl, and collected an unexpected sum of money. Mrs. Crouch and I were present; and when it came to our turn to bestow our mite, I said to Mrs. Crouch, that I thought our best donation would be to play a night at the theatre for the girls benefit; and as neither of us had ever been seen on the stage at Margate, and the place was very full, I hoped we should bring her a good receipt. Mrs. Crouch most cheerfully acquiesced, and the night appointed by the manager was the Saturday week : in the course of the next day, the performance was announced, "" The Beggar's Opera."" Mrs. Crouch, Polly ; myself, Macheath : every place in the house was taken, and the whole pit, one row excepted, railed into boxes.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Margate

His work at the Crystal Palace from 1855 to 1900, alike in its educational aspect and its conspicuously beneficial encouragement of native art, will endure, a lasting monument of industry, catholicity of taste, and consistent loftiness of purpose. At Sydenham it was that Arthur Sullivan was first prof- fered a helping hand by the performance of his ""Tempest"" music on his return from Leipsic (April, 1862). Thither did Sir George -Grove- sometime secretary of the Crystal Palace Com- pany and writer of the luminous analytical notes that so materially enhanced the enjoyment of the famous Saturday Concerts convey the precious Schubert manuscripts which he had rescued from dust and oblivion in Vienna. There, under the aegis of August Manns, was solved for the first time in England the problem of cheap ""classical"" orchestral concerts that should attract the masses and initiate them into the delight of listening to good music. There I heard my first symphony (it was Beethoven's ""Pastoral""); and there, Saturday after Saturday, I heard the most celebrated soloists that visited our British shores from Rubinstein and Clara Schumann to Paderewski, from Joachim to Sarasate, from Piatti to Hausmann and Hugo Becker.

The London audience not only acknowledged its own gratification for the past in this reception, but its sense also of the triumph in the French capital. She appeared as fresh, young, and girlish in her buoyancy as ever. The magic effects of the ""fontaine de jouvence,"" that enviable marvel, seemed still upon her.

Many of the self-styled ""interpreters"" of public sentiment pretended that the chain of sympathy which had attached her to the public had been too suddenly snapped asunder to be restored to its former strength; that the tide of popular feeling, untowardly checked when it had reached to such an unprecedented height, had been diverted, and would never flow in the same channel again. But all these suppositions turned out utterly ill-founded. Never had Jenny Lind been received with a more enthusiastic welcome, or with acclamations more fervent, from a house crowded to the ceiling, than on the night in which she returned once more to the stage. The scene of excitement was perhaps more agitating than any former scenes of bygone triumphs. It seemed not only as though a favourite idol had been restored to the public, but as if a child, whom some difference had temporarily estranged, had been received back to the arms of its family. In truth, the emotion on both sides appeared equally profound. The evening was signalised also, it may be said en passant (for every other consideration seemed utterly swamped in the one exciting event), by the first appearance of Signor Calzolari, an excellent and most satisfactory young tenor of (what was denominated) ""the good old school.""</span></p>",,

He always received me with kindness and hospitality. He was remarkably fond of punch, of which beverage I have seen him take copious draughts. He was also fond of billiards, and had an excellent billiard table in his house. Many and many a game have I played with him, but always came off second best. He gave Sunday concerts, at which I never was missing. He was kind-hearted, and always ready to oblige ; but so very particular, when he played, that if the slightest noise were made, he instantly left off. He one day made me sit down to the piano, and gave credit to my first master, who had taught me to place my hand well on the instrument. He conferred on me what I considered a high compliment. I had composed a little melody to Metastasio's canzonetta, "" Grazie agl' inganni tuoi,"" which was a great favourite wherever I sang it. It was very simple, but had the good fortune to please Mozart. He took it and composed variations upon it, which were truly beautiful ; and had the further kindness and condescension to play them wherever he had an opportunity. Thinking that the air thus rendered remarkable might be acceptable to some of my musical readers, I have subjoined it. Encouraged by his flattering approbation, I attempted several little airs, which I shewed him, and which he kindly approved of; so much indeed, that I determined to devote myself to the study of counterpoint, and consulted with him, by whom I ought to be instructed. He said, "" My good lad, you ask my advice, and I will give it you candidly ; had you studied composition when you were at Naples, and when your mind was not devoted to other pursuits, you would perhaps have done wisely; but now that your profession of the stage must, and ought, to occupy all your attention, it would be an unwise measure to enter into a dry study.

<p>In all, one hundred and forty instruments; to which must be added the great organ, one of the most powerful in the world. The vocal chorus consisted of eighty to ninety voices on each part, as soprano, alto, tenor, and bass; in all, about three hundred and thirty or forty voices. It must be understood that these were all real (not merely nominal) singers, capable of sustaining their respective parts. The parts were well balanced, and the chorus blending was admirable, no individual voices being heard. The alto consisted of both female and male voices; yet the men&rsquo;s voices were kept in good subjection, and only once or twice during the four days&rsquo; performance, did they appear severe or hard. The solo singers were the best that could be obtained in Europe[.]</p>

Here was again a success- nay, a great and noisy success &mdash; but yet a doubtful one. After the comparative unanimity with which ""Nabucco"" had been received, it seemed necessary for the forces of the opposition to recommence the attack against a school which now threatened to make its way with the town. Party spirit on the subject was again rife. Whilst, by the Anti-Verdians, ""I Lombardi"" was declared to be flimsy, trashy, worthless ; the Verdi party, and the adherents of the modern Italian school, pronounced it to be full of power, vigour, and originality. The one portion asserted that it was utterly devoid of melody &mdash; the other, that it was replete with melody of the most charming kind; the one again insisted that it was the worst work of the aspirant &mdash; the other, that it was the young composer's chef-d'oeuvre. And in the midst of this conflict &mdash; so analogous to the old feud between the partizans of Gluck and Piccini &mdash; public opinion, as usual, seemed undecided and wavering, uttering its old formula of ""Well! I don't know!"" The music, too, was weighed down by a rambling, ill-constructed, uninteresting libretto ; and it is really difficult, under such conditions, to sunder the merit of the musical ""setting"" from the demerit of the text.

This was, in fact, the opera in which she first appeared upon any stage. None, perhaps, of Verdi's works had kindled more enthusiasm in Italy, or crowned the fortunate composer with more abundant laurels than his ""Attila."" Its fame was great in the native land of the composer. In catering for novelty, therefore, the Director of Her Majesty's Theatre must be held to have done well in producing a work of so great repute, and in placing before his subscribers the leading opera of the day upon the Italian stage. To prove with what good will this was done, the opera had been ""mounted"" with great scenic splendour, and with every ""appliance"" likely to produce effect. ""Attila "" was produced on Tuesday, the 14th of March. Cruvelli sang ""con fuoco."" Her fine fresh ringing voice ""told."" Beletti displayed unusual histrionic talent, besides all that steadiness and excellence of ""school,"" which helped to earn him his reputation in this country. Gardoni was in the ""cast&rdquo;' whilst Cuzzani accepted a second tenor part. On every side were zeal, talent, and good-will employed successfully to execute a work which many cities of Italy had pronounced to be Verdi's masterpiece. But although Verdi had already commenced to make his way to English favour &mdash; and this by means of that vigour and dramatic fire which unquestionably belonged to him &mdash; the public displayed an unwonted unanimity of sulkiness upon the production of ""Attila."" They would have ""none of it."" Consequently ""Attila"" proved a failure. Music and libretto displeased alike.</span></p>",,

I once heard him in opera, but he was then nearly sixty, and had long abandoned his stage career. I first heard him sing at the Norwich Festival of 1866, when he took part in Costa's oratorio &ldquo;Naaman&rdquo;. His voice was then still in its prime. A more exquisite illustration of what is termed the true Italian tenor quality it would be impossible to imagine; and this delicious sweetness, this rare combination of &ldquo;velvety&rdquo; richness with ringing timbre, he retained in diminishing volume almost to the last.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich

The Orchestra numbered about thirty performers. It was really a fine Orchestra, though it appeared feeble in strings, (having only four violins on a part,) after listening to the Gewandhaus band. Beethoven&rsquo;s Sym. No. 7, was played, and also Weber&rsquo;s Overture to Oberon &mdash; with other music, including a very excellent new overture (manuscript) by W. Herfuth. The contrast was really a very excellent one, but it suffered in comparison with that of the preceding evening; and the room was too much filled with tobacco smoke and noise for comfort.</p>",,

The drama was written by Cobb, the music by Storace. The under-plot of this opera was taken from the Italian piece of "" La Cosa Kara,"" which had been originally taken from a Spanish drama. There was a good deal of beautiful original music in it, by Storace, who, with his great taste and knowledge of effect, had also selected some from Martini. The opera was received with great applause, and was performed the first season sixty nights to overflowing houses. The acting of Mrs. Crouch, in the ""Letter Duet,"" with the Seraskier, was beyond all praise, and Palmer's bye-play was excellent. One night, during the performance, an accident occurred which gave me great uneasiness : in the battle scene, between Palmer and myself, when fighting with scimetars, he left his head totally unguarded, and received so severe a blow in the forehead, that the blood spouted all over the stage; luckily, the wound was not sufficiently serious to confine him, although he was obliged to wear a black patch on his forehead for a length of time. In justice to poor Palmer, I must say he bore his misfortune with the greatest good humour.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

As already mentioned, when living at Windsor I had made a musical setting of ""Christmas Bells,"" a poem from ""In Memoriam,"" and this being sung in the Abbey at Christmas-time had attracted the attention of a friend of Lord Tennyson, Mr. Baillie-Hamilton. He had also heard privately a performance of a setting of mine of Tennyson's humorous poem, ""The Goose."" Through Mr. Baillie-Hamilton's introduction, I got to know the Hon. Hallam Tennyson, and it was decided that the two settings should be performed at an evening party at the house of Lord Tennyson in Eaton Square. I took a portion of the Abbey choir with me, and we sang these two compositions before a large company. ""The Goose,"" with its humorous words, and, I think, fairly humorous music, seemed to please the audience very much. Indeed, I know it gave satisfaction to the Poet in one point.There is a verse in the poem describing the old owner of the goose getting prosperous with the results of her poultry-keeping, and the lines run : And feeding high and living soft Grew plump and able-bodied, Until the grave churchwarden doffed, The parson smirked and nodded. This is set in a mock sentimental way, and it produced considerable merriment, the Poet saying in my hearing, evidently with some satisfaction, ""That 's the poem the critics said showed I had no sense of humour."" It seemed to me that he had for the first time been quite easy in his mind on this subject. Another observation which I must record also came from the Poet in connection with this song. Mr. Frederick Locker, who was one of the guests, and himself a poet of no mean order, congratulated me before Tennyson on the way in which I had set the words, saying: ""I hope that your name will go down to posterity associated with the poem and its author."" ""In fact,"" added Tennyson, ""the current of my poetry will be Bridged"".</p>",,

Mr. Mapleson had seen it at the Brussels Monnaie during the preceding winter, and it was on the strength of the success won there, alike by the work and by the exponent of the title-role, that he had determined to transfer both to the boards of Her Majesty's. The Carmen in question was no other than Miss Minnie Hauk, the young American prima donna who had sung at Covent Garden one autumn season when quite a girl, but had not been heard again in London until the present year, when she made her rentree as Violetta in &ldquo;La Traviata&rdquo;. Her Carmen was already famous. It was considered as good dramatically as that of Mme. Galli-Marie, and in a vocal sense far superior. Garcia was simply delighted with the artistic finish, the vivacity and charm, of her performance. He thought she had caught with marvelous instinct and truth the peculiarities of the Spanish type, the coquettish manners and the defiant devilry of the wayward </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">gipsy.

Nor since have I heard a sweeter, gentler, or more persuasive Michaela than Alwina Valleria (nee Miss Lohmann, of Baltimore), another American soprano who was just beginning to win her way into the affections of the English public. The Escamillo&mdash; and an altogether ideal one&mdash; was that remarkably fine barytone, Del Puente, who in after years settled down in New York as a singer and teacher; while Campanini sang and acted with superb dramatic power as Don Jose. It was a strong cast, therefore, and Sir Michael Costa conducted the opera with exemplary care, even if he failed to bring into full relief the manifold beauties and exquisitely delicate touches of Bizet's score. But Signor Garcia was simply enthusiastic, and he labored as effectively as any individual in the whole theatre to bring about the triumphant reception that greeted &ldquo;Carmen&rdquo; that night. The subject and its treatment alike appealed to him; he thought the story intensely dramatic; the degree of real Spanish color in the music quite astonished him. He had not imagined that any Spanish opera after &ldquo;Don Giovanni"" and &ldquo;Il Barbiere"" could please him so much.</span></p>",,

On the 3rd May, <br />1808, Mr. Cumberland produced, at Drury Lane Theatre, a piece entitled ""The <br />Jew of Mogadore,"" to which I composed the music: It was with great reluctance <br />that the Board of Management at Drury Lane accepted it : therefore, when I had <br />finished the music of the first act, I rested upon my oars until I knew their <br />final determination. I met Mr. Sheridan one day in Essex Street in the Strand, <br />and told him of it. He desired me to go on with it by all means ; ""For,"" said <br />he, ""if the opera should fail, you will fall with a fine classical scholar, <br />and elegant writer, as well as a sound dramatist,"" (such was his expressed <br />opinion of Cumberland's abilities.) ""Go, instantly,"" continued he, ""to those <br />discerning critics, who call themselves the Board of Management, and tell 
them, from me, if you please, that they are all asses, to presume to sit in <br />judgment on the writings of such a man as Cumberland ; and say, further, that <br /><em>I order</em> the opera to be accepted, and put into rehearsal."" ""And pray, Sir,"" <br />said I, ""in what light am I to view this ' Board of Management?' What are 
they?"" ""Pegs to hang hats upon,"" said Sheridan. I went to the pegs, <br />communicated Mr. Sheridan's command, and the opera was performed accordingly- <br />Braham sang in it charmingly. </pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

The first change was made by the revival of the ""Montecchi e Capuletti"" of Bellini, for Madame Frezzolini as Giulietta, and Mademoiselle Parodi as Borneo. So many years had passed since Bellini's version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" had appeared on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, that it was received with a certain amount of curiosity, not to say as a novelty. Pleasing as are Bellini's, melodies throughout this opera, its disjointed and unsatisfactory libretto had always caused it to fail of securing a hearty welcome in a theatre where Shakspeare was involuntarily more or less in men's thoughts. But the combined attraction of Frezzolini and Parodi, both of whom were admirably ""suited"" in this opera, carried it through with very considerable eclat. The same occasion was used for the reappearance of Gardoni (the fourth successful primo tenore in my abundant list for the season), in the somewhat unsatisfactory part of Tebaldo; when this popular favourite was welcomed back with more than usual cordiality. Some of the enthusiasm demonstrated upon this occasion was due to a false report which had been spread about and had appeared in the public prints, respecting the death of this accomplished young tenor at St. Petersburg, where he had a winter engagement. The intelligence had been frequently given as authentic, although Gardoni had never had a moment's illness.</span></p>",,

I had all the principal vocal performers in the choruses; who all, as well as a numerous list of choral singers, both male and female, took infinite pains to execute the charming productions in a style unequalled in my remembrance; and the enthusiastic applause which the audience gave them, was commensurate with their merits. It was a rare and novel sight, to see so great a body of English chorus singers on the stage, full of appropriate and animated action. Yet in the instance I speak of, such things were; I cannot say such things are, they find it, perhaps, too troublesome.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1462038250768,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>There was a large congregation the Sabbath we were in Haarlem, and all united in great earnestness in the psalms. The movement was very slow &mdash; very nearly twice as slow as it is common to sing the Old Hundredth in our American churches, so that the time was easily described by counting four to each note, or eight in a double measure. No leading voice was heard; the organ alone seemed to lead, and yet the singing and the playing were so nearly together that no unpleasant effect was produced. It is always better that the organ should lead, than that a single voice should be heard ahead of others; but, there is, indeed, no necessity for either, even in Congregational singing, and the idea that a single voice should lead a choir by being always a little in advance in time, is so entirely at variance with good taste that it is not to be tolerated. The singing was in unison, and the times seemed to be perfectly familiar. The tune was not played over upon the organ before the singing, but the organist played only a prelude of a few measures, when all the people joined at once in the hymn. The interludes were very short; indeed, they could hardly be called interludes in the ordinary sense, since they were too short to include even a single phrase; they consisted only of a passing chord or two, merely allowing time to breathe between the stanzas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have already intimated that the singing was very general in the congregation; in this respect, we think the Dutch congregations are in advance even of the German; for there was one universal burst of vocal sound from the beginning to the end of the hymn. No other musical form was attempted than that of the plain metrical time, or chorale.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grote_Kerk,_Haarlem"

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448393918391,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>On Sabbath morning, we attended the Roman Catholic service at St. Roch. Music receives more attention here than at, perhaps, any of the other Paris churches; and the whole mass was, to-day, quite well done. The choir, including ministers, boys, and all, numbered about fifty persons. There are two organs; a large one at the end of the gallery, occupying about the place in the house that organs generally do with us; and a smaller one in the choir, near the altar. This latter was used exclusively for accompaniment, and the former, or large one, was played only when some flourish of overture or march triumphant was desired. Then it sent forth its tones loud and jubilant, so as to make the welkin ring again. The music was quite modern; as much so as if composed by the latest Donizetti or Verdi, and quite in the orchestral, anti-ecclesiastical style. It was indeed vocal, &mdash; words were sung; but, as they could not be understood, the effect of the whole was such as is the musical effect in a grand pantomime. Indeed, the worship in the Roman Catholic cathedrals seems to be little else than a mute, gesticulatory action of bowings, crossings, and kneelings, with grand processions, musical accompaniment, &amp;c. Musically considered, how ever, the performance was good. It was prompt and energetic, and the pianos and fortes were well observed. The organs too, though far different from the German style, were played with all the power of execution that could be desired.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saint-Roch,_Paris"

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448311811907,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>I attended service there [St Peter's Church, Leipzig] this afternoon. At the precise hour the organ prelude commenced; it continued two minutes, and the first Lied immediately followed. There was no introit, or introductory motette as in the Nicolai and Thomas churches. The choir consisted of three boys and two men; and beside these, the organist, another person walking about in the organ loft, and myself, there was but one person present &mdash; a goodly old lady; so that when the service commenced, the congregation in fact consisted of but one woman. It reminded me of the clergyman who, when he had no one present but the clerk, took the liberty to alter the prescribed form of the service, reading not &ldquo;Dearly beloved brethren&rdquo; but &ldquo;Dearly beloved Roger.&rdquo; Here was an occasion then, when the singing was indeed congregational. The members of the choir were all singing, the old lady appeared to sing, and I joined the general chorus. The organ was full and made up for any deficiency of vocal power. I observed that in some stanzas the voices commenced without the organ, and sung three or four syllables, when they were joined by the full organ; though in some other stanzas the voices and organ were simultaneous in their commencement. This, however, can have nothing to do with that which we sometimes call expression or the adaptation of the tune to the different stanzas of the hymn, for no attention whatever is paid to this subject here; there is no variation of soft and loud, but every stanza is loud, and is apparently sung and played without the slightest reference to the principle above mentioned. Indeed the principle of adaptation (as generally understood by us in the United States), seems not to belong to the Congregational style of singing. The minister, who was not present at the commencement of the service, came in during the singing of the last stanza, faced the cross upon the altar for a few moments, and then turning towards the people (by this time numbering perhaps between twenty or thirty), he commenced the responsive chanting service. His first sentence is confined to about half a dozen words, which are given in the tones three and five of the scale; this being responded to by the choir, the minister chants quite a long sentence, after which the choir respond Amen. The response closed upon five of the scale, ascending to it by the sharp four &mdash; thus five, three, sharp four, five. After this the minister read about two minutes &mdash; the people rising. This was followed by the organ, and another hymn. The minister retired the moment he had finished reading (prayer) and was not present during the singing that followed; but at the close of the hymn, as before, he came in and read a scriptural lesson; again he retired, and again the organ announced another choral. By this time some fifty or sixty persons had assembled, and they succeeded in raising quite a chorus. At the close of the last stanza the minister appeared, not at the altar, but in the pulpit, and after half a dozen words of prayer, commenced his sermon. And now the choir, three boys and two men, took their turn in going out; as the minister seemed to have nothing to do with their part of the service, so, I suppose, they were alike relieved when he began to preach. Considering myself by profession and long habit as more nearly allied to choristers than preachers, and especially as I could not understand what was said, and as I could retire without being noticed, and without disturbing others, 1 followed their example.</p>",,

Those of <br />my American readers who saw her when she appeared with Mr. Mapleson's troupe at 
the Academy of Music, New York, in 1876, cannot fail to have a vivid <br />recollection of her genius both as a singer and an actress. Then, however, she <br />was just approaching the tragical climax of her brilliant career. When I first <br />heard her, at one of the general rehearsals for the festival of 1866 (some eight <br />years after her d&eacute;but in England), her voice was not only fresh, powerful, and <br />penetrating, but it possessed in a greater degree than then that sympathetic <br />charm that curiously dramatic ""human"" quality which was perhaps its most <br />notable attribute. Her style was marked by the same rare individuality. Her <br />phrasing offered a curious blending of vigor and grace; and she had a trick of <br />employing the portamento when approaching a high note, which in any other singer <br />might have been thought almost ugly, but in Tietjens seemed both natural and <br />artistic. At the same time, her attack was superb. Never have I heard the <br />opening phrase of the ""Inflammatus"" in Rossini's ""Stabat Mater"" delivered with <br />such magnificent energy and such absolute purity of tone. To hear Tietjens in <br />those days sing ""Let the bright Seraphim"" (especially to the trumpet obbligato <br />of Tom Harper) was a treat never to be forgotten. </pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich

<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Don Jose of Jean de Reszke has been variously criticized. I hold the opinion, however, not <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>only that it was, and still is, a superb embodiment, <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>but that it did a great deal to restore to the character the musical and histrionic value which it had <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>gradually been losing in inverse ratio to the ever-growing prominence of the central figure of the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>opera. For this reason I quote some lines that I <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>penned anent M. de Reszke's impersonation at the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>time: <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">He showed us that it was as easy for one great artist <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>to revive the importance and enhance the interest of a <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>good role as for twenty mediocrities to drag it down to <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the level of their own talent. It goes without saying <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>that the Polish tenor copied nobody's Don Jose in particular. He knew the traditions of the character, just <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>as he learned those of Sir Walter von Stolzing by visiting Bayreuth. He read his Merimee and carefully studied <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>his libretto; but like an artist of individuality and resource, he also thought the part out for himself. The <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>result, curiously enough, was a conception more closely <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>resembling Campanini's than any we have seen since. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>It was free from the melodramatic exaggeration into <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>which other tenors had fallen. Take, as an instance, the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>last act. M. de Reszke did not make himself up like a <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>starved ghost, neither did he rush about like a savage <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>animal in a cage. He looked the picture of despair, and <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>he made his piteous appeal to Carmen with the tone of <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>a man who is yearning for love, not for an excuse to <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>commit murder. When at last driven to extremities, he did not gloat over his revenge nor chase his victim from <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>corner to corner as a cat might chase a mouse. He simply stood at the entrance to the bull-ring, and when <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Carmen made her attempt to escape, he seized his dagger as by a sudden impulse and stabbed her as she was <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>endeavoring to pass him. An instant later he was leaning over her lifeless body in tears, horror-stricken at the deed he had committed. This surely was the true reading of the episode. Nor was it the only scene upon which <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>M. Jean de Reszke, with rare artistic insight, contrived <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>to throw a new and consistent light. He depicted with <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>wonderful subtlety and skill the gradual stages by which <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Don Jose is drawn under Carmen's fascinating influence. Fierce and absorbing passion revealed itself in <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>his facial expression, his gestures, and, above all, the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>thrilling tones of his voice. Never before has the beautiful passage where Jose brings forth the flower that Carmen gave him and tells her how it cheered his lonely <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>prison hours, been invested with such charm of voice and <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>such tenderness and warmth of delivery.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

I enjoyed one performance of the music, and we returned to Windsor on the 16th of June.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Delany,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

The privileged of the theatre told tales abroad of the appearance of the ""Swedish Nightingale"" at rehearsal, of her enthusiastic reception by all the members of the orchestra, of her overpowering emotion on facing this tumultuously flattering welcome, and of her undiminished, nay, increased powers. Thursday, the 4th of May came. The scenes of excitement in all the thoroughfares leading to the theatre were once more renewed; again were struggling crowds early at the doors; again were hats doubled up, and dresses torn; and again was the throng of carriages, the clamour and conflict of coachmen, servants, policemen, mob, the same as of yore. A ""Jenny Lind crush"" had lost nothing of its fever and intensity. The adored prima donna was to make her reappearance in the part which, more than all, had fascinated her enraptured admirers of the previous year, namely, the part of Amina in ""La Sonnambula."" Words fail to describe the aspect of the overcrowded house, the tumultuous reception, the enthusiasm which knew no bounds and no limits of time, or to give an idea of the prolonged cheering that followed every vocal display on the part of this idol of the public. The house was crowded to a state of impossibility, which eagerness and determination had exercised their magic to make possible. The Court was present ; and an incident, independent of the great event of the evening, is worthy of record. It was the first appearance of the Queen in public, since the famous 10th of April, when English loyalty and English "" pluck "" had pretty clearly shown that England could have nothing to fear from the revolutionary elements which were just then rife in Europe, driving monarchs from their thrones. When the British Sovereign first reappeared among her subjects, loyalty was not to be baulked of a fitting de- monstration; and in spite of the etiquette of the day, which allowed the Queen, as well as her subjects, to enjoy a dramatic entertainment without interruption, she was received by such universal homage of acclamation, that she was constrained to appear in the front of her box to acknowledge the demonstration, whilst the the National Anthem was sung by the chief singers of the establishment. Well might the newspapers of the day preface their record by the phrase, ""The great evening of the season has come off, and the result has been most brilliant.""</span></p>",,

He was the favourite scholar of the renomme Hasse, Maestro di Cappella to the then Elector of Saxony. Schuster, though a very young man, had been sent for from Dresden to compose for Pachierotti, at the theatre St. Carlo. The opera chosen was Metastasio's "" La Didone abbandonata."" I recollect his taking me to a rehearsal, which was a crown and sceptre to me in those days. The opera was received with enthusiasm, particularly the rondo, sung divinely by Pachierotti, "" lo ti lascio, e questo addio,"" which was afterwards introduced in the musical entertainment of "" The Flitch of Bacon, ""with the English words, "" No, 'twas neither shape nor feature,"" adapted to it by my worthy friend Shield. La Didone drew crowded houses, but the rondo was the magnet ; indeed, Pachierotti's singing it, was supposed to have raised a violent flame in the bosom of La Marchesa Santa Marca, one of the most beautiful women of the Neapolitan court.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436433150618,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>While we were talking, the Earl of Westmorland came up and spoke to me. Lord Cardigan said, ""Ah, vous connaissez Monsieur Ganz?"" ""Mais oui, et ses parents. Ses oncles etaient mes premiers violon et violoncelle a Berlin."" Lord Westmorland, who had been English Minister in Berlin, was one of the most distin- guished musical amateurs of the time. He composed operas and cantatas, and founded our Royal Academy of Music. His grand-daughter, the present Lady Londesborough, was a pupil of mine. As he was going away Lord Westmorland said, ""I live only five miles from here, and would be very happy to see you if you will come over."" There were many distinguished guests there, including Count Pourtales, Lord and Lady Ernest Bruce, the Earl and Countess of Jersey and their daughter, the beautiful Lady Clementina Villiers. The day after we had music in the afternoon, and I played to Lady Clementina, and she played some Chopin Valses and other pieces to me very beautifully. Mrs. Dudley Ward, a pupil of mine (afterwards Mme de Falbe), sang the same evening.</p>",,

That was a <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>great night. The house was literally crammed from floor to ceiling, and the Prince and Princess <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>of Wales led the applause that greeted the now <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>famous Polish tenor on making his debut upon the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>stage of Covent Garden in the role of Vasco di <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Gama.

I am not prepared to assert that it is in a much better way at the present moment. Beyond doubt, however, its fortunes, through the instrumentality of this lamented impresario, underwent a revival that was of the utmost importance...[""This] London public is now ripe for English opera of a better sort than Pyne and Harrison provided. It longs for something more than ballad-operas and a 'star' or two. It wants good works and, above all, a good ensemble. See how it appreciates the 'Figaro' ensemble! Well, next season I shall produce more unfamiliar operas and a still stronger company. Then gradually I shall introduce Wagner in English, beginning with 'The Flying Dutchman,' and perhaps even test whether London can stand a brand-new opera by a native composer."" He was as good as his word. In the following year, at the Lyceum, Carl Eosa brought out four novelties, including Frederic H.

It lasted three hours and a half and is so long that I would not dare to advise concert managers to try such an adventure. The performance was sublime. It was given in a newly constructed square hall. Cavaille-Coll, who knew acoustics, used to advise the square hall for concerts but nobody would listen to him. Three hundred chorus singers, many from a distance, were supported by an orchestra that was large, but, in my opinion, insufficient to stand up against this mass of voices. Furthermore, the orchestra was placed below the level of the stage, as in a theatre, while the voices sounded freely above. Two harps, one on the east side of the stage and one on the west, saw each other from afar, a pleasingly decorative device, but as annoying to the ear as pleasing to the eye. The chorus and the four soloists-- their task was exceedingly arduous-- triumphed completely over the difficulties of this immense work and all the varied and delicate nuances were rendered to perfection.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camille_Saint-Sa%C3%ABns,

It required an augmented orchestra and the following extra instruments: one flute, two bassoons, one contra-fagotto, two cornets, one ophicleide, one tympani, two large bells (which I had specially cast), and four harps (in my opinion the proper effect cannot be obtained with a less number), making a grand total of ninety-two orchestral performers. The second movement, a <em>scene du bal</em>, a charming waltz movement for which I engaged four harpists who came in with brilliant effect, was enthusiastically encored.

The Queen spoke to me in German and asked me whether I was related to the Conzertmeister Leopold and Moritz Ganz, who had played before her at Windsor many years before. I replied they were my uncles. On referring to my diary I find this happened on June 10th, 1856, twenty-nine years before ! I well remember taking my uncles down to Windsor and having great difficulty in finding rooms at an hotel, as it was Ascot week. I went with the mand the other artists to the Castle and listened to the concert in the next room. The Queen seemed pleased with Madame Roze's singing; I remember that the. Duke of Connaught was there, dressed in Highland dress, as were also some of the other men present, and I had to sign the Queen's visitors' book. The drawing-room in which the music took place was hung round with a number of en- gravings of the Royal Family, and the furniture was upholstered with Scotch plaid. Everything was very simple and unceremonious. When all was over, one of the gentlemen-in-waiting handed me, in the name of the Queen, a cat's-eye breast-pin set in diamonds, which could also be worn as a stud.

By the light of subsequent experience,<br />I learned to realize that Benedict was one of the worst conductors who ever held <br />a baton. His head was invariably buried in his score; his arms were ever <br />uplifted, as though seeking a higher level than the shoulder-joints naturally <br />permitted. He rarely gave a cue until it was too late to be of practical value; <br />and he entirely lacked the magnetic power and the sense of ensemble that should <br />be the primary gifts of a good conductor.

deficiencies were noted only by the few. The vast majority of East Anglian <br />amateurs, including my youthful self, were satisfied to look upon Sir Julius 
not only as a great conductor, but as a musician whose cooperation brought <br />honor and glory to the festival. Was he not the favorite pupil and friend of <br />Weber? Had he not, when a young man of twenty-three, seen and shaken hands with <br />the immortal Beethoven?

The revival of old memories, at those exciting and once familiar sounds, joined to the thought of the causes which had placed her in that arena, must have moved her pro- foundly.

Madame Sontag brought back an artistic skill, matured and perfected by the continued study which, since her retirement, had been to her a labour of love. The beauty, which had exercised so great a fascination over an elder generation, was, strange to say, but little changed. It was remodelled rather than effaced, whilst the figure seemed almost untouched by time. The pleasing contour of the face, the beaming and expressive eye, and, above all, the winning smile which formerly had stolen away so many hearts, were all there. Men declared that with the most clear and searching of opera- glasses they could not give her more than five-and-twenty. She was, in truth, a living marvel! And, more strange than all, the Sontag who had been deemed by a former' generation somewhat deficient as an actress (although the most exquisite of soprano singers), was discovered to have warmth, animation, expression, even power, as a dramatic artist! The fascination of her histrionic talent came to be as great as that of her faultless execution. The public is said to be a ""wayward"" creature; but, on the contrary, it is extremely difficult to be moved from prepossessions once formed for good or for evil. Whatever change may supervene in an artist, the public is loath to admit a change into its own formed opinions. Sontag left the stage with the reputation of being ""no actress."" On her return, it was almost impossible to persuade this public, wedded to traditions, that she was (what really was the case) one of the most finished and exquisite histrionic artists.</span></p>",,

Hitherto we had been slowly paving the way only. Now, with almost startling suddenness, the metropolis found itself the scene of two weighty enterprises which were destined to give an even stronger fillip to the spread of the Bayreuth master's art than his own visit in 1877. To be candid, the double dose, taken well-nigh simultaneously, proved rather too heavy for the receptive capacity of the general public. But the German community again rallied in brave numbers to this musical call from the Fatherland, and, alike with money and plaudits, proffered substantial support to the cause. Early in the year a troupe had been formed by Herr Angelo Neumann for the purpose of performing &ldquo;Der Ring des Nibelungen"" in the leading cities of Germany, Austria, Holland, England, and Italy. The months of May and June were chosen for the London visit, and Her Majesty's Theatre was engaged. In all, four cycles of the tetralogy were given. Of these I attended two, and then for the first time felt that I was beginning to obtain an insight into the real scope and meaning of this gigantic work. The casts included not a few of the famous artists who had taken part in the initial representation of the &ldquo;Ring&rdquo; at Bayreuth in 1876,&mdash; among them Niemann, linger, the Vogls, Hill, Schlosser, and Lilli Lehmann (who sang Woglinde, Helmivige, and the ""Bird"" music); with that admirable artist, Reicher-Kindermann, as Brilnnhilde. The conductor was the lamented Anton Seidl, who then made his first appearance in London. He at once won the high approval of connoisseurs by the skill which he displayed&mdash; with by no means first-rate material&mdash; in bringing out with clearness, refinement, and intellectuality the beauties of Wagner's colossal score. It was through no fault of Seidl's that the representations were at many points open to criticism; nor, we may be equally sure, was he responsible for the number of extensive ""cuts"" which disfigured the last two of the four music-dramas.</span></p>",,

There seemed to be a swarm of Israelites in this old town, which is renowned for wig-makers, pits, water-works, and dancing ladies, who are by no means scrupulous on the point of exhibiting their legs. It being Sunday, we did not visit their sulphureous water-works, but looked in at one of the balls which are given every Sunday evening, where were some very prettily-dressed servant girls, labouring assiduously at the dance, accompanied by a dulcimer, a violin, pipe, and tabor.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augsburg

Carlotta Grisi, not absolutely unknown here, but now entitled for the first time to touch the highest position, and her clever, agile husband, Perrot, were the prominent artists in the entertainment. A Mademoiselle Fleury, new to England, added to the excellent effect of the ensemble as the Queen of the Wilis. The anti-pantomimic malcontents not having yet assumed the position of a fashionable faction, the ""story"" was admitted to be ""vastly pretty."" ""Giselle"" was pronounced a success, and the production of this ballet may be regarded as the main element of attraction on the opening of my first season. Its success was probably owing to the fact of the whole story being comprised within the limits of a short romantic legend, which, in the hands of a skilful ""Mime,"" becomes easily intelligible.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

The change was not greatly to be regretted, for the popularity of Gardoni aided him, and he sang his best. On the morrow, there appeared in all the principal daily prints a long letter from Mr. Sims Beeves, protesting against the interpretation given to his refusal, and asserting that he had only accepted an engagement at Her Majesty's Theatre on the express stipulation that he should be cast for the part of Edgardo in the ""Lucia,"" and other principal tenor parts; and that finding he was not to sing in a forthcoming representation of the first named opera, he considered his contract annulled, and himself at liberty to withdraw. To this communication a firm denial was given in another letter from Mr. Balfe, the conductor, in which that gentleman affirmed that no such stipulation had ever been made &mdash; an affirmation he was able to maintain, inasmuch as he himself had signed the contract made with Mr. Reeves; and that moreover the coveted part could not have been promised to him, it having been in the possession of Signor Gardoni six weeks before the engagement of the English vocalist.</span></p>",,

Bliss handed the words to him, asking what he could get for a tune. McGranahan worked upon it a long time without success, making harmonies and trying to satisfy himself with something that would properly express the words. When supper-time came he did not care to eat. At bedtime the family went to their rooms, leaving him in the parlour at the piano. Finally, dissatisfied with the result, he threw himself on the floor and fell into a doze. Suddenly he awoke, and the tune, chorus and all, had come&mdash;different from the harmonies he had worked upon. When he sang it to Mr. Bliss in the morning he was delighted with it, and immediately adopted it for use.</p>",,

told in action, and the poetry of the songs appropriate. I was rather fortunate <br />in composing the music. The scenery, machinery, and decorations, were profusely <br />splendid ; and nothing could surpass the fine acting of Miss Decamp, as <br />Cinderella.

""The Monk,"" by Mr. Boaden, and performed at Drury Lane, called ""Aurelio and <br />Miranda."" I thought there was a great deal of merit in the writing; but it was <br />only acted six nights: many thought it indecorous to represent a church on the 
stage (which, by the way, was a fine specimen of the art, painted by Capon). But <br />the powerful objection was, the unearthly appearance of Kemble, as the Monk. I <br />never shall forget his attitude immediately after his entrance; his dress the <br />look. The tout ensemble struck me to be more than human. He was hailed with the <br />most rapturous applause ; but he stood motionless, with uplifted eyes, and <br />apparently regardless of the public tribute.</pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

Then it was that in the concert-room I listened to the still marvellous voices of Alboni, Carlotta Patti, and Sims Reeves; heard delightedly the glorious playing of such violinists as Sivori, Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski, Neruda, and Joachim ; and reveled in the never-to-be-forgotten art of Clara Schumann and Alfredo Piatti. Looking back after thirty years, and with every wish to avoid the objectionable manner of the laudator temporis acii, it seems to me that that was a veritable ""age of giants,"" a period of artistic constellations which, as far as London at least is concerned, has never since been approached. Among the most interesting of the French refugees of 1871 were the members of the Comedie Franchise. They gave a memorable series of representations at one of the London theatres, selecting for it most of the gems of their matchless repertoire, with casts that included such artists as Got, Delauny, Mounet-Sully, Worms, Febvre, the Coquelins, Mmes. Sarah Bernhardt, Blanche Pier- son, Bartet, Barretta, Keichemberg, and Samary. If I am not mistaken, it was during this season that Sarah Bernhardt made her London debut. I saw her for the first time in her exquisite embodiment of Dona Sol in Victor Hugo's ""Hernani."" My father, who saw her in ""Andromaque"" and ""Phedre,"" told me that he considered her little, if aught, inferior to the celebrated Rachel, whose triumphs he had often witnessed in Paris during the ""forties.""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436178232441,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>A memorable event in the spring of 1852 was the first series of orchestral concerts given by the New Philharmonic Society, which was formed by Dr. Henry Wylde with the special object of producing novelties and giving concerts of the best kind. Great eclat attended these concerts, as Hector Berlioz, after his triumphant tours throughout Europe, was specially engaged to conduct. The orchestra consisted of 110 per- formers, the leaders being all well-known soloists, such as Sivori, Jansa (violinists), Goffrie (viola), the great 'cellist Piatti, Bottesini, the famous contrabassist, Remusat the flautist, Barret the oboist, and Lazarus the clarinettist. I was fortunate in being engaged as one of the second violins, and was much gratified when, during the first rehearsal, Berlioz said, ""Ganz, I want you to play the small cymbals with Silas in the scherzo"" We were rehearsing his Romeo and Juliet symphony, which has a wonderfully light and fairy-like scherzo to represent ""Queen Mab,"" and he had had two pairs of small antique cymbals made to give a particular effect in it. There were several orchestral rehearsals, which for England at that time was a really great innovation. Every one was intensely enthusiastic, and anxious to please Berlioz, who was a wonderful conductor. His beat was clear and precise, and he took endless trouble to get everything right. I remember his asking Silas and me to come and see him in King Street, St. James's, just to try over the passage for the little cymbals. I mention this to show the care he took over every detail. As a result, the first concert proved a veritable triumph for him, and it was generally admitted that no such orchestral performance had ever before been heard in England. The hall was crammed, and the audience was absolutely carried away and cheered him to the echo.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanover_Square_Rooms

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1461671039271,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>Rev. Mr. Brock (Baptist) is the minister of Bloomsbury&nbsp;chapel, Bloomsbury street. He is a very popular preacher, and has a large and flourishing congregation. Not indeed like the great German congregations where we often see two or three&nbsp;thousand people assembled on a Sabbath mornings but there were not less, we think, than a thousand persons present at the Bloomsbury chapel last Sunday. The church is furnished with a very good-sized organ, though its tones are harsh, and especially so are the stops of small pipes, as mixture or cornet. There is no choir, but the singing is by the people, and seems&nbsp;to be very general. There was a chorus of many voices; a chorus not of musical attraction, but of religious edification - excellent and appropriate. Chanting had been introduced into this congregation, and is practised by the whole collected assembly with much success. We do not hesitate to say that the chanting by all the people in Rev. Mr. Brock's church is much&nbsp;superior to any of the cathedral choir chanting which we have heard. The chant itself was, indeed, unfavorable to the best results, being the well-known Dr. Dupuis in A; but notwithstanding the tune-like character of the chant, the effect was truly good, and seemed to furnish a most satisfactory answer to&nbsp;those objectors to chanting, who say that it is impossible for a large congregation to chant together. The words were, in general, deliberately and well delivered, and with a good degree of simultaneousness on the part of the congregation. Chanting is practised in public worship in many dissenting churches in&nbsp;London, and in other parts of the kingdom. Indeed, although it was introduced at an earlier period into our New England churches than here, yet it seems to have spread more here, and to have taken deeper root. One reason for this may be, that here it is made a republican thing; it is in the hands of the&nbsp;people, and they like it. The metrical psalms were also quite well sung, and the great importance of an organ in Congregational singing was made very apparent. A custom in giving out the hymn and tune is singular. The minister first gives out the number of the hymn, and immediately afterwards the organist plays over the tune. After this the minister, who&nbsp;stands in the pulpit during the playing, reads the hymn, and then the singing follows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Brock has made a much-needed reform in relation to the public prayer. He has broken up the ever-so-long prayer, and instead of it has two shorter prayers. Rev. Mr. Binney of the Weigh House chapel has done the same. The devotional exercises occupied an hour, and the sermon that followed about forty minutes, after which the meeting was dismissed by the usual benediction.&nbsp;</p>",,

Jean de Reszke, who received the cross of the &ldquo;RVO&rdquo; (fourth class) after a performance of &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; at Windsor Castle on the Queen's eightieth birthday. May 24, 1899. His brother was similarly decorated fourteen months later, after a representation of &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; &mdash; the last occasion on which Queen Victoria ever listened to an opera.</span></p>

To begin with, only the first and third acts of &ldquo;Lohengrin"" could be given. There was hardly time to include the second, as these royal functions do not commence until nearly ten o 'clock at night. The plot, however, was fully explained to the Queen, who had never heard Wagner 's opera, and the temptation of Elsa (Mme. Nordica) by the perfidious Ortrud (Mme. Schumann- Heink) and her spouse (David Bispham) was easily &ldquo;taken as read&rdquo;. Mancinelli conducted, and everything went capitally until the fall of the curtain. Her Majesty then retired to one of the drawing-rooms and requested that the principal artists be presented to her, together with Mr. Maurice Grau as managing director of the Royal Opera. The awful discovery was then made that neither Jean nor Edouard de Reszke had with him any but the operatic garments in which they stood. It was the first time that the brothers had ever appeared in opera before the Queen, and, not knowing that it was usual to don evening dress for the subsequent presentation, they had clothed themselves as Lohengrin and Heinrich der Vogler before leaving London, and had traveled to Windsor in dark cloaks of sufficient amplitude to conceal themselves from the gaze of an inquisitive Cockney crowd. The situation was duly explained to Her Majesty, who laughingly declared that it did not matter in the least; for once court etiquette should be disregarded, and the two artists brought before her in their picturesque stage attire. The command was forthwith obeyed, and the Queen, in course of conversation with the brothers, &ldquo;expressed the delight that it had afforded her at last to hear them in opera and listen to the beautiful music of Wagner's work&rdquo;.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windsor_Castle

Mr. Taylor, the then proprietor of the Opera House, and Madame Banti, made a request to Mr. Sheridan, to give me permission to act the principal part in the opera, which I had so often performed at Vienna, under the tuition of the great composer. The knowledge of my having success- fully performed it at that theatre, induced Madame Banti to ask me to act it at the Haymarket. I got permission, and the opera made so great a hit, that Mr. Taylor, with the consent of Mr. Sheridan, engaged me for twenty nights. Madame Banti's performance of Alceste was a chef-d'oeuvre; her acting sublime, her singing charming; for twenty nights the opera drew crowded houses. Banti possessed all the power of voice which she had when I heard her first at Venice her figure was much improved; and, as a serious actress, she was unrivalled. She had wonderful natural powers, but, as I have already said, no great knowledge of music.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haymarket,_London"

Padua was interesting to me, as the birth-place of Tartini ; and the two greatest singers of their time were living there retired, Pachierotti and Guadagni. The latter was a Cavaliere. He had built a house, or rather a palace, in which he had a very neat theatre, and a company of puppets, which represented L' Orpheo e Euridice ; himself singing the part of Orpheo behind the scenes. It was in this character, and in singing Gluck's beautiful rondo in it, "" Che faro senza Euridice,"" that he distinguished himself in every theatre in Europe, and drew such immense houses in London.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Padua

There was a one-stringed violin with a trumpet attached, a very funny rifleman comedian, and a lady-reciter-a typical reciter, with a pale ivory complexion, dark eyebrows, rather tired look, and a clear-cut dental enunciation. It was rather good to feel spinal again. There is so little room for spinality in the Army. Still the lady was rather relentless-five recitations in two appearances and we missed having the funny rifleman again. One rifleman sang a rather doleful and unintelligible song with a rousing chorus to the words 'And a little child shall lead them'. This merged without any break into a series of ragtimes which he accompanied extremely skilfully on the bones.</p>",,

Eight societies had entered their names as candidates, and sang successively for the prize picture. Some of them produced roars of laughter, and every one of them was received with more or less merriment and glee. One song (they were all part-songs) was truly good and exceedingly well done, but the others were commonplace, or even low and frivolous; so much so, as to appear quite at variance with the idea that these festivals are designed for improvement in musical taste. It was somewhat sad too, to observe that those songs which seemed to bring down humanity the nearest to mere animal being were the most admired, so that one in which imitations of the bleating of sheep and the cries of the domestic animals were introduced, called forth the loudest laugh and the most violent clapping of hands.</p>",,

That reminds me, now for his little daughter [Maria Anna (Nanette) Stein, child prodigy]. Anyone who sees and hears her play and can keep from laughing must, like her father, be made of stone. For instead of sitting in the middle of the clavier, she sits right opposite the treble, as it gives her more chance of flopping about and making grimaces. She rolls her eyes and smirks. When a passage is repeated, she plays it more slowly the second time. If it has to be played a third time, then she plays it even more slowly. When a passage is being played, the arm must be raised as high as possible, and according as the notes in the passage are stressed, the arm, not the fingers, must do this, and that too with great emphasis in a heavy and clumsy manner. But the best joke of all is that when she comes to a passage which ought to flow like oil and which necessitates a change of finger, she does not bother her head about it, but when the moment arrives, she just leaves out the notes, raises her hand, and starts off again quite comfortable - a method by which she is much more likely to strike a wrong note, which often produces a curious effect.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Augsburg

Now this entertainment is our only London caricature, the true embodiment of everything that travesty ought to be. The male members are the most voiceless collection of vocalists I ever heard, but goodness me, all their quartettes and concert pieces are better sung than the attempts of some real operatic artistes. Gwennie Mars told me I would not listen to her for the chorus at Drury Lane, but her thumbnail sketches of Harry Lauder and Wilkie Bard were genius studies, and yet where does it all come from, this realization of the real thing out of the supposed nothing ? Why, Pelissier himself. When the ""Follies"" first came under my notice it was at Bexhill. I gave them &pound;35 for four performances.

The congregation consisted of at least some twelve hundred persons. The exercises commenced by an organ voluntary of about four or five minutes, at the close of which the whole congregation joined in the old choral everywhere heard in Germany, the first line of which is 1, 5 3, 1 5, 6 6, 5, &amp;c., in the key of E flat major. Two stanzas were sung, each taking four minutes. At the close of the second stanza, the organist, continuing to play, changed gradually his key to A minor, closing an intermediate voluntary of about three minutes, diminishing to pianissimo so as to hush the house to perfect silence; then, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, the people joined again to the lead of the organ, in the fine old choral beginning as follows: e, a g, f e, d&mdash;, e&mdash;, &amp;c. Four stanzas were sung of three minutes each. Here, then, were two hymns sung in connection; which, with the organ prelude and interlude occupied full half-an-hour in the performance. Men&rsquo;s voices predominated, marking in strength the bold outlines of the tune; while female voices were heard and seemed to come in echoing, enriching, beautifying, and rendering that charming and lovely which otherwise would have been too severely grand and majestic. The organ was firm and steady, leading along the whole combined chorus with the utmost certainty, and giving full confidence to all the voices.</p>",,

Madame Vestris, the popular singer, who appeared in the operetta 'The Slave,' found willing listeners among the occupants of the galleries, who ruled the house, and were delighted with such nursery ditties as 'Goosie Goosie Gander.' [...] So far so well, but Braham had calculated without his host in setting before such an audience as this good music for the second part of the concert, which he called 'Apollo's Festival,' and which, after the poor stuff that had been played and sung, began with the overture to the 'Ruler of the Spirits.' I'm sure I don't know, but the screams and hubbub in the gallery while the overture was played, without a note being heard from beginning to end, made my blood boil; in a state of high indignation, I sat down to my piano on the stage, and gave a sign to the band beneath me to begin my 'Recollections of Ireland.' At the opening bar of the introduction, the roughs in the gallery made themselves heard by whistling, hissing, shouting, and calling out 'Are you comfortable, Jack ?' accompanying the question with volleys of orange peel. I heard the alternate crescendos and decrescendos; and fancied that in this chaos all the elements had been let loose, and would overpower me; but, thank heaven, they did not, for in this new and unexpected situation I resolved not to come to any sudden stoppage, but to show the better part of my audience at I was ready to fulfil my engagement, I stooped down to the leading violinist, and said, 'I shall continue to move my hands on the keyboard, as though really playing. Make your band pretend to be playing also; after a short time I will give you a signal and we will leave off together.' No sooner said than done. On making my bow as I retired, I was overwhelmed with a hurricane of applause. The gods cheered me, being glad to get rid of me. Next came Miss Paton, with a scena for the concert room. She met with a similar fate. Three times she stopped singing, but came forward again, in answer to the calls of the well-behaved portion of the audience, who shouted 'silence.' At last the poor lady went away, burst into tears, and gave it up. Thunders of applause followed her exit, and when common ballads and songs began afresh, the gods were once more all attention and good behavior.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Beside the three artists, there were present Mme. Nordica&rsquo;s sister (Mrs. Walker) and Mr. Amherst Webber, the talented English maestro at piano who had recently acted as accompanist to the brothers in their Wagnerian studies. After supper the conversation turned upon Bayreuth, and allusion was made to a certain half-promise given by Jean de Reszke to Frau Cosima, that he would one day sing Tristan and Walther, or perhaps even Siegfried, at the festival. I remarked that, after what I had heard that night, I entertained no doubts concerning the adequate quality of his accent. This only elicited a further request that I would stay in New York until I had heard how it sounded in &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo;. Then the distinguished tenor turned to Mme. Nordica and proposed that, as I was evidently not to be made to alter my determination, the best thing they could do would be to &ldquo;bring the mountain to Mohammed"" and sing some &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; to me there and then; and that between one and two in the morning, and after a heavy opera like &ldquo;Lohengrin""! Surely it was not possible. But surprise and incredulity quickly changed to delight. For, without an instant's hesitation, Mme. Nordica consented ; Mr. Webber went to the piano and played a few introductory bars; and, almost before I could realize what was being done, the two gifted artists were warbling the wondrous love scene from Wagner's immortal music-drama.</span></p>

It was a strange experience, sitting at the supper-table (for none of us but Mr. Webber had moved from our seats) while for an hour or more those two famous singers reveled in the enjoyment of their self-imposed task&mdash; undertaken for the sole purpose of conferring pleasure upon an old friend.

As a stage performance I got more satisfaction from this than from 'Les Noces', which was the latest thing that Diaghileff had had from me. Georges Balanchine, as ballet master, had arranged the dances exactly as I had wished &ndash; that is to say, in accordance with the classical school. From that point of view it was a complete success, and it was the first attempt to revive academic dancing in a work actually composed for the purpose. Balanchine, who had already given proof of great proficiency and imagination in his ballet productions, notably in the charming 'Barabau' by Rieti, had designed for the choreography of Apollo groups, movements, and lines of great dignity and plastic elegance as inspired by the beauty of classical forms. As a thorough musician - he had studied at the St. Petersburg Conservatoire &ndash; he had had no difficulty in grasping the smallest details of my music, and his beautiful choreography clearly expressed my meaning. As for the dancers, they were beyond all praise. The graceful Nikitina with her purity of line alternating with the enchanting Danilova in the role of Terpsichore; Tchernichova and Doubrovska, those custodians of the best classical traditions; finally Serge Lifar, then still quite young, conscientious, natural, spontaneous, and full of serious enthusiasm for his art &ndash; all these formed an unforgettable company. But my satisfaction was less complete in the matter of costume and &lsquo;d&eacute;cor&rsquo;, in which I did not see eye to eye with Diaghileff. As I have already said, I had pictured it to myself as danced in short white ballet skirts in a severely conventionalized theatrical landscape devoid of all fantastic embellishment such as would have been out of keeping with my primary conception. But Diaghileff, afraid of the extreme simplicity of my idea, and always on the lookout for something new, wished to enhance the spectacular side, and entrusted scenery and costumes to a provincial painter, little known to the Paris public &ndash; Andr&eacute; Bauchant, who, in his remote village, indulged in a genre of painting somewhat in the style of the 'dounaier' Rousseau. What he produced was interesting, but, as I had expected, it in no way suited my ideas. / My work was very well received, and its success was greater than I had expected, seeing that the music of &ldquo;Apollo&rdquo; lacked those elements which evoked the enthusiasm of the public at a first hearing.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Igor_Stravinsky,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

<p>I. Invocation. The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer alone was used the Sabbath we were there.</p>

<p>VI. Reading second lesson from Scriptures &mdash; New Testament.</p>
<p>VII. Prayer, about the length of former.</p>
<p>VIII. Hymn.</p>
<p>IX. Sermon.</p>
<p>Anthem, a hymn.</p>
<p>XI. Very short prayer, and benediction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no choir; the singing is congregational, and led by a precentor. It was quite good; one does not often hear a better performance of this part of the public worship, but yet it would be much improved if simple tunes, appropriate to Congregational singing, were substituted for the too difficult ones attempted on the Sabbath we were present. A peculiarity of the singing here, is, that the whole congregation engage in chanting. The 24th Psalm was chanted to one of the plain old English chants, with an effect far, very far better than one hears when he listens to the trained Cathedral choirs. [...] Mr. Binney&rsquo;s sermon, on Christian growth and development, was most able and satisfactory.

A tablet is seen in one of the rooms, with the amount received for several years in succession from Oratorios given. But alas! for the music&nbsp;now; it is anything but church music. There are nearly 400 children, about half of each sex; they all sit in the organ loft, and all sing the chants, responses, tunes, and services. They are dressed in a neat uniform, the boys in blue, with a white collar turned down, and the girls with white caps and aprons. The organ loft is so arranged, that by the raised seats every one can be distinctly seen.</p>
<p>The service commenced by an organ voluntary; and a lighter, more frivolous piece of organ-playing, I never heard. It was an attempt at a kind of extemporaneous overture with fancy stops, flute, oboe, &amp;c., and great organ contrasts, staccato passages, sudden pianos, and fortes, and sforzandos, in little scraps of melody, light as the lightest of Donizetti or Verdi, without dignity, solemnity, character, or sense. Not a particle of reverence about it. I have heard the organ abused before, and degraded enough, but this was the climax of organ absurdity and degradation.</p>
<p>In the chanting the children kept together, and there was the entire absence of that drawling in the cadences, so common in America. The notes in the cadences were very quickly sung &mdash; very much quicker than I have been accustomed to teach them, yet not too quick. But little attention was given to words &mdash; they were not properly delivered; but the smaller words were omitted, and many were so clipped or abridged as to be decidedly coarse or vulgar, as</p>
<p>""Glory be t' 'he Father,"" &amp;c. ""As 't was 'n th' beginning,"" &amp;c.</p>
<p>This was particularly observable in the monotone recitation of the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and Creed.</p>
<p>The Te Deum was sung in anthem form, and was well done &mdash; i.e. they all kept together, pronouncing the words with the speed of an auctioneer, but without any attention to sense, emphasis, pause, and the like.</p>
<p>A strange psalm tune was sung. It was like an andante allegretto, with marked time, by Haydn. Strange indeed, to hear a hymn so sung to music so very light and inappropriate. But it was well done, that is, they all went through it together, as true as a factory wheel goes round, and with as much expression and good taste.</p>
<p>In the place of an anthem, an extract from the Messiah was sung. Rec. &ldquo;For behold darkness,&rdquo; &amp;c.; aria, &ldquo; The people that walked,&rdquo; and the chorus &ldquo;For unto us.&rdquo; The bass song was well done, by a fine voice, and in quite an artistic manner. The singer did himself much credit indeed, but the chorus was a failure &mdash; the little things (children) kept along and got through with it, but no character was given to it whatever. It is not children&rsquo;s music. Children might as well be required to read Shakspeare, as to sing Handel. They may hit the tones, but they cannot sing the music.</p>
<p>The organ accompaniment was here excellent &mdash; orchestra style was required, and orchestra style was played. The staccato was boldly, cleanly, and most distinctly given.

On Thursday the 11th of July she appeared (now ""for the last time on any stage"") in a selection of ""scenes"" from ""Anna Bolena."" The part of the afflicted queen had been one of the greatest among her characters. Curiosity had been stimulated to a very powerful degree, and the house was crowded in every part. Madame Pasta appeared, to be hailed with prolonged acclamations. There she stood once more, on the scene of her past glories, ""every inch a Queen."" The spectacle was deeply interesting ; yet it was melancholy, not to say painful, to all who could feel with true artistic sympathy. With the noble presence and the lofty air of the Pasta of old days, she moved like a mighty shadow of the past before the eyes of the spectators; but it was the ""shadow of a shade."" The qualities already mentioned &mdash; the faultless style, the finished phrasing, the grand declamation, were all greeted with something more than respect, whilst the imaginative among the audience may have figured to themselves, like clever geologists, out of the shattered remains of the great vocal Mammoth, a perfect creature of former times. But the general sentiment was one of disappointment and regret. ""Is this all that remains of so wonderful a past?"" was the regretful exclamation of the young. ""It had been better that our hopeful recollection had never been disturbed and dimmed by so sad a ghost,"" thought the old. The ""longing, lingering look behind "" had literally been taken by the great prima donna. That she damaged her great fame by taking it, cannot be said. Her ""last appearance"" was soon forgotten in the turmoil of operatic events; whilst her name still gleams with tra- ditional lustre in the annals of lyric fame.</span></p>",,

Of these gorgeous, and at the same time tasteful embellishments, a general approval prevailed; whilst the aspect of the vast and elegant interior, in its fresh and magnificent array, struck every eye. Curiosity had been more legitimately, although perhaps less eagerly, excited by the striking novelties which the first night of the season was to produce. The ""Nabucco"" of Verdi, a work which was popular on the Continent, and had in some places caused a perfect furore, was selected to inaugurate the new salle. That Verdi had already made way against his wholesale detractors, was rendered evident by the generally better feeling with which the music of ""Nabucco"" was accepted. In a popular sense, the opera was a decided success; the choral melodies especially suiting the public taste. The libretto, although faulty in many respects, was dramatic, and afforded scope for fine acting and artistic emotion. ""Nabucco,"" in short, floated on the sea of the Anglo-Italian stage, where, whilst one current was always rushing towards novelty, another tended to wreck all novelty whatever in the interests of so-called ""classicism."" Much had been done to place the opera with splendour on the stage, but though it pleased as a whole, no decided success attended the venture of the two new ladies. Sanchioli, wild, vehement, and somewhat coarse, attracted and excited by her ""power, spirit, and fire,"" but she failed to charm. As a ""declaiming, passionate vocalist,"" she created an effect; but the very qualities which had rendered her so popular with an Italian audience, acted somewhat repulsively upon English opera-goers. The lack of refinement in her style was not in their eyes redeemed by the merit of energy. The electric impulse that communicated itself to the Italians, fell comparatively powerless on the British temperament. Sanchioli, however, was in many respects the ""right woman in the right place,"" in this melodramatic opera. The other lady, Mademoiselle Corbari, though destined in after times to please greatly as an altra-prima on the Anglo-Italian stage, and though she was considered from the first, charming, even ""fascinating"" in her simplicity and grace, was not yet acknowledged as a leading vocalist. The nervousness and inexperience of a novice, which she showed at this stage of her career, somewhat lessened the success due to a sweet voice and feeling style, though the prayer allotted to her character, Fenena, was encored nightly. Fornasari pleased those who remained of his old enthusiastic admirers, by his emphatic dramatic action and vigorous declamation, and thus far worked towards the success of Verdi's new opera. It is not unworthy of record that, in compliance with that repugnance which is prevalent in the English mind against any dramatic subject referring however remotely to biblical history, and which had already transformed ""Mose"" into ""Pietro L'Eremita,"" the ""Nabucco"" of the Italian stage was condemned to assume on this occasion an alias under the title of ""Nino Ee D'Assyria."" That the opera thus lost much of its original character, especially in the scene where the captive Israelites became very uninteresting Babylonians, and was thereby shorn of one great element of success, present on the Continent, is undeniable.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Thirteen years had elapsed since Alboni was last heard in London, and some time since she had retired from the stage altogether. Even then she was only in her forty-ninth year, and, despite her unusual stoutness, her tones retained well-nigh all their pristine charm of quality and organ-like richness of volume. What a magnificent voice it was! How marvelous&mdash; for a pure contralto&mdash;its evenness and range! Mr. Julian Marshall, in his article on Alboni in Grove's Dictionary, describes her compass as ""fully two octaves, from G to G."" To be correct, he should have added quite another half-octave to the head register and nearly as much below; for Alboni sang with perfect ease to the upper C, and could descend when she pleased to the middle space of the bass clef&mdash;altogether a scale extending not far short of three octaves! The purity and fluency of her style were indescribable. She was one of the last great exemplars of the old Italian school.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

There was no organ on either occasion, and I find that it is not common to unite the organ with a choir performance. If an orchestra play an overture, they are not supposed to need the support of an organ, and if a choir sing a vocal motette, they are supposed to be able to sing it independent of instrumental aid; so that the organ is seldom heard, except when it is telling its own story, or sustaining and leading along the great congregation in the choral songs.</p><p>Every seat was occupied; indeed it was necessary to secure tickets a day or two previous to the performance. The king was there, and both the sovereign and the people seemed to enter into the spirit of the music. The house was perfectly still, and there was not the slightest indication of applause; not because the music was not well executed, but because the usual method of manifesting approbation seemed to be inappropriate to the solemn state of feeling existing. It seemed indeed to be an occasion of deep solemnity ; all the members of the choir, male and female, were dressed in black, so that an appeal was made, through the eye as well as the ear, to the religious sympathies in view of the sufferings of the Son of God. I shall not attempt any analysis of the &ldquo;Tod Jesu.&rdquo; With the exception of one chorus, and Luther&rsquo;s chorale, it is, I believe, quite unknown in America[&hellip;]</p>",,

In each case the general verdict was emphatically ratified. Moritz Rosenthal's debut at the Richter concerts (June 10, 1895), when he played the Liszt concerto in E flat, created a genuine sensation; and his subsequent recitals confirmed the opinion that he possessed the most phenomenal technique of any living pianist.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

When revived for the opening of the season, on the 9th of March 1844, it was supported again by Madame Persiani; Corelli, the new tenor, appearing in the part originally sustained by Conti. Persiani, though now somewhat on the wane, was one of the favourites of the day. Corelli was generally pronounced a pleasant tenor, fitted for the Nemorinos of the stage, and so far an acquisition. But ""Adelia,"" although ""backed up"" by one of the most successful choreographic displays ever witnessed on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, would not, could not attract. It lingered on for a few nights, when it was deemed advisable to bring out the promised opera of ""Zampa,"" even without Fornasari.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

The young Italian composer had achieved only a moderate success with his &ldquo;Manon Lescaut"" at Covent Garden three years before, and was anxious to add to his laurels. On joining him at Manchester the afternoon of the premiere, I found him in very low spirits. He was not satisfied with the Carl Rosa artists, and fully anticipated a fiasco for the English representation of &ldquo;La Boheme&rdquo;. I assured him that Carl Rosa singers (as distinguished from Carl Rosa &ldquo;directors&rdquo;) did not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;fail&rdquo;; the intelligence and ensemble of the company were bound to pull him through. And so it proved. Deficient as it was in many respects, there was, nevertheless, so much spirit and animation about the performance, such a flavor of Bohemian jollity, that the opera instantly won the favor of the Lancashire audience and paved the way for its subsequent London success.</span></p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Giacomo_Puccini,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester

On the whole, that was perhaps the more satisfactory production of the two, albeit I fancy Sir Michael Costa penetrated very little further into the meaning and spirit of Wagner's score than did his worthy countryman, Signor Vianesi. His chief interest used to centre in the proceedings of the swan, of which he invariably spoke contemptuously as ""Dat goose!""</span></p>

A fine introductory voluntary, full of joy, was played, closing with a very lively fugue; after which the people sang a chorale.</p>",,

But he had versatility. He was the first coster singer, with his Chickaleary Bloke. He could sing a moral, ""motto"" song with effect. Act on the Square, Boys; act on the Square. Of course his name is inseparable from Slap Bang. He declined in popularity, and his death occurred at a hall he would hardly have considered in his great day, the Sun, Knightsbridge. In a barrister's wig and gown he sang a topical song, with the refrain, uttered as an appeal to the gallery, ""Are you guilty ? ""He fell unconscious on the stage. A troupe of singers and dancers tripped lightly over his body, and carried on the show. A scene, quickly lowered, divided them from a dead man"".</span></p>",,

The Emperor Louis Napoleon and the Empress Eugenie were present on the first night, and the opera was received in cold, significant silence. On the second night the audience, from the second act onward, made a great row, fighting among themselves and disturbing the singers. On the third night there was a terrific noise, and no member of the audience could hear a note of the music the whole evening, but the one success of the opera was the appearance of the sporting dogs, which the Emperor had specially lent from the royal kennels. One of my friends played the part of the page who had to lead the dogs on the stage towards the end of the first act, and he told me recently that the audience cheered them and called them before the curtain, shouting, ""Bravo les chiens !"" ""Bis les chiens! on vous rappelle!"" But the page would not comply with their sarcastic demands. Now all this has been changed, and whenever Wagner's operas are performed in Paris the house is crowded, and even the <em>Ring</em> has become very popular.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

One of the new operas performed was Auber's <em>Enfant Prodigue</em>, in which the Parisian prima donna, Madame Ugalde, sang most charmingly, and M. Massol, the French baritone, also took a leading part. The scenery and dresses were magnificent, and, in fact, the opera was sumptuously mounted.

On one occasion, when he was little short of a hundred years of age, he came to one of our Carol Services, afterwards writing me the following letter: Mon Abri, Cricklewood. DEAR SIR FREDERICK, We have to thank you for a most delightful afternoon. The Carol Service was perfect. What beautiful voices the boys have who sang the solos round, clear, steady, and true! Heard in the semi-darkness of the Abbey, those voices had an exquisite effect, and they are all as well trained as they are beautiful. Please give my kind regards to Lady Bridge and thank her for her hospitality. With best wishes to you both, Believe me, Yours very sincerely, MANUEL GARCIA. I value very highly this testimony to my method of training the boys in the Abbey choir.</p>",,

I had no difficulty in following any of the music, and the various Leitmotifs with which each opera was interwoven came out perfectly clear to me. The theatre, which was built from designs given by Wagner, was so arranged that one could see quite well from every seat in the stalls. There was no pit, only rows of gradually ascending stalls, and at the end of every few rows there were doors of exit. There was only a small gallery or circle, in the middle of which was placed the royal box, and also several smaller boxes. The gaslights were lowered during each performance of course, electric light was not then invented. When Wagner appeared, walking across the stalls during the <em>entr'actes</em>, he was cheered to the echo. King Louis of Bavaria attended the four performances, and before the beginning of each opera a fanfare of trumpets was sounded, giving a few bars of a Leitmotif.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bayreuth

I hope you will agree with the way your work was placed between the Stravinsky suite and H.P.[Ballet by Ch&aacute;vez]. The performance was accurate and &ldquo;simple&rdquo;; we had 10 rehearsals and it was worked out with the utmost of interest and energy; the orchestra men were at first sceptical but by the third rehearsal or so they had a more genuine and growing interest. / I was amazed to see this, as it seldom happens with your works and mine. This last concert was the best of the entire season; it was warm and enthusiastic. It is impossible to tell you in a few words how much I enjoy the Little Symphony. I have already begun to write an essay on it which I intend to send to Minna Lederman for Modern Music. / The dialectic of this music, that is to say, its movement, the way each and every note comes out from the other as the only natural and logically possible one, is simply unprecedented in the whole history of music. The work as a whole, I mean to say in its entirety, is an organism, a body in which every piece works by itself 100% but whose mutual selection is such, that no one part could possibly work and exist without the other. There has been much talk about music in which everything is essential, nothing superfluous, but, as far as I know, the talk about such music exists, yes, but not the music itself. The Little Symphony is the first realization of this I know of, and yet the human content, the inner expression is purely emotional. It is precisely that tremendous human impulse which made possible such realization. / What I understand by &ldquo;modern music&rdquo; or &ldquo;contemporary music&rdquo; is merely our music; all the res belongs to historical periods, no matter how close or dear these historical periods may be to us&hellip;Let me tell you what I thought when I got the Little Symphony- well, here is the real thing, here, is our music, here is my music, the music of my time, of my taste, of my culture, here it is, a simple and natural fact to myself, as everything belonging to oneself is simple and natural.</p>",,

This so enraged the poet, that, having a stick in his hand, he laid about him lustily, and broke every thing he could reach. When the poor devil of a potter expostulated with him for destroying the property of a man who had never done him any injury, he replied "" 'Tis false, you have done me the deepest injury; you have murdered my verses; I have caught you in the very fact.""

One of the refugees of 1870, he had made a stay there of considerable duration, and among other pieces brought out his cantata &ldquo;Gallia&rdquo;, which he conducted at the opening of the Royal Albert Hall in 1871.

Having arranged with Messrs. Novello &amp; Co. for its publication (at the highest price ever paid at that time for an oratorio), Gounod arrived late in September to superintend the final rehearsals for its production at the Birmingham Festival.

His manner had a charm that was irresistible, and his kindly eyes, soft and melting as a woman's, would light up with a smile, now tender, now humorous, that fixed itself ineffaceably upon the memory. He could speak English fairly well, but preferred his own language, in which he was a brilliant conversationalist; and he could use to advantage a fund of keen, ready wit. He was influenced at that time by a recrudescence of that religious mysticism which had so strongly characterized his youthful career; but his tone, though earnest and thoughtful when he was dwelling upon his art, could brighten up with the lightness and gaiety of a true Parisian. He was rather upset, on the morning of the London band rehearsal at St. George's Hall, by the numerous mistakes in the parts, which led to frequent stoppages. The trouble reached a climax in the &ldquo;March to Calvary,"" where, after about the ninth or tenth stop, Gounod turned to Costa and remarked: &ldquo;Seulement ici puis-je pardonner tous ces arrets, quoiqu'ils gatent ma musique.&rdquo; </span></p>

Gounod said to me later, &ldquo;They are wonderful readers, these English players. There is scarcely a mistake that is due to inaccurate deciphering of the notes.

The season of 1842, in obedience to this custom, opened on Saturday, the 12th April, with the ""Gemma di Vergy"" of Donizetti, Madame Moltini appearing for the first time as the prima donna, and Guasco as leading tenor. The choice of the opera, given rather to meet the views of the singers than those of the manager, was by no means felicitous. ""Gemma di Vergy,"" although abounding in melody and effects, both dramatic and musical, was not esteemed one of Donizetti's finer compositions, albeit a favourite opera in many parts of Italy. Donizetti, likewise, had found, up to this time, but slight favour with the English public, or, at all events, with the English press. He occupied, then, in this country, a position similar to that which afterwards fell to the lot of his successor, Verdi; and even among a great portion of the numerous critics, amateurs as well as ""professionals,"" he was pronounced, by many arbiters of taste, ""flimsy,"" ""meretricious,"" ""noisy,"" ""unsound,"" ""plagiarist,"" and so on. ""Gemma"" was unquestionably a failure; as, indeed, it would have proved under these prejudices with even stronger claims to approbation.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

There can be no doubt that it immensely enhanced the reputation of the composer, whose genius as a writer of comic operas had been brilliantly exemplified eighteen months before by the production of &ldquo;The Mikado&rdquo;. The laurels yielded by the Savoy operas were of necessity shared by Sir Arthur with his talented collaborator, Mr. W. S. Gilbert. In regard to the Leeds cantata, the composer certainly owed much to Longfellow's lovely poem and to Mr. Joseph Bennett's adroit adaptation thereof; but, this apart, there was no one to divide with him the glory of a supreme triumph, of an artistic achievement that stood &ldquo;head and shoulders&rdquo; above all his previous efforts. The overwhelming success at Leeds was the more remarkable in that it came at the close of the greatest festival ever held there&mdash; following new works of such calibre as Dvorak's oratorio &ldquo;St. Ludmila,"" A. C. Mackenzie's cantata &ldquo;The Story of Sayid&rdquo;, and Villiers Stanford's fine choral ballad &ldquo;The Revenge,"" not to speak of a phenomenal performance by the Yorkshire chorus of Bach's great Mass in B minor, never before attempted at a provincial festival. The most tremendous ovation of all, though, was that which greeted the composer of ""The Golden Legend"" when he laid down his baton at the close of the noble choral epilogue. Such ringing British cheers had not been heard in that magnificent hall since Queen Victoria opened it in the ""fifties.""</span></p>",,

Gailhard, came over to England and travelled west to Craig-y-nos Castle to invite Madame Patti to go over to Paris and sing, and she kindly consented to do so. Signor Nicolini invited the late Mr. Augustus Spalding, Mr. Percy Harrison, the late Mr. N. Vert, and myself to go over to Paris and hear the performances. We four, accordingly, travelled over to Paris and stayed at the Hotel Meurice in the Rue de Rivoli. <em>Romeo et Juliette</em> was a brilliant success, and was sung to packed houses.

Taffanel, who used to play the flute in the 188 SOME GREAT PERSONALITIES orchestra Gounod only conducting the first of the four performances. We had seats in a box in one of the upper tiers that night, and for the next three performances had very good seats in the stalls.

The Ball Scene, where Juliet faints through the effect of the potion given her by Friar Lawrence in the second act, is always omitted at Covent Garden, but it was given in Paris, and altogether it was a memorable occasion. This was the first time I had seen the New Opera-house, with its grand staircase and superb joyer. The only thing which threw a kind of damper on my enjoyment was that I lost my pocket-book in the crush while trying to get my overcoat at one of the cloak-rooms connected with that part of the stalls where we sat. There were a great many other people trying to get their coats, and I felt a man pressing against me who, I suppose, was the one who stole my little book. Fortunately it contained no money, only my return-ticket to London, and, what I regretted most, a card from Gounod introducing me to Ambroise Thomas, in which he was kind enough to call me his confrere.

The soldier, not acquainted with that kind of performance, and perhaps never having heard a sacred song in his life, rushed up to where I stood, looking quite alarmed. I knew that he could not understand a word of what I was singing, so I kept right on to the end of the psalm.

None, perhaps, of Verdi's works had kindled more enthusiasm in Italy, or crowned the fortunate composer with more abundant laurels than his ""Attila.""

In catering for novelty, therefore, the Director of Her Majesty's Theatre must be held to have done well in producing a work of so great repute, and in placing before his subscribers the leading opera of the day upon the Italian stage. To prove with what good will this was done, the opera had been ""mounted"" with great scenic splendour, and with every ""appliance"" likely to produce effect.

The English words put to it, "" Oh, thou wert born to please me,"" were very good, and chimed in well with the scene ; no piece of music ever produced a greater effect ; it was always called for three times, and no performance was allowed to go on in which it was not introduced ; it was sung about the streets by the ballad-singers, and parodied by the news-boys, who used to sing to each other, "" Oh thou wert born to tease me, my life, my only love ;"" in short, it was completely the rage all over Ireland, England, and Scotland, for many, many years.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dublin

That artist's superb assumption of Floria Tosca, coming as it did on top of a series of triumphs in such roles as Brilnnhilde, Sieglinde, Elsa, Elisabeth, and Leonora, was but another revelation of her versatility and of her vocal and histrionic charm. This was Ternina's first essay as the heroine of Puccini's picturesque work, and she received excellent support from De Lucia as Pietro Cavaradossi, and from Scotti as Scarpia &mdash; this last a creation which has won universal recognition as an ideal presentment of one of the most subtle and malevolent figures in modern opera. Altogether it was a splendid performance, and Luigi Mancinelli conducted it in his most masterly manner.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

Out of tune, and sinking the pitch, were faults common to quite a number of the solo singers. The chorus was, in the poorest instances, tolerable; but it was not so with the solo singers, who were not, in all cases, better than we have heard heretofore, under circumstances where little was expected, and nothing realized. It is comparatively easy to have a chorus well done, but there are very few singers who have carried vocal cultivation so far as to be able to sing a solo part, or a part in a trio or quartet, well enough to save the hearer from absolute pain.</p>",,

Many people are not aware that at least one of these Evangelists was a vocalist in a minstrel entertainment in America many years before they came to England on their religious mission. They came to Liverpool on their great campaign, and at a time when Aynsley Cook, as the Baron in ""The Babes of the Wood,"" was singing a topical song called ""It's a fraud."" Cook I certainly think unwisely brought in the Moody and Sankey movement, ending with the gag-words ""It's a fraud."" This brought on an acrimonious newspaper warfare, and Aynsley Cook's disclosures in self-defence of the burnt-cork attributes of the popular Evangelist.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liverpool

He was a very old man. His sister, nearly his own age, kept his house for him. She was reckoned a deep blue, and very well versed in all the arts and sciences: The great poet Metastasio had lived sixty year in her brother's house, upon the most friendly terms, and died in it. The colleges of Bologna and Pavia gave her the title of Dottoressa ; and deputations came from both those places, with her diploma. When I was admitted to her conversaziones and musical parties, she was in the vale of years, yet still possessed the gaiety and vivacity of a girl, and was polite and affable to all. Mozart was an almost constant attendant at her parties, and I have heard him play duets on the piano-forte with her, of his own composition. She was a great favourite of his.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna

It had been known for some time that Theresa <br />Tietjens was suffering from cancer; and, after much hesitation, the doctors <br />decided to perform an operation before the end of May. ""Lucrezia"" was announced <br />for the 19th, and among the prima donna's friends it was pretty well understood <br />that this would be her last appearance before the operation was performed. 

When the day arrived Tietjens was far too ill to be really fit to sing. It was <br />distinctly against her medical advisers' wish that she insisted upon keeping <br />faith with her manager and the public a practice that she had persistently <br />adhered to throughout her career. How she contrived to get through the opera I <br />shall never understand. It can only be compared to some splendid example of <br />martyrdom. She fainted after each of the acts, but immediately on recovering <br />consciousness decided to proceed with the performance. Never so much as a look <br />or gesture betrayed to her audience the mortal anguish she was suffering. Only <br />the initiated knew how much of reality there was in the terrible scream of agony <br />uttered by Lucrezia in the final scene when she perceives that her son is dead. <br />As it rang through the house the audience shuddered. Yet the brave artist would <br />not shirk her fall at the end. What it cost her could be guessed, however, from <br />the fact that after the curtain had been twice raised in response to rapturous 
plaudits, she still lay motionless upon the ground. She had once more become <br />insensible. 

In the following week the operation was performed, but the case was hopeless, <br />and on October 3, 1877, Theresa Tietjens breathed her last.</pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

<p>At San Carlo's are performed grand serious operas, (the other three theatres are for the opera buffa,) the first I saw there was Metastasis Olim-piade, the music by Metzlevisic, a German of great musical celebrity. I thought it very fine, and the performance exquisite.</p>
<p>The celebrated Marchesi, the first soprano, performed the part of Megacle ; his expression, feeling, and execution in the beautiful aria, "" Se cerca se dice l'amico dov'e,"" were beyond all praise. Ansani, then the finest tenor voice in Europe, was there; and Macherini his wife, was the principal female singer ; she had a very sweet voice, but small, and of limited compass ; the Neapolitans called her "" La cantante con la parruca,"" from her wearing a wig, in consequence of her head being shaved during illness, previous to her engagement ; but they liked her in spite of her wig !</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples

To this rehearsal tickets were sold at a small price, and the amount thus collected was to be given to the poor. The house was filled, and quite a considerable sum must have been received.&nbsp;</p>",,

The success of this great singer was necessarily triumphant; and the season, in appearance at all events, could not have commenced under happier auspices. The public is a child in many respects&mdash; in many respects, too, a spoiled child, a very spoiled child. It cried still for its favourite toy &mdash; Jenny Lind. However brilliant the new toy placed before it for its delectation and amusement, it would not take to it as, under other circumstances, it might have done. The favourite image and idol of the last two years was ever in its thoughts. However eminently successful as was the debut of Mademoiselle Alboni at Her Majesty's Theatre, it hardly carried with it that prestige to which it was fairly entitled.</span></p>",,

<p>They had at that time excellent performers. The celebrated Genaro Luzzio was the primo buffo, and the principal female, La Coltellini, was delightful, both as a comic actress and singer.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples

This positively took place (we repeat it, for it will hardly be credited) during the public performance at the Dusseldorf festival. The second day a notice was posted up to the following effect: &ldquo;Smoking will not be allowed in the hall during the public performances.&rdquo; An advance in civilization, surely! Hats were worn on succeeding days, but the smoking disappeared.</p>",,

The uproar aroused by the new Leipzig Musikzeitung attracted a lot of curious people here. Last night there was a lady in the loge next to my wife who kept telling her neighbours what she had read in that paper and she remarked that in this work Richard Wagner had created a completely new catastrophe in music. Others said: &ldquo;This is no music at all,&rdquo; and left after the second act. /But the opera has gained many admirers because of its subject matter and seriousness, and when I compare it with other productions of recent years, I admire it also. Much that was extremely offensive to me at the beginning I have already got used to after a few more hearings, but I&rsquo;m always repelled by its lack of rhythm and well-rounded phrases. This production is really exceptionally good and we shall hear few so precise in Germany. Last night not a single note was omitted in the enormously difficult ensemble of singers in the second act. / Still, that doesn&rsquo;t prevent its being really terrifying music in some parts, especially just before the part where Elizabeth throws herself on the singers rushing in on Tanh&auml;user. Imagine the faces Haydn and Mozart would make if they had to listen just once to the hellish noises that now pass for music!/ The intonation in the pilgrims&rsquo; choruses (but in this performance they were supported by clarinets and bassoons piano) was so pure that for the first time I felt somewhat reconciled to the farfetched and unnatural modulations. It is astonishing what the human ear can gradually get used to! After this experience I can understand how Mendelssohn, who was fed largely on Bach&rsquo;s music from the time he was a boy, could write such harsh harmonies, in fact downright cacophony. But of course that&rsquo;s nothing compared to what Schumann is doing.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Louis_Spohr,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kassel
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436174968369,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>MONSIEUR JULLIEN was the director of the English Opera at Drury Lane when I arrived with my father in 1848, and my father often took me there. Hector Berlioz, the celebrated French composer, was the conductor. I heard many operas there in English, including Mozart's<em> Le Nozze di Figaro</em>, the night after my arrival, in which Miss Charlotte Ann Birch was the Susanna. She had a very fine soprano voice. Miss Miran, who had a lovely mezzo-soprano voice, sang ""Cherubino""; unhappily she died while still young. Sims Reeves and many other well-known artists also appeared.</p>",,

serenaded on her birthday at Christmas with the strains of the &ldquo;Vorspiel""
to &ldquo;Parsifal,"" of which work he had then completed the first act. The only
question was how to obtain an orchestra. After some reflection, Wagner
determined to procure the services of the celebrated Meiningen performers, but
of course without their conductor, then no other than Dr. Hans von Biilow, Frau
Cosima Wagner&rsquo;s first husband. The project was kept a profound secret, and
young Anton Seidl was forthwith despatched to Meiningen to arrange matters with
the band. He arrived there early in the morning, and went direct to the hotel
at which von Bulow was staying. The worthy doctor was practising, and, being
unacquainted with Seidl, sent out word that he could not see him until eleven
o'clock. Accordingly, at that hour he presented himself at the great pianist's
apartment and was duly ushered into his presence. At the first mention of
Wagner's name von Bulow drew himself up and inquired in an icy tone what it was
that Herr Wagner wanted. Seidl explained the object of his mission.</span><br />The &ldquo;ambassador"" quickly found the leader
of the band, and, the Duke of Meiningen's permission being readily granted, it
was arranged that the men should be at Bayreuth by a certain evening. They
assembled in good time at the Sonne Hotel, where Wagner met them and conducted
a rehearsal of the &ldquo;Vorspiel&rdquo; Early next morning, while Frau Cosima was still
asleep, the heavier instruments were conveyed to Wahnfried, and the players
quietly stationed themselves at their desks in the vestibule and upon the
staircase. When all was ready, Wagner gave the signal, and his much-honored
wife awoke from her slumbers to hear for the first time the mystic phrases of
the prelude to &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo;.</span></pre>",,

I saw <em>Boris Godounoj</em> with considerable interest. I heard pleasant and impressive passages, and others less so. In one scene I saw an insignificant friar who suddenly becomes the Emperor in the next scene. One entire act is made up of processions, the ringing of bells, popular songs, and dazzling costumes. In another scene a nurse tells pretty stories to the children in her charge. Then there is a love duet, which is neither introduced nor has any relationship to the development of the work; an incomprehensible evening entertainment, and, finally, funeral scenes in which Chaliapine was admirable.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camille_Saint-Sa%C3%ABns,

It was at Newcastle, I first had the pleasure of meeting <br />that genuine child of Momus, Liston; and, on my return to London, strongly 
recommended Messrs. Sheridan and Richardson to engage him for Drury Lane : but <br />procrastination was their motto ; and it is to George (Dolman's discernment, that <br />the public are indebted for the invaluable acquisition of Listen's unrivalled <br />talents to the London stage: he made his first appearance in Zekiel Homespun, in <br />the ""Heir at Law,"" at the Haymarket Theatre (14th June, 1805).

These were held in August and September, under the management of Messrs. A. and S. Gatti. My old friend Signor Luigi Arditi was the conductor for the first few seasons, and he was succeeded in turn by Sir Arthur Sullivan and Mr. F. H. Cowen; while later on came a popular Welsh bandmaster, Mr. Gwyllym Crowe. Much that was interesting and instructive the shilling habitue could hear at these &ldquo;Promenades&rdquo;; but for me the most notable recollection associated with them is the occasion when Arditi gave the first performance in England of the &ldquo;Trauermarsch"" from &ldquo;Gotterdammerung."" The new tubas had only just arrived, and there was not much time for rehearsing. Nevertheless, it seemed to me that the wonderful excerpt was fairly well played, though I was too breathless with amazement and admiration to be able to form a cool judgment. But I do know that the audience hardly waited for the last note before it burst into frantic applause, and insisted upon having the march played a second time.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

I can well remember the first performance in England of this overture at a New Philharmonic Concert on May 1st, 1854: I was playing in the orchestra. It is usually stated that it was first given at an Old Philharmonic Concert in 1855 under Richard Wagner's direction, which is incorrect.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

I can find no words adequate to give you any real idea of the impression she has made. Independent of the fact that the language of panegyric is exhausted, this wonderful artiste stands far too high in my judgment to be dragged down by commonplace complimentary phrases, such as newspaper writers so copiously indulge in. This is no short-lived fit of public enthusiasm. Everybody wants to see and hear her, or, having seen her, to see her and hear her again.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

She was the first to sing the leading role in Verdi's <em>La Traviata</em>. She was a little woman, but rather handsome, with fine, even features. It used to be said that she would never succeed in being able to shake, although she worked very hard at this accom- plishment, and in this particular opera it was so necessary to sing a shake, the arias being full of trills as well as runs, chromatic scales, and brilliant bravura passages. However, she got through all these difficulties with much credit to herself. I remember well a certain evening on which she sang <em>La Traviata</em>, because Mr. Charles Braham, son of the celebrated John Braham, took the part of Alfredo in that opera, which he had studied with me, and had previously studied in Italy, and it was his first appearance at the opera here. Naturally he felt very nervous, and so was his sister Frances, Countess of Waldegrave, who had previously asked me to remain with her on that memorable occasion at her house in Carlton Gardens until after the performance was over. The result was most favourable to Mr. Braham, and Lady Waldegrave was overjoyed, and presented Mademoiselle Piccolomini with a very handsome piece of jewellery as a mark of her gratitude for singing with her brother.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Mrs. Bradlee sent in her younger daughter in the evening to say tea was waiting. I took tea with them and accompanied them to the social concert given by the pupils of the female monitorial school under the instruction of Lowell Mason. I was very much delighted to hear the little girls sing alone so sweetly like little birds. Before the exercises commenced, Mr Fowle read an article of his own composition to the visitors. The sentiments were that we were all possessed of the capability of learning to sing that we were of learning to read. That the faculties of mind all required cultivation in order to arrive at a state of perfection, that there is no point at which to stop, that we either constantly make acquisitions, the knowledge already gained, else we are gradually losing what we possess.

I refer to Jenny Lind. The close association which existed <br />between that gifted and noble woman and the city of Norwich is a matter of <br />common knowledge. A bishop of Norwich (Dr. Stanley) it was who persuaded the <br />first of the ""Swedish Nightingales"" to abandon, on religious grounds, the <br />operatic stage; which premature and much-regretted event occurred in 1849. But <br />the famous singer frequently visited Norwich, and more than once she appeared 
at concerts given on behalf of the funds of the Jenny Lind Infirmary for <br />Children, an institution founded by her and still flourishing in the old city. 

At one of these concerts, some time during the middle ""sixties,"" I heard Jenny <br />Lind sing. The voice, I remember perfectly, was as exquisitely clear and fresh <br />as a young girl's; its sweet tones haunted me long afterward. Of the wondrous <br />art of the great singer I was too young to judge; but I shall never forget what <br />she sang, or the rare wealth of religious sentiment with which she invested the <br />prayer of <em>Agathe</em> in the favorite <em>scena</em> from ""Der Freisch&uuml;tz."" Upon the stage, <br />of course, the heroine of Weber's opera always kneels while uttering her <br />touching appeal for her lover's safe return, and Jenny Lind also knelt while <br />singing the same passage upon the platform of St. Andrew's Hall on the occasion<br />I am alluding to.</pre>",,

The success of the work on the first night was ""tremendous."" Never, perhaps, had any new opera been received with such frenzied acclamation. The opera, there is no doubt, abounded in striking and captivating morceaux, and had been composed with earnestness and power. Of melody, there was a rich store, although the ever popular air, by Dr. Arne, ""Where the bee sucks,"" judiciously employed by the composer for the pantomimic music of his Ariel and as the finale of the opera, stood out amidst all its modern companions with a delicious freshness. </span></p>

All the foreign artists were warm in their expressions of delight. One after the other they approached him to say, ""How beautiful! How charming! How exquisite is this motivo!"" Each hummed a melody. The melody was invariably the same. It was that of Arne. Poor Monsieur Halevy must have winced under it, even in the midst of his glory. Moreover, there was a drawback in the decrescendo nature of the composition. Each of the three main acts of the opera (the tempest at sea having formed a prologue) was less effective (even though good in itself) than the preceding one. Nevertheless, the opera was received with a species of wild enthusiasm. Artists, composer, author, conductor, and finally the manager, were one and all called and recalled to receive the overwhelming plaudits of the crowded house. </span></p>

Madame Sontag won herself fresh laurels, and made the part of Miranda one of the very best. But, in the midst of all that was excellent, Lablache stood out in popular estimation as the striking impersonation of the character of Caliban. It was the last, as it was the best ""creation "" of this rare artist. The music as well as the acting taxed to the utmost the powers of one already on the wane. But he rose superior to every difficulty. His Caliban was not only adjudged to be the finest delineation of the character known, even amidst the many great actors who had figured in this extraordinary part upon the English stage, but was hailed as one of the ""finest creations"" ever seen! All was novel &mdash; all was artistic in this wonderful personation. His ""dull earthiness"" and ""brute ferocity,"" his expression of animal love for Miranda, his savage exultation under the influence of wine, and his grovelling, but still revengeful despair, combined to form a masterpiece, and raised Lablache &mdash; if anything could raise him &mdash; to a loftier pinnacle of fame than before. Scarcely less striking was the Ariel of Carlotta Grisi, who exhibited more ""mind"" as well as more poetry of expression in this, than in any previous choreographic effort. Coletti, Baucarde, and Mademoiselle Parodi (in the spirited little part of the sailor Stephana, as it stood in operatic form), all came in for the crumbs which fell from the rich harvest of acclamation so lavishly bestowed upon the above-mentioned artists. It is due to the management, at the same time, to say, that all the scenic illustrations of the ""faery"" opera were fraught with a magnificence and a poetic feeling previously unknown. The contrivance of the vessel wrecking in the storm of the prologue, the landscapes of the ""Enchanted Island,"" and the gorgeous display of spirit power in the concluding tableau, surpassed all yet exhibited on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre.</span></p>",,

It was in those days a rare event for an English singer to venture upon the boards of the Anglo-Italian stage; and the force of fashion and prejudice made the venture one of unusual difficulty. But with his advantages of Italian training and style, Mr. Sims Reeves was entitled to be fairly considered as an Italian singer. He had not only a beautiful natural organ, but expression and passion were at his command, and there can be little doubt that he might have permanently justified the enthusiastic welcome of what might be termed the ""national"" portion of the audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, and might have battled successfully against prejudice, had not difficulties, created by himself, arisen, and caused his secession for the remainder of the season.</span></p>",,

I first heard it under the direction of the composer at these concerts in 1855 at Exeter Hall, when I was playing the violin in the orchestra, and it then made a deep impression on me. I remember seeing Meyerbeer sitting in the audience at this concert. He was a small, slight man, with a very interesting face, and attracted a good deal of attention. At my concert in 1879 Herr Joseph Strauss played the viola obbligato part which had been played by Ernst in 1855. The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh honoured the concert with their presence; the Duke had previously told me that he would go anywhere to hear Beethoven's Overture to Egmont, with which I opened it. Another attraction at this concert was Beethoven's Pianoforte Concerto in E flat, the ""Emperor,"" which was magnificently played by Charles Halle. When I escorted the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh to their carriage at the end they spoke to me in German in most complimentary terms. I had beforehand given the Duke a pianoforte score of the Symphony to enable him to follow it with greater interest.</p>","http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfred,_Duke_of_Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha",http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

In the part of Amina, in ""La Sonnambula,"" she surpassed all previous expectations. In simplicity, tenderness, and grace, in perfect impersonation, these qualities being combined with exquisite delivery of the music, she was universally declared to have beaten all her compeers ""out of the field."" Not only was she the Sonnamhula, but Amina was generally looked upon as the culminating point of her unprecedently successful season. Ably seconded by Gardoni, she stamped the part as her own, and threw a fresh charm over an opera, always beautiful, it is true, but yet ""hackneyed"" to the last degree.</span></p>",,

The opening of it is a masterpiece of harmony, and was warmly applauded by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who honoured the theatre with his presence, and was in the house before the commencement of the opera. Amongst the audience were the late Duke of Cumberland (in the pit), and the Duchess (in her box,) with the present Marquis of Conyngham.

This orchestra, though regarded as inferior to that of the Gewandhaus, is, nevertheless, fully competent to put life into any of the compositions of the great masters; it can expound Beethoven, make clear his meaning, and bring one into communion with his spirit, as was abundantly manifested on the present occasion. It numbers ten violins on a part, five double basses, an equal number of violincellos, and a complete set of wind instruments. A perfect knowledge and command of his instrument, a clear perception of the music to be performed, and the will to do the exact thing necessary, in the best possible manner, seems to belong to each performer. A universal determination to succeed seems to prevail; every man is not only competent to the discharge of his duty, but is at his post, watchful and ready, heart and hand, to put forth his whole power, according to the circumstances, at the indication of the baton.

I am told that throughout the per- formance he did nothing but sob, he found that my phrasing was so pure and touching. At the end of the Farewell Scene, just as I was rushing off, my foot caught in the lace of my skirt, and I fell right down on the floor. ' Dieu Merci,' I did not hurt myself much. ...

This is all the more regrettable since it is not a question of a haphazard gramophone record of just any performance. Far from that, the very purpose of the work on these records is the elimination of all chance elements by selecting from among the different records those which are most successful. It is obvious that in even the very best records one may come across certain defects such as crackling, a rough surface, excessive or insufficient resonance. But these defects, which, for that matter, can be more or less corrected by the gramophone and the choice of the needle, do not in the least affect the essential thing, without which it would be impossible to form any idea of the composition &ndash; I refer to the pace of the movements and their relationship to one another.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Igor_Stravinsky,

One night, too, following upon a long field-day spent in command of his Company, he proposed and carried in the School Debating Society a motion that 'The Classics are the invention of Dr. Kennedy', with its corollary that all archaeological remains were the work of a tourist agency. By a brilliant speech he made his argument plausible to almost the entire house. At the end there was a reminiscence of the earliest days at Broadlands on an evening (described by one of the performers in the following letter afterwards) when quartets were played in the Abbey Church:- """"White is simply splendid-he fairly revelled in the Tschaikowsky Trio. The last time he played with us, the string Quartets, Dvorak in C flat and Schumann in A, were done in the Abbey here-and no concert room could compete with that building. We finished up at my house with the Dohnanyi P. F. Quintet and the big posthumous D mi.

He looks wretchedly ill, but played with great energy and passionate feeling. We had a novelty in F. Hiller's Symphony in E major, with the motto: 'Es muss doch Fr&auml;hling werden,' a work in grand style, with excellent points in it. I recognize in all Hiller's music a composer aiming at what is true and beautiful. Liszt played part of a concerto by Henselt, and his Don Juan Fantasia, with all his gigantic power. The tossing about of his hands, which he seems to think a mark of inspiration, I still regard as an eccentricity, although it is no doubt remarkable that he accomplishes the most perilous jumps with scarcely a single mishap.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig

Orpheus was performed by Rubinelli, a native of Brescia ; his fine contre-alto voice has never been surpassed, and he was an excellent actor as well as a sound musician. The prirna donna was Signora Banti, who had just then returned from London, where she had been engaged at the Opera House. As many of my readers doubtless remember, she had a finely marked countenance, and a noble soprano voice, but was no musician. The difficulties arising from this deficiency she obviated by an extraordinary quickness and niceness of ear, perfect intonation, and strong feeling. She played Euridice finely. The music of this opera was by Bertoni ; one duet between Banti and Rubinelli was almost the most exquisite treat I ever received. Two such voices I never heard before nor since. When a superior contre-alto voice and a fine soprano unite in a duet, nothing can surpass the effect !</p>",,

Paesiello was the Emperor's favourite amongst them; indeed, he took an unbounded interest in his success, and was so enchanted one day by a song Paesiello had just written, that he caught him by the hand, saying, ""Without doubt you are the greatest composer that ever lived."" ""No, sire, I am not,"" replied he; ""while Cimarosa lives, to him must be given the palm."" Paesiello wrote the opera of ""Proserpine,"" which was brought out at Paris under the auspices of the Emperor; but somehow or other it did not suit the French taste, and proved a failure. Napoleon was furious at the non-success of his protege&rsquo;s opera, and observed, ""It is not to be wondered at, for the French understand nothing of music.""

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1432216151622,https://archive.org/details/mylifesacredsongs00sank,"<p>"" One evening in November, 1886,"" says the superintendent of a boys' school, "" I was walking along a street in St. Joseph, Missouri, when I saw before me a great crowd gathered around a door. On coming nearer I saw that it was at the entrance of the hall of the Young Men's Christian Association. In the doorway stood some young men, singing. Just as I came near enough to hear, they began to sing : A ruler once came to Jesus by night, 'lo ask Him the way of salvation and light; The Master made answer in words true and plain, Ye must be born again. When they came to the chorus the sword of the Spirit entered my soul. It seemed to me that I was brought face to face with the Lord Jesus. There on the street, while that song was being sung, I asked Him to teach me how to be bom again &mdash; and He did it.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/St._Joseph,_Missouri"
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1436193426140,https://archive.org/details/memoriesofmusici00ganzuoft,"<p>My concert in 1874 was remarkable for the first appearance on any concert platform of the young Canadian soprano Mile Emma Albani. She sang the great scene and aria ""Il dolce suono"" from Lucia, and ""O luce di quest'anima"" from Linda di Chamounix, and received a great ovation. Another of the items on the programme was Gounod's ""Ave Maria"" on Bach's Prelude, sung by Mlle d'Angeri with violin obbligato by Signor Papini, piano by Sir Julius Benedict and harmonium by Signor Randegger a fine combination which pleased the audience greatly. Mr. Frederick Gye, director of Covent Garden, was present, as he was much interested in Mile Albani's platform debut and wanted to see how she got on at a London concert. His son Ernest afterwards became her husband.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanover_Square_Rooms

She was to appear as the chief ""star"" of the pre-Easter period, and considerable excitement was awakened in musical circles by the announcement that Pasta's favourite pupil would sustain the character of Medea, one of the parts of that great singer that were most strongly stamped upon the memory of a former generation of opera-goers. So, with the ""Medea"" of Mayer, and Mademoiselle Parodi as the enchantress, the theatre once more opened its doors. That I had been judicious in producing this opera, as a lure to curiosity, was attested by the result. But it never could have been expected to occupy a permanent position on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre. The music of Mayer was of the ante-Rossinian school, and was consequently entitled to the respect of the old opera- goers, who in their early days had looked upon Rossini as a mere tune-maker. But it was not one of the best specimens of the early period of the present century, and it had owed its reputation to the correctness of its cold classicality, and, on the Anglo-Italian stage, to the powerful acting of Pasta. To modern ears it seemed tedious and almost commonplace &mdash; at all events, deficient in the dramatic warmth of later composers. The ""mantle"" of Pasta however, even to the literal acceptation of the word, had descended to her pupil; Parodi's performance created a lively interest, stamped, as it was, with the traditions of the great vocal Siddons of the Italian stage. It was powerful, impressive, and, of its kind, brilliant. The ""cast"" included Beletti and Calzolari &mdash; both sure, steady, and satisfactory singers of another school; Madame Giuliani; and, lastly, a new tenor, Micheli, who made his first appearance as Giasone, but failed utterly to obtain a favourable verdict from the critical audience of ""Her Majesty's.""</span></p>",,

The officiating canon and the choir went through it with the speed of railroad travelling, and if that is well done which is done quickly, then this was well indeed. But the idea of worship in such a service, who would think of it, or suppose for a moment that confession, supplication, thanksgiving and adoration, had any part or lot in the matter.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_Paul's_Cathedral
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448659532009,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>After six societies had sung, a recess of half an hour was proclaimed, when the vast multitude retired to the garden, where greetings were given and friends welcomed, and refreshments abundant were passed round, with &ldquo;wine which maketh glad the heart of man.&rdquo; It was interesting to move about among the thronged avenues and crowded tables, see the eating and drinking and smoking, and hear the mirthful laugh and lively prattle of the busy people. It was fraught with instructive lessons, too; but we must not moralize now, but only attempt to describe. The half-hour having been prolonged by one half or more, the sound of the trumpet was heard, calling again to action, and soon the contest was resumed.</p>",,

Much credit was due, I had heard, to the talent of this celebrated pupil of the great Paganini, and at once I decided to bring him to England. He was received by the opera-frequenters with admiration, even with enthusiasm. The instrument he played upon was the magic violin bequeathed to him by his dying master, and the fanciful legends of Italy having set afloat a notion that the soul of Paganini had taken refuge in the instrument, the popular ear, charmed by the young artist, listened credulously to the fable. Even in England the press declared that ""Sivori was not Sivori &mdash; it was Paganini restored to another generation in a renovated and younger form.""</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1424695222129,https://archive.org/details/lettersofcompose00norm,"<p>Yesterday I had the Singverein. While practising I felt as if I had already been at the work for twenty-five years. My voice is of no little use to me on these occasions, because I have to shout so loud, and it is an advantage that, like every other, I exploit to the full. My voice sounds quite majestic. While the choir is singing I exercise it and yell above the din, really only on my own account in order to get practice. We intend to do the Zigeunerleben and I am sure it will soon go splendidly. How childishly easy such things are compared with old church music, and my Salve Regina is easy as such things go. This piece would please you very much. I can&rsquo;t tell you very much about Rovetta except that he lived about 1640. Both pieces please the singers very much, and they are taking great pains with them. The Zigeunerleben is exquisite and sounds wonderful. Yesterday with Bargheer I had to accompany the Prince in his songs. I hope it won&rsquo;t often happen&hellip;.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johannes_Brahms,

It is famous for its female conservatories, of which there are four, which are in fact foundling hospitals, supported by wealthy citizens, &amp;c. where the girls are maintained and educated ; some are married from them, and those who display strong talent for music are instructed by the very best masters. They gave concerts every Sunday evening, and on festival days ; I heard two, one at La Piet&agrave;, the other at La Mendicant! the former celebrated for its fine orchestra, the latter for its singers. At La Piet&agrave; there were a thousand girls, one hundred and forty of whom were musicians : all the instruments were charmingly played by girls. The churches were crowded on those occasions ; and while the performance was actually going on, the most perfect silence was observed ; but at the conclusion of a piece of music, which excited their approbation, the audience expressed it in the most extraordinary manner, they coughed aloud, and scraped their feet on the ground, for some moments, but did not utter a word ! which seemed to me a practical mode of pointing out the beauty of concord in opposition to the horrors of discord.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venice

Liszt arrived at Westwood House, Sydenham, very late in the evening and very tired, and was received by a distinguished company of between three and four hundred people who had been specially invited to meet him. He had come over to hear his oratorio, <em>Saint Elizabeth</em>, performed at St. James's Hall on April 6th under the direction of Sir Alexander Mackenzie. I went to hear the performance, and noticed that Liszt occasionally fell asleep, but woke up at hearing the great applause that came at the end of each important part.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Franz_Liszt,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

In an earlier chapter I have made reference to his zeal as a conductor. Some of his Scots ancestry was perhaps responsible for the snap and go so frequently revealed in himself and in his compositions; yet he had another side, as will be remembered by those who were at the Philharmonic Concert in St. James's Hall in May, 1888. He conducted the orchestra in his two ""Elegiac Melodies,"" and played his Pianoforte Concerto, but surely the rare charm of that evening was the singing by Madame Grieg of some of her husband's songs to his accompaniment, songs which led several of the critics to proclaim a new range of emotion found in subtlety of rhythm and curiously arresting turns of expression.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

After several songs had been sung, Storace, who was present, asked me to give them the Canzonetta. Now thereby hung a tale, new to the company ! The truth was this: There was an old miser of the name of Varesi, living at Vienna, who absolutely denied himself the common necessaries of life, and who made up his meals by pilfering fruits and sweetmeats from the parties to which he was invited ; the canzonetta for which Storace asked, he was particularly fond of singing with a tremulous voice, accompanied by extraordinary gestures, and a shake of the head ; it was, in fact, this imitation which I was called upon to exhibit, and I did so. During my performance, I perceived Casti particularly attentive, and when I had finished, he turned to Paesiello, and said, "" This is the very fellow to act the character of Gafferio, in our opera ; this boy shall be our old man ! and if he keep old Varesi in his eye when he acts it, I will answer for his success."" The opera was brought out, the drama was excellent, and the music was acknowledged the chef-d'oeuvre of Paesiello. Overflowing houses, for three successive seasons, bore testimony to its merits. I played the old man ; and although really little more than a boy, never lost sight of the character I was personating for a moment. After the first night's performance, His Majesty, the Emperor, was pleased to have it signified to me, through Prince Rosenberg, that he was so much surprised and pleased with my performance, that he had ordered an addition to my salary of one hundred zecchinos per annum, (about fifty pounds British,) which I ever after enjoyed, during my stay at Vienna : in short, wherever I went I was nicknamed Old Gafferio.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna

He always enjoyed singing the part of Leporello in Mozart's Don Giovanni, and I remember an amusing incident that happened in connection with it. It was in his first song ""Madamina,"" when he recounts Don Giovanni's easy conquests of admiring ladies, putting the number at <em>mille e tre</em>. On this occasion, when the phrase came again he repeated it in English ""a thousand and three"" and the whole house roared with laughter.

Both parties agreed to recognize in the then organist of the Paris Madeleine (a post held by Saint-Saens from 1858 until 1877) a musician of prodigious talent, endowed with a versatility that enabled him to shine in every branch of his art, and possessed of a mastery of technique that could adapt itself to whatsoever style he might for the moment choose to exploit. He was as brilliant a pianist as he was an organist, his habit of playing the one instrument never spoiled his exquisite touch for the other, and his gift of improvisation was marvelous. Saint-Saens made his debut in London, in 1871, at the Musical Union; but I did not hear him until 1879, when he played his own pianoforte concerto in G minor at the Philharmonic.</p>",,

On one occasion she asked me to arrange a performance of <em>La Traviata</em>, as her husband, Baron Rolf Cederstrom, had never seen her on the stage. I had engaged some singers from London, and a small orchestra from Swansea, which I conducted. It was a memorable performance, and I never heard her sing better, nor with more pathos, than in the last act, in the dying scene, when everybody was moved to tears and felt as if, in the death of Violetta, they had lost a personal friend. The audience consisted of her friends staying at the castle, and the rest of the stalls were filled with the families of her neighbours, while the little gallery contained her personal attendants and tenants. Of course the applause of the audience was most enthusiastic. A performance of Grand Opera in a private house, under such circumstances, was most interesting.</p>",,

We performed "" The Haunted Tower,"" in Dublin, with complete success.

Anxious to hear what the papers said of my performance of the night before, I opened the street door, and calling the news-boy to me, asked him for Freeman's Journal ; "" Sir,"" said the ragged urchin, "" I've sold the last I had."" Then,"" said I, "" you stupid dog, if you have sold them, why are you crying them about the street ?""

The shout of joy uttered by the students when he sat down at the piano was something to remember. It was followed by an intense silence. Then the aged but still nimble fingers ran lightly over the keys, and I was listening for the first time in my life to Franz Liszt. To attempt to describe his playing, after the many well-known Weimar pupils and distinguished writers who have tried to accomplish that task, would be mere presumption on my part. Even at seventy-five, Liszt was a pianist whose powers lay beyond the pale to which sober language or calm criticism could reach or be ap- plied. Enough that his greatest charm seemed to me to lie in a perfectly divine touch, and in a tone more remarkable for its exquisitely musical quality than for its volume or dynamic force, aided by a technique still incomparably brilliant and superb.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Academy_of_Music

They practice the very best music, from Lasso and Palestrina all the way down to Mendelssohn; and on the afternoon when we were permitted to be present, the Oratorio of Elijah was performed, with Piano Forte accompaniment. The recitatives, songs, and concerted pieces were all given by pupils, and both these and the choruses were highly creditable to the institution. It was not a public performance, and was without rehearsal. Mr. Hauser was so kind as to allow us to choose what Oratorio should be sung, mentioning Elijah, St. Paul, the Creation, Seasons, and others; we chose Elijah, and it was put down before the choir accordingly, and, by them, quite satisfactorily rendered. It was a drilling, or training exercise, and the Director did not hesitate to stop the song whenever anything appeared to him to require it. Solo singers were in several instances stopped and corrected. The Director has full authority, and fears not to use it. After the performance was over, we spoke to him of the great advantage he had over an American Conductor in this respect; for surely no choir with which we are acquainted, would bear such close bringing up to the mark of perfection; and we said to him, that were he in America, and thus corrected faults, especially in a solo singer, the vocalist would very probably take his hat, bid him &ldquo;good evening,&rdquo; and be off. Mr. H. smiled, and said: &ldquo;I am a tyrant here.&rdquo;</p>",,

AT MR. GANZ'S CONCERT He. We are very late, but we are in time for the Fourth Part of this marvellous Symphonic Fantastique. A wonderful man is BERLIOZ. She. Oh, charming! So original! I hope he'll write many more Symphonies. He (with a vague idea that BERLIOZ is no more). Yes, yes! He was a Russian, wasn't he, by the by? She (equally jogged). It is a very Russian name. He (looking at programme). Now for it! Ah! (pretending he knows it by heart) this move- ment illustrates a deep sleep accompanied by the most horrible visions. How admirably those loud sounds of the violoncello express one's idea of a deep sleep ! She (not to be outdone at this game of ""Brag""). Yes, yes! Listen! Now he thinks he is being led to the scaffold to the strains of a solemn march. How gloomy, how awe-inspiring are those pizzicato touches on the violins ! He (having got another bit by heart). Grand! Grand! Just hearken to the muffled sounds of heavy footsteps ! It is finished! Oh, massive! Oh, grand! Like a reverie in some old cathedral ! She. It almost moved me to tears. Nothing more exquisitely doleful have I ever heard! Third Party (leaning over). How do you do? How are you? I saw you come in. How late you were ! But you were in time for that third lovely movement. He and She. Oh, grand! Magnificent! Superb! Solemn !&nbsp;Third Party. The light rustling of the trees moved by the wind was so wonderfully ex- pressed! He (amazed). Eh? Third Party. Yes, you noticed it, of course. Did it not conduce to bring to your heart an unaccustomed placidity, and to give to your ideas a more radiant hue? She (confounded). What? Third Party. Why, the Third Part. He and She. Oh, the Third Party! Third Party. Yes; and now you'll hear the Fourth Part. Now you will hear a deep sleep accompanied by the most horrible visions. Ta! ta! [Exit, and their enjoyment is gone for the Concert. Although some critics gave the work a favourable notice, several papers, and one in particular, cut the Symphony to pieces. This, however, did not affect me, and I repeated it at the next concert. Berlioz had a hard fight in Paris to get his works performed, and it was only after his death that he was fully appreciated by his compatriots. Without being egotistical, I must confess to feeling proud of having brought his Symphonic Fantastique before the English public.</p>",,

""LaFavorita,"" although not entirely new to England, having been already performed at London both in French and English, was new to the Italian boards; and in its Italian form had all the interest of a novelty. Perhaps, thus given as it was with singers far superior to any heard in it in this country, and with a far more correct and powerful ensemble, the opera gained in popular favour rather than lost, through the familiarity of opera-goers with its melodies. Apart from the unwonted interest attached by all the friends and habitues of the long-cherished establishment, to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre in face of the new opposition, considerable sensation was excited by the first appearance on the Anglo-Italian stage of Signor Gardoni. Much had been said of the strange adventures that had befallen the handsome and gentlemanlike young tenor during his brief musical career. His first appearance on the stage raised a battery of opera-glasses from every part of the house; a murmur of gratified expectation followed. The success of Gardoni on this occasion was undoubted. Both his principal solos, sung in the purest taste and with perfect feeling, were encored with enthusiasm. The attraction of his performance was felt by all. Voice, style, and expression were there. His talent as an actor was alone disputed; for these were already days when a singer, however great his merit as a vocalist, was expected (and justly, on the lyrical stage) to be a histrionic artist also. It became the fashion among some dilettanti to say that Gardoni was no actor. Still, even as an actor he was pleasing. His manner, his bearing, his feeling, his conception of parts were blameless. He lacked only one element &mdash; power; he was not capable of bursts of passion.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Christine Nilsson now at the finest period of her career led off a group of sopranos that included Minnie Hauk, Etelka Gerster, Clara Louise Kellogg, Marie Roze, and, last but not least, Marie Vanzandt, a youthful debutante whose delightful singing as Zerlina and Amina took the London world completely by surprise. Trebelli, unapproachable as ever in her way, stood at the head of the contraltos; Campanini and Fancelli were the best tenors; and among the barytones and basses were Del Puente, Galassi, Eota, Behrens, and Foli. Some of the artists here named also took part in the autumn season which Mr. Mapleson gave at the same opera-house in the Haymarket now, by the way, the site of Mr. Beerbohm Tree's theatre and the Carlton Hotel.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

An apology was made for ""huskiness,"" and he again came on, omitting his ""aria."" Discontent began to be manifest. The ""Rosina"" (Madame Grisi) came forward, but commenced her air in such ""admired disorder,"" that further manifestations of disapprobation arose. The prima donna, in her turn, came to a stand-still, and confronted the audience with wrathful brow. The jollity of Lablache for a time restored something like composure: at the commencement of the celebrated finale, however, Almaviva having reappeared, and murmurs having been again heard, the indignant tenor left the stage, to return no more that evening. The inimitable humour of Lablache, expressed at this sudden flight, restored the audience to good temper by its irresistible comicality. Another apology was made &mdash; Signor Corelli had been sent for; and after some delay, the opera proceeded, with Corelli as the Almaviva of the night. An angry correspondence ensued between the management and the offending tenor: I, on my part, protesting that with but a slight display of good will, Signor Mario might have spared such an indignity to the subscribers and the public &mdash; the recalcitrant tenor imperatively asserting that on his part with failing voice, and the burden of public disapprobation, he was wholly dans ses droits in leaving the stage abruptly. The breach between the management and two artists, with whom it was difficult to negotiate, and whom it was next to impossible to control, was thus widened more and more; until, with other elements of discontent (not apparently prominent until the ensuing season) the chasm became so wide and deep, so impossible to bridge over by concession, that a rupture was positively looked forward to as a relief.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448310549245,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>The presence of Robert and Clara Schumann was enough to attract a large audience. Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand &mdash; the signal is given &mdash; every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven&rsquo;s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven&rsquo;s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.</p>
<p>A very good singer followed; Frau Leopoldine Tuczek-Herrenburg, from Berlin, in a Recitative and Arie from the opera of &ldquo;Sylvana,&rdquo; by C. Maria von Weber.</p>
<p>This was followed by a grand Concerto for the Piano Forte, with orchestral accompaniment (G moll), composed by J. Moschelles, and played by Clara Schumann. I have already spoken of Madame Schumann&rsquo;s playing; her performance of this Concerto was perfect, and received the warmest approbation from the audience.</p>
<p>An air of De Beriot followed, by Frau Tuczek-Herrenburg; after which Madame Schumann played most charmingly a Notturno (B. major) for piano forte, by F. Chopin. In this she was encored, and played in answer to the call another piece unknown to the writer.</p>
<p>The second part of the concert was that in which the musical ones were most deeply interested, for it consisted of Robert Schumann's new Symphonie. This has not been published, and was played from manuscript, conducted by the author, who was cordially greeted on his appearance at the head of the orchestra. It is undoubtedly a work of great merit; but it is truly a great work, and can only be performed by a very thoroughly trained band. Its analogies and correspondencies are deeper and more hidden than in Mozart or Beethoven, but nevertheless they are there, and can be discovered to some extent even at a first hearing. The Symphonie consists of five movements, there being in addition to the usual movements a short adagio (fourth) introduced. In the second movement (scherzo), there is playfulness and relief, but throughout the whole the idea of greatness prevails; so much so as almost to oppress one with a feeling of grandeur and sublimity. The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do. The captain inspired confidence, and the result was most satisfactory. There was but a momentary pause between the parts, and in this respect the learned conductor&rsquo;s example is well worthy of imitation. The Symphonie occupied thirty-three minutes in its performance, and at half-past eight the concert closed.</p>",,

Doc.,"" honoris causa, upon two of the world's greatest musicians, Johannes Brahms and Joseph Joachim. The distinguished violinist readily accepted this invitation...To Brahms the intended compliment involved a good deal more. It meant a long journey to a country that he had never visited, and, as he afterward bluntly admitted, had never had the smallest desire to visit. He looked upon England as probably the least musical of European countries, and set no store whatever upon honorary degrees, even when bestowed by such an ancient university as Cambridge. He therefore declined the invitation to be present, but expressed his willingness to receive the degree if it could be conferred in absentia; and he offered as his doctor's "" exercise "" the new symphony in C minor, No. 1, which had been performed for the first time in the previous November at Karlsruhe. After some consideration the offer was accepted, and March 8, 1877, was the day fixed for the ceremony to take place at Cambridge...If the ""Deutsches Requiem"" opened the eyes of German music-lovers, it was assuredly the symphony in C minor that awakened English ears to a just and worthy estimate of the gifts of the Hamburg composer. The impression created at Cambridge was to spread within a few years over the entire kingdom. ""What a masterpiece for a first symphony!"" exclaimed Garcia, as we listened to the rehearsal by the Cambridge University Musical Society under Villiers Stanford. What a masterpiece indeed! And what patience for such a musician to have waited before writing it until he was forty-three years old and could inscribe ""Op. 68"" upon the score of his symphony No. 1! Of course we all smiled when the opening theme of the finale suggested that unmistakable resemblance to the corresponding subject in the last movement of Beethoven's ""Ninth,"" which Brahms always protested he could not perceive. But the trifling similarity mattered naught unless to lend the new work a greater charm; for Brahms was nothing if not original, and the soul of honesty itself. His beautiful ""Schicksalslied"" was also performed at this concert, and it helped to confirm the deep impression created by the symphony. Alas, that he should not have been there himself! But the personal tribute paid that day to his beloved friend, Joseph Joachim, was in every way remarkable. Well-known musicians came from distant parts of the country to be present. It 'was to do honor to the illustrious violinist whom he had known long years that my own venerable master made the journey from the metropolis to witness the bestowal upon him of a distinction similar to that which had already been conferred upon himself as the inventor of the laryngoscope. And never has the Public Orator of Cambridge University employed terms more felicitous or more eulogistic than he contrived to put into his Latin speech in this instance. Dr. Joachim's ""exercise"" consisted of his fine overture in memory of the celebrated poet Heinrich von Kleist, which was played under his own direction. He also gave a superb performance of the Beethoven violin concerto, of which work he is, by common consent, admitted to be the greatest of all interpreters.</p>",,

The solo artists included three members of the original quartet, namely: Mme. Stolz, Mme. Waldmann, and Signor Masini.

But the undoubted gem of the whole performance was the &ldquo;Agnus Dei&rdquo;, with its octave unison phrases for the two women's voices, sung by Stolz and Waldmann with a delicacy and charm of simply ethereal loveliness. Nor shall I forget the pains taken by Verdi at rehearsal to obtain from his chorus and orchestra of eight hundred a pianissimo in fitting proportion to the exquisite tone of these singers.</span></p>

I went, first, to the grand opera, and was delighted with the magnificence of the scenery, decorations, and dresses, and, above all, with their choruses ; in that department they decidedly bear away the palm from every other country the orchestra was most minutely attended to, and more numerous than even that of San Carlo at Naples : but the principal singers (God save them) made a shriek louder than I thought any human beings capable of producing. The opera was Gluck's Iphigenia, which we had performed at Vienna ; but for decorations and effect, Paris beat us out of the field. The chorus and procession, where Pylades and Orestes in chains, were dragged on by Gardel, Vestris, and a host of first-rate dancers, were beyond any thing I could have conceived. I went the next night to the same theatre, and saw the first representation of the grand serious opera of ""Oedipe a Colon ;"" the music by Sacchini, was delightful and enchanting. I there heard, for the first time, the celebrated bass singer, Cheron, who played the part of Oedipe, and sang in a delightful style ; it was quite different from the performance of the night before, indeed I could scarcely imagine myself in the same theatre. I saw, too, the opera of Phedra, and had great pleasure in seeing Madame St. Auberti perform the part of Phedra ; she was a great actress, and when she sang in a demi voice, was quite charming. This unfortunate lady and accomplished actress subsequently married, and with her husband, the Count d'Entraigues, was robbed and murdered by their servant when in England. In this opera I felt much gratified by hearing Monsieur Lais, possessing a fine baritone voice, with much taste and expression ; but his greatest praise, in my opinion, was, that he was very unlike a French singer. The next theatre I visited, was the Francais. Their great tragedians, at the time, were on leave of absence in the provinces ; I had not, therefore, an opportunity of seeing a tragedy, but I was amply compensated by their excellent comedians ; their comic acting is always natural. I saw Mole act the part of Duretete, in Farquhar's Inconstant, admirably. Fleury was inimitable in Le Pupile (the guardian) ; and Madame Contare in Susan, Beaumarchais' Marriage of Figaro, exquisite. Dugazzon was a fine low comedian ; indeed, I thought all the actors good ; but my favourite theatre of all was the Theatre Italien, in the Rue Favart, where French comic operas were performed ; the orchestra was very good, and the actors and singers equally so, a Mademoiselle Renard had a most delightful voice, and was a sweet singer. I saw there "" Richard Coeur de Lion,"" and enjoyed its charming music. I thought it always Gretry's masterpiece. Clairval, the original Blondel, gave the air of "" O Richard ! O mon Roi !"" with great expression. His acting in the scene when he heard the voice of Richard from the prison, was electrifying : his joy, his surprise, at having found his king, the trembling of his voice, his scrambling up the tree to let Richard hear his voice, and the expression altogether, made an impression on me that never can be effaced ; and while I remained at Paris, I never missed going to see him. Monsieur Philippe played Richard remarkably well, and gave the bravura air, "" L'univers que j'ai perdu,"" with great skill and animation.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

But one piece was sung, and that was a new composition by Robert Schumann, &ldquo;Der Rose Pilgerfahrt&rdquo; (Pilgrimage of the Rose,) an allegory by M. Horn, to which Schumann has written music. The choir consisted of about one hundred voices, well balanced as to the parts, with an efficient orchestra; the whole directed by the Concertmeister David.</p>
<p>The music is mostly solo, though some fine chorus effects are produced, especially in a funeral scene, the &ldquo;burial of a miller&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo; It is, throughout, highly scientific or learned, and of course difficult. A very fine musician, Mr. Richter, teacher of harmony and instrumentation in the conservatory, who was sitting beside me, said, &ldquo;Robert Schumann is truly a great composer, but his music must be studied, and heard more than once, to be appreciated; we cannot understand it at the first hearing.&rdquo; His opera, &ldquo;Genoveva,&rdquo; failed &mdash; it is too learned, and is now seldom performed.

There had been no previous announcement of her remarkable powers, and the public were taken by surprise and highly delighted, and I felt sorry I had not gone to hear her, even for a short while ; but I managed to do so later on, and was charmed with her singing. The house had been sold out the nights she appeared, and I had the greatest difficulty in even getting standing room to hear her. There is no need for me to dwell upon the beautiful quality and exceptional compass of her voice and her brilliant powers of execution. In the great Mad Scene she brought down the house with thunders of applause. The revival of interest in the old operas of Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti is largely due to Tetrazzini.

There I met Targioni-Tozzetti, part author of the libretti of Mascagni's operas, and also Count Sacconi, architect of the colossal monument to Victor Emanuel, which was then being erected. Mascagni was also there, and played and sang extracts from I Rantzau to Sgambati, and told us he was receiving seven or eight hundred letters a day asking for his autograph. We were all very jovial, and passed a delightful evening.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome

For some years she had held the proud position of the most celebrated prima donna on the lyric stage in Italy. Her advent was naturally heralded by many a flourish of trumpets, not one of which, perhaps, was louder than her great reputation merited. Italy had proclaimed her ""the first among the first."" There was nothing, therefore, which in the slightest degree savoured of ""humbug"" in the ""puff preliminary."" She was not only a great singer and a great actress; she was, moreover, a fine woman. Italy was enthusiastic about her &mdash; why should not England be so likewise ? As it turned out, Madame Frezzolini was received in England with favour, but not with enthusiasm. At all events, her success did not reach the point anticipated. This result may be ascribed to the fact, that her health had suffered greatly, not only from her recent confinement, but from cold and privations endured in one of the houses of refuge on Mount Cenis, where she had been sheltered during a storm for nearly three whole days. Jarring discords between herself and her hus- band, Signor Poggi (which terminated shortly afterwards in a separation), and consequent distress of mind, contributed likewise to deteriorate a voice which had been pre-eminently beautiful when heard a few months previously. The mind and ""school"" of the great artist were no longer adequately seconded by her physical powers. The fine intention still remained; but the full means for consummate execution were wanting. As it was, when the influence of the vieille garde and its numerous adherents, as well as the conservative tendency of the English public, are taken into account, it is manifest that the really great talent of Madame Frezzolini alone enabled her to maintain such a position as she actually did acquire. </span></p>

Nevertheless, in this opera, Ronconi completely established himself, both as singer and actor. Poggi, who had unwisely refused the tenor part, writhed with jealousy to hear Guasco invariably encored in the ""Io Soffru"", a melody which, it may be noticed, bears a considerable resemblance to the tender composition by Reissiger, known as ""Weber's last Waltz.""</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

I was there the first week but already the place had such spirit and atmosphere. Most congenial, and stimulating to a degree. My Alleluia had been sung to perfection at the opening exercises, so my entrance into the place two days later was not so awkward as it might have been. I went to several of the Institute (&ldquo;professional&rdquo; students) Orchestra rehearsals, which gave its first concert on Friday night of the first week, opening (if you please) with a certain E minor Symph, led by Leonard Bernstein, student from C.I.M.[Curtis Institute of Music] I confess I enjoyed this privilege because it was really a fine performance. Most of all I relished watching Koussevitzky sit directly behind the student conductors at all rehearsals, criticizing them at every turn. He has proved himself a fine teacher and &ndash; still more surprising &ndash; a most skilful administrator of the school. His outlook is very broad and he seeks at every turn to do equal justice to the professional and non-professional students. There is no doubt in my mind that he has come out with a permanent institution of the greatest value and importance. It preserves the best in Mr. Surette&rsquo;s Summer School, with an added plus of a fine performing group, the presence of members of the B.S.O and facilities of all kinds &ndash; little operas, masques, plays, large choral works, and a situation that is simply beautiful.

Her success had been all that could be hoped - far greater indeed than had been expected. Under the guise of her engaging smile, fortune seemed again to have beamed upon the theatre. At all events, the promise for the ensuing season of 1850 was more cheering under the new auspices of Sontag than might have been anticipated a few months before. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New';""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",,

We talked of you and mama you may conclude. I dined with him at Sir John Stanley's, whose spirits were so raised by the return of his companion that he would treat him with the opera that he might hear Caristini sing: I went with Lady Chesterfield in her box.

It was for many years the largest in the world, and is famed for its size the world over. We thought it as good as it is great, and listened to its tones with delight. It is indeed very powerful, but its&nbsp;full power is seldom heard, and never in public worship. There are now several organs as large, or larger; for example, the organ in the Town Hall, at Birmingham; but although the Haarlem organ is now equaled in size, and although various improvements (especially within a few years past) have been made both in action and in pipes, yet there is not perhaps anywhere to be found, a more powerful chorus than that of this famous instrument. Dr. Burney took particular pains to examine and describe it, many years ago; and, in his ""Musical Tour in Holland,"" he gives the details which have been often copied and published. The present organist has fine execution, and appears to understand well his instrument; but, it is a pity that, for the sake of pleasing his company, and confirming his hearers in a bad taste, he should employ its noble powers in battle-piece and thunder-storm representations; or, at least, that these should be made the principal feature of his exhibitions.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grote_Kerk,_Haarlem"

The audience assembled on the occasion testified its sense of her good will by an unexpected reception and lavish plaudits throughout the whole evening; and Madame Rossi Caccia, although not to be cited as a thoroughly successful artist, retired from the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, after a performance honoured by sufficiently flattering applause.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

It was this, viz.: the closing voluntary, in both cases, consisted of an introduction and fugue played in excellent style. How noble and elevating is the fugue; this most learned and most interesting style of music is admirably adapted to the organ, and no person ought to be regarded as an organist who cannot play with a clear and distinct articulation, a strict fugue &mdash; yea, even a Bach!</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_Paul's_Cathedral

A boat with two ladies and one gentleman was immediately attracted and pursued us. As soon as they were near enough for us to see their faces, who should we behold but the Duchess of Ancaster, an odd woman with her, and my Lord Tyrconnell! I was not a little diverted at the interview, but much more so when he opened his wise mouth, and told Mrs. Donnellan her singing was ""the finest water language he ever heard, nay, the finest language he had ever heard by land or by water,"" and many more polite speeches we had. They were in an open boat, ours was cover'd: it would have diverted you to see how the wretch peeped to look at us, which was no easy matter. My companion's voice charmed them so much that they did not quit us till she had sung several songs. Capel asked the Duchess of Ancaster to sing, which she in a droll way did very readily; at last they agreed to sing a duetto out of y<sup>e</sup> Beggars' Opera, but such catterwauling never was heard and we all laughed.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Delany,

Despite her twenty-three years upon the stage, this brilliant artist was now also at her best; her voice had lost none of its freshness, and the piquant grace of her style and the marked originality of her conceptions were even more striking than before. Her Selika I can best describe in a single word as a &ldquo;dream&rdquo; &mdash; a supreme achievement to be mentioned in the same breath with the Bosina of Adelina Patti and the Marguerite of Christine Nilsson. Supported by Mierzwinsky as Vasco da Gama, Lassalle as Nelusko, Bagagiolo as Pedro, and Valleria as Inez, Pauline Lucca's performance in &ldquo;L'Africaine&rdquo; is to be folded in the lavender of one's memory.&nbsp; </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""><br /></span></span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

Owing to the fact (I suppose) that there were several distinguished solo singers here, the first part of the concert consisted more of vocal music than usual. A chorus of men&rsquo;s voices was also introduced, and large extracts were given from Cherubini&rsquo;s opera of &ldquo;Ali Baba,"" and from Rossini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wilhelm Tell,"" also an aria from Don Juan by Mozart. Two overtures were admirably played, viz.: Leonore No. 2, Beethoven, and William Tell, Rossini. The fine chorus of men&rsquo;s voices added much to the interest of the concert, but the principal piece was the charming A minor Symphony No. 3, by Mendelssohn. I have often heard this magnificent production of Mendelssohn performed at home, but it is no discredit to our orchestras to say that it is quite a different thing when given with the precision of the Gewandhaus orchestra. I will attempt no description; suffice it to say that it was the perfection of orchestral music &mdash; so soft and so loud, so melancholy and so joyful, so exciting and so soothing, so expressive and so effective &mdash; imagine it, ye who have no opportunity of hearing it.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gewandhaus

All former differences had been amicably arranged with the management, and he came again to assert his true position as one of the best of European tenors. His task was a severe one. He had still to contend with the ill-judged fastidiousness and one-sided prejudice of a class of opera-goers who will never allow any singer, whatever his merits, to be great in his own country. But Reeves accomplished his task with admirable artistic skill, and won his golden spurs in the battle with prejudice in the part of Ernani. His whole performance, dramatic as well as vocal, was one of eminent merit in the opinion of all unbiassed hearers, Parodi was the Elvira of the evening.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

To have them all performed on the same night, by royal command, was no small compliment to the author, and must have been highly satisfactory to him,- The crowd was so great, that at the opening of the doors, in going down the steps which led to the pit, three or four persons slipped and fell, and several others were hurried over them ; sixteen persons were trampled to death, and upwards of twenty were taken up with broken limbs. The news of this fatal accident was, very judiciously, kept from their Majesties until after the performance was over, when they evinced the deepest sorrow and regret at the event.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Haymarket,_London"

This brilliant function took place in July, 1909. The proposed institution was close to my own University of London, and when my friend Dr. Henry T. Bovey, the Rector of the new College, came and asked me to provide appropriate music to grace and assist the ceremony, I greatly appreciated being selected for this honour. Dr. Bovey was one of the many friends whom I had met in Canada, where at his charming residence he had entertained me with engaging kindness. His attainments had procured his nomination to the important post of Rector of this institution devoted to the most advanced training and research in science, especially in its relation to industry. By permission of the Dean, the full choir of the Abbey was able to attend. I arranged a representative programme of glees, madrigals, and other part-music, which found much acceptance in performance. At the moment when His Majesty tapped and levelled the stone, and declared it to be ""well and truly laid,"" I conducted the choir in a setting of Joseph Addison's magnificent hymn, ""The spacious firmament on high,"" which I had specially composed for the occasion.</p>",,

The work had been much talked of since its revival, in revised form, at Bologna in 1875, and Mr. Mapleson took creditable pams to mount it in such fashion that there should be few looijholes for criticism. Truth to tell, it was an exceedingly good representation all round. Christine Nilsson's embodiment of the dual role of Margherita and Helen of Troy had much of poetry and charm; Trebelli was as fascinating and artistic as ever in the contralto parts; Campanini made an excellent Faust; and Nannetti lent rare sardonic color and alertness to the part of Mefistofele, Sir Michael Costa was still vigorous enough to conduct Boito's opera in his old resolute, vigilant manner; and very delighted he was over its success, which lent quite a special distinction to the season.</span></p>",,

She sang splendidly, and the whole orchestra and personnel applauded tremendously.' 'Thursday, May 4th, was the performance of Sonnambula. The Opera-house was packed full with people. The Queen, the Duchess of Gant [Kent], the Queen-dowager, and the Duke of Wellington were there. After the first act 'God save the Queen' was sung, and the Queen herself stood up and bowed to the public. Then the cheering began and they cried 'Hurrah!' and made an awful noise. Lind pleased very much.'</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1461779662782,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>In a recent letter, we spoke of the different choral societies in London. Public performances by some one of them are very frequent; so frequent indeed, that we can find time for only now and then one. The first for the season was by the ""Sacred Harmonic Society,"" under Mr. Costa, and consisted of a selection from ""Samson,"" by Handel, Mendelssohn's ""Christus,"" ""The Last Judgment,"" by Spohr. The death of the illustrious Duke gave a tinge to all the earlier concerts, and the ""Dead March"" in Saul was in constant requisition. On the present occasion, the selection from ""Samson"" consisted of the air, ""Ye Sons of Israel,"" ""Dead March,"" and chorus,&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Glorious hero, may thy grave&nbsp;<br />Peace and honor ever have.""&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ""Christus"" by Mendelssohn, seems to be very popular, both among the singers and hearers. The chorale, ""As bright the Star of Morning gleams,"" one of the best German chorales, and one that is very often heard in their churches, is brought in with fine effect after the chorus, ""There shall a Star of Jacob&nbsp;come forth."" Mendelssohn is always great in such choruses as ""He stirreth up the Jews,"" ""Crucify Him,"" and others in which he depends mostly upon orchestral effect, and in which he carries out his ideas of imitation or description with all the powers of modem instrumentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spohr's oratorio was well given, the Gresham Professor himself being judge; for we had the honor of a seat by his side, and of listening to his remarks during the perormance. Mr. Taylor was the first to bring out Spohr in England. ""Die letzten Dinge,"" or ""The Last Things,"" (which is a much better title for the oratorio than the one it now bears,) was composed about twenty-five years ago. It accidently came into the hands of Prof. Taylor, who translated the words, and first brought it out at the Norwich Festival in 1830. Since then it has been a standard oratorio, and is often performed. Prof. Taylor says: ""It at once seized the public attention, and commanded the admiration of the most distinguished professors of every school. Its influences upon the feelings of an audience has been attested by expressions more decided and unequivocal than I ever remember to have witnessed. I speak not of the admiration which the musician derives from such a display of the power and the resources of his art, but of the homage which nature, though musically untutored, involuntarily yet willingly pays to genius. The throbbing heart, the moistening eye, the quivering lip, here bespeak the triumph of the composer."" The solo parts&nbsp;were sustained by Mrs. Endersohn, Miss Williams, Mr. Lockey and Mr. Phillips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot enter into the detail of this performance; suffice it to say, that it afforded some of the best specimens of solo, quartet and chorus singing which we have ever heard. It was&nbsp;performed with admirable promptitude and exactness, as is everything else that is brought under the b&acirc;ton of Mr. Costa.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

On the first morning of my going to the theatre, at the <br />back of the stage, I perceived a number of horses, and on inquiry, found they <br />were to prance about in ""Blue Beard."" I was making my way to the green-room, <br />when, in the middle of the stage, I came in contact with John Kemble, and <br />pointing to the place where the horses stood, I thus accosted him, 

""Now are we in Ardeu!""

The peasantry and shepherds from Abruzzo, Calabria, and Apulia, upon this anniversary, come from the mountains in their sheepskin dresses, playing on their various instruments, some on the Zampogna, (a kind of bagpipe,) others on the Colascione. This instrument is the common one in the Neapolitan dominions, and is something like a guitar, having however only two strings, tuned fifths to each other. These shepherds visit all the churches, and play their famous <em>pastorale</em> there, and at all the principal noblemen's houses. During Christmas the processions are to be seen, in which they perform ; amongst their pageantry they have moveable stages, the machinery connected with which is admirable, representing the birth of our Saviour, the Virgin, &amp;c. all as large as life.

It was represented to her that he had retired with a fine fortune to his estate, in the interior of Calabria, and had declared his determination never to sing again. "" Then"" said the reasonable young lady, "" <em>I</em> declare my <em>determination</em> never to take the veil unless he does.

The fair lady was firm ; and her glorious obstinacy was such, that her father was obliged to take a journey into Calabria, when, with much entreaty, and many very weighty arguments, he prevailed on Cafarelli to return with him to Naples. He sang a <em>salve regina</em> at the ceremony ; and the Signora having gained her point, cheerfully submitted to be led, like a lamb to the sacrifice, to eternal seclusion from the gay and wicked world.</p>
<p>In justice, however, to her taste it must be said, that Cafarelli was one of the greatest soprano singers Italy ever produced. He was a Neapolitan, and the Neapolitans were very proud of him.

The concert was organised by the Marchioness of Lansdowne, whose husband was then the Secretary for War. Mr. Alfred de Rothschild took an active part in the arrangements, and asked Madame Patti to give her services, which she at once did. He consulted with me about everything, and, as we wanted a good operatic tenor, and there was none available, he suggested that I should go to Paris and see if I could obtain the help of M. Alvarez. I accordingly went to Paris the following morning, and in the evening went to the opera, where Faust was being performed, and was shown into the director's box, where I met M. Gailhard and M. Capoul, whom I had known from meeting them in London. M. Jean de Reszke, whom I knew well, was also in the box. During the interval I spoke about Alvarez, and M. Gailhard said he had no objection to his singing, and I had better telegraph him to New York, where he was then singing. I accordingly sent Alvarez a long wire asking him to appear in a scene from Romeo et Juliette with Madame Patti, and asked his terms. The same evening I received a wire from him in which he said he would be most happy to sing without any fee, as the English public had always been very kind to him. Next day I showed the wire to M. Gailhard, who, however, made some objection to Alvarez singing in London, as the Parisian public wanted him first when he returned from America. I wrote to Mr. Alfred de Rothschild telling him the difficulty, and when I saw him in London on my return he said he would send a confidential clerk to ""kidnap "" Alvarez and bring him over to London, which he succeeded in accomplishing ! I had engaged a very good orchestra, which I conducted. The scene from Romeo et Juliette with the ""Alouette"" duet, was the clou of the evening, and everything went off well. The con- cert was a huge success ; all the tickets were sold and the boxes fetched as much as a hundred guineas, and the stalls ten guineas. The sum- total was 11,000 : such a large amount has never been collected through any other single concert.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

<pre>On Wednesday, 1st December, 1813, an Ode was performed at Freemasons' Hall, <br />for the Installation of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent and Strathern, as <br />Grand Master of Masons in England, according to the old institution. The Ode <br />recited by brother Pope; the music composed by brother Kelly.

The same obstacle to success in Congregational singing was observable here, as at the Scotch Church in the morning &mdash; the tunes were too difficult, and the effect of the singing was wretched.

It is not indeed a new hall, but an old one repaired, painted, and ornamented; it is in the same house where Bach lived, and is the very room where Bach, Hiller and others labored and conducted musical performances. Hauptmann now occupies the same apartments which were formerly occupied by the great Fuguist. The exercises, with the exception of a short address by one of the pupils, were exclusively musical, as follows:</p>
<p>I. Prayer. ""Kommet Lasset uns anbeten"", Hauptmann</p>
<p>II. Motette. ""Der Geist hilft unserer Schwachheit, J.S. Bach</p>
<p>III. Four part-songs:-</p>
<p>1. ""O Thaeler weit, o Hoehen"", Mendelssohn</p>
<p>2. ""O sanfter, suesser Hauch"", Mendelssohn</p>
<p>(The above may be found in the ""Social Glee Book,"" and have been sung in the Boston Musical Conventions.)</p>
<p>3. ""Waldeinsamkeit"", Hauptmann</p>
<p>4. ""Ich stand auf, Berges Hoehen"", Hauptmann</p>
<p>IV. Motette. ""Jauchzet dem Herrn"", Schicht.</p>
<p>The singing was by the choir of the school and church, which consisted of about fifty voices; Soprano and Alto by boys. It was entirely without accompaniment. A grand Pianoforte in the room was only used to announce the pitch before each piece.</p>
<p>[... H]ere is a chorus who stand up and sing Bach&rsquo;s and other most difficult motets, the most difficult vocal music perhaps ever written, by voices alone, with as much certainty as the sure aim of an experienced marksman.</p>
<p>I think I have never before witnessed such devotion to the work as in these singers. Here is indeed entire self-committal. Every one throws all the powers he has, physical and spiritual, into the performance of the music. Every tone is attacked with a conscious certainty of success; no matter how complicated the rhythm, it is given with an energy and truthfulness that a first-rate violinist can hardly excel. The singers seem to have a perfect command of their vocal organs, and are no less certain of results than is the accomplished pianist when he strikes the keys, or the violinist when he draws the bow. There is an entire absence of that sleepiness, drowsiness, inattention, and foolish levity too often witnessed in our choirs. No looking about, or whispering, or laughing, or silliness; but close attention is ever manifested. I wish I had words to point out that consecration to the work, that deep, heartfelt interest which these choir members seem to possess; so that it might be sought for by our American singers. [...] I have never before heard a vocal chorus so prompt, so energetic, and perfect in time and tune, as on this occasion. The place, too, was holy ground, for all the great musicians have visited that saloon; Bach lived there as his home, and Handel, and Haydn, and Mozart, and Beethoven have been there. A new portrait of Bach (or rather an old one put in perfect order) has been placed at the head of the hall, and opposite to it is a fine bust of Schicht, who, though less known, was a very profound musician, as his works testify. On the whole, I have not attended a more interesting musical performance in Germany.</p>

This was in some respects the most striking function of the series. The gathering was in every sense a representative one, and the famous abbe, as he went round chatting from group to group, seemed positively radiant with happiness. To repeat his own words, addressed to myself: &ldquo;You have so overwhelmed me with kindness in this country that I shall be quite sorry when the time comes for me to leave you.&rdquo; The programme comprised his &ldquo;Angelus&rdquo; for strings, a chorus for female voices, a pianoforte piece, and some songs; and finally, amid a scene of great excitement, he himself played the finale of Schubert's &ldquo;Divertissement a la Hongroise&rdquo; and his own Hungarian rhapsody in A minor. This glorious treat furnished the crowning feature of a memorable evening&mdash; doubly memorable because it was the last time but one that Franz Liszt touched his instrument in the presence of a public or quasi-public assemblage.</span></p>",,

Brilliant without finish, and perhaps also without elegance, the celebrated prima donna nevertheless elicited in this her only part after the ""Linda,"" a great amount of applause, and may again be said to have achieved a success. Brilliancy and vivacity are 'telling"" qualities with a miscellaneous audience. But the opportunities afforded this clever singer were few. One star shone with too powerful a light in the operatic sphere to allow any other star, however radiant, to sparkle within its legitimate lustre. It was difficult, indeed almost impossible, both for Cruvelli and Tadolini to shed their really bright rays, whilst the great planet Jenny Lind was in the ascendant. Of the two ladies, Cruvelli had the better chance of winning fame in England, since she had commenced her career earlier in the year, before the arrival of the all-absorbing ""Jenny."" She accordingly maintained her footing; whilst the sister ""star,"" Tadolini, set below the horizon of the Italian stage at the end of the season, once and for ever.</span></p>",,

The organ was well played, yet not always with sufficient strength to support and guide the congregation.</p>
<p>[...]&nbsp;</p>
<p>The choir in Mr. James&rsquo; church did not seem to be much in advance of the people in the manner of their performance; they tried to help the organ to lead, but no choir piece, either tune or anthem, was attempted by them. There was no chanting, as there is in many of the London churches, and metrical psalmody was the only form of song. Extempore parts were sung near to me, and especially by a gentleman who knew enough of music to sing always a third below the treble; this knowledge he took care to bring into practical use, and so, of course, was often producing fifths as much at variance with music&rsquo;s laws as are nouns in the plural in connection with verbs in the singular number with the requirements of grammar. The first tune was St. Ann&rsquo;s, with the good old-fashioned cadence on the mediant at the end of the third line&mdash;grand and effective; the second was St. Paul&rsquo;s; the third we did not know, but while it was a pretty, &ldquo;all's well"" kind of tune, it was unfit for Congregational singing, and an affected, fainting away, or &ldquo;oh dear&rdquo; result was the consequence. As in other places in England, so here, the hymn is just named, the organist then gives out the tune on his instrument, playing it through, then follows the reading of the hymn, after which it is sung.</p>",,

Well-known musicians came from distant parts of the country to be present. It was to do honor to the illustrious violinist whom he had known long years that my own venerable master made the journey from the metropolis&mdash;to witness the bestowal upon him of a distinction similar to that which had already been conferred upon himself as the inventor of the laryngoscope. And never has the Public Orator of Cambridge University employed terms more felicitous or more eulogistic than he contrived to put into his Latin speech in this instance. Dr. Joachim's ""exercise"" consisted of his fine overture in memory of the celebrated poet Heinrich von Kleist, which was played under his own direction. He also gave a superb performance of the Beethoven violin concerto, of which work he is, by common consent, admitted to be the greatest of all interpreters.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cambridge

The first was Giornovick, who was on his way from Russia to Paris, and had been many years first concerto player at the court of Petersburg. He was a man of a certain age, but in the full vigour of talent ; his tone was very powerful, his execution most rapid, and his taste above all alluring. No performer, in ray remembrance, played such pleasing music. He generally closed his concertos with a rondo, the subject of which was some popular Russian air, to which he composed variations with enchanting taste; his performance reminded me strongly of the celebrated La Motte, whom I had often heard at the Rotunda in Dublin. Janewitz, the other, was a very young man, in the service of the King of Poland ; he also touched the instrument with thrilling effect, and was an excellent leader of an orchestra. His concertos always finished with some pretty Polonaise air ; his variations also were truly beautiful. But the Apollo, the Orpheus of the age, was the redoubted and renowned Baron Bach, who came to Vienna to be heard by the Emperor. He (in his own conceit) surpassed Tartini, Nardini, &amp;c. &amp;c. This fanatico per la musica had just arrived from Petersburg, where he went to make his extraordinary talents known to the Royal Family and Court. Now, I have often heard this man play, and I positively declare, that his performance was as bad as any blind fiddler's at a wake in a country town in Ireland ; but he was a man of immense fortune, and kept open house.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna

Grisi, Mario, Fornasari, and Lablache afforded an admirable quatuor for the performance of this genial opera buffa, the success of which was perhaps even greater than that of ""Linda."" I might now indeed deem myself fortunate, for bringing out in one season two new operas, each of which won such golden opinions. Warned by this second success, the press now grew lavish in their praise of Donizetti. He was declared to have composed his Parisian opera in his ""happiest vein."" It was studded with ""musical beauties,"" and contained ""more marks of originality that most of his works,"" &amp;c., &amp;c. In fact, the tide not only changed, but now flowed strongly in favour of the once despised composer. The racy comic humour of Lablache, and the spirit of Grisi, combined with the pleasant and careful execution of Mario and Fornasari, may have contributed sensibly to a success, nowise certainly promoted by the unusually meagre, flimsy libretto. But, in a musical point of view, the verdict was certainly favourable, and none could better recognise the fact than the fortunate manager.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Sontag is gone, and the Gewandhaus Orchestra is thrown upon its own strength and resources; but it fails not, neither is it faint or weary. The Eighteenth Concert was (save the charming singer) one of the very best of the season. The Orchestra (said one who has often heard) never played better; well might they feel the inspiration of their author, for they played Beethoven's 4th Symphonic, than which he has not written a better. It is not so well known in America, but it cannot rank second to anything which Beethoven has composed.</p>
<p>The adagio (sextuple movement) is as perfect in design and as beautiful in coloring as in any work of musical art. Fraulein Anna Klassig sang a Recitative and Arie from Sphor's Jessonda. Herr G. Kruger, from Stuttgart, played two pieces well on the Harp; and a well-trained choir, Pauliner S&auml;nger-Vereins, of fifty men&rsquo;s voices sung three pieces, two of which were by Mendelssohn, and one of which may be found in the &ldquo;Fireside Harmony&rdquo; (Waserfahrt.) Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Overture ""Melusine,"" as fine an Overture as exists, was played; and the performance was worthy of the composition.</p>
<p>These Concerts are very popular and fashionable. The Musical Professors are all there, expectation is fully awake, and I believe almost always fully gratified.</p>
<p>Mad. Sontag has left Leipzig for Dresden, where she will undoubtedly create as great a sensation as she has here. I hope to notice her more particularly hereafter.</p>",,

Here was again a success- nay, a great and noisy success &mdash; but yet a doubtful one. After the comparative unanimity with which ""Nabucco"" had been received, it seemed necessary for the forces of the opposition to recommence the attack against a school which now threatened to make its way with the town. Party spirit on the subject was again rife. Whilst, by the Anti-Verdians, ""I Lombardi"" was declared to be flimsy, trashy, worthless ; the Verdi party, and the adherents of the modern Italian school, pronounced it to be full of power, vigour, and originality. The one portion asserted that it was utterly devoid of melody &mdash; the other, that it was replete with melody of the most charming kind; the one again insisted that it was the worst work of the aspirant &mdash; the other, that it was the young composer's chef-d'oeuvre. And in the midst of this conflict &mdash; so analogous to the old feud between the partizans of Gluck and Piccini &mdash; public opinion, as usual, seemed undecided and wavering, uttering its old formula of ""Well! I don't know!"" The music, too, was weighed down by a rambling, ill-constructed, uninteresting libretto ; and it is really difficult, under such conditions, to sunder the merit of the musical ""setting"" from the demerit of the text. ""I Lombardi,"" however, was played frequently, and even to crowded houses.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1447521350548,https://archive.org/details/diaryofwilliampl01jaco,"<p>After some deliberation I resolved to see what has been called a living miracle, the greatest wonder of the world. This miracle is a little blind, grinning negro of eleven or twelve years of age, an idiot in reality and appearance and yet who has the most remarkable power over the piano. Tom, for that is his name, heard his young mistress playing on that instrument and having crept into the house through a window, startled the whole house by discoursing sweet music. Tom is a perfect idiot but his faculties of music and imitation have been wonderfully cultivated. It would be wonderful for a blind man to play as well as he does but for a blind idiotic negro to do so well is marvellous indeed. Music is his existence. He is happy only in music. He lives and breathes music. Even while speaking his fingers are running over imaginary keys and he plays over his sentences. He puts his whole soul into the piano and thunders out his musical sentences with eagerness and expression. He played such pieces as the Carnival of Venice, Norma, the Anvil Chorus and other simpler pieces such as the Georgia Breakdown. A very remarkable feature in his ability to use the piano was also shown us. He turned his back to the piano and played Yankee Doodle. He then sat down and played ""The girl I left Behind Me,"" with one hand, some other piece with the other hand and sang Dixie all at the same time. Then, leaving the piano his exhibitor would touch various keys but Tom would instantly tell which were white and which black. Tom also favoured us with several speeches and songs to display his power of imitation. But the grandest piece of the evening was the last, a piece of Tom's own arrangement, entitled the Battle of Manassas. It thrilled me through and through. I listened with intense interest to the Southerners with fife and drum playing ""The girl I left behind me"" far off in the distance gradually growing louder as it approached;- the march of the grand Union Army from Washington, playing Dixie, the preparation for battle. Suddenly a cannon's roar startled us. Cannon after cannon rose high above the southern band playing the Marsellaise hymn and intermingled with Dixie. Cannon after cannon mingled with with peal after peal of musketry; the sharp crack of rifles. Suddenly above the roar of artillery rose the shrill whistle of the steam car, imitating the puffing and blowing of the engine, bringing in Kirby Smith's division. Then rout and confusion seized the northern hordes. Horse trampled on man and man on fellowmen. The scene was thrilling and the heart could not but swell with emotion. Tom made the instrument speak. Could I help being delighted and entertained? And yet at time the saddening thought of the poor fellow's idiocy would cross my mind. Perhaps not many days hence, his eyes may be opened and his mind unbarred and he may tune his harp around the everlasting throne of God. If envy could find a place in heaven, we might then, envy poor Tom his lot. Music is his God or rather his God is music. Then will he know and reverence the God of music. Tom is to me, indeed a puzzle. The phrenologists say that their art fails them in explaining Tom for they cannot find in him any music bumps.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charleston,_South_Carolina"

He was very much interested in all that I read. I always selected the numbers of the hymns for him, found his text and the Bible chapter which he had Mr. Branch to read. On the way to church he told me he wanted the Pastor's Aid Society of Thornwell Memorial Church to put up a slab of some kind on the front of the church, having the name of the church, pastor, time of Sunday service, and prayer meeting, and ""All are welcome."" A duet by William and Edna which was very pretty. Text I Corinthians, third chapter, sixteenth verse. ""Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you.""

Neither, however, achieved any notable success, or made any very durable impression. M. Barroilhet was the favourite and admired baritone of the Academie of Paris. On the boards of the Parisian grand opera his reputation was immense. As the king in ""La Favorita,"" and the mad monarch in Halevy's opera of ""Charles VI&rdquo;, he had been proclaimed without an equal. </span></p>

Moreover, the role of ""Nottingham"" (though originally composed for him) was less favourable to his style than the parts in which he obtained repute in Paris. He appeared in two operas only, and then returned to France to recruit his failing health. </span></p>

She obtained, it is true, a share of approbation; but it was only moderate.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Mrs. C. was struck with the subject, and wrote down the programme of the drama, with a view to get it dramatized for Drury Lane ; Johnstone got the music copied to bring to Mr. Harris, at Covent Garden, and it was got up at that theatre as a pantomime, I believe by Delpini ; I never was it in that shape, but have heard that it was not successful.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

She was no longer in her first youth, and, coming directly after Jenny Lind, her success at first was not great; but afterwards she appeared as Rosina in <em>Il Barbiere</em> and carried everything by storm. In the duet ""Dunque io son"" with Signor Belletti, and in ""Una voce"" her vocalisation was perfect, and, to crown all, in the Lesson Scene she interpolated Rode's ""Variations"" (which were popular about that time) and created a great furore. The last variation is very difficult, consisting of arpeggios and chromatic scales, running up and down, which she executed with perfect ease, her face not betraying in the least that she was singing the most difficult phrases; on the contrary, she warbled everything <em>con amore</em>.

My &ldquo;Lezghinka,&rdquo; which, as you know, was written for two orchestras and arranged for one, really an enormous one, lost much of its effect and I am not sure whether it was the arrangement or the execution that made it rather unsuccessful. The result did not come up to my nor Berlioz&rsquo;s expectation. He likes this piece very much and chose it himself. In the fourth concert Soloieva did not sing so well and in the one I gave at the Salle Hertz she lost her head completely in the middle of the duet from the I Puritani and was unable to appear in the rest of the pieces. Marras saved the situation by singing the cavatina from Elisir d&rsquo;Amore, which was not on the program. He does this beautifully.

After dinner, the weather being warm the party strolled in the garden attached to the Embassy &mdash; Catalani and Jenny Lind talking much together. In the evening, some little embarrassment arose about asking Jenny Lind to sing, because, as no one ever refuses a request made by the representative of majesty, the Marchioness considerately forbore to place the young Swede in a position of difficulty. But Catalani, who was burning vsdth curiosity to hear Jenny Lind sing, perceived that there was some hesitation, went up to the ""Nightingale,"" and asked her with grace and earnestness to oblige the company with a song, adding, ""C'est la vieille Catalani qui desire vous entendre chanter, avant de mourir !"" </span></p>

Jenny Lind's beautiful voice was consequently heard under sensible disadvantage; moreover, she had to sing in a sitting posture instead of standing up. Nevertheless, the many obvious merits of her style, taste, and execution enchanted the Italian ear of Catalani, who sat on the ottoman in the centre of the room, enjoying the rare treat, rocking her body to and fro with delight and sympathy, and murmuring (loud enough to be overheard by Mrs. G, who sat by her side), ""Ah! la bella cosa che la musica, quando si fa di quella maniera !"" &mdash; and again, ""Ah ! la carissima ! quanto bellissima !"" Of course expression of cordial thanks and admiration on the part of all present followed the performance; and before separating for the night, Jenny was good enough to sing one or two more ""arias"" (among which ""Ah! non Giunge"" was included), to the renewed gratification of the interesting ""ex-prima donna.""</span></p>",,

Sontag, by marriage the Countess Rossi. The weather was unfavorable, being rainy, and the streets were muddy. I took my place at the door of the Gewandhaus at half-past four, where the people were then gathering. By five, when the outer door was opened, a multitude had assembled, and immediately rushed into the house, filling the long stairway and entry. Here was another interval of waiting, until half-past five, when the door of the hall was opened, and the room was immediately filled. We had now to wait another hour, or until half-past six; when the performance commenced with a Symphonie, by Joseph Hadyn in C, very light, playful, and pleasing, but lacking the depth of a Beethoven or a Mendelssohn. It is so easy a composition, that it seemed to be quite children&rsquo;s play for the orchestra, who yet rendered it in the most perfect manner possible. This was followed by an Arie from &ldquo;Rinaldo&rdquo; by Handel; a most charming song indeed, and as charmingly sung by Mad. Sontag. Of Mad. Sontag&rsquo;s singing, I dare not speak now. I will only say that no one can have a more perfect execution; but to say in what her excellence consists, as a singer, or what are the peculiarities of her style, must not now be attempted.</p>
<p>The third piece was &ldquo;Romanze for the Violin,&rdquo; by Beethoven; performed by Herr Concertmeister, Ferdinand David. This is the David whose compositions for the violin are so well known, and whose reputation as a player is so extensive. Mad. Sontag then sang ""Bel raggio lusinghier,"" from Rossini&rsquo;s Semiramide, a song requiring the greatest powers of vocalization; this was perfectly given by the inimitable artist.</p>
<p>The second part consisted of the Overture and a long scene from Gluck&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Iphigenie in Tauride;"" the principal vocal part being that of Iphigenie by Mad. Sontag. Gluck has not been heard with us, but he ranks in the very first class of composers here. The overture is a magnificent concert piece, and it was performed by this fine orchestra with wonderful precision and effect. Beethoven&rsquo;s Overture to Egmont closed the musical entertainments of the evening, and well repaid one for his Two Thalers, (cost of a ticket,) and for all the previous waiting, wetting, and crowding necessary to secure a place to stand up.</p>",,

They sang in tolerably good time and tune, but in no better taste than we have heard some of the children's choruses in America. There was a kind of nasal, or feline quality of tone, which was anything but pleasant. [...] The singing, by children, of music unfit for them, or unadapted to their capacities, is a very common fault; on the present occasion a glee by Callcott was attempted, to sacred words, which had better been omitted; and at the close of the services, after the benediction, the poor children, not knowing what they were about, but led on by those who ought to have known better, made a bold attack on Handel&rsquo;s Hallelujah. It hardly need be added that the performance came as near to the ridiculous as need be; there was nothing good about it except the intentions of the children; they were innocent through ignorance; but not so with the teachers, for ignorance cannot, in a teacher, excuse such error in judgment and carelessness in execution.&nbsp;</p>",,

The novel charm bestowed on it by such a ""cast,"" and by an admirable performance throughout of the music, established ""La Figlia"" at once in favour.

When she quitted her home, <br />Drury Lane, her departure was regretted by all. </pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

When the opera was produced, I sang all the original music, and introduced an Italian air of Sarti's, with English words, written for me by Mr. Richard Tickell, brother-in-law to Mr. Sheridan ; and a duet, written by the well-known Doctor Lawrence, the civilian. I composed the melody, and Stephen Storace put the instrumental parts to it. This duet was his first introduction to Drury Lane theatre. That eminent actor, King, who had been a friend of my father's in Dublin many years before, took a great deal of pains to instruct me in the dialogue of the part. To Mr. Linley I was also much indebted for his able tuition, and from all the performers I experienced the most kind and friendly attentions.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

C. Mackenzie's cantata ""The Story of Sayid,"" and Villiers Stanford's fine choral ballad ""The Revenge,"" not to speak of a phenomenal performance by the Yorkshire chorus of Bach's great Mass in B minor, never before attempted at a provincial festival. The most tremendous ovation of all, though, was that which greeted the composer of ""The Golden Legend"" when he laid down his baton at the close of the noble choral epilogue. Such ringing British cheers had not been heard in that magnificent hall since Queen Victoria opened it in the ""fifties.""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds

A new opera and a new soprano singer were both forthcoming on the occasion. The opera, given for the first time in this country, the ""Due Foscari,"" of Verdi, and the singer, Madame Montenegro, a Spanish lady of good family, with a clear soprano voice of some compass, and an attractive person, pleased, without exciting any marked sensation. Coletti, in the character of the Doge, one of his most famous parts, was, by general accord, pronounced to be an admirable, not to say a great artist; whilst Fraschini, by his energy and power, contributed to the effect of the ensemble. The first appearance of Lucille Grahn, on the same occasion, added to the eclat of a brilliant reopening.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Here the organ-playing is frivolous, light and trifling, we had almost said, as is Jullien's Quadrille Orchestra in Drury Lane. It is amazing that any one who has musical knowledge should so pervert the powers of his instrument. But yet the&nbsp;organist has fine powers of execution; he plays with a rapidity of finger, with a clean piano-forte touch, producing the staccato with as much distinctness as stringed instruments, and at times&nbsp;almost the pizzicato. So it was on the occasion when we last heard him, when the song, ""Why do the nations,"" from the Messiah, with the chorus, ""Let us break their bands,"" were sung to an organ accompaniment as brilliant almost as that of a grand orchestra.&nbsp;</p>

I was charmed to be under the same roof with her, and it was, besides, very convenient for me to practise the duets and concerted pieces. The day after she arrived we began our rehearsals ; the first opera was "" II Fittore Parigino ;"" the music, by Cimarosa, was beautiful ; the Painter was the character allotted to me ; the opera pleased very much. The town of Brescia was all alive, being fair-time, and the theatre was crowded ; it was a very splendid building ; the boxes, of which there were five tiers, were ornamented with glasses, like those of San Carlo, at Naples, and the seats in the pit turned up in the same way as in Padua. Independently of a very good company of singers, there was an excellent, and very expensive corps de ballet.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brescia

The ""Tempesta"" was still to be found ""upon the bills,"" and on the night of the 18th of July, Madame Rossi Sontag appeared for the first time in the ""Figlia del Reggimento."" Perhaps during her whole career at Her Majesty's Theatre, since her return to the stage, Madame Sontag had never undertaken a more hazardous part. The ""Figlia"" was so identified in the public mind with Jenny Lind, that it was impossible for Madame Sontag to escape comparisons on the part of a public which always will insist, against all the rules of true judgment, in making them. The Anglo-Italian stage had known no ""Figlia"" but its own cherished and petted daughter of adoption. The town still swarmed with coloured engravings and statuettes of its beloved ""Child of the Regiment."" But from this ordeal Madame Sontag came forthwith credit. Her exquisite grace and the perfection of her singing nobody questioned. But it was as the consummate actress, full of imaginative detail, and inventive bye-play, that she shone forth conspicuously. The public found that instead of one ""daughter,"" it now had two, and in spite of strong impressions of ""first love,"" could hardly decide which of the two it now loved the best.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Nevertheless, he possessed vocal and histrionic attributes of a very distinguished kind, and chance so willed it that he was destined to ""bridge over&rdquo; to a large extent the interval that separated the final retirement of Mario from the advent (as a tenor) of Jean de Reszke. By birth a Spaniard, and hailing from Pampeluna (the town in which Sarasate was born), Giuliano Gayarre had studied and won his early successes in Italy. He was an exponent of the new quasi-nasal Thirty Years of school of tenor singers, which already had Tamagno for one of its leading protagonists. To my ears his production, on the night he made his debut at Covent Garden (April 7, 1877), sounded strange and not wholly pleasant. Still, the voice traveled well, and he sang the music of Gennaro with so much tenderness, so much charm, allied to genuine dramatic feeling and expression, that the crowded house forthwith accorded him a splendid reception. I declined to join in the general chorus of &ldquo;Another Mario!&rdquo; It struck me as little less than sacrilege to compare with the divine voice of that tenor an organ which could occasionally descend, or ascend, to the utterance of tones that quickly earned the name of the &ldquo;Gayarre bleat.""&nbsp; </span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""><br /></span></span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

My travelling companion was the late Mr. Eugene Ascherberg, the music-seller, who purchased the rights of Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana, and Leoncavallo's I Pagliacci; he also wanted to hear the new opera, to see if it was worth his while to publish it in England. Thanks to him, I made the acquaintance of Signor Sonzogno, Mascagni's publisher, through whom I was in- troduced to Mascagni, who conducted the per- formance at the Pergola Theatre, which is very large and has six to eight rows of boxes, but no gallery. Signor Ferraris, the ordinary conductor had a splendid orchestra and fine chorus. Madame Darclee, a Roumanian soprano, took the part of Luisa. De Lucia, whom I remembered hearing at Covent Garden, was the tenor. The most prominent artist in the cast was the great baritone Signor Battistini, whom I visited during the interval in his dressing-room and asked him why he never came to England. He replied that he would like very much to come, only had not yet had any offers of an engagement. But I think Sir Augustus Harris had wished to engage him, only that his terms were so high. The fact was that Battistini was a great favourite in Russia, and got high fees there. In Russia a baritone was a draw, in England not at all even the former great baritones, Ronconi and Graziani, never drew crowded houses.</p>",,

This ""Grand Symphonic Pastoral Ode"" (as it was denominated) met with a larger amount of ""fair play"" than the opera of Verdi, was very generally treated as an ""extraordinary production"" (not always in the best sense of the term), and was both applauded and to a great extent appreciated. As an ""extra"" entertainment, indeed, it was repeated several times. Felicien David's odd composition, though rather more than a nine days' wonder, was but the wonder of a season. None of his subsequent works have attained an equal degree of celebrity ; and it is recorded of a celebrated composer, who in society is scarcely less celebrated as a wit, that when asked his opinion respecting one of David's late productions, he drily remarked, ""II est descendu de son chameau."" An explanation often spoils as much as it elucidates a joke, but for the benefit of my younger readers I must take the liberty of stating that the subject of ""Le Desert"" is the journey through the desert of a caravan, in which of course the camel plays an important part.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Then I gave a solo, my last Sonata in D [K. 284], written for Baron Durnitz, and after that my Concerto in B flat [K. 238]. I then played another solo, quite in the style of the organ, a Fugue in C minor, and then all of a sudden a magnificent Sonata in C major, out of my head, and a rondo to finish up with. There was a regular din of applause. Herr Stein was so amazed that he could only make faces and grimaces. As for Herr Demmler, he couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing.

She was to appear as the chief ""star"" of the pre-Easter period, and considerable excitement was awakened in musical circles by the announcement that Pasta's favourite pupil would sustain the character of Medea, one of the parts of that great singer that were most strongly stamped upon the memory of a former generation of opera-goers. So, with the ""Medea"" of Mayer, and Mademoiselle Parodi as the enchantress, the theatre once more opened its doors. That I had been judicious in producing this opera, as a lure to curiosity, was attested by the result. But it never could have been expected to occupy a permanent position on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre. The music of Mayer was of the ante-Rossinian school, and was consequently entitled to the respect of the old opera- goers, who in their early days had looked upon Rossini as a mere tune-maker. But it was not one of the best specimens of the early period of the present century, and it had owed its reputation to the correctness of its cold classicality, and, on the Anglo-Italian stage, to the powerful acting of Pasta. To modern ears it seemed tedious and almost commonplace &mdash; at all events, deficient in the dramatic warmth of later composers. The ""mantle"" of Pasta however, even to the literal acceptation of the word, had descended to her pupil; Parodi's performance created a lively interest, stamped, as it was, with the traditions of the great vocal Siddons of the Italian stage. It was powerful, impressive, and, of its kind, brilliant. The ""cast"" included Beletti and Calzolari &mdash; both sure, steady, and satisfactory singers of another school; Madame Giuliani; and, lastly, a new tenor, Micheli, who made his first appearance as Giasone, but failed utterly to obtain a favourable verdict from the critical audience of ""Her Majesty's.""</span></p>",,

They were written expressly for her, at a period when the heyday of her youth was gone by, she having long been an acknowledged favourite both with the manager and King Ferdinand. ""When ""Elisabetta"" was produced in 1815 by the young maestro, Madame Colbrand retained all the beauty of her voice, which, added to her physical advantages and a commanding figure, fine features, and dignified bearing, called forth a shout of applause as she appeared on the stage of San Carlo, in the character of the English queen. The duet with Leicester secured the success of this the first opera that Rossini had produced at Naples, and others which followed in quick succession were received with the enthusiastic admiration they so fully merited.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teatro_di_San_Carlo

A new opera and a new soprano singer were both forthcoming on the occasion. The opera, given for the first time in this country, the ""Due Foscari,"" of Verdi, and the singer, Madame Montenegro, a Spanish lady of good family, with a clear soprano voice of some compass, and an attractive person, pleased, without exciting any marked sensation. Coletti, in the character of the Doge, one of his most famous parts, was, by general accord, pronounced to be an admirable, not to say a great artist; whilst Fraschini, by his energy and power, contributed to the effect of the ensemble. The first appearance of Lucille Grahn, on the same occasion, added to the eclat of a brilliant reopening.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

I refer to Jenny Lind. The close association which existed between that gifted and noble woman and the city of Norwich is a matter of common knowledge. A bishop of Norwich (Dr. Stanley) it was who persuaded the first of the &ldquo;Swedish Nightingales"" to abandon, on religious grounds, the operatic stage; which premature and much-regretted event occurred in 1849. But the famous singer frequently visited Norwich, and more than once she appeared at concerts given on behalf of the funds of the Jenny Lind Infirmary for Children, an institution founded by her and still flourishing in the old city. At one of these concerts, some time during the middle &ldquo;sixties,"" I heard Jenny Lind sing. The voice, I remember perfectly, was as exquisitely clear and fresh as a young girl's; its sweet tones haunted me long afterward. Of the wondrous art of the great singer I was too young to judge ; but I shall, never forget what she sang, or the rare wealth of religious sentiment with which she invested the prayer of Agathe in the favorite scena from &ldquo;Der Freischutz&rdquo;. Upon the stage, of course, the heroine of Weber's opera always kneels while uttering her touching appeal for her lover's safe return, and Jenny Lind also knelt while singing the same passage upon the platform of St. Andrew's Hall on the occasion I am alluding to.</span></p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448921066520,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>At half past 3 o&rsquo;clock we attended the church of St. Martin&rsquo;s (Episcopal). The congregation was small, and was (as we supposed from the application of almost every one who came in to the Beadleship for a seat) composed mostly of strangers. The service was dull and monotonous, no one appearing to manifest any other interest than a desire to get through. The chanting, however, was an exception, and was of a character somewhat new. It was almost exclusively instrumental, being performed on the organ. Of course, we could find no fault with the articulation of words, or the rapidity of utterance, since the pipes appeared to do their best. But voices could not be heard in this part of the service with the exception of &ldquo;Gloria Patri,&rdquo; in which there was a feeble attempt at vocal effect. It may be well for congregations who do not wish to be at the trouble of opening their mouths and speaking forth God&rsquo;s praises in the &ldquo;Venite,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jubilate Deo,&rdquo; and other canticles, to confide the matter wholly to a faithful instrument; for, under a master&rsquo;s hand, it is always sure.</p>",,
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1447580357730,https://archive.org/details/diaryofwilliampl01jaco,"<p>The fireworks were magnificent, a gem of beauty and beyond anything I had ever seen. we had a delightful return trip. There was music, singing and moonlight. The bay reflected the lights of the city, the electric lights above Brooklyn Bridge; the lofty lights on the statue of liberty, and the whole horizon, a mass of innumerable stars, was a scene to be remembered.</p>",,

Beside the three artists, there were present Mme. Nordica&rsquo;s sister (Mrs. Walker) and Mr. Amherst Webber, the talented English maestro at piano who had recently acted as accompanist to the brothers in their Wagnerian studies. After supper the conversation turned upon Bayreuth, and allusion was made to a certain half-promise given by Jean de Reszke to Frau Cosima, that he would one day sing Tristan and Walther, or perhaps even Siegfried, at the festival. I remarked that, after what I had heard that night, I entertained no doubts concerning the adequate quality of his accent. This only elicited a further request that I would stay in New York until I had heard how it sounded in &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo;. Then the distinguished tenor turned to Mme. Nordica and proposed that, as I was evidently not to be made to alter my determination, the best thing they could do would be to &ldquo;bring the mountain to Mohammed"" and sing some &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; to me there and then; and that between one and two in the morning, and after a heavy opera like &ldquo;Lohengrin""! Surely it was not possible. But surprise and incredulity quickly changed to delight. For, without an instant's hesitation, Mme. Nordica consented ; Mr. Webber went to the piano and played a few introductory bars; and, almost before I could realize what was being done, the two gifted artists were warbling the wondrous love scene from Wagner's immortal music-drama.</span></p>

They sang with full voice; they went through not only the scene with which they had started, but the duet of the first act as well; and, from beginning to end, the exquisite beauty of their phrasing, the blending of their voices in perfect intonation and unity of color, the significance of their supreme dramatic interpretation, constituted at once a marvel and a revelation. It was a strange experience, sitting at the supper-table (for none of us but Mr. Webber had moved from our seats) while for an hour or more those two famous singers reveled in the enjoyment of their self-imposed task&mdash; undertaken for the sole purpose of conferring pleasure upon an old friend. The picture of that night remains vividly imprinted upon my mind, even as its vocal spell lives fresh and fragrant among my most treasured memories. </span></p>",,

How can we ever forget her delivery of the beautiful aria "" Mon Coeur s'ouvre a ta voix,"" or "" Printemps qui commence "" ? She is also great as Amneris in A'ida, and as a concert singer she is simply perfection. I have heard her sing at most of her recitals and her voice reminds me very much of Alboni's.

Many German musicians at that time affected rather to look down on the Italian maestro with a sort of condescending superiority, wondering how in the world Ferdinand Hiller, the conductor-in-chief of the Festival and an excellent musician, could have chosen for performance at one of their classical institutions a work by the author of <em>Il Trovatore</em>, <em>Rigoletto</em>, <em>Traviata</em>, and other operas of street-organ popularity. Hiller, however, knew what he was doing. Already at the first rehearsal Verdi's fine musicianship and powerful personality made a great impression upon chorus, orchestra, and soloists, of which latter I had the honour of being one. From hour to hour we felt more and more strongly the fascinating influence of a master - mind, and both the beautiful, deeply felt work and its genial creator at the end of the excellent performance&mdash;Lilli Lehmann was the soprano&mdash;met with a most enthusiastic reception.</span></p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Henschel,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cologne

Mr. Sheridan had seen her the previous season at Stafford, where she was acting ; she was much patronised at that place by the leading families, particularly by Mr. Horton, an intimate electioneering friend of Mr. Sheridan's. She was engaged at Drury Lane, and proved herself a valuable acquisition to our dramatic corps. She was a handsome girl, and much esteemed ; and in gratitude, I feel called upon to say, that, both as Miss Mellon and Mrs. Coutts, I have received from her the most marked and friendly attentions ; and am happy to have it in my power, thus publicly, to express my acknowledgments.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

A committee of ladies met daily at my rooms in the Theatre, and co-operated with me in the arrangements for this beneficent performance. The proceeds, amounting to about &pound;2000, were handed over to Lord John Russell, then Home Secretary, for distribution in Ireland; and the ladies forming the committee sent me a letter expressing their thanks for my kindness, and for the assistance afforded to them in the conduct of the affair; signed by Lady Palmerston, Lady Clarendon, Lady Clanricarde, and Lady Ailesbury. On the evening of the benefit ""All London"" was present, from the Queen and Royal Family to the humblest inhabitant of the world of fashion who could find a corner in the vast assemblage. ""Nino"" (""Nabucco"") followed, in order to introduce Coletti, who appeared in the part of the maddened king (previously so effectively sustained by Fornasari), and was welcomed with enthusiasm.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Between the years 1797 and 1821, I produced, at different theatres, sixty-two pieces, by far the greatest number produced by any one English composer, Bishop excepted.

The fine music of this work deserved more enduring success. The cast comprised Mme. Albani, Miss Meisslinger, Philip Brozel, David Bispham, and Richard Green ; but, unluckily, there was a lack of distinction (and distinctness) about the general rendering that was scarcely calculated to engender in aristocratic auditors any particular love of opera in the vernacular.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1431697022699,https://archive.org/stream/recentmusicmusic00mosc,"<p>Yes, Mendelssohn's triumph at yesterday's performance was something quite unparalleled and unheard of. I think eleven numbers had to be repeated, and that too amid a storm of applause and clapping of hands, demonstrations usually forbidden; but on this occasion all attempt at restraint was hopeless, the noisy scene reminded me of the pit in a theatre. Staudigl was a magnificent Elijah, Philip, the bass singer, admirable, and Mendelssohn was particularly pleased with the singing of the two Misses Williams.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Birmingham
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448397101672,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>But I am forgetting the psalmody. There is neither organ nor choir in Mr. Noel&rsquo;s chapel. The singing is entirely Congregational, and is led by a precentor, who occupies a secondary pulpit in front of that of the minister, and who, in addition to his singing duties, reads the notices. He gives out the hymn, proclaiming its number, and also at the same time gives the name of the tune; then he reads a stanza which is immediately sung by all the people, and in like manner the succeeding stanzas are read and sung. It is not easy to see why the stanza is read before it is sung, since all the people have hymn-books, and many of them also tune books. The singing of the psalms was as good as may be expected where choir tunes are used for congregational purpose. The tunes here were altogether too difficult for the people&rsquo;s use; difficult in rhythmics and difficult in melodics. The attempt too, to sing in parts, was not in all cases productive of the greatest good; for example: We stood by the side of a young man who was furnished with a tune book containing only the bass part. In the first tune we sung out the bass with as much voice as we could conveniently command, but with the second tune we were unacquainted, and could not therefore join in the exercise. This was observed by the young man, who drew near and held out his bass part, thus enabling us to sing. But he, while he was looking carefully first at his hymn book and then to his tune book, so as to be sure and be right, was, with his bass part before him, singing all the way the treble part, two octaves below the pitch! How a little knowledge may expose one&rsquo;s ignorance!</p>
<p>The general effect of the singing was, notwithstanding these drawbacks, very good, vastly better than some of the attempts at musical display which we have witnessed in churches in England and on the Continent; and if it was not musically attractive, it was religiously edifying, and served to revive the affections and lift them upwards.</p>
<p>The standing position was observed in singing, and the sitting position in prayer. The people generally had Bibles, and often referred to the texts which the preacher quoted.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448396118064,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>We have recently attended a rehearsal of the London Sacred Harmonic Society, under the direction of Mr. J. Surman. There are two societies meeting in Exeter Hall; the Sacred Harmonic Society, under the direction of Mr. Costa, and the one before mentioned. There were about one hundred and fifty members of the choir present at the meeting of the London Sacred Harmonic Society, with an accompaniment of about twenty stringed instruments. A new Anthem, by Dr. Elvey, of Windsor, was sung, and also Mozart&rsquo;s Twelfth Mass. The performance was decidedly poor &mdash; vastly inferior to the German choruses which we have recently described. The time was tolerably well kept, but tune was far enough from accuracy. The same feeling about for the pitch, and uncertainty of tone, was observable in the more difficult modulations, which is so common with our untrained New England choirs; with this difference, however, that we occasionally stop to correct a badly-intoned passage, whereas here it was passed over as if unobserved, or as if such a dissonant performance had become a matter of habit. There was, too, an absence of all those things that go to make up a good choral performance, as Forte and Piano, Sforzando, Syncopated accent, distinctness and clearness of vocal utterance, &amp;c. The leader would occasionally sing out at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Piano,&rdquo; but he did not seem to expect that attention would be given to what he said, and kept on, under a press of sail, until another opportunity should occur for calling out with like result.</p>
<p>This was, indeed, a rehearsal; but if a choir is permitted to sing thus in rehearsal, will they not form habits that will prevent improvement, and will not the public performances be of the same general character?</p>
<p>The violins were badly played. One could hardly help coming to the conclusion that they were mostly beginners, assembled for practice. It would not be surprising to hear as bad, or even a worse, rehearsal, on the Western Continent; but, in Europe there should be, at least, a correct performance of the technicals of music, if not something belonging to the higher department of appropriate expression.</p>",,

That event properly belongs to 1880, when he appeared for the first time at Covent Garden as Indra in ""Le Roi de Lahore."" He was then about twenty-six, and his noble bass voice had already developed in full splendor the richness of timbre and amplitude of volume for which it is remarkable. He lacked ex- perience, of course ; the art of later years was yet to come. Still, the sonority and grandeur of his tones were an unalloyed delight, notably in such parts as Basilio, St. Bris, Count Rodolfo, and Walter (""William Tell""), and he instantly won hearty favor. He returned regularly for the four succeeding seasons.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

His songs and chamber pieces were tolerably well known, but of his orchestral works only three had so far been heard in London&mdash;namely, the symphony in F (April 12) and the symphonic poems, &ldquo;Till Eulenspiegel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Also sprach Zarathustra&rdquo;. He now brought with him the &ldquo;Tod und Verklarung&rdquo;, wherein is depicted the death struggle of a man before whose mental vision there passes the panorama of a wasted life, followed by the man's transfiguration, as his redeemed soul passes out of earthly existence into a higher state. The second section of this remarkable work made an especially deep impression, and at the close the composer was overwhelmed with applause. Strauss's gifts as a conductor were made manifest in very positive fashion. In his own music startling contrasts, powerful crescendos, and exciting climaxes naturally abounded. In the inter-pretation of Mozart and Wagner he displayed an admirable command of dynamic effects, ranging from the most delicate to the most sonorous; and in everything alike he revealed the intellectual insight and authority, the artistic culture, the magnetic force, the strong individuality of a musician of genius.</span></p>",,

Her terrified friends <br />withdrew her from the box, whence she was immediately conveyed home in a <br />fainting condition. 

The following morning, Miss Wheatley received a note from her Ladyship, (to <br />whom she had previously been unknown,) inviting her to her house, where, <br />after complimenting her upon the force and feeling with which she had given <br />the melody, she added, ""The description brought our glorious Nelson with such <br />terrible truth before my mind's eye, that you overwhelmed me at the moment, <br />but now I feel as if I could listen to you in that air for ever."" She <br />prevailed upon her visitor to repeat the ballad no less than four times at <br />the piano-forte, ""as if increase of appetite grew by what it fed upon."" 

Eventually, so powerful became this sentiment, that she induced Miss Wheatley <br />to retire from the stage altogether, and accept, under her roof, the post of <br />musical governess to the young Horatia Nelson, who had been confided to her 
Ladyship's guardianship. Not a day afterwards elapsed, but the favourite song <br />was put in requisition.

When the Pope chaunts the Te Deum, assisted by the choir, and in some parts by the whole congregation (generally possessing good voices and fine ears), the effect produced is certainly sublime ; but it is in the Pope's chapel only, one can hear in perfection the divine music of Palestrina.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome

He played a delicious and melancholy piece of his and afterwards we sang &ndash; he, the two daughters of the house, a young German painter, and I &ndash; five-part pieces by Purcell. The ladies seemed to know them like their Bible, but they pleased Klindworth and me only tolerably. The others drank it up like consecrated milk. There is a musical feeling at the bottom of these English organizations, but it is a conservative feeling, religious above all, and anti-passionate.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hector_Berlioz,

They consist of vocal and instrumental music, but without orchestra. They employ some five or six solo performers, and a choir of about forty-five choristers. Glees and madrigals are sung by the choir, and songs, duets, &amp;c., by the solo voices, with piano forte pieces, violin pieces, or other instruments as it may be convenient to obtain for the different concerts. I attended the second of the series on Thursday last. The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God save our gracious Queen,</p>
<p>Long may Victoria reign;</p>
<p>God save the Queen!</p>
<p>Send her victorious,</p>
<p>Happy and glorious,</p>
<p>Long to reign over us,</p>
<p>God save the Queen!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""O Lord our God arise,</p>
<p>Scatter her enemies,</p>
<p>And make them fall.</p>
<p>Confound their politics,</p>
<p>Frustrate their knavish tricks,</p>
<p>On Thee our hopes we fix,</p>
<p>God save us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Thy choicest gifts in store&nbsp;</p>
<p>On her be pleased to pour,</p>
<p>Long may she reign;</p>
<p>May she defend our laws,</p>
<p>And ever give us cause,</p>
<p>To sing with heart and voice,</p>

We slept at Abbeville, at the Hotel de l'Europe, an excellent house. We took luncheon at Beauvais, where it was market-day; and the street, in which our inn was situated, was crowded with market-people, listening to a French ballad-singer, roaring away on the steps of the coffee-house, opposite to our <br />inn. I was in high spirits, and determined to rival the said Stentorian ballad-singer; so I mounted the steps, and sang a strophe of a French song. The crowd gave me great applause, and loud cheering; so much indeed, that the mistress of the coffee-house declared, that if I would remain at Beauvais, and sing to the frequenters of her coffee-room, she would board and lodge me, free <br />of expense.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Beauvais

I am emboldened, Sir, by the generous Concern You please to take in relation to my affairs, to give you an account to the Success I have met here. The Nobility did me the Honour to make amongst themselves a Subscription for 6 Nights, which did fill a Room of 600 Persons. so that I needed not sell one single Ticket at the Door. and without Vanity the Performance was received with a general Approbation. / Signora Avolio, which I brought with me from London pleases extraordinary. I have formed an other Tenor Voice which gives great satisfaction, the Basses and Counter Tenor are very good, and the rest of the Chorus Singers (by my Direction) do exceeding well, as for the Instruments they are really excellent. Mr. Dubourgh being at the Head of them, and the Musick sounds delightfully in this charming Room, which puts me in such spirits (and my Health being so good) that I exert my self on my Organ with more than usual success. I opened with the <em>Allegro</em>, <em>Penseroso</em>, &amp; <em>Moderato</em>, and I assure you that the Words of the Moderato are vastly admired. the Audience being composed (besides the Flower of Ladyes of Distinction and other People of the greatest quality) of so many Bishops, Deans, Heads of the Colledge, the most eminent People in the Law as the Chancellor, Auditor General, etc. all which are very much taken with the Poetry. So that I am desired to perform it again the next time.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Frideric_Handel,

I was present at the first performance of the latter opera on June 25th, 1853. Berlioz conducted it himself, but it had no success, and was withdrawn after the second performance. My disappointment was great, as I had also coached Madame Nantier Didie for the part of Ascanio. My diary says: ""May 22nd. To Madame Didie. M. Berlioz there: tried over Madame Didiee's part for his opera Benvenuto Cellini, which is to be pro- duced at Covent Garden under his direction.

The one left in April; the other came in May. Within a period of six weeks we heard and saw, for the last time, the two greatest pianists that the world had then known. The leonine Russian gave at St. James's Hall that wonderful series of &ldquo;Historical Recitals&rdquo; which has since become historical in every sense&mdash; that marvelously comprehensive cycle wherein he illustrated the progress and development of pianoforte music from its earliest epoch down to the penultimate decade of the nineteenth century. It was, alike mentally and physically, an extraordinary tour de force. No one save Rubinstein would have attempted the Herculean feat involved in the execution of such programmes. What must the task have been for the executant, if the bare labor of listening was an exhausting process! But Rubinstein was a giant, and the considerations that applied to ordinary pianists did not arise in his case. These recitals yielded the largest sum ever taken at St. James's Hall for a series of seven concerts, the gross receipts amounting to &pound;6000 ($30,000). An extra recital was given, and out of the proceeds Rubinstein divided &pound;300 ($1500) among various charitable institutions.</span></p>",,

After receiving us most graciously, Her Majesty seated herself near the tail-end of the piano, evidently in order to be able to see Rubinstein's face as he played. In the distance the only other listeners were seated, two or three ladies-in-waiting. The great pianist began with some Chopin nocturnes and other soft sweet things, which greatly pleased the Queen. After that I sang, and then Rubinstein played again, this time some louder things. I thought I could detect faint signs of uneasiness in Her Majesty's face as she seemed to realize the alarming nearness of the huge concert grand, the open lid of which threw the sounds back in the direction of Her Majesty's chair with redoubled force. Then I sang again, and then, to my dismay I confess, for I had heard him do it before, Rubinstein settled down to the playing of Liszt's arrangement of Schubert's <em>Erl-King</em>. At the first outcry of the frightened child, &ldquo;Mein Vater, mein Vater,&rdquo; I was prepared for the Queen asking me to close the lid, when there happened the most touching act, or rather a succession of most touching acts on the part of her indeed Most Gracious Majesty. Every now and then she would, unnoticed by the player, gently push her chair farther and farther away from the piano, the sounds issuing from which were growing more and more terrific from bar to bar, until, during the last frantic ride of the horror-stricken father, keys, strings, hammers seemed to be flying through the air in all directions, dashed into fragments by the relentless hoofs of the maddened horse. By that time, however, the Queen was at a safe distance, and a charming smile of pleasure and relief stole over her serious, wonderfully impressive features when at last, home reached, Rubinstein was half, and &ldquo;the child&rdquo; completely dead.</span></p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Henschel,

But, although the public seemed to care for nothing but Jenny Lind, and although all the interest of the opera centred in the great favourite of the day, that same public appeared to resent the mutilation of Meyerbeer's great work: 1st, by the entire suppression of the character of the Princess Isabella, and 2nd, by the omission of two complete acts. The revival was thus a failure in popular esteem, though not in remunerative attraction; for, as has been said, whenever, and whatever ""Jenny"" sang, the house was crowded to its farthest limits. The ""cast,"" it must be said, lacked the completeness of the previous year, Gardoni (the Raimbaldo of the previous season), favourite though he was, was pronounced not up to the part of Roberto; whilst Beletti, although usually applauded by the.audience in other characters was judged deficient in the depth and intensity necessary to Bertram. Labocetta, the new Raimbaldo, also failed to please. The experiment of the revival of ""Roberto il Diavolo,"" under these conditions, was, therefore, anything but prosperous.</span></p>",,

Madame Mara was engaged there, and so was I, as principal tenor singer. The first performance was "" The Messiah, which I was to open on the Thursday morning. I was to quit town on the Tuesday, but on Monday night I received an order not on any account to leave London, for Mr. Sheridan had sent a peremptory message to have Richard Coeur de Lion performed ; and against his decree there was no appeal. John Palmer, the excellent comedian, was with me when I received the message ; he said to me, "" My valued friend, Richard will be over by eleven o'clock ; if you choose to have a carriage and four horses at the door, you will get with ease to Norwich by twelve, on Thursday, in time to open "" the Messiah. Norwich is the city that first cherished me, and where I married my beloved wife; how I should like to accompany you, if you would give me a seat in your chaise. I said it would make me very happy to have the pleasure of his company. He told me he was perfectly acquainted with every inn on the road, and would write immediately to those where we were to change horses, to have relays prepared for us, that we might not meet with any delay on the road. I was much pleased with the promised arrangement, and wrote to Madame Mara that I should be at Norwich on Thursday in time, requesting her to secure two beds at the Hotel where she was ; one for my friend Palmer, and one for myself. On Wednesday evening, as I was dressing for Richard, my friend Palmer came to me, with the countenance of Joseph Surface, and sighing, said, "" My best of friends, this is the most awful period of my life; I cannot leave town; my beloved wife, the partner of my sorrows and my joys, is just confined."" I said, under such circumstances, of course I could not expect him to leave Mrs. Palmer, but I hoped there would be no mistake about the horses, which were ordered to be ready at each post ; he sat down, and deliberately wrote down the names of all the places where he had ordered them to be in readiness. About eleven o'clock, having merely taken off my Richard's dress, I got into the carriage ; and accompanied by a Scotchman, who was my valet and hair-dresser, rattled off full speed to Epping, where we were first to change, at the inn marked down by my excellent friend ; we knocked and bellowed for Mr. Palmer's horses ; at last out came the ostler ; Mr. Palmer had no horses there ; he had not sent any orders ; nor did they even know who Mr Palmer was. I never in the course of my life experienced a greater disappointment ; in short, all the way down I had to wait for horses, as Palmer had not written to any one of the inns ; however, the road was excellent, and by paying the boys well, I got on at a capital pace without the smallest accident. It was market-day at Norwich, and as I drove in, the good folks stared and wondered to see me getting my hair dressed in the carriage; however, I reached the church-door just as the overture to "" the Messiah,"" was on the point of commencing. I took my seat in the orchestra, opened the "" Oratorio,"" and never was in better voice, although naturally much fatigued. We had two more morning performances in the church, and three evening performances in the grand assembly room. At the conclusion of the festival I returned to town, and when I charged Palmer with neglect and deception, he swore that he had ordered all the horses exactly as he had stated. I thought it of no use to be at variance with him, and pretended to believe him.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich

As the body of Siegfried was placed on the shield and slowly carried shoulder-high along the hilly, wooded banks of the Rhine to the passionate strains of that stupendous Funeral March, the moon breaking through the clouds just at the appearance of the beautiful Love-motif, the impression was simply overwhelming. Wagner's conception of the music drama as a perfect blending of the three arts, poetry, music, and painting, here seemed to have had its consummate realisation. After the last note of the great trilogy [<em>sic</em>] had died away and the seemingly minute-long, awed silence of the deeply moved audience given place to an outburst of frantic enthusiasm, amid which Wagner was called again and again, until he delivered himself of that historical speech containing the famous and at the time much-discussed phrase, "" Now it rests with you whether or no we shall have a German Art,"" I had to walk around the theatre in the dark for a while, quite by myself, before I felt like returning to reality and realism by joining my friends at supper.&nbsp;</span></p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Henschel,

But it would seem that for an instant the demon of disaster hovered over Her Majesty's Theatre. Persiani was announced for Tuesday, the 5th April; but, at the last moment, a hand-bill informed the entering crowd that the expected favourite had suffered too much from sea-sickness on her passage from Calais to Dover, to be able to sing. The disappointed public was not to be pacified with a pot pourri from ""Gemma"" and ""Il Giuramento,"" with Guasco and Moltini, but expressed its dissatisfaction with clamour and hissing. The ""check"" was unfortunate to a season destined to realize in many respects the sanguine presages with which it commenced.

On the contrary, an expectation of fresh disappointment hung over the minds of all. Under these circumstances, Baucarde may be said to have taken the town by surprise. According to a current story, young Baucarde had been originally employed in the palace kitchen of the Grand Duke of Tuscany; and, like the celebrated composer Lully, he first attracted the attention of his superiors by his talents for cookery. His manifest vocal advantages caused him to be placed in a position to acquire a sound musical education, and thus to become one of the most agreeable tenors of his time. Nothing was expected, yet great results were achieved. With a charmingly sweet, bnt still robust voice of wonderful extension; with a style wherein the use of the falsetto was at once sparingly and judiciously employed, this young artist won easily upon a public accustomed to give a preference to natural gifts over the display of skill. Not that Baucarde was deficient in skill; on the contrary, his ""school"" was excellent. As an actor he rose scarcely above mediocrity, but any deficiency in this respect was overlooked in the splendour of his ""organ."" </span></p>",,

I first heard it under the direction of the composer at these concerts in 1855 at Exeter Hall, when I was playing the violin in the orchestra, and it then made a deep impression on me.

The King, Queen, and all the royal family sat opposite the orchestra ; the body of the church, the galleries, and every corner crowded with beauty, rank, and fashion : such was the rage to procure seats, that ladies had their hair dressed the night previous, to be ready to get to the Abbey in good time. The performers unanimously exerted their great talents to admiration; but what made an everlasting impression on me was, the powerful effect produced by Madame Mara, in the sublime recitative, "" Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously ;"" in that Her voice was heard around, Loud as a trumpet with a silver sound. I have often sung with her the recitative tenor part, ""And Miriam the Prophetess took a timbrel in her hand;"" and never heard her but with increased delight. No place could be more appropriate to give effect to the divine strains of Handel, than the spacious Abbey. His Majesty 's partiality for Handel's music was generally spoken of ; but I believe it was not universally known what an excellent and accurate judge he was of its merits. The fine chorus of "" Lift up your heads, O ye gates,"" was always given in full chorus, and indeed intended to be so given by Handel. The King suggested that the first part of it should be made a semi-chorus, and sung only by the principal singers ; but when it came to the passage, "" He is the King of Glory !"" he commanded that the whole orchestra, with the full chorus, should, with a tremendous forte, burst out ; the effect produced by the alteration was awful and sublime. A strange coincidence happened at one of the performances: the morning, during part of the grand selection, was cloudy and lowering; but when the grand chorus struck up "" Let there be light, and light was over all !"" the sun burst forth, and with its rays illuminated every part of the splendid edifice. Every one was struck with the coincidence, and the effect produced by it.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

The privileged of the theatre told tales abroad of the appearance of the ""Swedish Nightingale"" at rehearsal, of her enthusiastic reception by all the members of the orchestra, of her overpowering emotion on facing this tumultuously flattering welcome, and of her undiminished, nay, increased powers. Thursday, the 4th of May came. The scenes of excitement in all the thoroughfares leading to the theatre were once more renewed; again were struggling crowds early at the doors; again were hats doubled up, and dresses torn; and again was the throng of carriages, the clamour and conflict of coachmen, servants, policemen, mob, the same as of yore. A ""Jenny Lind crush"" had lost nothing of its fever and intensity. The adored prima donna was to make her reappearance in the part which, more than all, had fascinated her enraptured admirers of the previous year, namely, the part of Amina in ""La Sonnambula."" Words fail to describe the aspect of the overcrowded house, the tumultuous reception, the enthusiasm which knew no bounds and no limits of time, or to give an idea of the prolonged cheering that followed every vocal display on the part of this idol of the public. The house was crowded to a state of impossibility, which eagerness and determination had exercised their magic to make possible. The Court was present ; and an incident, independent of the great event of the evening, is worthy of record. It was the first appearance of the Queen in public, since the famous 10th of April, when English loyalty and English "" pluck "" had pretty clearly shown that England could have nothing to fear from the revolutionary elements which were just then rife in Europe, driving monarchs from their thrones. When the British Sovereign first reappeared among her subjects, loyalty was not to be baulked of a fitting de- monstration; and in spite of the etiquette of the day, which allowed the Queen, as well as her subjects, to enjoy a dramatic entertainment without interruption, she was received by such universal homage of acclamation, that she was constrained to appear in the front of her box to acknowledge the demonstration, whilst the the National Anthem was sung by the chief singers of the establishment. Well might the newspapers of the day preface their record by the phrase, ""The great evening of the season has come off, and the result has been most brilliant.""</span></p>",,

Cuyler : "" During my active pastorate I often got better sermons from my people than I ever gave them. I recall now a most touching and sublime scene that I once witnessed in the death-chamber of a noble woman who had suffered for many months from an excruciating malady. The end was drawing near. She seemed to be catching a foregleam of the glory that awaited her. With tremulous tones she began to recite Henry Lyte's matchless hymn, ' Abide with me ! Fast falls the eventide.'</p>",,

No prayer having been offered for this part of the service, and feeling that the singing might prove only an entertainment, and not a spiritual blessing, I requested the whole congregation to join me in a word of prayer, asking God to bless the truth about to be sung. In the prayer my anxiety was relieved. Believing and rejoicing in the glorious truth contained in the song, I sang it through to the end. At the close of Mr. Moody's address, Dr. Bonar turned toward me with a smile on his venerable face, and reaching out his hand he said : "" Well, Mr. Sankey, you sang the Gospel to-night.""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh

<pre>On Wednesday, 1st December, 1813, an Ode was performed at Freemasons' Hall, <br />for the Installation of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent and Strathern, as <br />Grand Master of Masons in England, according to the old institution. The Ode <br />recited by brother Pope; the music composed by brother Kelly. The military <br />band of His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, who were Masons, attended; <br />together with several eminent professional singers; and the whole formed a <br />grand coup d'oeil. Brother Bellamy sang the following song with great animation,<br />and it was received with unanimous applause: <br />""Mountains may fall, and rocks decay, <br />And isle on isle be swept away, <br />But Masonry's primeval truth, <br />Unbroke by force, unchanged by time, <br />Shall bloom in renovated youth, <br />And energy sublime."" </pre>
<pre>The following duet met with the same meal of approbation : </pre>
<pre>""For see! from Heaven the peaceful dove <br />With olive branch descend; <br />Augustus shall with Edward join, <br />All rivalry to end; <br />And taught by their fraternal love, <br />Our arms, our hearts shall intertwine. <br />The union to approve, <br /><br />""Then Edward and Augustus hail ! <br />For now beneath the Brunswick line,<br />One system shall prevail ; <br />O'er all the earth, with truths divine, <br />Shall Masonry extend its sway, <br />Till time itself shall pass away <br />In unity to shine."" </pre>

There was to be seen the whole population of Rome, high and low, rich and poor,<em> en masque</em> ; the nobility and ladies in their most slendid equipages, all masqued, throwing sugar-plums to the motley groupe below, which was composed of mountebanks, pulcinellas, cardinals, harlequins, &amp;c. with music, dancing, singing. In short, I was in a delirium of pleasure ! Every evening, we visited the theatres : - there are two for serious operas, the Aliberti and the Argentina, where the best performers are always found; indeed, should the manager attempt to introduce any thing inferior, woe be to him ! and, as these theatres are only allowed to be open during the carnival, he is obliged to pay enormous salaries to procure the first singers ; for the Romans will have the best or none. There are also two theatres for comic operas, La Capranica and La Valle. The Romans assume that they are the most sapient critics in the world ; they are, certainly, the most severe ones : they have no medium, all is delight or disgust. If asked whether a performance or a piece has been successful, the answer, if favourable, is, "" &egrave;&nbsp;andato al settimo cielo,"" - "" it has ascended to the seventh heaven."""" If it has failed, they say, "" &egrave;&nbsp;andato al' abbisso del inferno,"" - "" it has sunk to the abyss of hell."" The severest critics are the Abbes, who sit in the first row of the pit, each armed with a lighted wax taper in one hand, and a book of the opera in the other ; and should any poor devil of a singer miss a word, they call out "" bravo, bestia,"" "" bravo, you beast !"" It is customary for the composer of an opera, to preside at the piano-forte the first three nights of its performance, and a precious time he has of it in Rome. Should any passage in the music strike the audience as similar to one of another composer, they cry, "" Bravo, il ladro,"" "" bravo, you thief; or, "" bravo, Paesiello ! bravo, Sacchini !"" if they suppose the passage stolen from them, "" the curse of God light on him who first put a pen into your hand to write music !"" This I heard said, in the Teatro Aliberti, to the celebrated com-poser Gazzaniga, who was obliged to sit patiently at the piano-forte to hear the flattering commenda-tion. Cimarosa, who was their idol as a composer, was once so unfortunate as to make use of a movement in a comic opera, at the Teatro della Valle, which reminded them of one of his own, in an opera composed by him for the preceding carnival. An Abbe started up, and said, "" Bravo, Cimarosa ! you are welcome from Naples ; by your music of to-night, it is clear you have neither left your trunk behind you, nor your old music ; you are an excellent cook in hashing up old dishes !"" Poggi, the most celebrated buffo singer of his day, always dreaded appearing before those stony-hearted critics ; however, tempted by a large sum, he accepted an engagement at the Teatro della Valle. He arrived in Rome some weeks previous to his engagement, hoping to make friends, and form a party in his favour ; he procured introductions to the most severe and scurrilous, and thinking to find the way to their hearts through their mouths, gave them splendid dinners daily. One of them, an Abbe, he selected from the rest, as his bosom friend and confidante ; he fed, clothed, and supplied him with money ; he confided to him his terrors at appearing before an audience so fastidious as the Romans. The Abbe assured him, that he had nothing to fear, as his opinion was looked up to by the whole bench of critics ; and when he approved, none dare dissent. The awful night for poor Poggi at length arrived ; his ficlus Achates took his usual seat, in his little locked-up chair in the pit. It was agreed between them, that he was to convey to Poggi, by signs, the feeling of the audience towards him; if they approved, the Abbe was to nod his head; if the contrary, to shake it. When Poggi had sung his first song, the Abbe nodded, and cried, "" Bravo ! bravissimo"" but in the second act, Poggi became hoarse, and imperfect ; the audience gave a gentle hiss, which disconcerted the affrighted singer, and made him worse : on this, his friend became outrageous, and standing up on his chair, after putting out his wax-light, and closing his book, he looked Poggi in the face, and exclaimed, "" Signer Poggi, I am the mouth of truth, and thus declare, that you are decidedly the worst singer that ever appeared in Rome ! I also declare, that you ought to be hooted off the stage for your impudence, in imposing on my simple and credulous good nature, as you have done."" This produced roars of laughter, and poor Poggi retired, never to appear again, without even exclaiming, "" Et tu, Brute,"" which he might most appropriately have applied to his guardian crony. A circumstance something like this took place at the Teatro Argentina. A tenor singer of the name of Gabrielli, brother of the great female singer of that name, was engaged there. Before he had got through five bars of his first song, the critics began to hiss and hoot, (and very deservedly so, for he was execrable), saying, "" Get away, you cursed raven "" Get off, you Goat !"" On which he came forward and addressed the audience very mildly, "" You fancy you are mortifying me, by hooting me ; you are grossly deceived ; on the contrary, I applaud your judgment, for I solemnly declare to you, that I never appeared on any stage without receiving the same treatment, and sometimes much worse !"" This appeal, though it produced a momentary laugh, could not procure a second appearance for the poor fellow.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rome

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448281888079,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>A rich programme was presented this evening. The concert opened with an overture which is a great favorite here, and often played in public, though I have not heard it in America,&mdash; &ldquo;Iphigene in Aulis,&rdquo; by Gluck. It is a charming overture, and any one&rsquo;s musical reputation might safely rest on the production of a single piece like this. Its subjects are at once natural and beautiful, and they are always treated in a most masterly manner; with elaborateness it is always intelligible, and with copiousness it is never diffuse. There is no departing from the main topic of discourse, no wandering in the mazes of thick darkness, or searching for ideas, but the leading thoughts are kept ever before the mind, presented now in this form, and now in that. Its analogies are perfect, its contrasts are striking, and its light and shade are applied with the hand of a Raphael or a Turner. It is full of pleasing melody, yet always subject to the laws of good taste, and manifesting both genius and science; it is in the performance, perhaps, equally satisfactory both to the musician and to the mere unstudied lover of song.</p>
<p>The second piece was an extract (first and second movements) of Cherubini&rsquo;s Requiem, written for male voices. This, which is one of Cherubini&rsquo;s great works, was written under circumstances somewhat exciting, as I remember to have heard years ago. On some funeral occasion when a Requiem was desired, that which he had previously written was rejected, because composed for a mixed choir; this caused him to put forth his energies, in the production of a mass for men&rsquo;s voices only. The music throughout is of a very high character, though it would not much interest those who desire musical gratification only from pretty tunes or pleasant voices. The first movement, &ldquo;Requiem aeternam&rdquo; with its accompaniment of violoncellos and double basses, is plaintive and sad, and tells only of sorrow, penitence and grief. In the &ldquo;Dies irae,&rdquo; the full powers of the orchestra are brought into requisition; and uniting, as was the case on the present occasion, with sixty well-trained and fearless men&rsquo;s voices, the effect was awfully grand and commanding. The majestic movements, the severely dissonant harmonies, the wailings of the strings, the frightful appeals of the instruments of blast and percussion, and the cryings out of the voices, all combined to produce an effect which was, at times, truly terrific and overwhelming. The nineteen stanzas, however, have furnished an opportunity for musical contrasts which have been well introduced, affording variety and relief.</p>
<p>The third piece was the very unique but, to the musician, highly interesting ""Concert fur 2 claviere (c moll) Von J. S. Bach."" Following the Requiem, it was like a delightful calm after a storm, enabling one to realize where he was, to breathe easily again, and put on a cheerful countenance.</p>
<p>Several part-songs were then sung by the &ldquo;Mannerchor&rdquo; without accompaniment.</p>
<p>The second part consisted of the &ldquo;Sinfonie in C minor, by L. Von Beethoven&rdquo; What a symphonie this is! We have often heard it, and it is well known in America. We will not attempt a description; we listened with intense interest to the whole of it, hardly daring to breathe in the piano and not having the power to do so in the forte passages. Is it strange then, that, whether &ldquo;in the body or out of the body&rdquo; at its close, we should not be able to tell?</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig

Francescina sings most of Mrs. Cibber's part and some of Mrs. Clive's : upon the whole it went off very well, but not better than last year. Joseph, I believe, will be next Friday, but Handel is mightily out of humour about it, for Sullivan, who is to sing Joseph, is a black with a very fine voice, and Beard has no voice at all. The part which Francescina is to have (of Joseph's wife) will not admit of much variety; but I hope it will be well received; the houses have not been crowded, but pretty full every night.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448709848065,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>At five o&rsquo;clock was a grand festival of artists, entitled the &ldquo;Power of Song.&rdquo; It consisted in a succession of very splendid &ldquo;tableaux vivants&rdquo;&mdash;accompanied by appropriate music and recitation. A full orchestra, and a large mixed choir of perhaps one hundred and twenty voices, with solo-singers, constituted the musical department for the occasion. The best speakers were employed for the declamation; and the living pictures were under the immediate direction of a committee of the painters of Dusseldorf. The hour arrived, but vain was the attempt to commence. Bacchus had been there, and had obtained such a sway over the sons of Apollo, that music&rsquo;s voice could not be heard. The orchestra did indeed play, or appeared to play an overture, but not even the loudest passages could be heard, for the vocal shoutings quite overpowered trumpets, trombones, and drums. The speakers, in appropriate costume, came on the stage, but their voices were lost in loud shoutings, and they quickly gave up the contest and retreated. Various attempts were made for nearly an hour to command silence, and obtain a hearing, but in vain. The roar of voices, and the loud &ldquo; Hurrah,&rdquo; overpowered all the efforts of the Mayor, the artists, and the orchestra. Even the presence of the Prince, the patron of the Festival, could not restrain the tremendous cheerings.</p>",,

His success in this character (for which indeed he had been expressly engaged) was as great as it was merited, although his pronunciation of the Italian language was defective. He was proclaimed the Bertram of the Italian stage, as he had been of the German, Still it was impossible for him to occupy his merited position in the operatic ""talk"" of the day, when the public mind was wholly and exclusively absorbed by one object &mdash; Jenny Lind.</span></p>",,

But, although the public seemed to care for nothing but Jenny Lind, and although all the interest of the opera centred in the great favourite of the day, that same public appeared to resent the mutilation of Meyerbeer's great work: 1st, by the entire suppression of the character of the Princess Isabella, and 2nd, by the omission of two complete acts. The revival was thus a failure in popular esteem, though not in remunerative attraction; for, as has been said, whenever, and whatever ""Jenny"" sang, the house was crowded to its farthest limits. The ""cast,"" it must be said, lacked the completeness of the previous year, Gardoni (the Raimbaldo of the previous season), favourite though he was, was pronounced not up to the part of Roberto; whilst Beletti, although usually applauded by the.audience in other characters was judged deficient in the depth and intensity necessary to Bertram. Labocetta, the new Raimbaldo, also failed to please. The experiment of the revival of ""Roberto il Diavolo,"" under these conditions, was, therefore, anything but prosperous.</span></p>",,

She had come specially from her castle in Wales to sing to the Queen, and had asked me to come to Windsor to play for her. Naturally I looked forward to a very interesting evening, as it indeed proved to be. The Queen sat about twenty feet from the piano and used an opera-glass in looking at Madame Patti, who sang a number of songs. During ""Home, Sweet Home"" I noticed the Queen wiped the tears from her eyes. When Madame Patti had finished her first song Princess Christian, who sat by the side of the Queen, called to me in German, ""Herr Ganz, the Queen wishes to speak to you."" I rose immediately and advanced towards the chair where the Queen sat. Her Majesty spoke to me in German, in a lovely melodious voice, asking me what other songs Madame Patti would like to sing. She had a list in her hand, so I named some of them which I thought Her Majesty would like. Among other songs Madame Patti sang one by Princess Henry of Battenberg, who was present with Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein and a number of court officials, both ladies and gentlemen. At the end of the concert the Queen spoke for some time with Madame Patti, then rose, and bowed very graciously to Madame Patti and myself and the rest of the company. We then adjourned to a room where supper was served, and Sir William Carington, Comptroller of the Household, handed me, in the name of the Queen, a crocodile leather cigar-case, mounted in gold, with the royal crown and the Queen's initials. I spoke to Lady Ponsonby, one of the ladies-in-waiting, wife of Colonel Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary to the Queen, whom I had known as Miss Bulteel at Lady Waldegrave's at Nuneham Park, and she said she was very much pleased to renew my acquaint- ance. Next morning I was shown over the State Apartments at Windsor Castle, and saw the various collections of art-treasures. When Madame Patti left the Castle that morn- ing the Great Western express was specially stopped for her at Slough by Royal Command, so that she could get back to Craig-y-nos that day. On her arrival home she received a gracious telegram from Queen Victoria hoping she had had a comfortable journey, and later a signed photograph. My daughter Adelina, who was staying at Craig-y-nos, and travelled with her, told me that, although tired from her early start, she insisted on keeping awake the whole journey in case sleeping should affect her voice, as she considers sleep before singing injurious to the voice.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Windsor_Castle

D'Orsay, who was a Liberal, assured her, laughingly, that this fall in the midst of her Legitimist song was de tres mauvais augure, and a bad prognostic for the success of the party to which she belonged. He did not at the time believe his own prophecy, so firmly did the Bourbons appear to be established; but before the end of the month Charles X. had left France, and was followed by the fair Duchess and her husband, the most faithful friends and adherents of the fallen monarch, and as true to him in adversity as when he shone forth as one of the most powerful sovereigns of Europe. </span></p>",,

One of these was ""The Golden Legend."" He showed it to me during one of our Sunday chats, and pointed with pride to what he hoped would be some novel effects in the prologue the wailing ""diminished"" chords for the violins, the exulting clang of the bells, the blare of the brass instruments, the poignant cry, ""Oh, we cannot!"" uttered by the disappointed demons, and, lastly, the contrast when the organ comes in and the monks chant their grand hymn in broad unison. Novel, indeed, did these effects prove in the rendering-strokes of pure originality on the part of a composer who had heretofore ventured slightly, if at all, beyond the limits of treatment laid down in the scores of his beloved masters, Schubert and Mendelssohn. My outspoken admiration won for me the promise of a copy of the full score of ""The Golden Legend"" as soon as it should be published; and in due time that copy arrived, with the composer's autograph upon the title-page. This beautiful work was written for and brought out at the Leeds Festival of 1886. There can be no doubt that it immensely enhanced the reputation of the composer, whose genius as a writer of comic operas had been brilliantly exemplified eighteen months before by the production of ""The Mikado."" The laurels yielded by the Savoy operas were of necessity shared by Sir Arthur with his talented collaborator, Mr. W. S. Gilbert. In regard to the Leeds cantata, the composer certainly owed much to Longfellow's lovely poem and to Mr. Joseph Bennett's adroit adaptation thereof; but, this apart, there was no one to divide with him the glory of a supreme triumph, of an artistic achievement that stood ""head and shoulders"" above all his previous efforts.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leeds

How that purely artificial vogue ever came to extend beyond the walls of the Italian churches no one knows. At least it should have stopped short at Paris, which was as far as the youthful abbe himself contrived to get on his road to London. But for a time the &ldquo;craze"" raged in England with the virulence of an epidemic, and many sane musicians persuaded themselves that the new oratorio composer was a genius of the first magnitude. His &ldquo;Transfiguration"", his &ldquo;Raising of Lazarus,"" and his &ldquo;Resurrection of Christ"" were all performed at the London Musical Festival which Robert Newman started at Queen's Hall in May; while his &ldquo;Passion of Christ"" was given at the Norwich Festival in the autumn. In each instance, however, there was felt a keen sense of disappointment. At best Perosi's works could appeal only to the ear amid ecclesiastical surroundings, and even there their woeful lack of originality was bound to irritate the critical listener.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Queen's_Hall

The scene was one of those palatial residences in Belgrave Square. Two operatic prima donnas, England's foremost tenor, two foreign virtuosos, a violinist and a &rsquo;cellist, and myself were to go through a long programme of music, commencing at 11 </span><span style=""font-size: 9.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"">P.M</span><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt;"">. There was leading into the ball-room, which by the temporary erection of a platform had been converted into a music-room, a little antechamber, reached by the back stairs, which served as a green-room. This we caged lions paced impatiently up and down until our respective turns came and the faithful Mr. Saunders, the representative of Chappel&rsquo;s, who managed the affair, opened the doors into the arena to let us loose. We had just heard the applause following the customary high C natural of the prima donna's final cadenza when that poor lady re-entered the green-room in a state of great excitement, nervousness, and indignation, exclaiming on the point of tears, &ldquo;It is too awful, they don't pay the slightest attention to the music, they talk and giggle it&rsquo;s horrid,&rdquo; and so on. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; I asked&mdash;poor innocent me&mdash;&ldquo;you don't mean to say they talked aloud <em>whilst you sang</em>?&rdquo; and being informed that such indeed was the deplorable fact of the case, my mind was made up. Soon my turn came: a recitative and air from a Handel opera. As usual I was my own accompanist. After striking a few <em>forte</em> chords by way of prelude I began to sing. For a few bars there was silence, and then, at first from far away down by the door at the end of the room where it opened into another, came sounds of talking and tittering. Count Beust, a distinguished diplomatist and amateur musician, turned round&mdash;he sat in the first row&mdash;with a few sharp and solemn &ldquo;Psht&mdash;psht, ...&rdquo; but hardly to any purpose. The talking and tittering grew louder and louder, and so did my voice. No use. With a few &ldquo;bangs&rdquo; I improvised an abrupt ending to the aria, inwardly apologizing to the shades of Handel. Amid the applause of the audience, the majority of which only by that applause realized that something in the way of singing had happened, I withdrew to the green-room, took my hat and coat, and in spite of the anxious entreaties of poor Mr. Saunders to, for goodness' sake, stay and do my second turn, left the room and the house.</span></p>",,

The colonel had become anxious about his spiritual condition, and decided to go to London to attend our meetings there. At the conclusion of one of the evening services, as he was about to leave the great building, his attention was arrested by a sweet voice singing, "" Let the Saviour in."" On taking the train at Waterloo station for Bournemouth, the song remained in his heart and the wheels of the train seemed to repeat in his ears the refrain, "" Let Him in ! Let the Saviour in !"" He went again to London and sought out the singer whose voice had so impressed him.

Just after breakfast I hurried over to the depot and got on some cars which were about to leave. I found soon, however, that I had not got on the passenger train but on one carrying up soldiers. I knew, however, when I reached Tekoa by Killian's millpond and though the cars were at full speed I had had no intention of going up to Charlotte so I jumped off ""flying squirrel"" fashion and down I came full length. I jumped up however and found that my neck was not broken and went over to the church. I conducted the Sunday School and got on very successfully until the very close when the choir leader who was singing ""Old Hundred"" gave out and I was obliged to sing alone the last two lines though I had never sung a line unaided before in my life. I believe I changed the time completely before I got to the end.</p>",,

At this second concert we had many artists of European reputation to assist, such as Madame Clara Novello, who had a beautiful, bell-like, soprano voice. For years people used to rave about her singing of ""God save the Queen"" at the opening of the great Exhibition in 1851. The last time I heard her was at her farewell concert in 1860, at which she sang in Benedict's cantata <em>Undine</em>. I do not remember any other English singer with such a beautiful voice, and she was a very handsome woman as well. Another of our artists was Madame Viardot Garcia, sister of the late Manuel Garcia and Madame Malibran. I shall never forget her vivid and dramatic rendering of Schubert's ""Erl- konig"" which she sang with such fire and depth of feeling that the audience applauded enthusiastically and insisted upon her repeating it. She afterwards captivated every one by two characteristic Spanish songs.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hanover_Square_Rooms
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448285563397,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>The concert was given in the saloon of the Gewandhaus, by Robert and Clara Schumann. The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn&rsquo;s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this.</p>
<p>The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];&mdash; the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a &ldquo;help meet&rdquo; indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author.</p>
<p>The first piece was the &ldquo;Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred&nbsp;von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was &ldquo;Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,&rdquo; performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin&rsquo;s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety&rsquo;s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- &ldquo;Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of &ldquo;Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose&rdquo; (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this. For the few details here given we are indebted to others, for we did not attend this concert; we neither saw the sight nor heard the sound thereof. Why? It was given on Sunday Morning, March 14th, at 11 o'clock.</p>",,

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1448360140810,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>The service commenced with quite a long voluntary of ten minutes or more, consisting of an introduction and fugue. The subject of the fugue was, perhaps, a little too chromatic for the dignity of worship, but it was played slowly and with great precision and certainty.</p>
<p>At the close of the voluntary, the minister, followed by the session, entered; the former took his place in the pulpit; the latter took their places in seats appropriated to them, on each side, facing the congregation. The organ then gave out the tune Iosco &mdash; the melody was made very prominent, the bass was played by the pedals, and an intermediate figured accompaniment filled up the harmony, producing a fine effect. The hymn, the subject of which was prayer to Jesus for his spirit, was finely sung by the whole assembly, all singing the melody. At the end of the first line of the last stanza, which was doxological, the minister rose in the pulpit, not to find his place in the Bible as if he was in a hurry to cut off the last act of praise, but apparently as an act of reverence, as he kept standing, without any movement, and was soon followed in his example by all the male part of his congregation. A short prayer followed the hymn; then an address (extempore) of four or five minutes; after this the regular morning prayer was read; another hymn was sung as before, and the sermon followed. There were two hymns sung afterwards, making four times singing during the exercises. Here was a very simple, appropriate, devotional service for a Sabbath morning, &mdash; almost the same, indeed, as is the religious service in our Presbyterian, Baptist, or Congregational churches, and vastly superior to the Lutheran or English Cathedral repetitions and forms.</p>",,

The opening representation of &ldquo;Aida"" on June 13, with brand-new costumes and fresh scenery expressly imported from Italy, fairly took critics and opera-goers by surprise. The triumph of Jean de Eeszke was instantaneous and complete. Here, at last, was the great tenor for whom the world had been waiting since the death of Giuglini and the retirement of Mario !</span></p>",,

Manuel Garcia, the great teacher of singing, came to live under my parents' roof... Fortunately, Signor Garcia took a considerable fancy to me. He was fond of discussing politics, but, having little time to read the papers, would generally ask me for the latest news. He openly expressed his disgust with the policy of the Liberal Government of that day, and found in myself a sympathetic supporter of his views. About music I was afraid for a long while to talk with him. One day, however, he heard me singing in a distant part of the house, and told my mother that I had a very agreeable light tenor voice. She at once asked him if he would be good enough to give me some instruction. He readily consented, and, within an hour, to my intense delight, I found myself taking my first lesson from Manuel Garcia.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

We have already spoken of her as Marie; of other characters, we will only say, that Rosina and Martha are great favorites; and those persons who know what these are, will have a correct idea of the principal characteristics of her singing, and of the characters in which she stands pre-eminent &mdash; unapproachable. She was always greeted and recalled with the most perfect enthusiasm on the part of the audience, amid showers of bouquets and wreaths of flowers. Her appearance is highly interesting, especially after one becomes a little familiar with her voice and movements. She is indeed a fine looking woman; youthful and active, when she appears in public, as a young lady of eighteen. Her triumph in Leipzig was complete.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leipzig

I never cared particularly for the tenor&mdash; his voice was always hard and metallic; but Malten's noble organ was never in grander condition, and she sang with a degree of dramatic intensity and emotional warmth that was absolutely thrilling.</span></p>",,

In one of the scenes he sat in an arm-chair and tried to pick up the handkerchief of Norina, sung by Sontag, of whom I will speak later on. Being extremely fat, he could not do so, and his vain efforts always created much amuse ment among the audience. It may interest my readers to know that Lablache gave Queen Victoria lessons in singing.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

By command of the King, a supper was given in the Jerusalem Chamber, to the French Ambassadors who came over to arrange the marriage of the Prince of Wales (afterwards Charles I.) to the French Princess Henrietta Maria. But before the supper (as Bishop Racket, of Lichfield) describes: ""The Embassadors, with the Nobles and Gentlemen in their Company, were brought in at the North-gate of the Abby, which was stuck with Flambeaux everywhere, both within and without the Quire, that strangers might cast their Eyes upon the stateliness of the Church. At the Door of the Quire the Lord Keeper besought their Lordships to go in, and to take their seats there for a while, promising in the Word of a Bishop that nothing of ill Rellish should be offered before them; which they accepted; and at their Entrance the Organ was touch'd by the best Finger of that Age, Mr. Orlando Gibbons. While a verse was plaid, the Lord Keeper presented the Embassadors and the rest of the Noblest Quality of their Nation with our Liturgy, as it spake to them in their own Language; and in the Delivery of it used those few Words, but pithy, That their Lordships at Leisure might Read in that Book in what Form of Holiness our Prince worshipp'd God; wherein he durst say nothing savour'd of any Corruption of Doctrine, much less of Heresie; which he hoped would be so reported to the Lady Princess Henrietta.The Lord Embassadors and their Great Train took up all the Stalls, where they continued about half an hour, while the Quiremen, vested in their Rich Copes, with their Choristers, sang three several Anthems with most exquisite Voices before them.""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

The ""Adelia"" of Donizetti had been selected for the reappearance of Persiani and the debut of Conti. ""Adelia"" had never been accounted one of the most esteemed operas of the prolific composer, even in Italy. With the anti-Donizetti feeling strong in England (the bigoted lovers of the old school having just then no one else to abuse, in default of the Verdi, who was yet to come), the choice; was, as all must admit, hazardous. The opera, in a musical point of view, was not a success; although the remarkable execution of Persiani, who was enabled to show all her grace and flexibility in a rondo at the conclusion, ""brought down the curtain"" with applause; Conti was received as a steady, zealous, and even energetic tenor, but failed to excite any marked enthusiasm, or to realise the high expectations of the public.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

She came to me soon after her arrival from Australia in 1886, and brought me a letter of introduction from a friend in Melbourne. I asked her whether she had brought any songs for me to hear, and she said "" Yes."" So she sang the grand aria "" Ah ! fors' e lui "" from La Traviata. I was delighted. It could not have been better sung ; the vocalisation was perfect, and she warbled her runs and shakes without any effort. When I asked her to sing something else, she pleased me very much with her rendering of my song, "" Sing, Sweet Bird,"" and she told me she had sung it a great deal in Australia and made it popular there.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

The season of 1885 had been almost wholly barren, and that of 1886 was little better. Incapacity and indifference reached their climax with the disgraceful and humiliating scene that occurred at Her Majesty's Theatre on the night of March 6, 1886. Some unknown person, evidently without experience as a manager, had there started a season of Italian opera with a company of incompetent artists. On the fourth night it completely collapsed under circumstances unprecedented in the annals of opera in a great city. I quote my own description of what occurred. </span></p>

Their claims were partly satisfied, and, after an interval of inordinate length, in the course of which the audience displayed the noisiest impatience, the opera proceeded for another act, with the accompaniment of about half the band. But the crisis had only been deferred. After the curtain had fallen again there was another long ""wait,"" and the disturbances recommenced. At length, in response to deafening calls, the stage-manager came forward and announced that it was impossible to proceed. The stage-carpenters had refused to set the next scene, and the opera could not, therefore, go on. A howl of derision and anger greeted this statement; but the audience, having made up its mind to the worst, was preparing, amid a fearful din, to depart, when the curtain rose once more and a whole army of stage assistants came down to the footlights with outstretched arms and aprons, as though to implore the charity of the house. The gestures were understood, and, with one accord, the remaining occupants of the gallery and upper tiers began flinging a shower of coppers and small silver coins down on to the stage, uttering the while all sorts of satirical and uncomplimentary epithets. However, the occupation was too expensive to last long, and in a minute or two this disgraceful episode came to a termination, ending also a night of horrors that will never be forgotten by those who witnessed it.""</span></p>",,

It was in those days a rare event for an English singer to venture upon the boards of the Anglo-Italian stage; and the force of fashion and prejudice made the venture one of unusual difficulty. But with his advantages of Italian training and style, Mr. Sims Reeves was entitled to be fairly considered as an Italian singer. He had not only a beautiful natural organ, but expression and passion were at his command, and there can be little doubt that he might have permanently justified the enthusiastic welcome of what might be termed the ""national"" portion of the audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, and might have battled successfully against prejudice, had not difficulties, created by himself, arisen, and caused his secession for the remainder of the season.</span></p>",,

The success of this great singer was necessarily triumphant; and the season, in appearance at all events, could not have commenced under happier auspices. The public is a child in many respects&mdash; in many respects, too, a spoiled child, a very spoiled child. It cried still for its favourite toy &mdash; Jenny Lind. However brilliant the new toy placed before it for its delectation and amusement, it would not take to it as, under other circumstances, it might have done.

He was received with immense enthusiasm by the largest audience which has ever been gathered together at a concert there. The programme included Handel's "" Ode on St. Cecilia's Day,"" with a miscellaneous second part. Miss Annie Marriott was the soprano, and Mr. T. Harpur the solo trumpet. Everything went exceedingly well. Sir George at the rehearsal stopped to make the drummer tune more accurately, his naturally sensitive ear for pitch being unable to put up with a mere approximation.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newbury,_Berkshire"

This was generally supposed to be his third visit to London, the previous occasions being when he came over in 1847 for the production of the opera ""I Masnadieri,"" which he wrote expressly for Her Majesty's Theatre; and again in 1862 (the Exhibition year) , when his ""Inno delle Nazioni"" was performed at the same theatre. But, according to his intimate friend, Mr. Randegger, the maestro also ran over from Paris one summer, without letting any one into the secret, for the purpose of hearing for himself what the world-famous Handel Festival was like. Mr. Eandegger has told me that his surprise was indescribable when he came across Verdi at the Crystal Palace with a score of ""Israel in Egypt"" tucked under his arm. He insisted, however, that his presence should be concealed; and he seems to have returned to Paris as mysteriously as he came...At the period of the ""Requiem"" visit there happened to be residing in London an elderly Italian musician named Deliguoro...The announcement of Verdi's coming was a great event for Deliguoro, inasmuch as the master and he had been fellow-students together at Milan, under Lavigna (1831-33). This was just after the preposterous refusal of the authorities at the Milan Conservatoire to admit Verdi as a pupil at that institution because they thought he did not display sufficient promise of talent. Deliguoro 's delight at the prospect of meeting his old friend knew no bounds. He had not seen him for quite thirty 60 Musical Life in London years. ""Giuseppe and I were like brothers. We ate, drank, and worked together the whole of the time. His harmony exercises always had more mis- takes than mine, and he could never master the art of writing a really good fugue. I wonder whether he has dared to put one into his ' Requiem'! We shall see; for I am going to write and ask him for a ticket to hear it."" In due course tickets arrived for the rehearsal and the concert, and Deliguoro showed them to me with the utmost pride. Most of the distinguished musical folk in London were present at the ""grand rehearsal""; and yet the vast auditorium, capable of holding 10,000 persons comfortably, looked comparatively deserted. I sat with Deliguoro not far from the orchestra. He was so excited that I had the utmost difficulty in restraining him from climbing over the barrier and taking Verdi in his arms there and then. Nor were my own feelings altogether calm as I gazed for the first time upon the man who had composed ""La Traviata,"" ""Rigoletto,"" and ""Aida."" He was then sixty-three years of age, and his closely cut beard was fast turning gray; but he was as ac- tive and robust as a youth, his eyes were keen and bright, and his clear, penetrating voice when he addressed the choir (in French or Italian, I forget which) could be heard all over the hall. At the end of the fugal chorus "" Sanctus Dominus,"" which my neighbor declared to be more scholarly than anything he had anticipated, Verdi came around to speak to his friends among the select audience, and ere long I could see that he was staring in an uncertain way at Deliguoro. Then all of a sudden he appeared to make up his mind, and took a ""bee-line"" over the stall chairs to the spot where we were standing. ""Tu sei Deliguoro, non &egrave; ver?"" exclaimed the maestro."" Si, si, son Deliguoro,"" replied his old friend, his eyes brimming over with tears. And then followed a close embrace that I thought would never end. It would be hard to say which of the two former classmates evinced the fuller measure of joy...Surely none who heard that magnificent performance of the Manzoni ""Requiem"" can have ever&nbsp; forgotten the combined effect of the beautiful music, the superb singing of the Albert Hall choir (trained by Barnby), the wonderful voices of the soloists, and, pervading all, the subtle magnetic influence induced by the presence and personal guidance of the composer. The solo artists included three members of the original quartet, namely: Mme. Stolz, Mme. Waldmann, and Signor Masini. All possessed noble organs; and the famous tenor, who has never been heard in opera in England, was then quite at his best. But the undoubted gem of the whole performance was the ""Agnus Dei,"" with its octave unison phrases for the two women's voices, sung by Stolz and Waldmann with a delicacy and charm of simply ethereal loveliness. Nor shall I forget the pains taken by Verdi at rehearsal to obtain from his chorus and orchestra of eight hundred a pianissimo in fitting proportion to the exquisite tone of these singers.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Albert_Hall

The Signora received me at her toilette ; where she was braiding up a profusion of fine black hair. I thought her handsome at the play the night before, but the Italian women all contrive to look well by candlelight; nature gives them good features, and they take care to give themselves good complexions. But Signora Benini wanted not "" the foreign aid of ornament ;"" her person was petite, and beautifully formed ; her features were good, and she had a pair of brilliant expressive eyes. After breakfast, she requested me to sing. I sang my favourite rondo, "" Teco resti, anima mia.""

<p>The success of this opera was never surpassed ; it was a lasting favourite for many years : the first season it was played fifty nights. The under plot was taken from an Italian intermezzo opera ; the entire scene of the Baron of Oakland reading a letter, was taken from it. Storace was greatly received in Adela, both as a singer and an actress. Bannister and Baddely were excellent in the comic parts ; Mrs. Crouch, as Lady Elinor, was in the full bloom of beauty, and the richest voice. I had two fine allotted to me, "" From Hope's fond dream,"" and "" Spirit of my sainted sire,"" one of the most difficult songs ever composed for a tenor voice ; indeed, all the music was beautiful : the admiration of the audience at the sestetto, "" By mutual love delighted,'"" I can never forget ; certainly, nothing could exceed the composition or the execution of it ; both were perfect.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

The performance was excellent in very respect &ndash; orchestrally, vocally, and scenically it was pure Kitsch and Stoll [Mahler&rsquo;s stage managers at the Vienna Opera], and again it made an extraordinary impression on me. It is an extremely clever, very powerful piece, which certainly belongs among the most significant of our time! Beneath a heap of rubbish an infernal fire lives and burns in it - not just fireworks. / That&rsquo;s the way it is with Strauss&rsquo;s whole personality and it&rsquo;s difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff.

She remembered Betterton in age, lived in intimacy with Wilks, Booth, and Gibber, and knew old Macklin when he was a stripling; her hospitality exceeded that of the English character, even in its earliest days of festivity, having almost through the whole of her life entertained from one to two thousand persons of both sexes six nights out of seven in the week ; she was an excellent poetess, could be gay and grave by turns, and yet sometimes catching disorder from intrusive guests, could be dull enough in all conscience ; her memory was excellent, and her singing kept in such a gradual state of improvement, that it was allowed, her voice was better the three or four last years of her life than when she was in her prime. At the latter end of the last century, she had a rout of near two thousand people at her house the very night of her death; and the old lady felt herself in such spirits, that she said she would give them no supper without a song, which being complied with, she fell gently back in her chair, and expired without a groan. Dr. Palmer, one of her family physicians, attended her in her last moments, and announced her dissolution to the company.""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane

The bill announced an uncommon number of choruses, and I remarked upon the fact to the chorister.</p>
<p>"" Why,"" said I, familiarly, concluding, that as I knew Hobler, Hobler must know me, ""You will have warm work, my master, with all these choruses.""</p>
<p>"" Not I,"" said the singer; "" the more choruses there are, the better I am pleased ; I never tire of them.""</p>
<p>"" Why,"" said I, "" that is strange, too, considering how much you have had of them in your time.""</p>
<p>""Not at all, I assure you,"" said Hobler ; ""I have for many years regularly attended the ancient concerts and music meetings, I have never had too much of Handel's choruses yet.""</p>
<p>""Egad,"" said I, ""you are quite a <em>fanatico per la music&agrave;</em>. And pray, now, to which of Handel's choruses do you give the preference?""</p>
<p>""Why, my dear Mr. Kelly,"" said Hobler, I cannot decide ; but I candidly tell you what Cicero said, when he was asked which of the orations of Demosthenes he liked the best, he answered the longest ; so say I of Handel's choruses.""</p>

I called the next morning, and saw the gentleman, who said his name was Botterelli, that he was the Italian poet of the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, and that his wife was an English woman, and a principal singer at Vauxhall, Ranelagh, the Pantheon, &amp;c. Her object in visiting Vienna was to give a concert, to be heard by the Emperor ; and if she gave that satisfaction, (which she had no doubt she would), to accept of an engagement at the Royal Theatre ; and he added, that she had letters for the first nobility in Vienna...Every thing was done for her ; the orchestra and singers were engaged ; the concert began to a crowded house, but, I must premise, we had no rehearsal. At the end of the first act, the beauteous Syren, led into the orchestra by her caro sposo, placed herself just under the Emperor's box, the orchestra being on the stage. She requested me to accompany her song on the piano-forte. I of course consented. Her air and manner spoke "" dignity and love."" The audience sat in mute and breathless expectation. The doubt was, whether she would melt into their ears in a fine cantabile, or burst upon them with a brilliant bravura. I struck the chords of the symphony silence reigned when, to the dismay and astonishment of the brilliant audience, she bawled out, without feeling or remorse, voice or time, or indeed one note in tune, the hunting song of "" Tally ho !"" in all its pure originality. She continued shrieking out Tally ho ! tally ho ! in a manner and tone so loud and dissonant, that they were enough to blow off the roof of the house. The audience jumped up terrified; some shrieked with alarm, some hissed, others hooted, and many joined in the unknown yell, in order to propitiate her. The Emperor called me to him, and asked me in Italian (what tally ho ! meant?) I replied, I did not know ; and literally, at that time, I did not. His Majesty, the Emperor, finding that even I a native of Great Britain, either could not, or would not, explain the purport of the mysterious words, retired with great indignation from the theatre ; and the major part of the audience, convinced by His Majesty's sudden retreat that they contained some horrible meaning, followed the Royal example. The ladies hid their faces with their fans, and mothers were heard in the lobbies cautioning their daughters on the way out, never to repeat the dreadful expression of "" tally ho,"" nor venture to ask any of their friends for a translation of it.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna

All the little bands from the surrounding country come to town to reap a little something during the harvest time. These bands are from four to eight or ten, perhaps, in number, and are variously composed as to instruments. Some of brass, some of strings, and some curiously mixed; as a horn, a clarionet, a violin, and a bassoon; or a double-bass, oboe, flute, and trumpet, &amp;c. As early as six o&rsquo;clock in the morning they are out, and are seen and heard playing in passage-ways, entrances to hotels, or wherever many people may be supposed to be within hearing; depending for remuneration upon the voluntary contributions of those to whose edification they play. They are almost all of them apparently very poor, and are contented with small gains; indeed, one would suppose that even without &ldquo;food and raiment&rdquo; they are content. They seem to enjoy it right well, and to take it for granted that others will like their music as well as they do themselves. Many females are seen with a very ordinary kind of harp in their hands; these unite into bands, and three or four are seen performing in chorus.

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1424694826250,https://archive.org/details/lettersofcompose00norm,"<p>Today I am writing to you in a state of inexpressible stupefaction! The reason is Brahms&rsquo;s Second Symphony in D. I read it through yesterday morning and I heard it the same day at the Concert Populaire. And this is the man whom some rank above, and others beside, Schumann! Schumann, the great poet, powerful, inspired, whose every note is individual &ndash; and the author of the Second Symphony in D &ndash; it&rsquo;s absolutely grotesque. / Brahms is a second-rate mind. He has dug up every corner in modern harmony and counterpoint - that&rsquo;s his only importance. He is not a born musician, his invention is always insignificant or derivative, and in his latest symphony the pastiche is especially flagrant. I have carefully kept up with all his chamber music; it holds together well because it is based on solid study, but his invention is hesitant, and one senses a man who is searching right and left for what he does not find in himself; further, under the pretext of increasing the sonority, there is an intolerable abuse of unison (Beethoven understood harmony well enough to appreciate the unison, but with his gift for sonority he did not need this ridiculous method). / Finally came the Piano Quintet. In the ensemble of this work there is an outburst that made me hope that the composer had at last found himself. Alas, the works that followed, always strongly steeped in laboured research, are absolutely insignificant as to invention. Since these last chamber-music compositions I have seen nothing by this man, and before yesterday&rsquo;s concert I had never heard his orchestral works. / Perhaps you will tell me that Pasdeloup&rsquo;s performance is not good. Maybe so, but it is the same for everyone, and Pasdeloup has worked very hard on this symphony, which, as a matter of fact, is not difficult. Now, at the same concert they played Mozart&rsquo;s G-minor Symphony, which seems like a dwarf when placed next to an orchestral page by Beethoven. Beside the Brahms symphony it seemed like a colossus. The first and last movements show paltry and old-fashioned invention and they are full of parches of Mendelssohn and Beethoven in all the themes serving as basis for development. The Andante is in contrast to these two puerile movements, but it is no less boring; it gives me the impression of some one who puts on air of terrible and profound conviction to keep repeating sentences like the following in a cavernous voice: &ldquo;The flash of this sabre is the most beautiful light of my life! The chariot of stage navigates on a volcano!&rdquo; The Scherzo is a nice little genre piece. / As for Brahms&rsquo;s instrumentation &ndash; I am completely dumbfounded. He understands nothing about selecting timbres; he orchestrates like a pianist, and if one of us had written such mediocre orchestration, the rest of us would say: &ldquo;My dear fellow, you have possibilities but hurry back to the schoolroom.&rdquo; / To sum up, the quintet, which I thought would be the point of departure of a vigorous old boy who, finally coming into his full power, was going to give us a series of remarkable works, is, on the contrary, the apogee of a composer who had done nothing but stumble around, and his latest symphony is below the level of his weakest quartet. / A stupid scene occurred at this concert; people whistled and hissed; these were the same idiots who had just encored an absurd guitar piece by Taubert. Well, I applauded as hard as I could, only because extremes attract extremes, and I think it monstrous for imbeciles to whistle at an artist whose value I dispute because his partisan overrate him, but who nevertheless, has an incontestable values. As for his symphony, I tell you again, it deserves neither applause nor catcalls. The same evening I saw Saint-Sa&euml;ns; his opinion of the symphony is the same as mine. / This is a very long letter, but it will show you what regard the musicians on the other side of the Rhine had for Brahms and his reputation since all of them went out of their way to admire the mountain that had been promised them; it isn&rsquo;t their fault if the mountain gave birth to only a mouse.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/%C3%89douard_Lalo,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

Again he had the misfortune to be hampered by one of Dr. Hueffer's elephantine librettos. Hence &ldquo;The Troubadour&rdquo; with its ghastly climax, wherein the erring heroine is compelled by her husband to drink a goblet filled with the blood of the fascinating Guillem de Cabestanh, proved too much for even those who admired the melodic charm and dramatic power of the music.

It was performed for the first time in Paris at a concert I organized and managed at a time when Liszt's works were distrusted. Along with the Dante symphony we had the Andante (Gretchen) 123 from the Faust symphony, the symphonic poem <em>Fest Kloenge</em>, a charming work which is never played now, and still other works. It would be hard to imagine all the opposition I had to overcome in giving that concert. There was the hostility of the public, the ill-will of the Theatre Italien which rented me its famous hall but which sullenly opposed a proper announcement of the concert, the insubordination of the orchestra, the demands of the singers for more pay they imagined that Liszt would pay the expenses and, finally, complete and expected failure. My only object was to lay a foundation for the future, nothing more. In spite of everything I managed to get a creditable performance of the Dante symphony and I had the pleasure of hearing it for the first time.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camille_Saint-Sa%C3%ABns,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paris

At that theatre was introduced to the public, for the first time, the musical romance, called "" The Prisoner,"" written by the Rev. Mr. Rose, one of the masters of the Charter House. It was a piece of much interest ; the principal scene (and a most effective one it was) I saw at Paris, and gave it to the author, who with a great deal of ingenuity, in grafted it on his own drama. It was that where the prisoner escapes by the aid of the gaoler's children. Chenard, the French actor's performance of the gaoler, was very fine acting ; and it is but justice to say, that Wewitzer's representation of the same character in its English garb, suffered nothing by comparison. The music by Attwood was very pleasing.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Mr. Havergal rector. The exercises commenced by a few measures as a voluntary, or rather prelude, and the &ldquo;giving out&rdquo; the tune on the organ, after which all the congregation united in a single stanza sung to the old tune called &ldquo;Tallis&rsquo;s Evening Hymn.&rdquo; The hymn was not read nor named, but it appeared to be a common thing for the worship to commence in the use of a stanza well known, always the same, and to the same tune. It was a hearty commencement, for every one seemed to join with full voice. The service was read by the curate. The chanting was done by the whole congregation, and the responding was between the occupants of the lower floor and those of the gallery &mdash; but the song was universal &mdash; men, women and children uniting harmonious voices. The Venite and the Te Deum were chanted responsively; the psalms were not chanted but, read in the usual manner. Two metrical hymns were sung during the service. The tunes were both of the old ecclesiastical class, and were in the same rhythmic form as St. Ann&rsquo;s, York, &amp;c. appear in the Cantica Laudis. The first and last words of each line being long, and all the rest short. They were sung by all the people, and in very quick time; as fast as propriety would allow the enunciation of the words. They were sung somewhat quicker than the writer has taught this class of tunes in musical conventions and singing classes in America. Let the tune Uxbridge, for example, be sung in quick time, somewhat quicker than usual, and the crotchets will give the time of the minims in the above-named class of tunes. There were one or two organ interludes introduced in a psalm of five stanzas; but these were very short, not more than about two measures, or the length of the last line of a common metre tune. &ldquo;These tunes would be popular in America,&rdquo; said the lady who was with me, who, though not a singer, has been accustomed for many years to give close attention to the Psalmody, and to hear criticisms and remarks concerning it. And indeed, they are as far from being dull and heavy as need be; I doubt not that many good people, with us, would think it almost irreverent to sing a hymn through with such rapidity. Yet all the people, old and young, joined &mdash; all seemed to know the tunes perfectly, and all kept well together.</p>",,

This school is large, and employs about fifteen teachers. Provision is made for the gratuitous education, and I believe support, of sixty pupils; and these charity pupils are the musical boys whence the choir is sustained. They are regularly taught music, and are required to sing on the Sabbath, on Saturday at o&rsquo;clock, and at funerals. On Saturday regularly at the hour mentioned, there is a short service, and the choir commence it by singing one or two motettes, without accompaniment. The same choir, with orchestra, alternate between the St. Thomas and the St. Nicholas Church; and the same motette is sung in one church which was sung in the other the previous Sabbath.</p>",,

I picked him up one night on leaving the Albert Hall, after conducting a concert. He drove me home. I had alighted in Dean's Yard, and was searching in my pocket for the fare, when suddenly he exclaimed, ""Well, Sir Frederick, how did the concert go off?"" I was rather taken aback by this unexpected query, and for a moment hardly knew what to reply. In point of fact, the particular concert was one of a special character. We had given a selection of Wagner, including ""The Last Supper,"" a very difficult work which had not been done in London for, I think, some twenty-five years indeed, very few choral societies had been able to tackle it. Pulling myself together, I said to the expectant cabby, ""Oh, I think pretty fair."" My friend at once replied, ""Well,for myself I don't understand Wagner [pronouncing it in familiar English], he is too abstruse and athematical for me."" This amused me very much, and after a little more conversation I said, ""Well, you know who I am. If you like to look out for me I shall be glad to employ you to take me to and from the rehearsals."" He thanked me, and said he would not forget. True to his word he turned up on the next occasion of a rehearsal. Afterwards I employed him often. He constantly came to the rehearsals, and also to the concerts, and on not a few occasions honoured me by adversely criticising my conducting. For example, he said, after a performance of ""Messiah,"" ""It was very good, Sir Frederick, very good : but what makes you take the 'Hallelujah Chorus' so fast?"" ""Fast,"" said I, ""I didn't take it fast."" ""Oh, yes, you did,"" he observed, shaking his head, adding, as he drove off, ""It may gain in brilliancy by your method, but it loses in majesty. Good-night!""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

He had established a fine orchestral and choral force, and gave concerts of first-class importance every week at Manchester and in many of the great Northern towns. He was an excellent conductor, without any tricks or oddities. As a conductor of choral music he was just as successful as with the orchestra, which is not always the case. He did not train the choir, that being done for him by a chorus-master of splendid energy and resource, Charles Hecht. The choir worshipped Hall&eacute;, the Lancashire lads and lasses coming entirely under his sway. I think he was never nonplussed but once. This was during one of the many performances of Berlioz's ""Faust"" (a work that Hall&eacute; had really restored to life, at least in England). In the well known Serenade for Mephistopheles there is a dramatic and dangerous part for the choir, who have to come in with a sudden satirical ""Ha !"" in the course of the song. An enthusiastic tenor in the choir was always very alert and on the spot to those who watched him, as I often did. But on this occasion he was a little too alert, and just a moment before the whole choir should enter, he came in alone with a loud nasal ""Ha !"" The effect was fearful, the choir could hardly go on, the audience were convulsed, and Hall&eacute; well he would have killed the man, I am sure, if he could, and he tried to do so with his eye. I never saw that tenor again, some say he emigrated.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester

At that time I share this admiration whole-heartedly, fascinated by the astonishing mastery of this scholar.

I was half amused, half annoyed by this unexpected communication, which, of course, I knew <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>better than to regard as inspired by my guest of <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>honor himself. It was also entirely superfluous, as <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>I always made it a strict rule never to request an <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>artist to perform in my house who did not come <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>there for that purpose or with that expressed intention.

I assured him seriously <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>that I had not had the slightest idea of asking him <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>to play, and that my friends were more than satisfied to have the pleasure of meeting him and enjoying his society.

Spencer to the Rev. Mr. Brock's (Baptist) congregation. Mr. Spencer is well known as a warm friend of old psalmody, and especially by his ""Explanation of the Church Modes."" His manner of chanting is good, quite a different thing from that of the Cathedral choirs. The words&nbsp;are delivered about as fast as in speech, and time in the cadences is almost wholly disregarded. His beau ideal seems to require the absence of all regular division of time, or all that which we commonly call measured rhythmic effect. He is favorable to the unisonous singing of the old church tunes, and the congregation tried some of them under his direction with good results.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

It is recorded of the veteran statesman that in his eighty-fifth year, in the course of an address to twenty thousand people gathered under the walls of Hawarden Castle, he uttered these words: ""Music is of enormous advantage both to those who hear and those who perform it. It is a great blessing to the people, and I think that there are few satisfactions in my mind greater than to witness the progress it has made in the course of the last fifty years."" Of Mr. Gladstone's personal attainments in music, it is said that he used to play the violoncello and possessed a charming tenor voice. Judging only from his speaking voice, one can easily believe this to be true. It is interesting to recall that in the midst of the long and patiently borne sufferings of his last illness, he found a solace in consoling music. His special interest in Church music is well known. For the funeral service the choir of the Abbey was augmented by those of the Chapel Royal, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Temple Church, and St. Margaret's, Westminster. The music performed on this occasion comprised among other numbers a Funeral-Equale for four trombones, by Beethoven, Schubert's March in B minor, the Dead March in ""Saul,"" Beethoven's March in A fiat minor, Service music by Croft and by Purcell, and hymns. The Right Hon. Herbert Gladstone (now Lord Gladstone) sent me the following letter shortly after the funeral, which I am gratified in being able to append: Hawarden, May 30//J, 1898. DEAR SIR FREDERICK BRIDGE, Accept our gratitude for the most beautiful music you gave us last Saturday at the Abbey. Nothing could have been more solemn and sustaining, and we shall carry the recollection of it all our lives. We could wish to thank all who contributed to it, but that is beyond our power, though perhaps in some quarters you may be able and kind enough to make it known what we feel. very sincerely yours, HERBERT J. GLADSTONE.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

In the earlier year I heard for the first time Anton Rubinstein and Pablo Sarasate, and witnessed the debuts of Etelka Grerster and Gayarre. With the exception of a brief visit in 1876, Rubinstein had not been in London for seven or eight years. I now heard him at the Philharmonic, at the Crystal Palace (where I saw him conduct&mdash; with all the &ldquo;extra"" movements included&mdash; his grandiose but interminable &ldquo;Ocean&rdquo; symphony), and at some recitals at St. James's Hall. He was then in his forty-eighth year, and had attained the fullest measure of his extraordinary powers.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Crystal_Palace

The change was not greatly to be regretted, for the popularity of Gardoni aided him, and he sang his best. On the morrow, there appeared in all the principal daily prints a long letter from Mr. Sims Beeves, protesting against the interpretation given to his refusal, and asserting that he had only accepted an engagement at Her Majesty's Theatre on the express stipulation that he should be cast for the part of Edgardo in the ""Lucia,"" and other principal tenor parts; and that finding he was not to sing in a forthcoming representation of the first named opera, he considered his contract annulled, and himself at liberty to withdraw. To this communication a firm denial was given in another letter from Mr. Balfe, the conductor, in which that gentleman affirmed that no such stipulation had ever been made &mdash; an affirmation he was able to maintain, inasmuch as he himself had signed the contract made with Mr. Reeves; and that moreover the coveted part could not have been promised to him, it having been in the possession of Signor Gardoni six weeks before the engagement of the English vocalist.</span></p>",,

True, this was the work of an Englishman; but it was composed to a French libretto and performed by French artists, and it owed its hearing exclusively to foreign influence. Its success, despite the glamour of its picturesque Roman setting, and notwithstanding the art of Heglon, Alvarez, and Renaud, must perforce be described as equivocal. The story at best is revolting; and the music combines with a few fine moments many dull quarts d'heure.</span></pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Covent_Garden

He quickly made his mark as an operatic composer, and <br />successfully competed with Michael Balfe and Vincent Wallace in the race for <br />fame. Like them, he wrote and produced many operas; like them, he left only one <br />that really promises to survive. Indeed, Benedict's ""Lily of Killarney"" is the <br />sole English opera of the so-called ""ballad"" type that still shares popularity <br />with ""The Bohemian Girl"" and ""Maritana."" Although such a mediocre conductor, he <br />was an admirable accompanist. He had studied under Hummel at Weimar before going <br />to Weber, and was a quite capable pianist. His reputation in this capacity was <br />not a little enhanced by his association with Jenny Lind on her memorable tour <br />in the United States (1850-52). At any rate, after his return to London his <br />services ""at the piano"" were in request at every kind of musical function, and <br />he was practically the sole accompanist employed at the Monday Popular Concerts 
during the first twenty years of their existence. </pre>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

The opera had been judged superannuated and had been ""improved."" A young composer had written a new score in which he inserted here and there such bits of Gluck as he thought worthy of being preserved. A costly and magnificently imbecile luxuriousness set off the whole piece. I may be pardoned the cruel adjective when I say that in the scene of Hate, so deeply inspired, and which takes place in a sort of cave, they relegated the chorus to the wings to make a place for dragons, fantastic birds beating their wings, and other deviltries. This, of course, deprived the chorus of all its power and distinction.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camille_Saint-Sa%C3%ABns,

The shout of joy uttered by the students when he sat down at the piano was something to remember. It was followed by an intense silence. Then the aged but still nimble fingers ran lightly over the keys, and I was listening for the first time in my life to Franz Liszt. To attempt to describe his playing, after the many well-known Weimar pupils and distinguished writers who have tried to accomplish that task, would be mere presumption on my part. Even at seventy-five, Liszt was a pianist whose powers lay beyond the pale to which sober language or calm criticism could reach or be applied. Enough that his greatest charm seemed to me to lie in a perfectly divine touch, and in a tone more remarkable for its exquisitely musical quality than for its volume or dynamic force, aided by a technique still incomparably brilliant and superb.</p>",,

There were five of these societies, each of which sang two songs. The performances were generally better than those of the third class (which sang on the first day), and more equal; but yet it was not difficult to decide which society in this second class would take the first prize.</p>",,

http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1437557057765,https://archive.org/stream/reminiscencesofm02kellrich,"<p>The 23rd January, 1813, Mr. Coleridge produced, at Drury Lane, his tragedy entitled ""Remorse."" There were some musical situations in the play which I had to compose. The poetry of the incantation was highly animating; it was sung by Mrs. Bland, with all the refreshing purity of her unsophisticated style, and with that chaste expression and tenderness of feeling which speak at once as it were to the heart. The chorus of boatmen chaunting on the water under the convent walls, and the distant peal of the organ, accompanying the monks while singing within the convent chapel, seemed to overcome and soothe the audience; thrilling sensation appeared to pervade the great mass of congregated humanity, and, during its performance, it was listened to with undivided attention, as if the minds and hearts of all were rivetted and enthralled by the combination presented to their notice; and at the conclusion the applause was loud and protracted.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to hear, from the highly-talented author of the play, that my music was every thing he could have wished. I felt this as a high compliment from Mr. Coleridge; for I understood, when he was in Sicily, and other parts of Italy, he had this ""Miserere, Domine"" set to music by different Italian composers, none of whom satisfied him by giving his poetry the musical expression which he desired.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drury_Lane
http://data.open.ac.uk/led/lexp/1461670558474,https://archive.org/details/musicallettersf00unkngoog,"<p>In the evening we went to the ""Zion-street Chapel,&rdquo; Walworth. This is a Baptist chapel; the pastor was absent, and a young man, a student, filled his place. As a matter to be expected in such a case, there seemed to be some attempt at eloquence; we almost invariably see it in a young man, and especially in a student. It is often somewhat trying to listen to the sermons of the theological students, and so it was on this occasion. The hymns were given out by the Precentor, who read them badly enough, applying the same accent, or general inflection, to each stanza. Perhaps the following may convey some idea of his manner of reading:&mdash; Let the first line be commenced on a high pitch, and let the pitch rise by a slide gradually until a climax very high is obtained by a strong pressure tone and upward slide or inflection on the last syllable but two; then a sudden slide down, still on the same syllable, followed by still another upward on the last syllable, and this to be exactly the same in form, though differing a little in force in every couplet, or twice in each stanza:</p>
<p>How sweet the name of Jesus sounds&nbsp;<br />In a believer&rsquo;s ear;<br />It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,<br />And drives away his fear.</p>
<p>We have seldom heard a hymn read in a more mechanical sing-song manner, or in worse taste. There was no choir, and the congregation generally joined in the singing. The people were all seated in prayer, and all stood in singing. They all took their seats merely for the benediction after the last singing. People in our own country are very much troubled that the custom of sitting in prayer should be increasing so much; but it seems to prevail in a majority of the churches here.</p>",,

Unfortunately, he was taken ill, so could not go, and his son came in his stead and we went together to the concert, which took place in the Salle du Conservatoire. It was conducted by M. Taffanel, and was a wonderful performance. The orchestra is celebrated all over Europe, and I must say I never heard a finer performance of Beethoven's<em> Eroica</em>.

The great masterpiece of Mozart without the essential accessories of scenery and action, without the illustrative resources which the composer himself contemplated, was simply rendered dreary and incomprehensible. Where was the well-known ""Jenny Lind"" crush? The house was comparatively empty. Where was the customary enthusiasm amounting to a mania? The applause was cold and feeble. The singer, who had been accustomed to hear those same walls ring with plaudits, could not but feel chilled at the faint and rare echoes of that night, so different from the noisy demonstrations of the previous year. The ""Flauto Magico"" was accordingly the first and last of these disappointing ""grand classical performances,"" permission for which had been with so much difficulty wrung from Mademoiselle Lind.</span></p>",,

I myself occasionally heard him play in such a fashion, and whenever I hear this Fantasia such moments involuntarily recur to my mind.</p>",,

It was attended by an enormous congregation, and was indeed a very solemn and impressive occasion. I selected the music to be performed, and think it will be conceded that it furnisheda programme of deep significance. We played five funeral marches, viz., Schubert's ""Marche Solennelle,"" Purcell's March composed for the funeral of Queen Mary in 1694, and Marches by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Mendelssohn, the last named the E minor, from ""Songs without Words."" The Tchaikovsky number, in C minor, was accompanied by organ only; but in the other items the organ was supplemented by brass and drums. The service commenced with the penitential verses of Psalm 51, as set by Sir John Stainer. These were sung in procession, by priest and choir alternately. An instrumental interlude followed, viz., Beethoven's "" Trois equals"" for four trombones, which, played in the Triforium, had a magnificent effect. Handel's fine anthem, ""The ways of Zion do mourn,"" and Goss's ""The souls of the righteous,"" which I had specially arranged for this service, were sung. The hymn, "" O God, our help in ages past,"" sung very slowly by choir and congregation (except verses five and six, which were sung very softly by choir alone), provided an inspiring moment. Gibbons' Amen the same that had been rendered at King Edward's Coronation completed the service, and I played the Dead March in ""Saul,"" accompanied by brass and drums. Chopin's ""Marche Funebre,"" played by Dr. Alcock, also accompanied by brass and drums, formed an exalted close.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

I had some good songs in it, and was in high spirits. As it was the custom for the ladies, the first night of the opera, to go in grand gala, the boxes and parterre were a perfect blaze of diamonds, and every part of the house was crowded.

On Thursday, July 2nd, ""I Masnadieri "" (after wearying rehearsals, conducted by the composer himself), was brought out, with a cast that included Lablache, Gardoni, Coletti, Bouche, and, above all, Jenny Lind, who was to appear for the second time only in her career, in a thoroughly original part composed expressly for her. The house was filled to overflowing on the night of the first representation. The opera was given with every appearance of a triumphant success: the composer and all the singers receiving the highest honours. Indeed, all the artists distinguished themselves in their several parts. Jenny Lind acted admirably, and sang the airs allotted to her exquisitely. But yet the ""Masnadieri"" could not be considered a success. That by its production I had adopted the right course was unquestionable. I had induced an Italian composer, whose reputation stood on the highest pinnacle of continental fame, to compose an opera expressly for my theatre, as well as to superintend its production. More I could not have done to gratify the patrons of Italian music, who desired to hear new works. It may be stated, in confirmation of the judgment of the London audience, that ""I Masnadieri"" was never successful on any Italian stage. The libretto was even worse constructed than is usually the case with adaptations of foreign dramas to the purpose of Italian opera. To Her Majesty's Theatre the work was singularly ill-suited. The interest which ought to have been centred in Mademoiselle Lind was centred in Gardoni; whilst Lablache, as the imprisoned father, had to do about the only thing he could not do to perfection &mdash; having to represent a man nearly starved to death.</span></p>",,

Yesterday I dined at Mrs. Percival's, and in the afternoon Phil and I went to the oratorio at Lincoln's Inn, composed by Porpora, an Italian, famous for church music, who is now in England : it is a fine solemn piece of music, but I confess I think the subject too solemn for a theatre. To have words of piety made use of only to introduce good music, is reversing what it ought to be, and most of the people that hear the oratorio make no reflection on the meaning of the words, though God is addressed in the most solemn manner; some of the choruses and recitative are extremely fine and touching, but they say it is not equal to Mr. Handel's oratorio of Esther or Deborah.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mary_Delany,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Again the same triumph &mdash; the same enthusiasm! That inexpressible charm which pervaded almost all the impersonations of the gifted songstress, gave a new stamp to the character of the village coquette. Of the singing of the part it would be needless to speak further. ""Such an Adina we have never beheld,"" was the judgment of the day &mdash; Gardoni, Beletti, and Lablache, all heard and seen to signal advantage, gave the crowning colour of excellence to the rendering of Donizetti's charming opera buffa.</span></p>",,

They were cold and cheerless and weary of the voyage, though only two days out, and a lady had come down to talk and sing to them. The subject was "" Stepping over the line,"" and the song was "" Safe in the arms of Jesus."" She told the story of a young sailor, who was summoned to his mother's death-bed. "" Willie,"" said the mother, looking up at him with tearful eyes, "" sing to me once more ' Safe in the arms of Jesus.' "" "" Mother,"" he replied, "" I can't sing that song. It would be a lie ; I am not safe, and I can't sing a lie.""</p>",,

She appeared on the 28th of March, in ""Linda di Chamouni,"" and with her now habitual success. The representation offered no novelty, beyond the debut of Mademoiselle Gaetanina Brambilla, a pleasant young contralto, in the part of Pierotto. Though bearing the same name, she was no relation, it was stated, of the more celebrated Marietta Brambula; nor, although in many respects a clever and agreeable singer, did she threaten to rival her fame. Later, however, she made her way in Italy, and was esteemed an excellent Azucena.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

I once heard him in opera, but he was then nearly sixty, and had long abandoned his stage career. I first heard him sing at the Norwich Festival of 1866, when he took part in Costa's oratorio &ldquo;Naaman&rdquo;. His voice was then still in its prime. A more exquisite illustration of what is termed the true Italian tenor quality it would be impossible to imagine; and this delicious sweetness, this rare combination of &ldquo;velvety&rdquo; richness with ringing timbre, he retained in diminishing volume almost to the last.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich

He lived in a house overlooking some public gardens not far from the royal palace, and on the way thither Harris confided to me for the first time that he was not quite sure whether he ought to have engaged the man we were then going to see, or his brother, Marino Mancinelli, who was the conductor at the Lisbon Opera-house, and, according to some people, the more gifted of the two. On this point I was happily able to reassure my friend. I had not seen both brothers ; but, when at Bologna in 1879, I had seen Luigi Mancinelli direct at the Teatro Comunale a remarkably fine performance of Gounod's &ldquo;Faust"" (with a Covent Garden soprano. Mlle. Turolla, as Margherita), and I had considered him a chef-d^orchestre of the first order. Harris was able quickly to confirm this opinion for himself by means of a representation of the selfsame work at the Royal Opera-house. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span><span style=""font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;""><span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",,

It had been known for some time that Theresa Tietjens was suffering from cancer; and, after much hesitation, the doctors decided to perform an operation before the end of May. &ldquo;Lucrezia"" was announced for the 19th, and among the prima donna's friends it was pretty well understood that this would be her last appearance before the operation was performed. </span></p>

It was distinctly against her medical advisers' wish that she insisted upon keeping faith with her manager and the public&mdash; a practice that she had persistently adhered to throughout her career. How she contrived to get through the opera I shall never understand. It can only be compared to some splendid example of martyrdom. She fainted after each of the acts, but immediately on recovering consciousness decided to proceed with the performance. Never so much as a look or gesture betrayed to her audience the mortal anguish she was suffering. Only the initiated knew how much of reality there was in the terrible scream of agony uttered by Lucrezia in the final scene&mdash;when she perceives that her son is dead. As it rang through the house the audience shuddered. Yet the brave artist would not shirk her fall at the end. What it cost her could be guessed, however, from the fact that after the curtain had been twice raised in response to rapturous plaudits, she still lay motionless upon the ground. She had once more become insensible. </span></p>

Of course we all smiled when the opening theme of the finale suggested that unmistakable resemblance to the corresponding subject in the last movement of Beethoven's &ldquo;Ninth&rdquo;, which Brahms always protested he could not perceive.

In the earlier year I heard for the first time Anton Rubinstein and Pablo Sarasate, and witnessed the debuts of Etelka Gerster and Gayarre. With the exception of a brief visit in 1876, Rubinstein had not been in London for seven or eight years. I now heard him at the Philharmonic, at the Crystal Palace (where I saw him conduct with all the ""extra"" movements included his grandiose but interminable ""Ocean"" symphony), and at some recitals at St. James's Hall. He was then in his forty-eighth year, and had attained the fullest measure of his extraordinary powers. Universally acknowledged to be the greatest pianist of his time, the public simply worshiped Rubinstein as an artist and gathered in crowds whenever he appeared. His technique bordered upon the miraculous; his interpretative gifts were worthy of a musician who was himself no mean creative genius; his style, the reflex, as it were, of his massive leonine aspect, was at once the most noble and most original of any pianist I have ever listened to. The fire and passion in his soul poured out at his fingers' ends; and yet his touch could be as gentle and caressing as a woman's. In private life his chief amusement was a game of whist. He loved the game and played it well as I discovered for myself one evening when I visited him at the old Hotel Dieudonne, in St. James's. Quite a number of friends dropped in after dinner, but Rubin- stein simply ignored their presence until he had finished his rubber. Then he went round and warmly welcomed them. After a time he sat down to the piano, and never left it till midnight, giving us a treat that will never fade from my memory as long as I live.</p>",,"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crystal_Palace,_London"

The public showed comparatively little interest in these fine concerts. At one of them Herr von Possart, the well-known director of the Hoftheater in Munich, who was also a most distinguished actor, appeared and declaimed Tennyson's ""Enoch Arden,"" giving this fine poem in German and from memory, whilst Strauss played the incidental music, which he had composed on the piano. There was, unfortunately, only a very small audience, but it was a most appreciative one, and cheered both artists to the echo. Neither of them was at all well known in England at that period. I paid them both a visit in the artists' room, as I knew them personally. They seemed quite satisfied, and did not mind having performed to an empty hall.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

We have seen attempts to introduce, for example, some of John Sebastian Bach's harmony parts into congregations. Now, it is well known that Bach did not write harmony parts for Congregational singing, but for choir singing. In his church, the St. Thomas', Leipzig, all the people sing the melody, and the parts&nbsp;are sung (when sung at all) by the choir. Of course. Bach wrote such difficult harmonies as none but a choir, and a pro[f]essional choir too, can sing well. Yet editors not knowing these circumstances have introduced these difficult harmonies into tune books designed for Congregational use. Congregations might as well undertake to sing Beethoven's Mass No. 2, as these chorals, with all sorts of complicated and difficult harmony parts. Oh that two things in relation to psalmody might be understood! 1st. That Congregational singing cannot be good unless the tunes are very plain and easy; and 2d. That there are plenty of such plain and easy tunes which possess true musical excellence, and which are in all respects suited to the wants of a worshipping assembly.&nbsp;</p>",,

He lived at Tavistock House, with Captain and Mrs. Weldon, where Charles Dickens once resided, near Euston Square. Georgina Weldon used to receive her friends, including a number of distinguished artists, on Sunday afternoons, and on those occasions Gounod used to accompany her in some of his newest songs, many of which he had dedicated to her. She had a lovely high soprano voice, and was, in those days, a great beauty. She used to call Gounod ""Papa."" Gounod also sang his own songs, such as ""Maid of Athens,"" with perfect charm. He had only a small voice, but he sang exquisitely, every word being distinctly heard, and of course he played his own accompaniments to perfection.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

I at once accepted this generous offer, but, unfortunately, Mr. Sims Reeves failed me at two of the concerts, sending word that he was not well. However, he sang at the third, being the last of the series, in 1880. I had announced him in the usual way in all the advertisements, when he again called off. On the SIMS REEVES 143 day before the concert, however, he sent word that he felt better and would sing. I immediately rushed off to the newspaper offices to get his name inserted in the next morning's advertisements; but it was rather a late announcement to make, and the public did not come forward in the same way as if they had had a longer notice. There was also a dreadful thunderstorm before the concert began, and I was in doubt whether Reeves would venture to come all the way from Upper Norwood in such fearful weather. However, he did turn up and sang the following items most beautifully: ""If with all your Hearts"" from <em>Elijah</em>, and ""Adelaide"" by Beethoven, in which I accompanied him. No one ever sang this beautiful aria which he sang in Italian better than he, or with more intense feeling.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

It was, alike mentally and physically, an extraordinary tour de force. No one save Rubinstein would have attempted the Herculean feat involved in the execution of such programmes. What must the task have been for the executant, if the bare labor of listening was an exhausting process! But Rubinstein was a giant, and the considerations that applied to ordinary pianists did not arise in his case. These recitals yielded the largest sum ever taken at St. James's Hall for a series of seven concerts, the gross receipts amounting to &pound;6000 ($30,000).

Dr. Saint-Saens won much applause by his performance of his Fantasia for Pianoforte, ""Africa,"" accompanied by the orchestra, and concluded the programme by conducting a brilliant interpretation of Berlioz's ""Marche Hongroise.""

I remember being present at the first concert which he conducted here : it was at the Queen's Hall one evening in December 1897. From the outset there was no mistake about his gifts as a conductor. He had the lights lowered in the hall when he began Mozart's "" Eine kleine Nachtmusik,"" and it was a real pleasure to note the sympathy he showed for the music and the beautiful balance and phrasing of the orchestra. There was immense Schwung, as the Germans say, about the performance of his fine tone-poem, "" Tod und Verklarung "" ; everything was made beautifully clear and understandable. It was apparent that another great figure had arisen in the musical world.

The Episcopal Church service is used, as it is in most of the Wesleyan congregations. The psalms were read by the minister, and intoned by the Precentor and others of the congregation, making a disagreeable mixture of&nbsp;speech and song. It was so likewise with other parts of the service, as the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. Four metrical hymns were sung, mostly to wretched tunes, and in a wretched manner. A small choir of boys surrounded the Precentor, but there was no organ. Next to me sat a young man who seemed to try and do his best, and the poor fellow would have done pretty well had the tunes been adapted to the circumstances;&nbsp;but when they went up as high as F or G, alas for him! He made the attempt indeed, which is better than not to try at all, but he fell; the leap was beyond his power. He tried to take the high parts of the tune an octave lower than the proper pitch, but in these attempts he often turned somersets, though he did&nbsp;not always come down upon his feet. It was really pitiable to stand by him and witness his efforts; but yet the easier parts of the tune he would get right. From this example, we obtained sufficient proof of what Congregational tunes ought to be: simple and easy, so that they may be within the reach of all. St. Ann, Phuvah, Tallis, are good examples, (Cantica Laudis, p. 307.) Yet they need not all be of this rhythmic character; Olmutz, Hamburg, Marlow, are always good. Had one of these tunes been sung at the Wesleyan Chapel, the young man would have been saved from many falls and bruises.&nbsp;</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

Indeed, it may be fairly assumed that, had not Jenny Lind so completely absorbed the public mind and thus rendered any rivalry in public estimation almost impossible, Sophie Cruvelli would have exercised even greater sway over the operatic world of London. She was endowed with rare and precious gifts &mdash; a magnificent organ, sufficient artistic capacity, and a highly attractive person. She possessed, too, a certain quality which might become a treasure or a bane, according to the way in which she applied it. This was an impulsive, ardent, almost reckless genius &mdash; a quality capable of achieving great results, but requiring to be reined in by judgment, taste, and tact, so as not to overspring the boundaries of legitimate art, or (in common parlance) to ""run wild."" Had she the tact, the taste, the judgment? Upon these depended her future greatness. There is no doubt, however, that in spite of the sudden and awful nervousness which fell upon her when for the first time she faced the densely-crowded audience of Her Majesty's Theatre, the aspect of which somewhat paralysed her efforts in her aria entrata, Sophie Cruvelli did achieve a signal success on the occasion of her debut. When once the undeniable spirit within was aroused, she carried all before her by its power. She was young, handsome, impulsive, clever; and with these advantages, she could hardly fail to be irresistible. </span></p>

Steady and sound as a musician, Beletti seemed to place his feet upon the boards of the opera-house with a consciousness that it was firm ground. He had a sonorous and flexible voice, sang in a careful, correct style, with a voluble delivery, but was endowed with little power as an actor. Beletti took up his position from the very first evening of his appearance &mdash; a position incontestable and uncontested. This was a pleasing circumstance for her who had in some measure staked her own reputation for judgment on the success of her estimable comrade. </span></p>

On this account the young singer was ""cast"" for the character of the king in ""Ernani&rdquo;; the part in the original score being written for a baritone. Some of the music was consequently transposed for Gardoni. But the commanding power of voice required to enable him to predominate in the great finale of the third act, was wanting ; and accordingly the reputation of the favourite tenor nowise gained by this venture. Still, by dint of all the varied interest due to the novelty of the ""cast,"" ""Ernani"" worked its way, and gave a very important prestige to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre for the season of 1848.</span></p>",,

One was the first production in London of Wagner's &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo;; the other, the first appearance there of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. The former was regarded almost in the light of an experiment. Never before had an opera by Wagner been performed at Covent Garden. In 1870 his &ldquo;Fliegende Hollander&rdquo; had been given at Drury Lane, under the Italian title of &ldquo;L&rsquo;Ollandese Dannato"" (Luigi Arditi conducting), but without any very marked success. And now here was &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo;, a more advanced example of the composer's method, about to claim the suffrages of a public still notoriously unprepared for the comprehension or enjoyment of what was generally described as the &ldquo;music of the future&rdquo;. Yet, thanks to the growing numbers of the German community, the event aroused intense excitement, and the opera-house was packed to overflowing. I think it was the worst performance of &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; ever seen in an important theatre. Albani (then in her third season) made a sympathetic Elsa; Nicolini presented a heroic-looking Lohengrin and sang wonderfully well, considering how completely out of his element he was in Wagnerian opera; and Cotogni did creditably as Telramund. But the remainder of the cast were beneath notice, while the chorus sang dreadfully out of tune, and the orchestra, under Vianesi, did its best to drown the singers throughout. Yet, in spite of these drawbacks, the beauty of the music exercised its inevitably powerful sway, and the opera was received with a warmth that grew and grew till it culminated in a tremendous climax of enthusiasm. The &ldquo;tooth-and-nail&rdquo; opponents of Wagner, who flourished exceedingly in London at this time, were simply dumfounded. In all probability, &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; was as new to them as it was to Covent Garden habitues, and they did not know whether to be more astonished at the subtle fascination of the music or at the ease with which its charm and significance had been grasped by an &ldquo;unripe&rdquo; public. In vain did James Davison print Cassandra-like utterances in the &ldquo;Times&rdquo;; equally in vain did my dear and valued friend Joseph Bennett limit himself to lukewarm admiration in the columns of the &ldquo;Telegraph."" The success of &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; in London was complete.</span></p>",,

When revived for the opening of the season, on the 9th of March 1844, it was supported again by Madame Persiani; Corelli, the new tenor, appearing in the part originally sustained by Conti. Persiani, though now somewhat on the wane, was one of the favourites of the day. Corelli was generally pronounced a pleasant tenor, fitted for the Nemorinos of the stage, and so far an acquisition. But ""Adelia,"" although ""backed up"" by one of the most successful choreographic displays ever witnessed on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, would not, could not attract. It lingered on for a few nights, when it was deemed advisable to bring out the promised opera of ""Zampa,"" even without Fornasari.</span></p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Her_Majesty's_Theatre

Josiah&mdash;other biblical names in the family were Joseph, James, Samuel, David, Sarah, Ruth, Esther&mdash;had been a Methodist minister, said to have had a beautiful voice, and the hymns we sang were chiefly of that church, like &ldquo;Jerusalem the Golden,&rdquo; &ldquo;Every hour I need Thee,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why not come to Me now. ...&rdquo; Commonplace as some of them unquestionably are from the musical standpoint, it is remarkable how their na&iuml;ve sincerity invests them with a quality almost amounting to beauty. The devotional, artless singing of them, too, in the open air, for every passer-by to hear, and in the simplest possible harmonies, was most impressive. Add to that the strange force of mental association, and there is perhaps no wonder these hymns seem lovely to me to this day.</span></span></p>

He was rather reluctant to play it, and, when I asked him the reason, said that, as Joachim was in London and had played it lately, he did not wish to compete with him; but I over-persuaded him, and he played it superbly. The only change in tempo from the beaten track was that he took the last movement quicker, in which his exceedingly light bowing was a revelation of fairy-like delicacy.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/St_James's_Hall

You may imagine how I delighted in hearing that music - I, a fervid worshipper of Mendelssohn - while the public sat listening in stolid indifference; no clapping of hands disturbed my ecstasies. The Chorale, and song, 'Watchman, will the night soon pass?' moved me even to tears. Herr Hoschek, a music-master, came up to me and said, 'Isn't this music very artificially strung together?' My sensations were those of a man pitched head foremost out of a balloon, but I smothered my anger, and said, 'That's as people choose to take it.'</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vienna

The visit of Her Majesty had been expected. The opera house was filled in every part to overflowing; and on the entrance of the Queen the expression of enthusiasm was electrical. The whole audience rose to its feet, and one loud deep burst of congratulatory applause burst forth from the vast concourse of human beings. Hats and handkerchiefs were waved. Many ladies sobbed aloud. During this demonstration the Queen stood at the front of her box and curtsied repeatedly, while Prince Albert bowed in reply to the deafening congratulations. The audience would not allow the opera to proceed till the ""National Anthem"" had been sung, and, as a mark of especial respect, Lablache and Persiani joined the rest of the company. At the words ""Scatter her enemies,"" in particular, the most deafening acclama- tions arose, and one cheer more was raised when Her Majesty resumed her seat in the corner of the box. </span></p>

The thin strings of his instrument, on which alone it was possible to conjure forth those myriads of notes and trills and cadenzas, would have been fatal in the hands of any other violin player, but with him they were indispensable adjuncts, and lastly, his compositions were so ultra original, so completely in harmony with the weird and strange figure of the man, that, if wanting in depth and earnestness, the deficiency never betrayed itself during the author's dazzling display of power.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

The services were as follows; the order is so different from ours, that I have thought it would be interesting to many to have it given in detail. I timed each piece, and give the time which each occupied.</p>

<p>The motette (2) may be found, with a free translation of the words, at p. 290, Cantica Laudis, &ldquo;Though all earthly joys should perish&rdquo;; and this will give some idea of what kind of music is done by the choir without accompaniment. The liturgical service (5) was chanted by the minister at the altar, with responses by the choir. The reading (6) was also at the altar, but the minister turned and faced the people. The reading (9) was from the reading desk. Sermon (12) from the pulpit. The ministers all wear a black robe, with a white surplice over it, as well in preaching as in prayer; also a large ruff, say two and a half or three inches wide, round the neck, as is seen in portraits of the Reformers and clergymen of 300 years ago. No fires in the churches, however cold. The service begins punctually at 1/2 past 8 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and it requires, something of an effort to be up and ready on the morning of a short and cold winter&rsquo;s day.</p>

In Wagner's opera she was ably supported by Herr Anton Schott; in ""Mignon,"" by that admirable singer, Joseph Maas, the best English stage tenor since Sims Reeves. In fact, these were all representations of the rarest excellence; and they all threw into a strong light the singular versatility of Minnie Hauk, who could bring out the poetry of Elsa or the deep passion of Aida as completely as she could the diablerie of Carmen or the petulant tempers of Mignon and Katharine.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/London

It was like stepping back across the decades into the years of my young manhood when, in December, 1910, responding to the invitation of Bishop Welldon and Mr. Nicholson, I journeyed to Manchester to collaborate with Dr. Kendrick Pyne in the opening ceremony of what was in fact a new instrument. Dr. Pyne had resigned the organistship of the Cathedral in 1908. It was a graceful act on the part of the Dean and Chapter thus to remember their former chief musicians, and bring them back to the scene of many happy memories to assist in so momentous an event. We greatly appreciated the honour thus conferred. I venture to append some excerpts from an account of the proceedings, written by Mr. Filson Young, an accomplished litterateur and cultured musician, which appeared at the time in the Manchester Guardian. Speaking of Dr. Pyne and myself, he said: ""They both looked astonishingly young which is also remarkable; one does not expect anyone to look young who has continued to do any one thing for five-and-thirty years . . . But the playing of both of them was a reminder that experience does not necessarily spell incapacity . . ."" And he continued: ""It says not a little for Sir Frederick that amid the many duties of his public musical life in London he has retained the executive skill necessary for a performance like this; for technique is nowadays a much more formidable thing than it was in his young days, and it would have been no discredit to him had he chosen to rest on his laurels and not to compete with the younger school. But his playing yesterday was a reminder to younger organists that they are not likely to have things their own way for a long time. He came to Manchester, indeed, not to exhibit his playing, but, one likes to think, out of love for the old place and the old building and no one would have felt the occasion to be complete without him. It is all the more gratifying then to be able to praise his performance, which was particularly good in the Larghetto of Wesley and the Choral Fugue of Merkel; it was delightful to see him and hear him in his old place, where his many friends in Manchester will hope to see and hear him again, and to wish him many more happy years of service in Westminster Abbey."" The writer went on to speak in most gratifying terms of the performances of Dr. Pyne, referring to his ""direct inheritance of the Wesley tradition.""</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_Cathedral

Our relations by that time were those of very close friends. We used to chat freely upon musical as well as other topics, and I loved to ""draw him out"" upon the respective merits of the great Italian singers of bygone years. I think his chief object of admiration was the celebrated Pasta, who lived the most brilliant portion of her career in Paris during his own residence there. He would often speak of the ravishing beauty of her voice, the perfection of her fiorituri, and the grandeur of her dramatic conceptions. Yet in his inmost heart, I fancy, his famous sister, Malibran, reigned supreme. She was his junior by three years, but at the period here referred to had achieved triumphs unsurpassed by any singer of her time, and yet she had been dead and buried some forty years! He would describe her as the most natural genius he had ever encountered, and also the most precocious. A great deal that has been related concerning her is purely imaginary; but one perfectly true story is that of an incident which happened at Naples one night when, a little girl of five, she was playing the part of the child in Paer's masterpiece, ""Agnese."" In this opera there occurs a scene where a husband and wife, who have quarreled, are reunited through the agency of their little daughter. The tiny Malibran had attended all the rehearsals, and so extraordinary was her memory that she knew the whole opera by heart. On the night of the performance, the prima donna, in the episode above mentioned, either forgot her part or hesitated a moment, when, lo! the little girl by her side instantly took up the melody and sang out with such vigor and resonance that the entire house heard her. The prima donna was about to interfere when the audience shouted, ""Brava! Don't stop her. Let the child go on!"" And go on the child did, until she had sung through the entire scene, amid an exhibition of true Italian enthusiasm. How strange it seems when one reflects that the venerable maestro who narrated to me this incident, which he witnessed as a boy of eight, is still alive and enjoying good health, and in full possession of his faculties and his wonderful spirits!</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples

Upon her, it was said, the mantle of the illustrious prima donna had descended. Pasta herself had declared that, in the person of this object of her solicitude and her future hopes, she herself was to rise again before the world. These sentiments were repeated by Madame Pasta in a letter to me, in which she recommended &ldquo;la mia Teresa"" to my care. The delight of the now aged prima donna in seeing herself revived in her favourite pupil, is apparent in every phrase. She writes: ""Plena di riconoscenza;"" and, in the fulness of her heart, exclaims, ""Oh! beata I'lnghilterra! Che Dio la renda sempra piu felice!"" The zealous and eager sympathy of the instructress with the pupil was unbounded. Mademoiselle Parodi appeared in one of the most favourite and celebrated characters of la Pasta, although the choice of this role de debut was bold and even dangerous. As has been seen in the quasi failure of Jenny Lind herself, the most popular and most adored of all prime donne of the time, in the part of Norma, it was impossible even for the most petted of pets to dare to undertake the task of rivalry, even in seeming, with the one who had been so long associated in English estimation with the true ideal of the Druid Priestess. Of all Madame Grisi's parts, Norma was the one in which no effort of rivalry was to be endured. The success of Mademoiselle Parodi, however, on her first debut, was in appearance very great. Moulded as her whole style, both as singer and actress, were upon her great prototype, she gave to a new generation an idea of the ""Pasta"" of their fathers; and, with old opera-goers, revived in some degree the memories of the past. Her voice was full and melodious, but "" veiled,"" like that of her instructress, in its upper notes. Her acting was distinguished, as had been that of the Siddons of the operatic stage, by simple grandeur, rather than by fiery impulse. Her success, as has been said, was great on her appearance; but no evening of triumph filled the void left in the hearts of the public by the seclusion of Jenny Lind.</span></p>",,

<p>Here is an array of musical strength, surely; and it was no small gratification to sit and look around upon the individuals, and to observe the physiognomies of these distinguished men, during the performances to which they were listening, and with respect to the comparative merits of which they were soon to express an official and public opinion.&nbsp;</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Robert_Schumann,

One of the best bands I have heard (but not better than the one in Berlin), consisting of about forty instruments, including oboes, clarionets, bassoons, &amp;c., plays daily at eleven o&rsquo;clock; say an overture first, and then one or two pieces of lighter music.</p>",,

I remember hearing from my father that Madame Moscheles told him, on one occasion, that she was expecting Mendelssohn to come on a certain evening and asked him, as a great favour, to allow the chorus of the German Opera, of which he was the conductor, to come to her house and sing the choruses from Mendelssohn's oratorio 'Edipus in Colonos' as a surprise for the composer when he arrived. My father and the chorus stood in the inner hall of the house, and when Mendelssohn arrived they greeted him with the strains of his own lovely music. He was naturally very pleased with the kind attention of Madame Moscheles, and thanked her most warmly.</p>",http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felix_Mendelssohn,

The Archbishop was a very fine looking man, particularly galant and attentive to the ladies, of whom there was a splendid show ; it was conceived that he was very partial to the English, and English manners. The music was chiefly instrumental, admirably performed ; the band numerous and excellent.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salzburg

To one of those I was taken by Sir William Hamilton, who did me the honour to introduce me to their Majesties as a lad from Ireland, come to study music in Naples. The first question the King asked, was, ""Ne; siete Cristiano?"" ""I say, are you a Christian ?"" "" I hope I am, Sire,"" was my reply. Shortly afterwards he commanded me to sing an English song, and I put forth my strength in "" By him we love offended,"" from the Duenna. Her Majesty then ordered an Italian air, and I sung u Ho sparse tante lagrime ;"" they seemed pleased, and her Majesty, after asking me with great affability, how I liked Naples, where I lived, who was my instructor, &amp;c. invited me to take some ice and a glass of Maraschino.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naples

There are no carvings, paintings, crosses, statues, or anything ornamental; not even a leather cushion can be found, or the smallest piece of drapery about the pulpit or elsewhere. There is neither organ, choir nor any instrument of music. The seats in the centre of the main floor are of plain, hard boards, unpainted; this part of the house is occupied exclusively by women. The men are mostly in the gallery, which is divided into separate stalls, each for one person. Each stall has a seat swung on hinges, that turns back after the fashion of the old New England swinging seats of a hundred years ago. The men on going into the church did not sit down, but each one took his stand in one of the stalls, waiting for the commencement of the service. Some took off their hats, others continued to wear them. When the bell ceased, the minister stepped up to the railing near the pulpit, and gave out the pitch by sounding the four principal tones of the scale to the syllable la, (1, 3, 5,8,) and immediately the large assembly began to sing. The singing was slow, very slow; I have never before heard a tune sung so slowly as on this occasion. In singing a tune - ""The Old Hundredth,&rdquo; for example, &mdash;I am persuaded that the Rev. Mr. Havergal&rsquo;s congregation would get through the tune by the time this Zurich assembly would get through the first line. The hymn-book used here, includes, also, the tunes, printed in four parts, and, although the tenor and the alto were not to be heard, yet many of the men made a bold attack upon the bass, which they made to tremble with uncertainty, if not with fear. The trebles in one line sought to attain the pitch of E; they reached a little higher than</p>
<p>Eb, but yet fell short of their aim, and this caused the sinking of the pitch, so that at the end of two stanzas it was something like a tone below its starting point. It was well that but two stanzas were sung; for a new pitch would have been necessary if the number had been much greater. Here, then, is a specimen of congregational singing without a choir or organ.</p>",,

Seats were not only at a high premium but virtually unobtainable, and I owed the<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>possession of mine to the courtesy of Jean de <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Reszke. Many a time I have looked upon the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>heavily gilded and slightly sombre interior of the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Paris Opera-house, but never when it contained<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>such an audience, such a gathering of famous men,<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>of elegant, jewel-bedecked women, as appeared <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>there on that memorable night. The grandes <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>dames of the French aristocracy were present, displaying a sartorial splendor that recalled the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>halcyon days of the Second Empire, and what that<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>implied I can only leave my fair readers to guess. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>On taking the conductor's seat, Gounod was overwhelmed with acclamations. His calm, serene <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>countenance wore an encouraging smile, and no one would have dreamed that the veteran composer was as anxious as though it were the first <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>performance of a brand-new opera. At the outset, indeed, every one was nervous. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Many years had elapsed since Mme. Patti had appeared at the Opera, and, often as she had enacted <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Juliette - this was the first time she had sung the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>part in French; in the waltz air &mdash; long one of her<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>favorite concert-pieces &mdash; she did what was for her the rarest imaginable thing: she made a slip <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>that carried her four bars ahead of the accompaniment (&ldquo;Elle sautait quatre mesures!&rdquo; as <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Gounod subsequently put it). Yet, thanks to her extraordinary presence of mind, the great prima donna regained her place so quickly that probably <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>not twenty persons in the audience noticed the <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>error. Moreover, she sang the whole waltz with such grace and entrain that an encore was inevitable, and on the repetition her rendering of it was <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the most brilliant I have ever heard her give. The <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>youthfulness and charm of her assumption were <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>astounding, while her fine acting in the more tragic <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>scenes indicated a startling advance in histrionic <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>force over her effort in the same opera ten years <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>earlier. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The new Romeo proved worthy of his association with this perfect Juliette. The mere fact that it was Jean de Reszke may be deemed sufficient guarantee of that to-day; it is not easy, however, to convey an idea of the striking revelation which<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>his impersonation offered as, step by step, scene by scene, it unfolded itself for the first time upon <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the same plane with Patti's exquisite conception. <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Every attribute that distinguished the one arose,<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>strong and clear-cut, in the other. Never before, <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>at least in their operatic mold, had the hapless <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Veronese lovers been so faultlessly matched.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Where was &ldquo;monotony&rdquo;, where was &ldquo;tedium&rdquo;, now? The interest of that delicious sequence of<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>love-duets acquired a fresh intensity, and became <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;cumulative"" in such a degree that the final scene <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>in the tomb formed a veritable climax of musical <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>as well as dramatic grandeur. The genius of <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Gounod stood in a new light; and his personal triumph on this occasion was a fitting corollary to <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>that of the great artists who were his chief interpreters. Again and again did they appear before<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>the curtain, hand in hand, an illustrious trio, &mdash; <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>to be converted into an illustrious quartet after Edouard de Reszke had invested with his own <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>unique organ notes the grateful phrases of Frere <span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;"">&nbsp;</span>Laurent. From first to last, it was a historic performance.</span></p>",,

On July 22nd of that year there was celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the Confederation of Canada, and occasion was taken to include in the commemoration a solemn memorial in honour of the sons of the Dominion fallen in the War. Their Majesties The King and Queen attended, the high officers of State and numerous dignitaries at home and from our Colonial Empire were present, while the great building was thronged with a huge congregation, conspicuous being many of the stalwart men whom Canada had splendidly lavished to stand with the liberal peoples in safeguarding civilization. The proceedings were throughout infused with a noble dignity and simplicity. ""O Canada,"" the opening hymn, was sung with great fervour, the organ being supplemented by a fine band belonging to one of the Canadian regiments. Parry's Coronation anthem, ""I was glad when they said unto me"" preceded the Commemoration and the ascription of Honour to the fallen, recited by the Dean. [...] So in splendour and majesty the service moved to its appointed end. An innovation which might have been startling in the old decorous days that now seem so long ago, was the singing of ""The Maple Leaf"" before the National Anthem. But its inclusion gave great pleasure to the Canadians present, and sung as also was the opening hymn by the great congregation, accompanied by band and organ, the effect was superb. Those who were privileged to be present brought away an imperishable memory.</p>",,http://dbpedia.org/resource/Westminster_Abbey

When <br />in the mood he would tell us how, as a youth, he had been taken to St. Andrew's <br />Hall to hear the great Paganini. With an air of awe he would describe the weird <br />aspect and lean, lank form of the illustrious fiddler, as he stood upon the <br />platform in his closely buttoned swallow-tailed coat, playing amid a silence so <br />intense that his auditors almost feared lest their breathing might break the <br />spell. 

""Never before or since,"" my teacher would say, ""have I seen an audience wrought <br />to such a pitch of excitement. It was partly the influence of the individual <br />himself, no doubt; but it was also due to the strangely wonderful beauty of the <br />tone that he obtained from his instrument, and the fascination of a method which <br />completely concealed the nature of the difficulties he surmounted.
