"'4th-11th- Reading Homer and basking in the sun upon the sea side of the breakwater. Weather delicious. Have also been swallowing autobiographies - Gifford's, Thomas Elwood's, Capt. Crichton's autobiography by Dean Swift. ... William Gifford's account of himself is somewhat conceited and pragmatical, yet natural and manful. I have a deep and secret sympathy with Gifford.'"
