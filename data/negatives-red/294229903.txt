"Both John Harris and Mary Smith read the """"Remains of Henry Kirke White"""" """"with great delight"""", and Thomas Carter actually saved up a guinea to buy the book.  It was, he said, """"a large sum for one like myself to spend at one time in buying books: yet I had good reason to be satisfied; for the work was useful to me in the way of strengthening and confirming my habits of reading and observation"""".'"
