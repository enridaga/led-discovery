"""""Guy Mannering"""" is reviewed in the same number [ of the Quarterly Review]. Tho' we have still more reason to question their competency here - you will probably admit that """"the Dutch boors of Mannering tho' never so well painted, must cause a different class of sensations from those excited by the Salvator banditti of Waverl[e]y."""" - Yet the only extract they give (the departure of the gypsies, and Meg Merrilies' address to Ellangowan) is very much in the Salvator stile.'"
