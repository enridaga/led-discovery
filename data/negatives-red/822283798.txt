"From letter of Elizabeth B. Ker, niece of Harriet Martineau: 'I regret infinitely that she desired all her letters to be destroyed.  I had so large a boxful that it took some time to read and burn them [...] on reading that most charming of all her publications, """"Life in the Sick-Room"""" [...] I said, """"Oh, but I have read it all before! -- this is only my burnt letters!""""'"
