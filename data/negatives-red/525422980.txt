"Just a word or two about Robert's book. It is a glorious performance. Much as we expected of him. [...] Nothing approaching it has appeared since Burton's """"Mecca"""" [""""Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El-Medinah and Meccah"""" 1855] [...] The Journey in Morocco is a work of art, a book of travel written like this is no longer a book of travel--it is a creative work.[...] The book pulled at my very heart strings.'
