"To return to """"Trevelyan"""". I long to know what you will hear of it from Mary. I think Lady Augusta admirably drawn, her letters are real life, and what a striking little trait her being less fond of St Ives than of the other boy because he had seen Theresa. But [italics] entre nous [end italics], sacredly, I do think she has too much excuse for standing out about the latter, and A.K. made the observation too. [LS then comments on the character of Theresa and her actions.] But interest, interest, interest, as Mrs Williams says, is the first, second, and third perfection in a novel, and that never fails or slackens, nor does one hardly know such a hero as Tevelyan. Mrs Williams will have it that Theresa is not worthy of him, nor likely to have attracted such a man, and caused such a lasting passion; she is not intellectual enough; a mere boarding-school-girl uninformed, etc. etc. Pshoh! I am not over sure that such men like much [italics] mind [end italics] in a woman. I am very sure they can do without it - and at any rate Theresa has capabilities, is what a superior man might train and make something of. However, there is but one voice as (to) thinking it a most interesting book - what nobody can lay down'."
