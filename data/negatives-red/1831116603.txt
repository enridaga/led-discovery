"My mother started to read to me when I was very young indeed. She read aloud beautifully and never got tired, and she would never, from the first, read anything that she could not enjoy herself, which cut out all the poor quality writing which every right-minded child loves when he can get it. Her only concession was one weekly comic, """"Rainbow"""". But apart from that, I was reared on a fine mixed diet of Beatrix Potter, A.A. Milne, Dickens, Stevenson, Hans Andersen, Kenneth Grahame and Kipling ‚Äì especially Puck of Pook‚Äôs Hill whose three magnificent stories of Roman Britain were the beginning of my own passion for the subject, and resulted in the fullness of time in The Eagle of the Ninth. Hero myths of Greece and Rome I had, in an unexpurgated edition which my mother edited herself as she went along, and Norse and Saxon and Celtic legends. There were Whyte Melville‚Äôs The Gladiators and Bulwer Lytton‚Äôs Last Days of Pompeii and Weigal‚Äôs Egyptian Princess; for my mother loved historical novels ‚Äì history of any kind, though her view of it was always the minstrel‚Äôs rather than the historian‚Äôs.'"
