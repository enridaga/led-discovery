'I read it countless times,' he remembered, 'and the pleasure I found in it ... enabled me to hurdle the terrible barrier presented by Little Women, which I sought out at the library on the hunt for anything else by Louisa May Alcott ... For Little Women, Miss Alcott announced, firmly, on the title page, was A Story for Girls.  Yet I read it.'""""   "
