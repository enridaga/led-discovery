"Tell Father the Huns haven't started to run yet. If he reads the September """"National Review"""" he will be surprised at the warning of the writer against the Cabinet. It is well worth reading. It says that in the Black Week, Haldane didn't want any interference of England; Asquith didn't want any Expeditionary Force and Churchill saved the situation in ordering Fleet Mobilization """"on his own"""" before the war. Also the Territorials at the event of war are untrained: we have no army really: all are practically recruits now in England.'"
