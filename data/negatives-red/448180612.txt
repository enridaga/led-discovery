"The Briefwechsel [Goethe-SChiller correspondence] I have also read; and must soon read again; purposing to make it the handle for an Essay on Schiller, in the Foreign Review.  I particularly admired the honourable relation that displays itself between Schiller and his Friend; the frankness in mutual giving and receiving; the noble effort on both sides; a reverence for foreign excellence is finely united with a modest self-dependence, in Schiller; whose simple, high, earnest nature again comes into clear light, in this Correspondence.'"
