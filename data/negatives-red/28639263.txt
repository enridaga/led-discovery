"Harriet Martineau, in letter of 20 March 1873: 'The Life of Dickens is far too exclusively occupied with his personal relations with Forster [...] Yet it has an interest, and is worth reading.  In the second volume I am much struck by Dickens's hysterical restlessness [...] To how great an extent the women of his family are ignored in the book!  The whole impression left by it is very melancholy.'"
