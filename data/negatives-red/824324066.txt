"Its really good of you to have sent """"Faith"""". Your magic never grows less; each of your prefaces is a gem and my enthusiasm is roused always to the highest pitch by your amazing prose. I have already read (the book arrived but two hours ago) """"The Idealist"""" and """"The Saint"""". Admirable in concepton and feeling are these two sketches.[...] This afternoon I shall sit down with the book and forget my miseries in the delight of your art so strong and human.'"
