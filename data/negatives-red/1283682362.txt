"I told you I had seen the """"Quarterly Review"""". You would notice its contents in the newspaper. It is a long time since I ceased to be one of its admirers. The writers pos[s]ess no inconsiderable share of dogmatism; and their learning, which they are, to an unpleasant degree, fond of displaying[,] is of that minute & scholastic nature which is eminently distinguished from knowledge. Moreover their zeal for the """"Social order"""" seems to eat them up[,] and their horror of revolution is violent as a hydrophobia. These qualities are prominent in the last number - and accordingly it contains much disgusting matter; but I like it better as a whole, than some of its predecessors. There is in it a distant and respectful but severe criticism on Dugald Stewart's writings, which comes much nearer my views of his character, than any of the panegyrics which the Edinr Reviewers have so lavishly bestowed upon him.'
