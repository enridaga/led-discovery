"I had also read 'Paper Bag Cookery' -one of my father's fads -because I wanted to try it. Now I saw 'The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' in leatherL it defeated me. Wordsworth and Milton at least wrote in short lines with wide margins. I moved on to a book by Hall Caine called 'The Bondman'. It appeared to be about a marriage and I noticed that the men and women talked in the dangerous adult language  which I associated with 'The bad girl of the family'. 'The Bondman' also suggested a doom -the sort of doom my mother sang about which was connected with Trinity Church and owing the rent."
