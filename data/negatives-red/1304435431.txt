"Now, however, they [workmen] clubbed their pence to pay for a newspaper, and selected the """"Weekly Political Register"""" of that clever man the late William Cobbett. This journal was in the form of a pamphlet. It was chiefly filled with the letters of correspondence and the political disquisitions of the proprietor. The only news it contained was that which related to the naval and military operations of the British forces. The """"Political Register"""" was soon thought to be deficient in matters of general interest. It was therefore exchanged for the """"Courier"""", which in a short time gave place to the """"Independent Whig"""". From this time the men were warm politicians - not indeed very well conversant with public affairs, but what they lacked in knowledge they made up by a rather large amount of zealous partisanship. When they were too busy to look over the newspaper, they employed me as their reader - an office whose duties I found to be very pleasant.  "
