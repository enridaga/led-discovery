"What pleasure hast thou given me during the last few days!  First your letter then your essay """"Fruit Blossom Time"""" & then your nameless novel.  ...I am in a fever to finish the novel.  Ken made me turn it up when I was at part ten.  I shall, Sturto volente, animadvert at length upon it at a future date,  Now, I will only say that I like it very much.  Its calm, unabashed realism charms me.  You find fault with Maupassant for his wealth of irrelevant ... detail.  Frankly, I think you would do well to follow him some way in this.  I don't think all his detail is irrelevant.  . . . No, I believe in detail.'"
