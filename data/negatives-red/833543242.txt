"I love Emily and am too much afraid of hurting her. Her book ['The Tigron' - unpublished] is so very personal to her. she seems to wants us and the world to judge it, not as a thing in itself but """"think what this woman must have been through to write it..."""" I love a great deal of the book but I am not happy about it as a whole.'"
