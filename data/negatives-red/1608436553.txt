"I have just read """"Family Portraits"""". I am a bad critic: it is difficult for me to express with the right words the pleasure that the reading of your charming sketch has given me; but when I raised my eyes from the page , it was with the very vivid feeling of having seen not only the long line of the portaits but also the beauty of the profound and tender idea which illuminated for you all the faces portrayed, the sad eyes of the dead with the flame of a gentle pity and a penetrating sympathy.'"
