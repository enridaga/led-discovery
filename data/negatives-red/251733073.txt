"Henry James, in 28 January 1894 letter to John Hay, explains how he learned of the manner of the death of Constance Fenimore Woolson in Venice: """" ... coming in -- from Cook's office -- with my preparations made [for travel to Venice] -- I found on my table a note from Miss Fletcher (of Venice ...), enclosing a cutting from a Venetian newspaper which gave me the first shocking knowledge of what it was that had happened."""""
