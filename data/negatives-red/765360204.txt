"James Murray, a Glasgow woodcarver, represented the kind of reader Dent and Rhys were trying to reach. He credited Everyman magazine with """"opening up an entirely new set of ideas to which I had previously been a stranger. I became familiar with the names and works of all the truly great authors and poets, and was now throughly convinced I had been misplaced in my life's work"""". His reading ranged from Rasselas to Looking Backward'."
