[Boswell reports a conversation about their possible joint authorship] Johnson. """"The first of these Odes is the best: but they are both good. They exposed a very bad kind of writing."""" Boswell. """"Surely, sir, Mr. Mason's 'Elfrida' is a fine Poem: at least, you will allow there are some good passages in it."""" Johnson. """"There are now and then some good imitations of Milton's bad manner"""".'"
