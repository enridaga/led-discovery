"I have written a little, and read a good deal, - the second volume of """"Sir Charles Metcalfe's Life"""", which makes me look upon him as more of a hero than many whom Carlyle would worship; and """"Hypatia"""" and two sermons of Dr Pusey's against Germanism, and part of """"Hero Worship"""", to say nothing of pamphlets and magazines, and a diligent study of """"The Times"""" every evening. """"Hypatia"""" is a marvel; very painful because it gives such a miserable view of Christianity in those days. In striving to be true, the description seems as if it must be untrue, even by its own acknowledgment. There must have been self-denial and faith, and charity working beneath those turbulent outward scenes. Yet it gives one no sympathy with philosophy. Mrs Meyrick and I both agree that """"Pelagia"""" wins our affection much more than """"Hypatia"""".'"
