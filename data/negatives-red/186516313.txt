"Monday 12 September 1937: '[At Memoir Club meeting] Maynard read a very packed profound & impressive paper so far as I could follow, about Cambridge youth; their philosophy; its consequences [...] The beauty & unworldliness of it. I was impressed by M. & felt a little flittery & stupid. Then he had to rest; it turned grey & cold. M. had to be slowly conveyed -- a bed made on the ground floor at Charleston. Nevertheless a very human satisfactory meeting.'"
