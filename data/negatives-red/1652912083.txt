"Horace Walpole to Mary Berry, 31 October 1790: 'Burke's pamphlet is to appear tomorrow, and Calonne has published a thumping one of 440 pages [Lettre sur l'Etat de la France, present et a venir].  I have but begun it, for there is such a quantity of calculations, and one is forced to bate so often to boil milliards of livres down to a rob of pds [sic] sterling, that my head is only filled with figures instead of arguments, and I understand arithmetic less than logic.'"
