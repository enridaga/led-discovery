"So that, whatever may have been its deeper cause, the love which filled my imagination was of a kind that seemed, to me, to have little to do with what I meant by sex. """"Love"""" was something I had learned about from """"David Copperfield"""" and """"Under the Greenwood Tree"""" and from the stories in """"The Woman's Weekly"""", which my mother occasionally bought. And of course, from the poetry I was beginning to enjoy. I was naively oblivious to the sexual innuendoes of Keats and Tennyson but their romantic raptures set me trembling like a tuning fork. """"Come into the garden, Maud"""" roused nothing of the derision, or even downright ribaldry, that it would surely rouse in a boy of today.' "
