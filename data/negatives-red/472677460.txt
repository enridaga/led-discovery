"It was in one of those cheerful moods that I one day took up The Life of John Buncle; and it is impossible for my friend to imagine with what eagerness and pleasure I read through the whole four volumes of this sensible pleasing work; it was wrote by the late Mr Amory of Wakefield, and I know not of any work more proper to be put into the hands of a poor ignorant bigotted superstititous methodist... In short I saw that true religion was no way incompatible with or an enemy to rational pleasures of any kind. ... I now also began to read with great pleasure the rational and moderate divines of all denominations.'"
