"Talking of the wonderful concealment of the authour of the celebrated letters signed [italics] Junius [end italics]; he said, """"I should have believed Burke to be Junius, because I know no man but Burke who is capable of writing these letters; but Burke spontaneously denied it to me. The case would have been different had I asked him if he was the authour; a man so questioned, as to an anonymous publication, may think he has a right to deny it"""".' "
