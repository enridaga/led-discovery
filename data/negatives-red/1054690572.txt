"I took up """"Chollerton"""" (a Church tale) and skimmed parts through the uncut leaves and was not fascinated. It seemed strained and the fasting was brought forward prominently, and there seemed too much womanish humility. In one place the authoress cannot follow a young clergman, by description, in his feelings, or intrude """"into that sacred edifice which formerly a woman's foot was forbidden to profane"""". This is, if I remember rightly, the drift of the observation, and really my humility cannot reach that depth. I think I [italics] can [end italics] imagine something of what a clergyman might feel, and I should never consider it an intrusion to go wherever men go, taking them as men. Of course the altar is different; but there the distinction is not between men and women, but between God and man'."
