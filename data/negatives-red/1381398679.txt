"Henry James to Viscount Garnet Wolseley, 7 December 1903: 'I feel I must absolutely not have passed these several last evenings in your so interesting and vivid society without thanking you almost as much as if you had personally given me the delightful hours or held me there with your voice.  I have read your two volumes [The Story of a Soldier's Life] from covers to covers and parted from you with a positive pang.' "
