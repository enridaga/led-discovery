I am afraid, Dowson, if you were asked the question, you would feel inclined to say ‚ÄúA short memory and a bad heart‚Äù; but I hope you could resist the inclination and determine not to ‚Äújudge of me otherwise that it becometh one member to judge of another.‚Äù If you desire to know whose words I quote, see an article of mine in this month‚Äôs [italics]Macmillan[end italics]. While my hand is in, I shall make another from the same source. ‚ÄúAnd therefore, whether I write or no, be assuredly persuaded that I have you in such memory as becometh the faithful to have of the faithful.‚Äù"
