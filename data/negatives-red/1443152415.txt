"During this year I read an odd volume of that curious publication, the """"Anti-Jacobin-Review"""", from which I gathered a little that pleased me. Among other things I met with some views respecting the conduct of Judas Iscariot towards his Divine Master which to me were quite new. I, however, thought them both reasonable and probable. I also read Mr. O'Meara's """"Voice from St Helena"""", Dr. Henderson's """"Travels in Iceland"""", and Captain Parry's """"Narrative"""" of his Arctic Voyage. I must here beg the reader to remember that henceforth when I say that I have read any book it will only mean that I gave it a hasty perusal, for I had no time for close reading.'"
