"?By the way, dear, I must send you """"Consuelo""""; you said you had quite forgotten it, if I remember aright. And surely a book that that could divert me, when I thought myself on the very edge of the grave, from the work that I so much desired, and was yet unable to do, and from other thoughts both sweet and sorrowful, should somewhat support and amuse you under all the hard things that may be coming upon you. If it is to be had in Edinburgh you shall have it, dear, even before this letter.?"
