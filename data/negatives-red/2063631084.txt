"Byron's Journal (14 November 1813-19 April 1814), 15 March 1814: 'Redde a satire on myself, called Anti-Byron, and told Murray to publish it if he liked.  The object of the Author is to prove me an Atheist and a systematic conspirator against law and government.  Some of the verse is good; the prose I don't quite understand.'"
