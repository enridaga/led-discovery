"Mary Berry, letter of 26 December 1799: 'What little I could read during two days and part of two nights has been Mercier's """"Nouveau Paris"""", a sort of continuation of his former """"Tableau de Paris"""".  This last, in six vols. is one of the most stupid, unclearly thought, ridiculous books I ever saw, and yet I read it, not without entertainment and instruction'."
