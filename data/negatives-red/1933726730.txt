"I kept my hours conscientiously, but when I had no work to do I read continuously. I read parts of """"The Times"""", the """"Standard"""" and the """"Morning Post"""" ever day. The theatrical and policitcal news interested me more than anything else. The study was lined with book shelves, and besides all the classical writers there was a large section filled with the works of French dramatists. I read several plays by Marivaux, and found, to my astonishment, that a serial I had read in the """"Girls' Own Paper"""" had its origin in one of his plays. Encouraged by this, I wrote a play which also derived from a play by Marivaux.'"
