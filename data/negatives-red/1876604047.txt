"My own Jane!- You are a noble girl; and your true and generous heart shall not lie oppressed anotehr instant under any weight that I can tkae from it... This letter is, I think, the best you ever sent me; there is more of the true woman, of the essence of my Jane's honourable nature in it, than I ever saw before.  Such calm quiet good-sense, and such confiding simple true affection!  I were myself a pitiable man, if it did not move me.'"
