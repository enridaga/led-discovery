"Henry James to Theodore E. Child, 30 May 1885: """"I ought already to have thanked you for your friendly thought and delicate attention in sending me Maupassant's ineffable novel, which I fell upon and devoured, with the utmost relish and gratitude.  It brightened me up, here, for a day or two, amazingly."""""
