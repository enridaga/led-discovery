"""""... [Margaret Cole's] reading at Girton in the early twentieth century influenced her development as a Socialist ... she was shocked by a comment in J. A. Hobson's The Science of Wealth to the effect that a certain number of wageless unemployed was a necessary condition of capitalist industry ... 'In this mood of altruistic indignation I picked up H. G. Wells's New Worlds for Old -- under the misapprehension that it was another scientific romance like The First Men in the Moon, which had fascinated me years before -- and tumbled straight into Socialism overnight'."""""
