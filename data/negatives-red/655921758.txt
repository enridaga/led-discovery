"I send you a new novel of Madame de Genlis' 'Mademoiselle de la Fayette'. I think it will interest and amuse you at the same time. The subject is taken from the reign of Louis XIII and Anne d'Autriche. The colouring of the characters has proved a very happy effort of genius, and, after my taste and my humble judgment, I think it one of the best that she ever wrote, except 'Les Voeux Temeraires'."
