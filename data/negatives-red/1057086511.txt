"Down here with my mother I feel that nothing can be so preposterous, so undignified as """"love"""". I have been reading her ludicrous, pathetic, nauseating diary about herself and Oswald Norton. """"Cleopatra had a famous wriggle last night. Julia ull-ully"""". The sexual act is not indecent but almost any verbal description of it is. Interspersed with all this are prayers, recriminations, schoolgirl ravings, a kind of complacent self reproach.'"
