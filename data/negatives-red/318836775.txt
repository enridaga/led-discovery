"Henry James to Wiliam Dean Howells, 7 December 1886: """"The last thing I did before leaving London three days and a half ago was to purchase 'Lemuel Barker' ... and though I laid him down twenty-four hours ago I am still full of the sense of how he beguiled and delighted and illumined my way.  The beauties of nature passed unheeded and the St. Gotthard tunnel, where I had a reading lamp, was over in a shriek.  The book is so awfully good that my perusal of it was one uninterrupted Bravo."""""
