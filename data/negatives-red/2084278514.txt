"I had been made the more anxious to get some spare time, because several books which I had not before seen now fall in my way. This was through the courtesy of my young master whose kindly feelings I have already noticed. He now gave me free acess to his little library, in which were Enfield's """"Speaker"""", Goldsmith's """"Geography"""", an abridged """"History of Rome"""", a """"History of England"""", Thomson's """"Seasons"""", """"The Citizen of the World"""", """"The Vicar of Wakefield"""", and some other books the titles of which I do not now remember. These books furnished me with a large amount of amusing and instructive reading.' "
