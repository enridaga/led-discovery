"And now for the best jest so far in Changi: the editors of """"The Changi Guardian"""" suddenly have their cells turned inside out this morning. They are sent for. We all wonder what the offence is. It is in Saturday's [14th] """"Changi Guardian"""": """"Sad Demise of the Sabbath Paper"""" - """"With mixed feelings, we announce that, owing to shortage of newsprint, publication of the 'Changi Chimes' ceased on Staurday last ... From all parts of the world we have received messages of sympathy and codolence and, from these, we append the following extracts: 'your ... little journal' ('The Feathered World'); 'The orginality of the contents never failed to surprise us' ('The Dredgemaster's Weekly')"""" ... The Japanese open the proceedings by asking how we got these papers into the camp. (They were looking for them, hence the ransacking of the cells.) And, after the most painstaking explanations, the editors are reluctantly released.' "
