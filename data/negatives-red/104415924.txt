"I have just finished <i>The Way of the World</i>; there is only one person in it , no there are three &mdash; who are nice: the wild American woman, and two of the dissipated young men, Dolly and Lord Niddersdale. All the heroes and heroines are just ghastly. But what a triumph is Lady Carbury! That is real, sound, strong, genuine work: the man who could do that if he had had courage , might have written a fine book; he has preferred to write very readable ones.' "
