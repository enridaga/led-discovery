"Harriet Martineau, in letter of 8 July 1862: 'If Mr. Lucas's book should come in your way (""""Secularia: Surveys on the Main Stream of History"""") do look at the chapter last but one, -- """"Absolutism in Extremis,"""" -- for his revelations of the conditions and perplexity of French politics.  To my taste this book is charming, though he and I differ about American politics.  Nearly all the rest is a very great treat to me.' "
