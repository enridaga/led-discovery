"I often wondered at his [Johnson's] low estimation of the writings of Gray and Mason. Of Gray's poetry I have, in a former part of this work, expressed my high opinion; and for that of Mr. Mason I have ever entertained a warm admiration. His """"Elfrida"""" is exquisite, both in poetical description and moral sentiment; and his """"Caractacus"""" is a noble drama. Nor can I omit paying my tribute of praise to some of his smaller poems, which I have read with pleasure, and which no criticism shall persuade me not to like'."
