"?I have some idea of writing in the intervals of my severer studies for professional education, a comedy for my father?s birthday, but I shall do it up in my own room, and shall not produce it until it is finished. I found the first hint of it in the strangest place that anybody could invent, for it was in Dallas?s History of the Maroons, and you may read the book to find out, and ten to one you miss it. ? pray read the book, for it is extremely interesting and entertaining.?"
