"I fully share your admiration for Bradshaw tho' I think he goes too much into detail so that all sense of reality is lost and the book produces the effect of being a mere fairy-tale. It's impossible to believe that all this takes place every day! The more popular and picturesque treatment of the same subject in the """"A.B.C."""" carries more conviction to my frivolous mind.'"
