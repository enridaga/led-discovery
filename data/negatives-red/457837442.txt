"Henry James to William James, 8 January 1873: """"Yesterday came an Atlantic with my Bethnal Green notice and its other rare treasures.  The B.G.N. doesn't figure very solidly as a 'Lady-article'; it was meant as a notice.  But it was as good as the rest, which, save Howells' two pieces, which his genius saves, read rather queerly in Rome."""""
