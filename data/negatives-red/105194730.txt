"Ellinor, or the World as it is, by M.A.Hanway. 4 vols. An entertaining production written in a light, easy style [editor does not reproduce all of Weeton's comments] [The story] cannot have the slightest tendency to injure the morals of any reader,whether they have common sense or not, when it is considered that there was a continued series of suffering for 20 years from first to last.'"
