"Absorbed as always in books, Willie read seriously in both French and German literature. His favourites in French were the """"Maximes"""" of La Rochefoucauld, """"La Princesse de Cleves"""" (which inspired his play """"Caesar's Wife""""), the tragedies of Racine, the novels of Voltaire, Stendhal's """"Le Rouge et le Noir"""" and """"La Chartreuse de Parme"""", Balzac's """"Pere Goriot"""", Flaubert's """"Madame Bovary"""", the works of Anatole France, the exotic tales of Pierre Loti and the well-crafted stories of Maupassant'."
