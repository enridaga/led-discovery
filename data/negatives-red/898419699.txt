"Till lately I have never read Spenser, and therefore was not personally acquainted with his beauties. Neither do I mean to say now that I have read his """"Fairie Queen""""; but having accidentally met with an extract from his """"Hymn of Heavenly Love"""", a long poem, I went to Papa's study and read the whole poem, which is most exquisitely beautiful, and is perhaps equal to anything Milton ever wrote.
