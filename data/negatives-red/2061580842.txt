"I read """"Golden Horn"""" by F. Yeats Brown. He was a prisoner in Turkish hands for two-and-a-half years. As in all these prisoners biographies, they had much more latitude compared with us: they had money, luxuries (eg. drinks and good smokes), individual purchases of food and other commodities, opportunities of escape, and a reasonable rapport with their captors.'"
