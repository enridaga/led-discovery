"[Edwin] Whitlock... borrowed books from a schoolmaster and from neighbours: """"Most of them would now be considered very heavy literature for a boy of fourteen or fifteen, but I didn't know that, for I had no light literature for comparison. I read most of the novels of Dickens, Scott, Lytton and Mrs Henry Wood, 'The Pilgrim's Progress' and 'The Holy War' - an illustrated guide to Biblical Palestine, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin', several bound volumes of religious magazines, 'The Adventures of a Penny', and sundry similar classics"""". With few books competing for his attention, he could freely concentrate on his favorite reading, """"A set of twelve thick volumes of Cassell's 'History of England'"""".'"
