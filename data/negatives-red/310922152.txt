He reported that he had 'found the written Copie' there, 'so mangled, so interlined and razed by Mr Page, and others who perused it before its approbation, that there was scarce one page in all the Coppie, in which there were not severall written  Errours, Absurdities and Impertinences quite expunged.'"""""
