"Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Hamlet, by the scene with the strolling player's declamation about Pyrrhus: """"the only thing deserving of much admiration in the speech is the manner in which it is raised above the ordinary diction which surrounds it.  It is poetry within poetry, - a play within a play.  It was therefore proper to make its language bear the same relation to the language, in which Hamlet and Horatio talk, which the language of Hamlet and Horatio bears to the common style of conversation among gentlemen.  This is a sufficient defence of the style, which is undoubtedly in itself far too turgid for dramatic, or even for lyric, composition."""""
