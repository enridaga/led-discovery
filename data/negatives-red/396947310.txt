"Many thanks for the inscribed D.F. ['The Dark Forest'] Overwork has delayed me much with it.  I thought the opening rather vague and lacking in direction ? due no doubt to """"recency"""" (a new word) of the impressions.  However the book gathers force.  By the time it finishes it is the best book of yours since Mr P & Mr. T.'"
