"Now for yesterday. The proceedings were the 'exercises' of the P.B.K. society wh. = simply a gathering of old students of all ages. They begin by some distinguished person reading an 'oration' & another a poem in the theatre. After that there is a dinner - a 'cold collation' we should call it & a set of speeches intended to be witty & with no reporters present. The poet was a little man called Gilder, editor of the Century. His poem was good of its kind & he was a bright amiable little man with whom I talked about Magazine editing.'"
