"Mary Berry, Journal, 27 July 1818: 'Went with Lord Hardwick to see the MSS. which have been offered for sale to Sir Charles Stuart; they are all the papers and corespondence of Ministers relative to the Peace of Utrecht.  We remained some time turning over and reading them.  There ought to be among them some curious facts, and I found some that were amusing, but much less than I should have expected.' "
