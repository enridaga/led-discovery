" I‚Äôve read 200 pp of 'Clissold'.  Formless & wordy, I agree (introductory note foolish); but so far I think the book is very good.  It is full of brains, & very provocative & stimulating, & I enjoyed it.  If you want to realise how positively good 'Clissold' is, read a bit of 'The Silver Spoon'.  But I know you won‚Äôt.  Coward!"
