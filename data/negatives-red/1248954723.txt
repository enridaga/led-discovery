"Our library too was a weighty affair. Shipton had the longest novel that had been published in recent years, Warren a 2,000-page work on physiology.[...] On Good Friday [...] the rest of us lay about ,played chess or read the less technical portion of our curiously assorted library. This included """"Gone with the Wind"""" (Shipton) """"Seventeenth Century Verse"""" (Oliver), """"Montaigne's Essays"""" (Warren), """"Don Quixote"""" (self), """"Adam Bede"""" (Lloyd), """"Martin Chuzzlewit"""" (Smythe), """"Stones of Venice"""" (Odell) and a few others. Warren,who rejoined us that day, besides his weighty tome on Physiology -in which there were several funny anecdotes if one took the trouble to look - had with him a yet weightier volume on the singularly inappropriate subject of Tropical Diseases.
