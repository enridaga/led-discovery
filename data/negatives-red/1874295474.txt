"Dr Nott has lent me a Work that I find very interesting, & which comes well after reading Wilkinson's Manners & Customs of the Ancient Egyptians; - It is, Lane's Manners & Customs of the Modern Egyptians: both works are full of Wood cuts in illustration of the subjects they describe, and in Wilkinson's work I found an ancient Egyptian Car, & a wooden pillow hollowed out for the head, which I immediately remembered having seen at Professor Roselini's Egyptian Museum at Florence'."
