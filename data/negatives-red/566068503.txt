"With the most intense interest I have just finished your Book which does you credit as to the manner in which it is executed, and after the momentary pain in part which it excites in many a bosom, will live in despight [sic] of censure and be gratefully accepted by the Public as long as Lord Byron's name is remembered--yet as you have left to one who adored him a little legacy and as I feel secure the lines """"remember thee-thou false to him then friend time""""--were his--and as I have been very ill I am not likely to trouble any one much longer--you will I am sure grant me one favour--let me to you at least confide the truth of the past--you owe it to me--you will not I know refuse me [...] Still I love him [Byron]--witness the agony I experienced at his death & the tears your book has cost me.  Yet, Sir, allow me to say, although you have unitentionally given me pain I had rather have experienced it than not have read your book.  Parts of it are beautiful, and I can vouch for the truth of much as I read his own memoirs before Murray burnt them.'"
