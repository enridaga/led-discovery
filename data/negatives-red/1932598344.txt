"In 1809 [Anne Isabella Milbanke] wrote the Lines supposed to be spoken at the Grave of Dermody. It is one of the earliest of her compositions extant [goes on to quote 11 lines from poem, beginning with """"Degraded genius! o'er the untimely grave / In which the tumults of thy breast were still'd, / The rank weeds wave....""""] [...] These, with some other verses, were sent to Byron for his opinion, in 1812, by Annabella's cousin-by-marriage, Lady Caroline Lamb. He liked the Dermody lines """"so much that I could wish they were in rhyme.""""'"
