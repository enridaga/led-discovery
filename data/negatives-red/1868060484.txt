"Macaulay's marginalia.  By an editorial note by Dr Johnson, to the lines, 'Who would fardels bear, / To groan and sweat under a weary life'.  Johnson wrote, """"All the old copies have to 'grunt and sweat'.  It is undoubtedly the true reading, but can scarcely be borne by modern ears.""""  Macaulay writes: """"We want Shakespeare, not your fine modern English."""""
