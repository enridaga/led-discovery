"September 5 1840. Went this morning to the house in Ship and Anchor court. On the parlour window of the house formerly kept by my father was a bill, 'a first, second and third floor to be let unfurnished'. Saw a dirty, Ruffianly looking man in the Parlour in which there wa[s] an old mangle and great appearance of miserable poverty."
