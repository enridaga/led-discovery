"Tuesday 20 September 1927: 'I opened the Morning Post & read the death of Philip Ritchie [...] I think for the first time, I felt this death leaves me an elderly laggard; makes me feel I have no right to go on; as if my life was at the expense of his. And I had not been kind; not asked him to dinner & so on.'"
