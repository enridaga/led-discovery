"Badliewe [sic] has not yet made great noise but has excited a deep interest in a limited sphere. It is reviewed in both our minor reviews in the one with a good deal of asperity but they allow the author to be posessed of some kind of unaccountable fund of poetical genius. In the """"Scottish"""" published yesterday there is a long and able review of it - the writer is quite misled likewise with regard to the author too - He blames the plot but extols the poetry some of it even above all others - says that the author is no common man and though he has great faults which it becomes him to mention the author if he continue writing his own way cannot go far wrong'."
