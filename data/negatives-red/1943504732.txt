"A good novel, but not so good as either of the two last, and not good enough for such a writer. The next must be better or it will be the last. There is I see Flibbertigibbet over again. Bridgenorth is not new, Charles is the best done. My opinion is worth but little but I am always sincere. There is one comfort, however, in reading Scott?s novels, that his worst are better than what are called the successful productions of other persons'."
