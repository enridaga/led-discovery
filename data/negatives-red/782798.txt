"I do not know whether Mr Wilson read """"Pickwick"""" right through, but I certainly did. My copy bears a plate inside the cover [school prize details]... It was the first of a succession of Dickens volumes on Indian paper, in stiff blue covers, with the original Phiz and Seymour illustrations. In 1926, at the Secondary School, I received """"Barnaby Rudge""""; in 1927, """"Dombey and Son""""; in 1928, """"Nicholas Nickleby"""". """"Great Expectations, which followed """"Pickwick"""" in Mr Wilson's scheme, I acquired in the red, cardboard-backed Nelson's Classics, price One Shilling and Sixpence, a series which became my regular source of Christmas and birthday presents from uncles and friends... These books were my winter reading between the ages of ten and fourteen... [discusses at length the realism he found in the Phiz illustrations for """"Dombey and Son"""": 'I would pick up my book sometimes and try to read by the glow from the coals, and the world I entered seemed not too far removed from the world I left. It was no more walking from one room into the next.']"
