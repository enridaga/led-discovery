"The evening being bright and moonlight and very still, we all went out, and walked through the whole village, where not a creature moved; &mdash; through the principal little square, in the middle of which was a sort of pillar or Town Cross on steps, and Louis read, by the light of the moon, a proclamation for collections of charities which was stuck on it. We walked on along a lane a short way, hearing nothing whatever &mdash; not a leaf moving &mdash; but the distant barking of a dog! Suddenly we heard a drum and fifes! We were greatly alarmed, fearing we had been recognized.'"
