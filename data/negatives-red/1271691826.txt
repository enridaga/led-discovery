"It was the custom of my master to invite some of the oldest of the boys to visit him for an hour or two on half holidays, these were Thursdays and Saturdays. On these occasions he always took the boys into his study a small room on the second floor, he used to show the boys his books and encourage them to read and ask questions, his collection of books was small and they were mostly old books in bad condition. I remember his shewing me a book on Anatomy, which stron[g]ly excited me, and made me desirous of information on the subject, which he, as far as he understood it was willing to impart, I conclude however that he knew very little about it."
