"Have you seen a little volume of Westall's Poems containing a DAY in SPRING, and other detached pieces, with four lovely engravings from his own designs?  One of them representing ayouthful Spenser, dreaming about knights, and squires, & Dames of high degree, and Fairies, & other entertaining whimsies. And all these visionary personages are dancing around him in the prettiest groupes you can imagine."
