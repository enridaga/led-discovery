"You say, """"I wonder what you think of Trotter's Life of Fox""""? Now I wonder that, supposing I had only read two paragraphs, you could have any doubt of what I must think; and still more I should wonder if, supposing that I [italics] had [end italics] read the paragraphs, you should imagine it possible for me to read two more.
