"A variety of works have been begun about the new year (as is the fashion) in the """"periodical line"""". A weekly newspaper the """"Scotsman"""" has reached the third number. I have seen them all - a little violent in their Whiggism; but well enough written in some places. Pillans & Jeffrey & Moncrieff and many others have been respectively named as the Editor. There is also a weekly essay """"The Sale Room"""" begun about six weeks ago - by whom, I know not. The writers are not without abilities; but the last numbers seemed to indicate that the work was about to give up the ghost.'"
