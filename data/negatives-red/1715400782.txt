"The first article in the last Quarterly review is [on] Stewart's second volume. The wise men of London are earnest in their censures of """"the metaphysical heresies"""" of their northern neighbours: and notwithstanding the high admiration they pay to Stewarts talents, the[y] differ from him in almost all his results - because they disbelieve his principles - the """"first principles"""" of Dr. Reid. Their opinion (and they give no reasons), on a point of this nature, is of little consequence. All the prejudices natural to Englishmen, they entertain in their full extent - and always modify their decisions accordingly[.] For my part, tho' far be it from me to attempt to disparage or vilipend this great man - I cannot help thinking, that, the perusal of his book has done me hurt. Perpetually talking about analysing perceptions, & retiring within ones self, & mighty improvements that we are to make?no one knows how, - I believe, he will generally leave the mind of his reader?crowded with disjointed notions & nondescript ideas - which the sooner he gets rid of, the better. I know you think differently; but de gustibus non est disputandum [concerning taste it is needless to dispute, ed. note]; and very probably, the fault is not with the Author - but his subject'."
