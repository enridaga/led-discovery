"Reading the new volume of Eddie Marsh's poets, nothing new to me in it. Wish the Kaiser would let me go back to my work at writing poems. Slow and sure is my way, I'm sure, and the good work was bound to come along sooner or later. And now if I get done in, I leave only a sheaf of minor verse, mostly derived from memory."
