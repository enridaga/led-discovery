"On her return to London [from Canford, after Christmas 1879] Lady Charlotte, having a very bad cold, hardly left the house for nearly a month. During this time her occupation was typical of her present way of living. She worked at the catalogue of her [ceramics] collections, she superintended the washing of her enamels and the cleaning of her enamel cabinets, she washed china, read Miss Freer's Anne of Austria, Henri III and Jeanne d'Albret and knitted for the benefit of the next expected grandchild.'"
