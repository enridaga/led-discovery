"A few years ago the curate of the village called upon the old man to converse with him on religious matters; after some talk, he promised to send him a Bible, """"his honour"""" also promising to read it after he received it. Shortly afterwards the curate was passing the cottage-door, and observed the old man employed with the book. The curate accosting him, said, """"Well, Isaac, I am glad to see you reading your Bible."""" """"Oh yes"""", replied Isaac, in a gruff tone of voice, - gruff, but not intentionally uncivil. """"Will you tell me what you are reading about?"""" said the clergyman. """"O, to be sure I will"""", was the answer, """"I am reading all the wars of rascally Jews, and all that sort of thing; why, what a blood-thirsty race of men they were, Sir"""".'"
