"Byron to Annabella Milbanke, 12 February 1814: 'In thanking you for your letter you will allow me to say that there is one sentence I do not understand ... I will copy it ... """"How may I have forsaken that - and under the influence of an ardent zeal for Sincerity - is an explanation that cannot benefit either of us - should any disadvantage arise from the original fault it must be only where it is deserved - Let this then suffice for I cannot by total silence acquiesce in that which if supported when it's [sic] delusion is known to myself would become deception."""" - - - This I believe is word for word from your letter now before me.'"
