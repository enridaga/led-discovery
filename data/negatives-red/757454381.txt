"[Mary Brotherton writes] 'I told him [Tennyson] the story [of the eighteenth-century woman soldier Phoebe Hessel] one day at Farringford, knowing it would touch him, and he came up to see my husband and me next day, and asked me to tell it him again: on whch I gave him the little penny magazine I found it in. It was an unpretentious account of """"Old Brighton."""" Many months after he took me up to his library, after a walk, and read me what he called """"Bones."""" That was before it was called """"Rizpah"""" and published.'"
