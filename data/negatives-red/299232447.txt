"Henry James to William Dean Howells, from Milan, 17 May 1890: """" ... I have been reading the Hazard of New Fortunes ... it has filled me with communicable rapture ... I read the first volume just before I left London -- and the second, which I began the instant I got into the train at Victoria, made me wish immensely that both it and the journey to Bale and thence were formed to last longer.""""
