"Somewhere about this time I met with a volume to which I am much indebted. This was a copy of Simpson's """"Plea for Religion and the Sacred Writings"""" - concerning which I have heard it said that it ought rather to have been called """"A Plea for Infidelity"""" because of its dwelling so much upon the corruptions of Christianity and the inconsistent deportment of some among its ministers.'"
