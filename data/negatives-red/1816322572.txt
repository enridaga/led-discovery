"Lord Jeffrey to 'Mr. Empson', December 1840: 'I have read Harriet [Martineau]'s first volume [of """"The Hour and the Man""""], and give in my adhesion to her Black Prince [Toussaint L'Ouverture] with all my heart and soul. The book is really not only beautiful and touching, but [italics]noble[end italics]; and I do not recollect when I have been more charmed, whether by very sweet and eloquent writing and glowing description, or by elevated as well as tender sentiments.  I do not believe that the worthy people ever spoke or acted as she has so gracefully presented them, and must confess that in all the striking scenes I entirely forgot their complexion, and drove the notion of it from me as often as it occurred.  But this does not at all diminish, but rather increases the merit of her creations.'"
