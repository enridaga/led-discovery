"Rudie inspired in all his children a love of literature, reading aloud to them from his own favourites, the great Victorians, particularly Dickens, and helping them to choose from the library shelves.

Nesbit and """"Les Petites Filles Modeles"""", began to discover some of the more adult novelists'."
