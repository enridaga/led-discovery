"My mother did her conscientious best to remedy the deficiencies of our literary education by reading Dickens aloud to us on Sunday afternoons.  We ploughed through """"David Copperfield"""" and """"Nicholas Nickleby"""" in this manner, which perhaps explains why I have never been able to finish anything else by Dickens except """"A Tale of Two Cities""""."
