"A letter from Southey, malcontent about Murray having accomplished the change in the Quarterly without speaking to him and quoting the twaddle of some old woman, male or female, about Lockhart's earlier jeux d'espirt but concluding most kindly that in regard to my daughter and me he did not mean to withdraw.  That he has done the yeoman's service to the Review is certain - and his genius, his universal reading, his powers of regular industry and at the outset a name which though less generally popular than it deserves is still to respectable to be withdrawn without injury."
