"...in one matter father and son were united. We developed a mutual love of comic papers, and together taught ourselves to read them. He could read after a fashion before I arrived, it's true, for once he'd struggled all the way through a serial in the """"Girls' Own Paper"""" called """"The Shepard's Fairy""""... He always sat in the hard chair, right-hand side of the kitchen range, with his back to the window, his sleeves rolled up and the paper held firmly... Then being set, off he'd go into the latest crime of Jasper Todd, the sinister landlord of the Red Inn, or Spring-heeled Jack, or the ingenious inventions of George Gale, the Flying Detective... we went on until every item in """"Chips"""", """"Comic Cuts"""", """"Lot o' Fun"""" and the """"Butterfly"""" had been dealt with -for that week.'
