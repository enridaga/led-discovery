"Friday 6 October 1939: 'I meant to record a Third Class Railway carriage conversation. The talk of business men. Their male detached lives. All politics. Deliberate, well set up, contemptuous & indifferent to the feminine. For example: one man hands the E. Standard, points to a womans photograph. """"Women? Let her go home & bowl her hoop"""" said the man in blue serge with one smashed eye [...] Odd to look into this cool man's world: so weather tight: insurance clerks on top of their work [...] Not a chink through which one can see art, or books. They play cross words when insurance shop fails.' "
