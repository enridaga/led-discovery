"H. J. Jackson discusses T. H. White's reading and annotating of C. G. Jung, Two Essays on Analytical Psychology (1928); Sigmund Freud, Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis (1923), and Alfred Adler, Practice and Theory of Individual Psychology (1924), conjecturing that White read these before 1932 (when aged 26)."
