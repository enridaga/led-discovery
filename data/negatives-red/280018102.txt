"Ruskin's """"Lectures on Architecture and Painting"""" which I have been reading, interest and please me immensely. They certainly are dogmatical. They are disfigured by exaggerated tirades against Romanism, but they are full of wonderful thought, and an intense feeling for truth, which must have an effect, one would think, upon those who read, or who have heard them'."
