"I had an opportunity once of reading, side by side,the despatches of the Chinese commander (published in the """"Peking Gazette"""") and the despatches  of the French general (published by the French Government) about the same battles. It was most instructive reading.The Chinese reported to the emperor [...] that the French had from ten to twenty times the number they really had ; and the slaughter these gallant Chinese soldiers effected beats everything previously recorded in history. Accirding to the """"Peking Gazette"""", no les than 1,800,000 Frenchmen were actually killed in the Tonquin [sic] war: and according to the same authority Admiral Courbet was killed on forty-six occasions.'
