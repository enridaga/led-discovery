" """"This is a very good Idyll.  Indeed it is more pleasing to me than almost any other pastoral poem in any language.  It was my favourite at College.  There is a rich profusion of rustic imagery about it which I find nowhere else.  It opens a scene of rural plenty and comfort which quite fills the imagination, - flowers, fruits, leaves, fountains, soft goatskins, old wine, singing birds, joyous friendly companions.  The whole has an air of reality which is more interesting than the conventional world which Virgil has placed in Arcadia"""".  So Macaulay characterises the Seventh Idyll of Theocritus.'"
