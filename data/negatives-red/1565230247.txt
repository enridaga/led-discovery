"Carter read and enjoyed fiction until the end of her life. Pennington reveals her enthusiasm for a number of novelists """"of considerable genius, as well as strict morals"""", who provided """"a very pleasing relaxation from her severer studies"""" (Letters... to Mrs Montagu, vol 1, p. 69). According to him, she disliked realist fiction, though she made an exception for Burney's which she read with """"increasing approbation more than once"""": her favourite was """"Evelina"""" (Memoirs, p. 299). She also enjoyed Jane West (who dedicated """"A Tale of the Times"""" to her) and Ann Radcliffe, who impressed her, according to Pennington, by """"the good tendency of all her works, the virtues of her principal characters... and her accurate, as well as vivid delineation of the beauties of nature"""" (Memoirs, p. 300). She thought """"A Sicilian Romance"""" """"elegant"""" and praised its """"good"""" moral (Letters... to Mrs Montagu, Vol III, p. 323).'"
