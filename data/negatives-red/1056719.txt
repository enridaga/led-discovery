"Thursday 28 May 1931: 'Disappointed, reading lightly through, by The man who died, D.H.L.'s last. Reading Sons and Lovers first, then the last I seem to span the measure of his powers & trace his decline. A kind of Guy Fawkes dressing up grew on him it seems, in spite of the lovely silver-bright writing here & there: something sham. Making himself into a God, I suppose.'"
