"Horace Walpole to Mary Berry, 17 October (in letter begun 16 October) 1790, on visit from his friend, and Berry's cousin, Miss Seton that day: 'As she was going she desired me to read to her Prior's """"Turtle and Sparrow,"""" and his """"Apollo and Daphne,"""" with which you were so delighted, and which, tho' scarce known, are two of his wittiest and genteelest poems.'"
