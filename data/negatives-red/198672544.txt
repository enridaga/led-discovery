"In """"Guns and Butter"""" by Bruce-Lockhart (written October 1938), he says: """"To anyone who knows the East, it was already clear that, whoever won the war between Japan and China, the white races have already lost it'. It is probably true in the long run, but, now that the East has seen, the time may be postponed.'"
