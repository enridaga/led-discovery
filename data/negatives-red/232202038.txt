"Mrs C. Cage wrote thus to Fanny - """"A great many thanks for the loan of """"Emma,"""" which I am delighted with. I like it better than any.  Every character is thoroughly kept up.  I must enjoy reading it again with Charles.  Miss Bates is incomparable, but I was nearly killed with those precious treasures! They are Unique, & really  more fun than I can express.  I am at Highbury all day, & I can't help feeling I have just got into a new set of acquaintance.  No one writes such good sense. & so very comfortable.""""'"
