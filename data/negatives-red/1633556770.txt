"I send you a characteristic letter from John Collier, which please keep for me. I suspected Pollock from the first; but did not think Collier himself had had a hand in it. Pollock, let me inform you, is the son of Lady Pollock, whoever she may be; and Collier is the son of Baron (I think they call him) Collier &#8722; no, I think it‚Äôs Sir Robert: anyway he‚Äôs a judge. Ahem.'"
