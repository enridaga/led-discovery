"?I now read for the first time """"The Tempest"""", """"Measure for Measure"""", """"Love?s Labour?s Lost"""", and many other of Shakespeare?s comedies, besides the supreme tragedies, among [them] the greatest creations of the human intellect ? """"Hamlet"""", """"Macbeth"""", """"Othello"""" and """"Lear"""". From no """"edition de luxe"""" did I read. The plays were published by Dick, cost me one penny each, a sum well suited to my means. No matter that the price was small and the paper poor; no matter that there were neither theatre nor stage, neither actors or orchestra. All the more scope was given to fancy and imagination.?"
