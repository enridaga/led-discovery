"Mr J. Plumptre. - """"I never read a novel which interested me so very much throughout, the characters are all so remarkably well kept up & so well drawn, & the plot is so well contrived that I had not an idea till the end which of the two wd marry Fanny, H.C. or Edmd.  Mrs Norris amused me particularly, & Sir Thos. is very clever, & his conduct proves admirably the defects of the modern system of Education.""""  Mr J.P. made two objections, but only one of them was remembered, the want of some character more striking & interesting to the generality of Readers, than Fanny was likely to be.'"
