"It seems to me that I have to write to you in the same nagging strain as I do to Wells,  In spite of my brotherly admonitions & my fatherly threats apropos of previous books there are at least as many grammatical slips in this one as in any.  . . . Such, imperfectly, respectfully, & fragmentarily are my views about this history which you have so affectionately dedicated to the aged one.  There are lots of questions I want to ask you about it.  Will you dine Thursday 21st?'"
