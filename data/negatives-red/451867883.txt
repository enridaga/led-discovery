"Phyllis Browne, """"What Girls Can Do"""" (1880): 'When I was a girl I was passionately fond of reading ... I went to stay with a friend in the country, who had by some means or other become possessed of a number of three-volume novels of a questionable character.  These were stored away in a box in the garret ... I discovered them ... I used to go into the garret, sit on the ground, and read all day long books of all kinds ...' (pp.104-05)"
