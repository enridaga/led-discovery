"Weaver-novelist William Holt extolled the standard greats (""""Noble Carlyle; virtuous Tolstoi; wise Bacon; jolly Rabelais; towering Plato..."""") and, having taught himself German, memorized Schiller while working at the looms. But he did not limit himself to classics: """"I read omnivorously, greedily, promiscuously"""", from dime novels and G.A. Henty to Hardy and Conrad. Holt disparaged popular authors such as Ethel M. Dell and Elinor Glyn for """"peddling vulgar narcotics"""", yet he was closely attuned to the mass reading public. His own autobiography sold a quarter of a million copes and he once owned a fleet of bookmobiles. He reconciled taste with populism through this logic: though most readers consume a certain amount of junk, it does them no harm because they recognize it as junk'."
