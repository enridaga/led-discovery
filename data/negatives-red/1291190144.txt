"It is surprising how irritating it is when simple little questions or arguments arise which none of us can settle because we have no other sources of information than our imagination. [italics] The Merchant of Venice [end italics], which Elsie sent me, has just settled one grevious point, viz. who was in love with Portia. I was a bit hazy over most of the play but I said Bassanio. Hamilton stuck out that Bassanio eventually trotted off with Nerissa. He had got it into his head that although Bassanio and Portia were lovers in the early part of the play, the ring episode upset things and Bassanio married Nerissa. But I was correct and I can now gloat over Hamilton although really I have little right to do so for it was more of a guess than a feat of memory, but I don't admit that to Hamilton.'"
