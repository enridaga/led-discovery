"At the Coffee-house in Exchange=alley I bought a little book, """"Counsell to Builders"""", written by Sir Balth. Gerbier; it is dedicated almost to all the men of any great condition in England, so that the epistles are more than the book itself; and both it and them not worth a turd, that I am ashamed that I bought it.'"
