"The only books I remember seeing as a small child were an old copy of Foxe's """"Book of Martyrs"""" and one of the Bible, including the Apocrypha, brought out of their hiding-places on Sunday evenings at Spitalfields to amuse the child with pictures, for both were illustrated - the """"Book of Martyrs"""" with realistic engravings of the horrible tortures inflicted on the faithful Protestant. """"Bel and the Dragon"""" in the Bible, too, was a favourite picture.' "
