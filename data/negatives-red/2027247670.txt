"On Wednesday before breakfast, I read the beginning of Antoninus?s 10th. book, & I went on with it today, but not the end.  My energies felt dead within me: & how could I do anything without them?  Nothing but reading the 3d. vol: of Mrs. Shelley, which I despatched in two hours ? (which did come at last!! - )  No going out today.  Marcus Antoninus after Mrs. Shelly [sic], and drinking tea after Marcus."
