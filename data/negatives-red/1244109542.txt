"At Wormwood Scrubs I lent a work on Henry VIII to a jewel thief. When he returned it, he remarked that he had enjoyed it very much and, if I had another similar book, he would like to read it. As he did not strike me as being the type of man to take so keen an interest in history as his praise of the book seemed to imply, I asked him what aspects of Henry the Eight had aroused his interest. He replied that it was Henry's penchant for women that had intrigued him. Only he didn't put it quite like that. What he really said was something like this: """"Gor blimey! Wasn't 'e a b- (son of a bachelor) for wimmin! Tork abaht us blokes bein' 'at stuff, why the b- had a bleedin' 'Arem! Them kings, and blokes like 'im, were the dirtiest lot of b-'s I've ever read abaht. Tork abaht Marie Monk! Why there ain't a bloke in this nick, or Dartmoor, or Pankhurst, as is a quarter as bad as these blokes yer reads abaht in 'istory!""""'"
