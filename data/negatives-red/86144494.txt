"Dorothy Wordsworth to Sara Hutchinson, 18 February 1815: 'Mary is deep in the 2nd volume of the """"Recluse of Norway"""" by Miss Porter - there is a wonderful cleverness in this book, and notwithstanding the badness of the style the 1st vol is very interesting.  I began the 2nd last night but could do no more than skim it.'"
