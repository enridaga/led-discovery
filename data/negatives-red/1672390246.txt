"On the inside cover of D[ove] C[ottage] MS 2, in use during 1786-7, a faint pencil inscription survives from c.1786: """"Non hoc ista sibi tempus spectacula,"""" from Virgil, Aeneid vi 37.  In The Death of the Starling several pages later, we find the epigraph, """"Sunt lacrimae rerum"""" ... from Aeneid i.462.'"
