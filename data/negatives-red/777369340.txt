"Three weeks of sickness, sleepness nights, and dismal days: and the """"light"""" reading that I have been devouring I find to weigh very heavy. Yet the """"Three Mousquetaires"""" of Dumas is certainly the best novel that creature has made. How is it that the paltriest feuilletoniste in Paris can always turn out something at least readable (readable, I mean, by a person of ordinary taste and knowledge) and that the popular providers of that sort of thing in London - save only Dickens - are also so very stupid, ignorant and vicious a herd? Not but the feuilleton-men are vicious enough; but then vice wrapped decently in plenty of British cant, and brutified by cockney ignorance, is triply vicious. Dumas's """"Marquis de Letoriere"""", too, is a pleasant enough little novelette: but I have tried twice, and tried in vain, to get through a mass of letterpress called """"Windsor Castle"""", by Ainsworth; and another by one Douglas Jerrold, entitled """"St Giles and St James"""".
