"??in Mrs Radcliff?s romances. She was ? an extraordinary female, and her style of writing ? must be allowed to form an era in English romances. Her ignorance was nearly equal to her imagination and that is to say a great deal. Of the modest life on the continent (where scenes of all her romances ? are laid) she knew nothing. With all this, and more, her romances are irresistibly and dangerously delightful? The most extraordinary production of this period was the powerful and wicked romance of The Monk. The spirits raised by the Enchantress of Udolpho, compared to those evoked by Lewis, are like the attendants on Prospero in his enchanted island.?"
