"In the afternoon I finished """"Dialectical Materialism"""", by David Guest - a promising young philosopher killed in the Spanish War. I find that my own conception of the relationship between love and necessity has much in common with Marx's philosophy, and I hope to be able to resolve them both. As a contrast to Guest's book I read, in the latter part of the day, T.S. Eliot's essat """"The Idea of Christian Society"""". Eliot has an aristocratic clarity of style, but dry in the mouth, and if it keeps the mind alert it rarely warms the heart; the quality is fine but lacks fullness; and we savour him in sips, never in a mouthful.'"
