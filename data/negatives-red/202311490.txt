"I have got two copies of """"Felix Holt"""" - the last sent me by Mr Langford [...] I don't think I could say anything satisfactory about it.  It leaves an impression on my mind as of """"Hamlet"""" played by six sets of gravediggers.  Of course it will be a successful book, but I think chiefly because """"Adam Bede"""" and """"Silas Marner"""" went before it.  Now that I have read it, I have given up the idea of reviewing it.'"
