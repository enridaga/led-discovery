"[Proceedings of the London Corresponding Society] The usual mode of proceeding at these weekly meetings was this. The chairman read from some book a chapter or part of a chapter, which as many as could read the chapter at their homes the book passing from one to the other had done and at the next meeting a portion of the chapter was again read and the persons present were invited to make remarks thereon, as many as chose did so, but without rising. Then another portion was read and a second invitation was given -then the remainder was read and a third invitation was given when they who had not before spoken were expected to say something."
