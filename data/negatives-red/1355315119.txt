"Wednesday 16 August 1922: 'I have read 200 pages [of Ulysses] so far -- not a third; & have been amused, stimulated, charmed interested by the first 2 or 3 chapters -- to the end of the Cemetery scene; & then puzzled, bored, irritated, & disillusioned as by a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples [...] An illiterate, underbred book it seems to me: the book of a self-taught working man, & we all know how distressing they are, how egotistic, insistent, raw, striking, & ultimately nauseating [...] I may revise this later. I do not compromise my critical sagacity. I plant a stick in the ground to mark page 200.'"
