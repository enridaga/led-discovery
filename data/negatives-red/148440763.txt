"November 18, 1881 [Paris] 'This morning I laid in a stock of Tauchnitzes, and am beginning a pleasant sketch of Miss Thackeray's on Mme. de Sevigne.  Apropos of books, I received two days ago a letter from an American publisher, telling me that M. Lanier had thrown my Mabinogion into a popular form for children and had just completed the work before he died [?] This is very interesting to me.  My first number came out in 1839, forty-three years ago.'"
