"What matters it to me if Young was an ambitious man or not? He wrote what I feel; and tho' not his wishes, his words would often have been mine, if heaven had endowed me withsuch giant-powers of speech. Were ever lines more beautiful than the first five of the first night? Shakespeare might have written them. What a description of night!  Less beautiful than Milton's so celebrated descrip- -tion of evening (book 4), but moresublime?  [quotes from 'Night One'and 'Night two']... I wished I had marked all, or half, my favourite passages- they would shew you a mind fond of deep thought- a haughty spirit unyielding to the storms of time and circumstance - a heart when lulled in Friendship's lap. perhaps as warmly gentle as your own.'"
