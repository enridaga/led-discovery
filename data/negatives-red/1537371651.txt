"William Blake, in copy of Sir Joshua Reynolds, Works (1798) vol I: """" '... I read Burkes Treatise [on the Sublime and Beautiful] when very Young at the same time I read Locke on Human Understanding & Bacons Advancmt [sic] of Learning on Every one of these Books I wrote my Opinions & on looking them over find that my Notes on Reynolds in this Book are exactly Similar.  I felt the Same Comtempt & Abhorrence then; that I do now.'"""""
