One of these lasted a long time: the writing of tales in letter form, to be put under the vegetable dishes at dinner, and read aloud when it was over. I have heard from my uncles and aunts that my father [Alfred Tennyson]'s tales were very various in theme, some of them humorous and some savagely dramatic; and that they looked to him as their most thrilling story-teller.'"
