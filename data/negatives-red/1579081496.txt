"H. J. Jackson notes Edmund Ferrars's annotations to his copy of Laurence Sterne, A Sentimental Journey: """"A note on the title page indicates that Ferrars acquired this two-volume set in 1772.  He annotated it very heavily, marking some passages, keeping  an index on the flyleaves, introducing biographical and bibliographical information on the title page, and recording cross-references to works by Sterne and many other writers within the text.""""
