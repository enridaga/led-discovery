Little occurred worthy of notice, till on my arrival in Moffatt, I discovered among my fellow travellers, along with three Lancashire cotton men, a pure species of popinjay - of whom all I can now say, is that he was much shocked at seeing [no] """"roasbeef fo suppa"""" and expressed his grief and surprise by several nondescript interjections; that he was unable to determine whether the fowl on the table was a tame duck or wild, and thereupon """"did patiently incline"""" to the reasonings of an ancient Scottish gourmand who at length succeeded in settling his mind upon this important subject; and that upon my inquiriing after the news of the paper which he was reading, he informed me that the Aachodoocs had returned to England, and that (this he preluded by three nods of satisfaction) the Prince Regent was gone to Brighton.'"
