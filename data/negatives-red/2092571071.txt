"""""It was about this period that Mike, the dwarf waiter, fell ill.  His mistress and others of her family being worn out by watching, the landlady appealed to me to take a turn.  I at once consented, and the widow, much pleased, set about mixing me grog for the night.  I asked to be allowed to glance over her library, and, from its contents, I selected """"Young's Night Thoughts.""""  This I managed to finish before morning, and never was book read to greater advantage.  The moans, occasional ravings and wanderings of my poor little friend and former schoolfellow enabled me to realise beauties that I had failed to see in a previous perusal."""""
