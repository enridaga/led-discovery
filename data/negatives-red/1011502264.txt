"Sir Joshua [Reynolds] mentioned Mr. Cumberland's """"Odes"""", which were just published. JOHNSON. """"Why, Sir, they would have been thought as good as Odes commonly are, if Cumberland had not put his name to them; but a name immediately draws censure, unless it be a name that bears down everything before it. Nay, Cumberland has made his """"Odes"""" subsidiary to the fame of another man. They might have run well enough by themselves; but he has not only loaded them with a name, but has made them carry double"""".'"
