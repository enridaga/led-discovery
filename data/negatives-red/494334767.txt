"None of the periodicals shown there are alive today. There was """"Ally Sloper's Half-Holiday"""", my favourite comic. When Father had a spot of overtime in, he used to buy a copy on Saturday, coming home from work with his wages and give it to me. Ally Sloper was always front page and full page. He was a comical man with a great bulbous nose, a wide grin, and he wore a tall hat that had a definite waist. He had a ma-in-law, and other relatives who were always making difficulties for him, but he always scored off them in the end. R.I.P. Ally.'"
