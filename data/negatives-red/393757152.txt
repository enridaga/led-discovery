"Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Hamlet, at the opening of Act 1, Scene 4: """"Nothing can be finer than this specimen of Hamlet's peculiar character.  His intellect is out of all proportion to his will or his passions.  Under the most exciting circumstances, while expecting every moment to see the ghost of his father rise before him, he goes on discussing questions of morals, manners, or politics, as if he were in the schools of Wittenberg."""""
