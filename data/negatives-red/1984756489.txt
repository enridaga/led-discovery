"Byron's Journal (14 November 1813-19 April 1814), 6 December 1813: """"Redde a good deal, but desultorily ... It is odd that when I do read, I can only bear the chicken broth of - any thing but Novels.  It is many a year since I looked into one, (though they are sometimes ordered, by way of experiment, but never taken) till I looked yesterday at the worst parts of the Monk.  These descriptions .. are forced - the philtred ideas of a jaded voluptuary."""" "
