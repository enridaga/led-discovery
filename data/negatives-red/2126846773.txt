"Many thanks for the book. [A Modern Utopia.] If it was a novel I could say something useful about it, but as it isn?t, I don?t know that I can.  The latter half of it is much more convincing & suggestive than the first half, & is also better done, but all of it is better than """"Mankind in the Making"""".'"
