"Finished reading """"The Northern Muse"""", arranged by John Buchan. A fine anthology - yet one must admit that our greatest poems are ballads by unknown men. If a choice had to be made, we could not sacrifice the ballad corpus even for Burns or Dunbar. Here all the passions and pains of humanity stark clear from the shadow of individuality. Here are the poems of Everyman.'"
