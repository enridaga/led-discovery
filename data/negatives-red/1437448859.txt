"I wouldn't throw a doubt on his [Edward Garnett's] judgement but I understand he has been lately crying up [through his review in """"The Nation"""" ] two books of which one (a sea book) is the most suburban thing   (I mean spiritually) I've  ever read. The other is a South American novel both portly and strangely disorderly--if I may express it so. But I had better say nothing more since I have written once a sea book  and also a portly S.American novel.'"
