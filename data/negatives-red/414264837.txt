"Henry James to William Dean Howells, 4 October 1881, on Howells's new story, Dr Breen's Practice: """"I won't forego the pleasure of letting you know ... what satisfaction the history of your Doctress gives me. I came back last night from a month in Scotland, and found the October Atlantic on my table; whereupon, though weary with travel I waked early this morning on purpose to read your contribution in bed -- in my little London-dusky back-bedroom, where I can never read at such hours without a pair of candles."""""
