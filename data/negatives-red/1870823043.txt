"Sir H. Davy is going to publish a volume of poetry. I saw one of the poems; it is very abstruse, and metaphysical, on the nature and essence of man, beginning with him as a suckling at the living rill, and going on until death infuses the natural parts into the dew and the firmament. Yet it does not cover a sheet of paper all this process!'"
