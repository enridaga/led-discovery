"I am glad I read the little book [""""The Problems of Philosophy""""] before coming to your essays [""""Philosophical Essays""""]. If in reading the first I felt moving step by step, with delight, on the firmest ground, the other gave me the sense of an enlarged vision in the clearest, the purest atmosphere.' Hence follow another 10 lines of praise and gratitude. "
