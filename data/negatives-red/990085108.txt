He was sitting in his high-backed chair, fronting a southern window which looks over the groves and yellow cornfields of Sussex towards the long line of South Downs that stretches from Arundel to Hastings (his high-domed Rembrandt-like head outlined against the sunset-clouds seen through the western window). His voice, low and calm in everyday life, capable of manifold and delicate intonation, but with """"organ-tones"""" of great power and range, thoroughly brought out the drama of the poem.'  "
