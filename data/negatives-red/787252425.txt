"from 1 to 3, read the first 100pp. vol 3 Leontine de Blondheim...It is altogether a very interesting thing +have read it with a sort of melancholy feeling, the very germ of which I thought had died for ever. I cried a good deal over the second + more over the third this morning, + as soon as I was alone during supper."
