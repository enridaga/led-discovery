"""""Now I began to think that the crown of all desire, and the sum of all existence, was to read and get knowledge.  Read, read, read! I used to read at all possible times, and in all possible places; up in bed till two or three in the morning, - nothing daunted by once setting the bed on fire.  Greatly indebted was I also to the bookstalls, where I have read a great deal, often folding a leaf in a book, and returning the next day to continue the subject; but sometimes the book was gone, and then great was my grief! When out of a situation, I have often gone without a meal to purchase a book."""""
