"""""One of the interleaved British Library copies of the 1691 edition [of Gerard Langbaine's Account of the English Dramatic Poets] graphically represents the circulation of annotated books in the eighteenth century and the early nineteenth, for it contains not only the notes of the current owner in 1813, John Haslemere, and those of his predecessor Richard Wright, but also notes transcribed from another copy that had been annotated by George Steevens who had himself collected notes from yet another annotated by Thomas Percy and William Oldys."""""
