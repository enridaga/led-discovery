"The dead lights [shutters used to protect ships' interiors during storms at sea]were no sooner up and a candle made fast to the table by many a knot and twist of small cord, than my young companion took up a book, and very composedly began to read to herself. I begged her to let me share her amusement by reading aloud. This she instantly complied with. She had however taken up the first book that came to hand, which happened to be not very apropos to the present occasion, as it proved to be Lord Kaims's Elements of Criticism. She read on however and I listen'd with much seeming attention, tho' neither she nor I knew a word it contained [...] The storm roared over and around us, the Candle cast a melancholy gleam across the Cabin, which we now considered as our tomb. We did not, however, assist each other's distress, for neither of us mentioned our own.' "
