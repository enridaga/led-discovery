"Henry James to Henry James Sr.,11 October 1879: """"I sent Alice the other day, unread, a novel (Jacques Vingtras by Jules Valles, the Communist) because Turgenieff has highly recommended it; but on coming to look into it afterwards I found it so disagreeable that if I had done so before, I shouldn't have sent it."""""
