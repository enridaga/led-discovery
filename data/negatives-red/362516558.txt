"""""A Victorian edition of a legal classic, the Institutes of Justinian, shows signs of careful and laborious study, with an elaborate system of marking (underlining ... lines in the margin ... etc); heads for important terms and definitions; corrections to the translation; cross-references to other law books; and occasional comments on matters of history or interpretation.  But a little more than halfway through this volume of 599 pages ... comes a personal note: 'Left off work at this pt to row head of the river 12th May 1864!'"""""
