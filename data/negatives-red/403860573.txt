"Marginal notes appear throughout this book, on almost every page. These notes range from comments written in Latin shorthand, underlinings, numbers marking particular passages and sketches of pointing hands. There is an obvious engagement with the text, and certainly evidence of a very intensive reading experience. There appear to be several different hands marking the book, indicating it was read and used by more than one person, as well as different types of ink."
