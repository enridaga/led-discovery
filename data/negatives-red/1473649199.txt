"W. M. Thackeray to William Smith Williams, 23 October 1847: 'I wish you had not sent me """"Jane Eyre.""""  It interested me so much that I have lost (or won if you like) a whole day in reading it ... Some of the love passages made me cry, to the astonishment of John who came in with the coals ... Give my respect and thanks to the author, whose novel is the first English one (and the French are only romances now) that I've been able to read for many a day.'  "
