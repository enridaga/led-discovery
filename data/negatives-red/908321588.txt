"Early in 1831 there is the following entry in a diary: """"Read to Ada the beautiful lines on Greece in 'The Giaour', the 'Fare thee well', and the 'Satire'. With the first she was highly pleased, from its efusion-of-feeling character; the 2nd she thought laboured and inferior in pathos; the 3rd very amusing though very unlike the person"""".'"
