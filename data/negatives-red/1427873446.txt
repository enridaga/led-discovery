"We see some funny things when we are censoring our men's letters. One hero wrote home """"We are fighting every day"""" ... One man was pathetically quaint: """"Christmas Day we spent in the trenches; I didn't get any food"""". (His own damned fault if he did not, but I think he was just piling on the agony. A man can't starve out here.)'"
