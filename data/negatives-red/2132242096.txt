"While admiring Tom's book ['The Man Below', 1939] I have great pleasure in finding its weaknesses and though I cannot help admitting there are passages in it far beyond my own powers, I feel resentful of this and that in some way such passages must be due to my influence or to Tom's having stolen them from me. Yet even in his earliest, crudest work... there are indications of such descriptive powers.'"
