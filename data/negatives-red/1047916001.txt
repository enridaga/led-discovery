"Aug 1838, journey to Scotland with sister in law E. Fry, friend John Sanderson, and from 15th, William Ball, a Quaker minister. Mr Ball kept a journal during the journey. 18 Aug 1838: 'These journeys are, I trust, not lost time; we have two Scripture readings daily in the carriage, and much instructive conversation; also abundant time for that which is so important, the private reading of the Holy Scripture. This is very precious to dear Elizabeth Fry, and I have often thought it a privilege to note her reverent """"marking and learning"""" of these sacred truths of divine inspiration. Often does she lay down the Book, close her eyes, and wait upon Him, who hath the key of David to open and seal the instruction of the sacred page. Truly it helps to explain how her """"profiting appears unto all"""" when she is thus diligent and fervent, in """"meditating upon these things"""", and giving herself wholly to them' "
