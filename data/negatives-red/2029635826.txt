"I finished the Endymion today.  I do not admire it as a fine poem; but I do admire many passages of it, as being very fine poetry.  As a whole, it is cumbrous & unwieldy.  You don?t know where to put it.  Your imagination is confused by it: & your feelings uninterested.  And yet a poet wrote it.  When I had done with Keats, I took up Theophrastus.  Theophrastus has a great deal of vivacity, & power of portraiture about him; & uplifts that veil of distance ? veiling the old Greeks with such sublime mistiness; & shows you how they used to spit & take physic & wear nailed shoes tout comme un autre?Theophrastus does me no good just now: & as I can?t laugh with him, I shall be glad when I have done hearing him laugh."
