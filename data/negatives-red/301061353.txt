"I was shown today some verses by an accomplished man, which made me wish to be a free agent, and to visit the scenes which he describes so well. Mr Keppel Craven addressed them to a lady, a friend of mine. The writer was one of her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales's most intimate friends, and she valued his acquaintance'. [The verses (which are lengthy) follow, dated Scio, March 1812]"
