"[Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Ben Jonson's Catiline, by the lines 'Lentulus: The augurs all are constant I am meant / Catiline: They had lost their science else.']: """"The dialogue here is good and natural.  but it is strange that so excellent a scholar as Ben Jonson should represent the Augurs as giving any encouragement to Lentulus's dreams.  The Augurs were the first nobles of Rome.  In this generation Pompey, Hortensius, Cicero, and other men of the same class, belonged to the College."""""
