"November 19, 1880 [Paris] 'I have been reading with great interest Humphrey Clinker [sic], which I like much the best of Smollett's works.  I read Peregrine Pickle some years ago on the Continent, and from what I remember of it, I consider it superior to Roderick Random, which I finished a week or two ago.  As to Mr. Bramble, he takes me back into the last century, and is quite inimitable.  I am now reading the Sentimental Journey, which I do not like so well.'"
