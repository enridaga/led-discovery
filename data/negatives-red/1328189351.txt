"Hallam's style does not appear to me so bad as it has been represented; indeed I am ashamed to say I rather think it a good style. He is a bold man and great names do not deter him from finding fault; he began with Pindar, and who has any right to complain after that? The characteristic excellencies of the work seem to be fidelity, accuracy, good sense, a love of Virtue and a zeal for Liberty'."
