"finished my morning's work a few minutes before 2. Made an extract or 2 from Lord Byron's Childe Harold + the lyrics at the end of the book in readiness to take it back. Set off down the old bank a little before 4. Staid at the library above an hour looking out a couple of books with proper prints for the children to copy at Pye Nest.'"
