"DILLY. """"Mrs. Glasse's """"Cookery"""", which is the best, was written by Dr. Hill. Half the trade know this.' JOHNSON. """"Well, Sir. This shews how much better the subject of cookery may be treated by a philosopher. I doubt if the book be written by Dr. Hill; for, in Mrs. Glasse's """"Cookery"""", which I have looked into, salt-petre and sal-prunella are spoken of as different substances, whereas sal-prunella is only salt-petre burnt on charcoal; and Hill could not be ignorant of this. However, as the greatest part of such a book is made by transcription, this mistake may have been carelessly adopted. But you shall see what a Book of Cookery I shall make! I shall agree with Mr. Dilly for the copy-right"""". Miss SEWARD. """"That would be Hercules with the distaff indeed"""". JOHNSON. """"No, Madam. Women can spin very well; but they cannot make a good book of Cookery"""".'"
