"[A Mr Murphy was looking for something to print in """"The Gray's Inn Journal"""" and a Mr Foote suggested] """"Here is a French magazine, in which you will find a very pretty oriental tale; translate that, and send it to your printer"""". Mr Murphy, having read the tale, was highly pleased with it, and followed Foote's advice. When he returned to town, this tale was pointed out to him in """"The Rambler"""", from whence it had been translated into the French magazine.'"
