"Her [Mrs Sheridan's]  novel, entitled """"Memoirs of Miss Sydney Biddulph"""", contains an excellent moral, while it inculcates a future state of retribution; and what it teaches is impressed upon the mind by a series of as deep distress as can affect humanty, in the amiable and pious heroine who goes to her grave unrelieved, but resgned, and full of hope of """"heaven's mercy"""". Johnson paid her this high compliment upon it: """"I know not, Madam, that you have a right, upon moral principles, to make your readers suffer so much"""".'"
