"He [Joseph Conrad] would read to me for long periods and make birds and other things out of sheets of paper which he folded with great dexterity. [...] His choice of books always met with my approval; I believe he must have read them all during his youth and enjoyed re-reading them almost  as much as I enjoyed listening. Among them were Charles Kingsley's """"Greek Heroes"""", Fennimore [sic] Cooper's """"The Last of the Mohicans"""", """"[The] Deerslayer"""", """"The Pathfinder"""" and Captain Marryat's """"Peter Simple"""", """"[Mr] Midshipman Easy"""",etc.[...] Some of these volumes [...] are still on my bookshelves here with his signature inside the cover.'
