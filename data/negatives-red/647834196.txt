"Reader makes 4 references to Gray's works V.1 p.73 (Ode to adversity), p. 91 (The progress of poesy); v.2 p.55 (The fatal sisters),; v.3 p. 59 (On a distant prospect of Eton college). Eg. p.73 'I always delight in Gray?s Ode to Adversity; read it once again and compare its ennobling tenors with my ideas.'; p. 91 'I feel the spark of fancy kindling at the torch of memory; but as Gray says of Jove?s eagle, """"the thunder of whose beak, and lightening of whose eye were to be quenched? &c &c I too will quench my mental light in ?dark clouds of slumber""""'."
