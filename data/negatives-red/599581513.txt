"Also on pink newsprint were """"Sketchy Bits"""" and """"Photo Bits"""". Most of the """"bits"""" in these journals had huge nude thighs and huge, almost nude, bosoms, with the absolute minimum of clothing... These two """"Bits"""" journals - that I sometimes bought for a halfpenny each at the second-hand periodical stall in the market -catered to some extent to masochists. There were pages of letters supposed to be written by readers to the editor -though it would not surprise me if they had all been written by the same journalist -that I did not quite understand as a boy. I read everything I came across, from the Bible to """"Deadwood Dick"""", so I read these letters also.'"
