"Anthony Grafton, in """"Discitur ut agatur: How Gabriel Harvey Read His Livy,"""" notes Harvey's reading of Lambert Daneau's Silva """"of political aphorisms"""" (1583), """"a now forgotten work by a Calvinist minister chiefly remembered for his unsuccesful attempts to impose a natural science based on the Bible on the Protestant curriculum, and a church order based on the 'Genevan Inquisition' on the liberal citizens and professors of Leiden.""""  Continues: """"Harvey's copy of Daneau has so far evaded discovery, but his references are so frequent and precise as to make it clear that thet were not conventional.  He read the work as soon as it appeared, excitedly referring to its newness, and often praised it as a source of pungent and precise political axioms."""""
