"?Here Hayley kept his books and manuscripts and the choicest pieces of his famous collection of Chinese porcelain. The walls were adorned with prints and drawings, and here also hung many paintings by Hayley?s friend George Romney. In this quiet room Mr Hayley and Mrs Opie would spend some hours together reading aloud, sometimes from a manuscript of Hayley?s or sometimes from one of Amelia?s tales.?"
