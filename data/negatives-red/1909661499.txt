"Rogers has at length appeared; an old friend must be a good poet; but without reference to this feeling there are some good descriptions - the Mother and Child, Mr Fox at St Annes and a few more. The beginning of the verses at Paestum are good, but there are many lines and couplets all over the poem quite unintelligible; particularly I recommend your attention to those verses on a sleeping boy on the 2d or 3d page - what is meant by the emmets and the wrens?'"
