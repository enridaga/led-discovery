"Forgive me for not thanking you sooner for the book [""""Incidences""""]. It's my gouty wrist I can barely hold a pen. But I don't need to tell you that I find your pages always congenial beyond measure. In the volume you so kindly sent to me there are some pages that I know. I did not know the Prefaces. I read them with delight &mdash; and also the reflections on mythology.'"
