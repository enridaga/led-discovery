"?? for a long time I read ten chapters in the Bible every day, I also read and learned many hymns, and as soon as I could procure some of Mr Wesley?s Tracts, Sermons etc. I read them also; many of them I perused in ?Cloacina?s? Temple, (the place where my Lord Chesterfield advised his son to read the classics.) But I did not apply them after reading to the farther use that his Lordship hints at.?"
