"Byron to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, 22 July 1823, thanking him for 'lines' forwarded by Charles Sterling and received at Leghorn: ' ... [I] arrived here ... this morning ... here ... I found your lines ... and I could not have had a more favourable Omen or more agreeable surprise than a word from Goethe written by his own hand.'"
