"In 1816, left alone in Bath by her husband, Mary Shelley records reading """"The Solitary Wanderer"""", Charlotte Smith's """"Letters of a Solitary Wanderer"""" (1799), a collection of interlocking tales in which a number of suffering women relate their stories. It is the single occasion her comprehensive reading diary mentions this book, which she seems to choose at this point to express a resentful, self-pitying protest against her desertion.'"
