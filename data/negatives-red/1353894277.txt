"I have been reading """"Robinson Crusoe"""". It is a splendid story. But I think Robinson need not have stayed so long on the island. He made a boat and hoisted a sail, and I think if it had been me I would have gone out to sea with the boat and then been picked up by some ship. Don't you think, Mr. Editor, that this could have been done? &mdash; Andrew J.C., Manningham, July 22nd. (aged thirteen)'"
