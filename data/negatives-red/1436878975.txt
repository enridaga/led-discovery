"Read some passages from Shelley?s Revolt of Islam before I was up.  He is a great poet; but we acknowledge him to be a great poet as we acknowledge Spenser to be so, & do not love him for it.  He resembles Spenser in one thing, & one thing only, that his poetry is too immaterial for our sympathies to enclasp it firmly.  It reverses the lot of human plants: its roots are in the air, not earth! ? But as I read him on, I may reverse this opinion."
