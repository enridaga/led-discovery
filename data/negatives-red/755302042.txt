"ms journal of Sophia de C-, one of the ladies of the Visiting Society for Newgate, entry dated 1 May 1817: '[school room] about twenty young women rose on our entrance and stood with their eyes cast to the ground. A young woman of respectable appearance, had offered herself as mistress, for keeping the young children in order; who were separated from their parents' words and placed in this room. I gave those who wished it permission to read to me, several could both read and write, some could say their letters, and others were in total ignorance, they wept as I asked them questions, and I read to them the parable of the prodigal son, as being particularly applicable to their present situation, they then resumed their needlework.'"
