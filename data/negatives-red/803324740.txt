"[Crabbe relates how he had fallen in love with Charlotte Williams and written her various letters, before she revealed she loved another] 'there was all this Time a Friend, who read every Letter & every Verse, for I took every Method that was allowed me, & Strange Creatures are Men & Women! While I was thus attentive to raise some partial feelings in the Mind of the Gipsy who wrote to me, this other who only read what was written, became interested & engaged & at length You must give me Credit strange as it is! She caught my Disease: it did not Signify to her that I was as old as her father! I could write in just that Style which she had fancied to be that of genuine Affection & Truth'. [Crabbe and Charlotte Ridout became engaged, but it was broken off for financial reasons]"
