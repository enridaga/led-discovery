"Yesterday I received a letter that gave me much pleasure from a poor fellow student of mine who has been all winter very ill, and seems to be but little better even now. He seems very pleased with """"Ordered South"""". """"A month ago,"""" he says, """"I could scarcely have ventured to read it -- today I felt on reading it as I did on the first day that I was able to sun myself in the open air"""" And much more to the like effect. It is very gratifying.' "
