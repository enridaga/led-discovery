"There was nothing for me to do but lie in my sleeping bag,write up my botanical notes, read and in between whiles eat chocolate.[...] Among the papers I had received by mail were copies of """"The Spectator"""" and """"The Times"""".

It all seemed utterly fantastic viewed from the Valley of Flowers.'  "
