"Yesterday my Elizabeth and I went to the most remarkable poets' Reading I have ever attended. It was held at Lord Byron's beautiful house in Piccadilly... I was moved by Mr de la Mare reading five poems of great beauty. Elizabeth was thrilled at seeing for the first time W.H. Davies, a strange tiny poet. He read """"Love's Silent Hour"""" and three others. Hilary [Hilaire Belloc] read """"The Poor of London"""" and """"the Dons"""". He got a big reception'."
