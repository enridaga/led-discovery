"March 16, 1884 [Lisbon] 'I am now reading to C.S. [Charles Schreiber] that charming book Rob Roy.  Scott never palls.  In the steamer we amused ourselves with Barnaby Rudge and the Old Curiosity Shop, which, with Pickwick which we read at Ceres, is enough of Dickens for the present.  C. S. likes my reading, and it has the blessed effect of often sending him to sleep, when he seems indisposed and restless.'"
