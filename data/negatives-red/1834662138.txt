"""""Alphonsine"""" did not do. We were disgusted in twenty pages, as, independent of a bad translation, it has indelicacies which disgrace a pen hitherto so pure; and we changed it for the """"Female Quixotte"""", which now makes our evening amusement; to me a very high one, as I find the work quite equal to what I remembered it.  Mrs F.A., to whom it is new, enjoys it as one could wish; the other Mary, I believe, has little pleasure from that or any other book.'"
