"That time Lord Tennyson was delightful - kind and friendly and full of stories, talking a great deal, and in the best of humours.  He read the Funeral Ode to us afterwards, and one or two shorter poems (Blow, Bugles, Blow); and I was so glad and thankful that Cecco should see him so, and have such a bright recollection of him to carry through his life.'"
