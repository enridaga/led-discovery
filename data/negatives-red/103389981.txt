"I have been reading John Racine: it is very standard &#8722; damnd[sic] standard, I beg your pardon.[‚Ä¶] I like John Racine, however; the noise is very pleasing and as unintelligent and soothing as a mill wheel; occasionally too there are verses of a dignity! &#8722; Verses with Versailles wigs &#8722; pageant verses &#8722; like a Roman Triumph.'"
