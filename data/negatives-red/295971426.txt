"Mary Berry, Journal, 22 September 1808, during stay at Bothwell Castle, seat of Lord Douglas: 'I read to Lady Douglas my sketch of a preface for the Letters [of Madame du Deffand], with which she seemed well pleased.  Finished reading """"The Tale of the Times,"""" a novel, which, like most other novels, begins better than it finishes.' "
