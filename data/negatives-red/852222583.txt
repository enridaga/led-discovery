"In the even read part of the """"London Magazine"""" for July, in which I find a great many excellent pieces, more than I ever remember to have seen in any one magazine. Perhaps I may be partial in my opinion, and only think them excellent as they agree with my own sentiments, for we are apt to be partial in our judgment of men and books as they agree and are similar to our own thoughts, few having so sound a judgment as to think and act impartial when their interests or sentiments are the topic.'"
