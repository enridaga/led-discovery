"One of the last books I have laid hands on is Lieutenant Burnes's (afterwards Sir Alexander Burnes) """"Journey through Bokhara and Voyage up the Indus"""". And, not to speak of the intrinsic merits of the work as a narrative of travel, which merits are moderate, it has become remarkable on account of events which have befallen since its publication. This Burnes was sent to those countries (in plain English) as a spy, to make observations and get intelligence which should be available to the Anglo-Indian government, in the project they had of invading, civilising, plundering, clothing in cotton, and finally subduing Lahore and Cabool.'
