"Have you seen Robert Nicholls' poems? If you are a reader of """"Tait's Magazine"""", you will see the review of them; that is a right manly and sterling volume of poetry, full of life, humour, and the noblest elements of poetry. I cannot tell you how such poems as """"Arouse the Soul,"""" """"I Dare not Scorn,"""" and others such of which this volume has many, affect me.  It is such writing as this which makes one feel that talent is nobler than birth, and high-mindedness of more worth than gold.'"
