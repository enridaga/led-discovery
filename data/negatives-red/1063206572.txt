"""""The Female Quixote"""" is written by a woman...Lennox her name. Her husband and she have often visited me together. Do you not think, however her heroine over-acts her part, that Arabella is amiable and innocent? The writer has genius. She is hardly twenty four, and has been unhappy. She wrote a piece, called """"Harriet Stuart"""".'"
