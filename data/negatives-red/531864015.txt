"Letter to Miss Reid May 24 1773 'O! how I wished for some one to share a luxury that wealth cannot purchase, and that thousands are not born to taste! """"O! blind to truth, to virtue blind,/ Who slight the sweetly pensive mind,/ On whose birth the graces  mild,/ Ands every Muse prophetic smil?d."""" ... ?There are the spirits born to know and prove,/ All nature?s charms immense, and heavens unbounded love.""""' [ie two separate quotations from the same verse]"
