"William Wordsworth to Francis Wrangham, 19 February 1819: 'I know little of Blackwood's Magazine, and wish to know less.  I have seen in it articles so infamous that I do not chuse to let it enter my doors.  The Publishers sent it to me some time ago, and I begged (civilly you will take for granted) not to be troubled with it any longer.'"
