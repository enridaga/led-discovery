"24pp pamphlet describing a reading by Mrs Fry to the female prisoners at Newgate, at which the author was present. pp.8-9: 'The silence was at length broken by that mild voice which the prisoners had often heard. Mrs Fry began to read from the Bible. She had selected the 12th and 13th chapters of the epistle to the Romans. This selection did honour to her judgement, and while, with distinct articulation, she dwelt upon the more important of the words of Holy writ, every hearer appeared affected. The convicts shewed their interest in the instruction thus afforded them by the eye fixed on the reader, and their anxiety by heads put, as it were, forward to meet the sound, while the eye had the tear quivering on the lash, or the cheek shewed that it had overflowed its bounds. When she had finished the chapters which she had read slowly, to give time to the hearers to receive the words, and to comprehend their meaning, she remained for a few seconds perfectly silent, and the silence was a silence which might be felt.'"
