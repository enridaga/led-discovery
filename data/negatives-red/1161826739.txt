"The review [in the """"Spectator""""] is good is it not.The """"Speaker"""" also reviewed me the same week--Whig and Tory. That is also a good review. Upon the whole the """"Press"""" is good. The provincial papers seem to catch on to """"Jim"""". They sent me cuttings from Ed'gh. The Bradford """"Observer"""" was most appreciative.'  "
