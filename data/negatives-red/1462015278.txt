"I send you with this all Dr. Channing's works, and the little series of four small volumes, in whcih Miss Sedgwick's """"Home"""" is to be found, and I send them very gladly, both because I think them good and because the last of them, """"Gleams of Truth"""", is a practical illustration of the principles touching the relations of the more favoured and less favoured classes of society, which are so ably and so beautifully set forth in the separate sermon of Dr. Channing which I send with them.'"
