"7/1/1827 ? ?Read about eighty pages of a book lent to me by Dr Ash, called ?The grounds of a Holy life?. Believe the author to be a friend in principle, if not in profession. Read Paul?s fine address to Agrippa to the servants; hope they understood it; it explains the nature of grace, and clearly.?"
