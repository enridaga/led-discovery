"With regard to the division of the circle into 360 parts,- I think it cannot be done by elementary Geometry - at least if M. Gauss is right - who (Leslie tells us) has demonstrated that a polygon can be inscribed in a circle - directly - by means of circles and straight lines - only - when the number of its sides is a prime number and can be denoted by 2n + 1.'"
