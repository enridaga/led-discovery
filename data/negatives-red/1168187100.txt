"He continued in the Colledge for the space of nine years, and in all that time (except he went forth a Town to his friends) he was never absent from morning Prayers in the Chappel, which used to be about half an hour after five a clock in the morning; yea, he used to rise so long before he went to the Chappel, as that he gained time for his secret devotions, and for reading his morning task of the Scriptures: For he tyed himself to read every day fifteen Chapters in English out of the Bible,  five in the morning, five after dinner before he fell upon his other studies, and five before he went to bed; he hath been often heard to say, that when he could not sleep in the night time he used in his thoughts to run through divers Chapters of the Scripture in order, as if he had heard them read to him; and by this means he deceived the tediousness of his waking, and deprived himself also sometimes of the sweetness of his sleeping hours, though by that, which administred to him better rest, and greater sweetness; for he preferred the meditation upon the word before his necessary food with Job, and before sleep with David.'
