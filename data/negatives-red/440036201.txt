"I get a library book, """"Dandelion Days"""". Written on the back cover is an extraordinary message deated 15.1.42 at the General Hopsital, thus: """"23.25 - what the hell has the night sister done to me? Injection refused but given some other awful stuff - made to feel like a drunk in five minutes - didn't ask for anything - or injection - God, she's a bitch. Evacuated from Penang and now a thorough defeatist - anti-everything. I feel stewed except the pain in my leg has not gone."""" Signature illegible.'"
