"Mary Berry, Journal, 19 May 1811, on stay with Joanna Baillie at Hampstead: 'Sat by the fire the whole day.  Joanna Baillie gave us her drama upon Hope to read; it is only two acts, and I was soon through it.  Very poetical, and much fancy, as all her things have; but this did not equal my expectation [...] It is certainly a dramatic story, but not dramatically managed.' "
