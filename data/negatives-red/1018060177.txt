"Such a shocked surprise came to me the pther day on opening T.F. Henderson's book on """"Scottish Vernacular Literature"""" to find out what he had to say by way of comment on Hume's """"The Day Estivall"""". I had just been reading this poem again - a poem to which I am often persuaded to return when prompted by a lovely day - and, having its freshness so vividly in my mind, it was all the more astonishing to be confronted by Henderson's contemptuous aside: """"...'The Day Estivall', if absurdly prosaic, is occasionally picturesque.""""'"
