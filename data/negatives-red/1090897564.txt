"Charlie Chaplin was a classic autodidact, always struggling to make up for a dismally inadequate education, groping haphazardly for what he called """"intellectual manna""""... Chaplin could be found in his dressing room studying a Latin-English dictionary, Robert Ingersoll's secularist propaganda, Emerson's """"Self- Reliance"""" (""""I felt I had been handed a golden birthright""""), Irving, Hawthorne, Poe, Whitman, Twain, Hazlitt, all five volumes of Plutarch's Lives, Plato, Locke, Kant, Freud's """"Psychoneurosis"""", Lafcadio Hearn's Life and Literature, and Henri Bergson - his essay on laughter, of course... Chaplin also spent forty years reading (if not finishing) the three volumes of """"The World as Will and Idea"""" by Schopenhauer, whose musings on suicide are echoed in Monsieur Verdoux'."
