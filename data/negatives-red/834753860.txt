"?Joe was never tired of expatiating on the beauties and grandeur of Wordsworth, and my lack of responsiveness must have occasionally surprised him. When he selected some of the shorter poems ? """"The Daffodils"""", """"The Highland Girl"""", """"The Solitary Reaper"""" and other gems ? and invited me to read them aloud, Joe?s quick ear soon detected that I read with the spirit as well as with the understanding, and, thus tutored, I quickly became a devoted Wordsworthian.?"
