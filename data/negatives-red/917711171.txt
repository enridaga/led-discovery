"No &#8722; my ‚ÄúBurns‚Äù is not done yet, it has led me so far afield that I cannot finish it ; every time I think I see my way to an end, some new game (or perhaps wild goose) starts up and away I go. And then again, to be plain, I shirk the work of the critical part, shirk it as a man shirks a long jump. It is awful to have to express and differentiate Burns, in a column or two. All the more as I‚Äôm going to write a book about it. """"Ramsay, Fergusson and Burns: an Essay"""" (or """"A Critical Essay"""" but then I‚Äôm going to give lives of the three gentlemen, only the gist of the book is the criticism) ‚Äúby Robert Louis Stevenson, Advocate, MS., P.P.C., etc.‚Äù How‚Äôs that for cut and dry? And I [italics]could[end italics] write that book. Unless I deceive myself in a superior style, I could write it pretty adequately. I feel as if I was really in it, and knew the game thoroughly'. "
