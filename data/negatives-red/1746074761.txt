"I also read again Silvio Pellico's """"Prisons"""". I read it once at Granton- a lovely book (same edition) and """"Adam Bede"""" and a French Novel and other new works. I like all Adam Bede immensely except the extremely inartistic plot. Geo. Eliot loves to draw self-righteious people with good instincts being led into crime or misery by circumstances.'"
