"In another house I found a tattered copy of Scott's """"Kenilworth"""" and a quite new copy of """"Cranford"""". Among some old books in my grandmother's cottage I found a curious one entitled """"Adam's First Wife"""". This was a sort of history of the Garden of Eden which rather discounted the """"rib theory"""" and raised some doubt in my mind as to Adam's innocence in the pre-apple days.'
