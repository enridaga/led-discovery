"My dear Anna, I hope you do not depend on having your book back again immediately.  I keep it that your G:Mama may hear it - for it has not been possible yet to have any public reading.  I have read it to your Aunt Cassandra however - in our own room at night, while we undressed - and with a great deal of pleasure.'"
