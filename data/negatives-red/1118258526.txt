"I have bought a book lately full of general information, & written in a good spirit - that is containing a happy mixture of religious feeling with Science. Its title is """"Good's Book of Nature"""". Have you heard of it? It is by a Dr Good, an M.D.F.R.S. who delivered Lectures at the London Institution'."
