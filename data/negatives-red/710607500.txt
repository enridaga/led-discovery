"I tell you it [Robinson Crusoe] is a grand book . . . I am reading it a second time, and I think I like it better than I did at first. Every boy should get it. You know how it begins -- that Robinson starts out by saying he was born in the city of York. Now, I would like to know whereabouts in the city of York Robinson was born? I live in York, but I've never seen Robinson's birthplace.'"
