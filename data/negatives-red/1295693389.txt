"Louis Battye, the spastic child of former millworkers, was at first utterly bewildered by the Gem and Magnet, because he was being educated at home and had no school experience of any kind... """"But I persevered and eventually familiarised myself with the conventions of the form... I continued to read the Gem and Magnet religiously until I was fourteen or fifteen, and from them I received what might be called the Schoolboy's Code""""... [which] enabled him to get along with other children when he was sent to Heswall Hospital'."
