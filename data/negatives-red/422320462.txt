"On Friday, June 11, we talked at breakfast, of forms of prayer. JOHNSON. """"I know of no good prayers but those in the 'Book of Common Prayer'"""". DR. ADAMS, (in a very earnest manner): """"I wish, Sir, you would compose some family prayers"""". JOHNSON. """"I will not compose prayers for you, Sir, because you can do it for yourself. But I have thought of getting together all the books of prayers which I could, selecting those which should appear to me the best, putting out some, inserting others, adding some prayers of my own, and prefixing a discourse on prayer"""".'"
