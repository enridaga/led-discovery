"Joanna Baillie to Mary Berry, 9 June 1828: 'I have read your """"View of the Social Life, &c.,"""" twice; and it has lost nothing, but rather gained, on the second perusal.  The style is clear and scholar-like [...] it is written in a good spirit of liberality and rectitude, and it abounds in excellent observations concisely and cleverly expressed' [goes on to express reservations, among these being that Berry's account of Voltaire's mistress Madame du Chatelet """"rather offends as to that delicacy which is expected in the writings of a woman""""]."
