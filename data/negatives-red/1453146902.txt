"All I can say at all likely to give you any pleasure is, that I read poor dear Charles Lamb's Memoirs and Letters with the utmost delight; & not the less so for seeing such continual allusions to one """"H.C. Robinson"""". Do you know such a person? And my dear brother James too, and kind-hearted Martin - these reminiscences were very pleasant to me. But of Lamb himself - what an affectionate disposition - what originality, what true wit, & what a singular, and I must say, melancholy combination of the truest & warmest piety, with the most extraordinary and irreverent profaneness. I cannot understand the union of two such opposites: but I believe there have been many other instances of it. Amongst fools who may take up the work, the oaths and the levity might do harm, & therefore I regret their insertion: but those who knew him, can only regret, & love him [underlined] notwithstanding [ end underlining].'"
