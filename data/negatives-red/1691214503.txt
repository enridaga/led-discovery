It is very painful, and from the impression of pain which, despite its happy ending, it leaves upon one I think it must want some element of peace, but still it is very true, and [italics] very [end italics] suggestive; and a description to the life of the trials of many single women, who waken up some morning to the sudden feeling of the [italics] purposelessness [italics] (is there such a word) of their life. Do read it if it comes yr way.'"
