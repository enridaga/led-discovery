"I was yesterday at Belleim, the winter palace of the King [of Portugal] [...] The house is by no means fine, and did not the garden and other appurtenances atone for it, it would hardly be worth the trouble of going to see, but those indeed are well worthy of a traveller's Notice. This garden contains within it variety enough to satisfy a Sir William Chalmers [sic], and had I not read his account of what a garden ought to be, I should not venture to express all I saw under that single appellation, but tho' it is far from being so extensive as his plan, yet it contains a great deal more than his three natural notes of earth, air and water, water, earth and air.'"
