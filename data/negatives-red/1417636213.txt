"We have got """"Rosanne"""" in our Society, and find it much as you describe it; very good and clever, but tedious.  Mrs Hawkins' great excellence is on serious subjects.  There are some very delightful conversations and reflections on religion: but on lighter topics I think she falls into many absurdities; and, as to love, her heroine has very comical feelings.  There are a thousand improbabilities in the story. Do you remember the two Miss Ormesdens, introduced just at last? Very flat and unnatural. - Mlle Cossart is rather my passion.'"
