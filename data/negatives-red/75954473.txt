"""""This bit of Tennyson sticks in my head; so I write it down: - 'All along the valley where the waters flow / I walked with one I loved two & thirty years ago / All along the valley while I walked today / The two & thirty years were a mist that rolled away / All along the valley by rock & wood & tree / The voice of the dead was a living voice to me'."""""
