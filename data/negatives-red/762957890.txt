"He talked with approbation of an intended edition of """"The Spectator,"""" with notes; two volumes of which had been prepared by a gentleman eminent in the literary world, and the materials which he had collected for the remainder had been transferred to another hand. He observed, that all works which describe manners require notes in sixty or seventy years, or less; and told us he had communicated all he knew that could throw light upon """"The Spectator."""" He said, """"Addison had made his Sir Andrew Freeport a true Whig, arguing against giving charity to beggars, and throwing out other such ungracious sentiments; but that he had thought better, and made amends by making him found an hospital for decayed farmers."""" He called for the volume of """"The Spectator,"""" in which that account is contained, and read it aloud to us. He read so well that every thing acquired additional weight and grace from his utterance.'"
