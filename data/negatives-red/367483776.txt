"?There was and is so judicious a blending of light and heavy literature in """"Chambers?s Journal"""" that their periodical has helped to educate, inform and entertain many generations of the British public. Whenever it came in my way, as it did sometimes, I revelled in its pages. The """"Penny Magazine"""" also was a great delight on the rare occasions that I saw it. But I remember best the """"Family Herald"""", """"Reynolds?s Miscellany"""", and Lloyd?s penny dreadfuls.?"
