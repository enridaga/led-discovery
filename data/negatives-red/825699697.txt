"Did you ever read """"Emma"""", a novel of Miss Austen's? I have seen three or four [italics] Harriet Smiths [end italics] taken up and let down again, and you not being a [italics] Harriet Smith [end italics], your [italics] good genius [end italics] would rather you were not of the number. The present inmate is, I acknowledge, rather of the [italics] Miss Jane Fairfax [end italics] class, and the first I have known so favoured... Oh! how I wish (and have long wished) for the [italics] Mr Knightly [sic, end italics] to come and take the government on his own shoulders, then everything would go on as it ought... which proves me to be something like a romantic old fool.'"
