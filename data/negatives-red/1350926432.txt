"During this period my indebtedness to an eighteenth-century poet became enormous.  At every spare moment I read Young‚Äôs ‚ÄúNight Thoughts on Life, Death and Immortality‚Äù, and I felt the benefit of this grave and intellectual voice speaking out of a profound eighteenth‚Äìcentury calm, often in metaphor which came home to one even in a pillbox. The mere amusement of discovering lines applicable to our crisis kept me from despair.'"
