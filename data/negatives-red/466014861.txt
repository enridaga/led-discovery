"In the order and government of his Family,  he was very exemplary. His house was another Bethel, for he did not onely constantly upon conscientious principles use morning and evening Prayer and reading the sacred Scriptures in his Family; but also he catechized his children, and servants, wherein God gave him a singular gift for their edification; for in teaching them he used not any set form, but so, as that he brought them whom he instructed, to express the principles taught them in their own words; so that his children (as Gregory Nazianzen saith of his Father) found him as well a spiritual as a natural Father."
