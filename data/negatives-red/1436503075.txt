"Harriet Martineau on inspirations and research for her story 'Settlers at Hoime': 'Tait's Magazine of last year had an article of De Quincy's which made me think of snow-storms for a story: -- then it occurred to me that floods were less hackneyed [...] Floods suggested Lincolnshire for the scene, and Lauder's book (Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's """"Floods in Morayshire,"""" read many years before) for the material.  For Lincolnshire I looked into the Penny Cyclopedia, and there found references to other articles'. "
