"Horace Walpole to Mary Berry, 10 July 1789: 'I enclose a most beautiful copy of verses which Miss H[annah]. More wrote very lately when she was with [the Bishop of London] ...] at Fulham, on his opening a walk to a bench called Bonner's.  Mrs. Boscawen showed them to me, and I insisted on printing them.  Only 200 copies are taken off, half for her and half for the printer, and you have one of the first.'"
