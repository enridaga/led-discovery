"William Wordsworth to Felicia Hemans, 20 April 1834, thanking her for the gift of a copy of her """"National Lyrics and Songs for Music"""": 'many of the Pieces had fallen in my way before they were collected; and had given me more or less pleasure [...] the pleasure is yet to come of perusing your Pieces in succession.  I can only say that whenever I have peeped into the volume -- I have been well recompensed. This morning I glanced my eye over the Pilgrim Song to the evening Star with great pleasure.'  "
