"Karnak which I chose for our first day has thoroughly answered... The Prince had already suggested what had already occured to me and was arranged with General Bruce, that our service at Thebes should be in some tomb or temple.

It was, I must say, a striking scene. In the furtherest aisles of that vast Cathedral were herded together the horses, dromedaries, asses, and their attendants. In the shade of the two gigantic pillars, seated on a mass of broken stones, were ourselves, two or three stray travellers, and the servants in the background. The Prince expressed great pleasure at the sermon, and begged to have a copy of it. It was on the good and evil of the old Egyptian religion.'"
