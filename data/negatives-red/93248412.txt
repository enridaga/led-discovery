"Miss Edg[e]worth must not be run down because she has like most people misunderstood her own powers--she never can pretend to any thing that is the least [particle?] of Genius she has not one single spark of it which time or opportunity could kindle--but in its place I think she has a very reasoning head much Humour, & great discrimination--she paints like the Dutch school true to the life--I only quarrel with her choice--she introduces us to the society of those who are disagreeable & she delineates characters we regret ever to meet with--like Crabbe she delights in drawing mediocrity vulgarity & meanness--this can never please--in her present production--there is more than an ordinary share of it--& no great humour to make up--no interest to carry us through--I for one cannot finish it but those more persevering will'."
