"[...] the volume [""""Charity""""] which on my first visit to London in many months I carried off home. From the first word of the wonderful preface to the last short sketch of the Pampa as it was, it has been one huge delight. Of course some of these stries--gems--I've read (The incomparable """"Aurora"""" is a long time ago first) but the cumulative effect is magnificent in its pictorial force and emotional power.'"
