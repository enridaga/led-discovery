Jackson notes pencilled parodic completions by unknown (apparently male) reader of verses in The New School of Love, """"a tiny Scottish chapbook of the kind sold by itinerant peddlers to the poorest readers ... [a] closely printed little book of just twenty-four pages ... a guide to the arts of courtship, including the significance of marks on different parts of the body and the meaning of dreams ... [and including] model love letters, love songs ... [etc]."""""
