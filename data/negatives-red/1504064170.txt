"We have had a very blowing night [...] I was set this morning very gingerly by the fire-side in an elbow chair I had made lash to for me close by the Cabin Stove, with my back to the door. I had taken up a book and was reading as composedly as if sitting in my closet. I did not however enjoy this calm situation long, for presently I heard a rumbling just behind me [...] what was my surprize, when the cabin-door burst open and I was overwhelmed with an immense wave, which broke my chair from its moorings [...] I found myself swimming amongst joint-stools, chests, Tables and all the various furniture of our parlour.'"
