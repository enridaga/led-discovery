"The other day for a treat Charlie got me La Petite Comtesse to read.  I never was more delighted with any story.  It is so beautifully and pathetically written, but so sad that it made me miserable.  I shan't read any more books.  For a whole day after I had finished my charming petite comtesse, I found I took not the faintest interest in any of my household duties, and wanted only to sit by the fire and read, read, read, all through my life.'"
