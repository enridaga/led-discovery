"[letter from Mrs Ward to Reginald Smith] I heard such pleasing things about """"David [Grieve]"""" from Lord Arran in Dublin the other day. He knows it absolutely by heart, and he says that when he was campaigning in South Africa two battered copies of """"David"""" were read to pieces by him and his brother-officers, and every night they discussed it round the camp fires'."
