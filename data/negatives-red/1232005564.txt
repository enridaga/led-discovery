"Mrs Pole wrote, """"There is a particular satisfaction in reading all Miss A-s works - they are so evidently written by a Gentlewoman - most Novellists [sic] fail & betray themselves in attempting to describe familiar scenes in high Life, some little vulgarism escapes & shews that they are not experimentally acquainted with what they describe, but here it is quite different.  Everything is natural, & the situations & incidents are told in a manner which clearly evinces the Writer to [italics] belong [end italics] to the Society whose Manners she so ably delineates.""""  Mrs Pole also said that no Books had ever occasioned so much canvassing & doubt, & that everybody was desirous to attribute them to some of their own friends, or to some person of whom they thought highly.'"
