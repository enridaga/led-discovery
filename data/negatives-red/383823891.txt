"Thomas Carter [a nineteenth-century Colchester and London tailor] wrote of """"The Seasons"""" that, """"With the exception of the Bible, I know not that I ever read any other book so attentively and regularly.  Its beautiful descriptions of nature were delightful to my imagination, while its fine moral reflections [...] were, as I believe, greatly instrumental in promoting my best interests""""'. "
