"[On hot summer afternoons Carter took shelter in the shaded parts of Hyde Park or Kensington Gardens] 'In the latter I remember to have passed one afternoon in a very pleasant way. I sat in a quiet, well-shaded spot, where I had the benefit of a cool atmosphere, and read once more Dr Beattie's """"Minstrel"""" - a poem which pleases me now quite as much as it did then. It is one of the poems of which I am never weary; from which circumstance alone, were there no other evidence, I should be led to infer that it is true poetry - the poetry of the heart no less than the imagination.'"
