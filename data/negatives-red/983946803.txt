"I started to read """"Bleak House"""" by Dickens when I was at the base and I should like to get on with it. You might get a small 1/- edition and send it on it will you as I have a bit of time when not in the trenches ... Don't forget to send the Daily Post occasionally so I can see what's happening in B'ham.'"
