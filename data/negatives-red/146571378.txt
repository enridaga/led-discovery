"I can only tell you, that if you please to read Sir Paul Rycaut, you will there find a full and true account of the viziers, the [italics] beglerbeys [italics], the civil and spiritual government, the officers of the seraglio, &c., things that 'tis very easy to procure lists of, and therefore may be depended on; though other stories, God knows - I say no more - every body is at liberty to write their own remarks; the manners of people may change, or some of them escape the observation of travellers, but 'tis not the same of the government; and for that reason, since I can tell you nothing new, I will tell nothing of it.'"
