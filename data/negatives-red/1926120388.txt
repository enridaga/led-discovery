"What I've thought of most to-day, and it has been running in my mind all the time, for we had to learn it by heart, is Rupert Brooke's <i>The Soldier</i>. I cannot feel like that. I do not want my body to rot away under this field, with its yellow earth and thin, pale grass. Perhaps Brooke could feel like that because he'd <i>had</i> something in this world. He'd been to Berlin, and he'd had lovely warm afternoons in Cambridgeshire ... and he's had time to enjoy things. <i>I</i> have never had time to think. I have had <i>nothing, nothing</i> ... Rupert Brooke had longer than I've had to see things and enjoy them. He was ten years older than I am now.' "
