"Mary Berry, 'Notes of Early Life': 'My dear grandmother [...] made me read the Psalms and chapters to her every morning; but, as neither explanation nor comment was made upon them, nor their history followed up in any way, I hated the duty and escaped it when I could.  The same consequence took place by the same dear parent making me read every Sunday to her a Saturday paper in the """"Spectator,"""" which, till the middle of life, prevented my ever looking at those exquisite essays, or being aware of the beauties of the volumes they were in.'
