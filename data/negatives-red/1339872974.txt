"The B-Block strip of grass between the high wall and the passage is now open. It is to be a haven of peace for readers and others. There is to be no talking. So there is a notice: """"B-Sanctuary. Do not pluck the flowers or disturb the wildlife. You may sleep, but do not snore. Keep your B-trap shut. Silence is golden. Gather riches here"""".'"
