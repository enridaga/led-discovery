"Thank you for the Atlas. The Guardian (Puseyite) has been very busy praising M[oorland] C[ottage] too. I hope the Times will be so kind as to leave it alone; for I think it would be a disgrace to be praised by the man who wrote that review of Mr Thackeray. Dr Whewell wrote that review in Fraser I believe; and I have received a very complimentary note from him as well'."
