"?I have waited to thank you for your book till I had read it & write now ? before having quite finished ? because I can talk best with my pen & would rather anticipate tomorrow. I am, as you know, quite unable to criticize the substance. I am greatly ignorant of history & of that part of history beyond nearly all others. I can, however, see that you have got through an amount of work wh. amazes me? I thought well of you; but you have quite surpassed my expectations.?"
