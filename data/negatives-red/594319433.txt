"I have many things I should like to say to the writer of the remarks on 'Mary Barton' which Miss Mitchell has sent me, and which I conjecture were written by your husband? Those remarks and the note which accompanied have given me great and real pleasure. I have heard much about the disapproval which Mr Greg's family have felt with regard to 'M.B.', and have heard of it with so much regret that I am particularly glad that Mr Sam Greg does not participate in it.'"
