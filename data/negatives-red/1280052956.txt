"Dorothy Wordsworth to Sara Hutchinson, 8 April 1815, on following progress of Napoleon in British press: 'Those villainous Sunday newspapers are my abhorrence - I read in one the other day the following sentiment """"Surely it would be wise that the Allies should at length give Buonaparte time to show whether he is sincere or not!""""  In other words give him time to be quite prepared to fence himself in his wickedness.'"
