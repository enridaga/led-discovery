"Last summer, being in Taunton, at the house of Mr J Smith, brother to my first wife, his son brought in a parcel of those religious tracts which are published by the Religious Tract Society, and sold cheap by T. Williams, Stationer's-court, Ludgate-street, London. . . I was much pleased with an opportunity of procuring some of them. I took one of each of more than thirty sorts; and when I got home, Mrs L and I read them over together, in order to know if they were proper to be dispersed abroad, and whether they were calculated to do good to such as should read them.'"
