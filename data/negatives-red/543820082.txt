"At about age fifteen [Joseph Barker] found an old folio on anatomy and surgery by Helkiah Crooke (physician to James I) and was delighted by """"certain parts of the work which treated on subjects whichare generally wrapt in mystery by people, and which my [Yorkshire Methodist] parents would have been least disposed for me to think about or understand."""" When he indiscreetly shared his knowledge with some friends, there was a general uproar and even death-threats. His angry parents confiscated the book then returned it """"on condition that I would paste up two particular parts of it. But I soon took the liberty to break loose the sealed-up parts, and read them again"""".' "
