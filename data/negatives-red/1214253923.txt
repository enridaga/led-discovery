"In the lower part of the newsagent's windows were the journals that catered for me. By would be reformers they were lumped together as """"penny dreadfuls"""". One was """"Deadwood Dick"""" -a cowboy who was always bumping off people in Deadman's Gulch or Gallow's Ravine, The reformers told me that my mind would become brutalised by reading Penny Dreadfuls... Besides """"Deadwood Dick"""" in the shop window there was """"Bronco Bill"""", with stories of a similar type. And there was """"Jack Wright"""".'"
