" """"Impressions and experiences which are important for the man may take no place in the poetry, and those which become important in the poetry may play quite a negligible part in the man, the personality."""" This [T. S. Eliot, Sacred Wood, p52] seems sound, but """"emotions which he has never experienced will serve his turn as well as those familiar to him"""" is surely nonsense. He recovers in """"Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But of course only those who have personality and emotions know what it means to want to escape from those things.""""'"
