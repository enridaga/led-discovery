"One of your brothers was brought to a liking of reading by my putting some Books which I had told amusing stories out of, in a place where they were difficultly come at and desiring that none of you might be allowed to spoil my books with your dirty Thumbs while I was abroad. He read them in a few daies [sic] and has continued to be fond of reading ever since.'"
