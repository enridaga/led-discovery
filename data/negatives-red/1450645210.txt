"My companions at the breakfast-table through this summer were many of our popular English Classics.  Among these may be enumerated """"The Death of Abel"""" which I read emphatically aloud.  Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, Pope's Homer, Cicero's Letters, Elizabeth, or the Exile of Siberia, Dr Johnson's Rasselas, with many other works of established reputation."
