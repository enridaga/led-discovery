"After all my contrivances I found but little convenience for reading, except on the Sunday. I always kept a book in my pocket, that it might be at hand in case I should find a few spare minutes. In general, I managed to read a few pages while going to and from the workshop. This, however, was a somewhat difficult affair, as my path led me through some of the busiest streets and places in the city: and I hardly need say that these are not the most favourable localities for a thoughtful reader, especially if what he chooses to read demands any thing like close attention. It was while standing at a bookstall that I read with the most advantage. I took care to avail myself of this as often, and for as long a time as possible; and from these out-of-door libraries picked up a few - perhaps a good many - scraps of useful or amusing information.'"
