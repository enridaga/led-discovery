"I read Mr. Beverley?s pamphlets which Mr. Boyd had lent to me; the letter to the Archbishop of York, & the Tombs of the prophets. ? They are clever & forcible; coarse enough, & in some places too highly colored.  For instance, I do not believe that the body of the established clergy are as much opposed to the reading of the scriptures, as the papistical clergy are; and I do know instances of members of that body, refusing the sacrament to persons of immoral character?"
