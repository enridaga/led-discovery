"Byron to John Hanson, 11 July 1815: 'Dear Sir -- I have called about my Will -- which I hope is nearly ready. -- I also wish to have the robe and sword sent up to my house -- and the Pedigree this last must be looked for immediately -- I recollect perfectly seeing it at your house -- and trust that it is not lost or mislaid -- as it is not only a document of importance but beautiful and valuable as a piece of work from the inlaid engravings upon it.'
