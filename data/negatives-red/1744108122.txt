"As I was reading with Susan and Sophy today in Rollin's Grecian History it struck me, that when Mardonius offered Terms to the Athenians & Aristides rejected 'em; he stretched out his hands to the Sun, & appealing to that Luminary - [italics] doubtless as God of the Persians [italics] for what had he to do with the Sun in particular? he called upon him to revenge the Grecian Cause upon his Worshippers. These Bramin & Persees being here in England turns everybody's Head now like [italics] Clytie's [end italics] to the [italics] Sun [end italics]. We are all deep for the Time forsooth in Persian Mythology.'"
