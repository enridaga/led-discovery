"?Do you sympathise with me when I say that the only writer whom I have been able to read with pleasure through this nightmare is Wordsworth? I used not to care for him especially; but now I love him. He is so thoroughly manly & tender & honest as far as his lights go that he seems to me the only consoler. I despise most of your religious people, who cultivate their maudlin humours &   despise even more your sentimentalist of the atheist kind; but old W. W. is a genuine human being, whom I respect.?"
