"I return you the Quarterly Reveiw [sic] with many Thanks. The Authoress of """"Emma"""" has no reason I think to complain of her treatment in it - except in the total omission of Mansfield Park. - I cannot but be sorry that so clever a Man as the Reveiwer [sic] of """"Emma"""" should consider it as unworthy of being noticed.'"
