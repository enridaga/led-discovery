"I thank you for your Letter & Mr Scott's Treatise. True! I agree with him in his principal Idea, though even there I do not like the Expression that Regeneration must precede Faith, but it is his Intricacy and his so strongly contending that Things must be as he has stated. There is too much of the Logician & though he is in Earnest, It is with the spirit of one who Fights for the Truth & loves the Fighting. He narrows the way & then what plain unlettered Christian is able to comprehend his Meaning? I do not say He is wrong, but I have no Doubt of there being many who differ very much from him & yet [5X] equal Reasons may be urged for them. In fact tho' I can but accord with Mr Scott on the Nature of saving Faith as distinguished from unproductive Belief, yet there is much in his tract which I do not understand & not a little which I cannot agreed to. see his Definition of Faith Page 9-10'"
