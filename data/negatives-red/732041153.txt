"Mary Berry to a friend, 19 November 1798: 'Don't let me forget to advise you to to read the """"Natural Son,"""" or """"Lovers' Vows;"""" it is the entire and literal translation of the play which is now acting with such success at Covent Garden, but [italics]not[end italics] as it is acted; you can get it at Todd's [bookseller's], where I did, to read in the chaise.  I think it quite charming, and it affected me much [...] You must allow for German manners and for the (at all times) sad disguise of a translation.'"
