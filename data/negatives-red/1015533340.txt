"Birkbeck's second book is not so good as his first. He deceives himself - says he wishes to deceive himself - and is not candid. If a man chuses to say: I will live up to my neck in mud, fight bears, swim in rivers, and combat with backwoodsmen that I may ultimately gain an independence for myself and my children, this is plain, and intelligible: but by Birkbeck's account it is much like settling at Putney or Kew, only the people are more liberal and enlightened'."
