"Lord Francis Jeffrey to Mary Berry, 23 April 1842 (in letter begun 22 April): 'I still read a good deal [...] I have just finished the last number of the """"Edinburgh Review,"""" and have been charmed more than ever, I think, with that splendid paper of Macaulay's on Frederic of Prussia.  I have read it twice over already, with thrillings of admiration whcih make my very weak heart leap rather too strongly; but it is delightful.'"
