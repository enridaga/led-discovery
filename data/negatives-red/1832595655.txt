"Henry James to Thomas Sergeant Perry, from home of host family in Bonn, Sunday 5 August 1860: """"[on Wednesday morning] I sat down to read [in the study] till our room should be made ready for me to go in and set to work.  I looked over an old volume of the 'British Chronicle,' a lot of bound weekly newspapers of the time of Byron, Shelley, Tom Moore and Walter Scott and which I had discovered in a corner the night before.  Then I finished the Letters of Lady M. W. Montague  which I had commenced a few days before from curiosity and had continued from interest."""""
