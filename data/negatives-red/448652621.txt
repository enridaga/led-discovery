"There was one German scholar with whom she had at any rate a lengthy correspondence - Dr Adolf Julicher, of Marburg, whose monumental work on the New Testament she presented one day in a moment of enthusiasm, to her younger daughter [the author] (aged seventeen), suggesting that she should translate it into English. The daughter dutifully obeyed, devoting the best part of three years to the task - only to find, when the work was all but finished, that the German professor had in the meantime brought out a new edition of his book, running to some 100 pages of additional matter. Dismay reigned at Stocks, but there was no help for it: the additional 100 pages had to be tackled. In the end Mrs Ward herself seized on the proofs and went all through them, pen in hand; little indeed was left of the daughter's unlucky sentences by the time the process was complete.'"
