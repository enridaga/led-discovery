"My arrival interrupted for a little while the important business of this true representative of Bayes[a clergyman who wanted Johnson's opinions on his literary works]; upon its being resumed, I found that the subject under immediate consideration was a translation, yet in manuscript, of the """"Carmen Seculare"""" of Horace, which had this year been set to musick, and performed as a publick entertainment in London, for the joint benefit of Monsieur Philidor and Signor Baretti. When Johnson had done reading, the authour asked him bluntly, """"If upon the whole it was a good translation?"""" Johnson, whose regard for truth was uncommonly strict, seemed to be puzzled for a moment, what answer to make; as he certainly could not honestly commend the performance: with exquisite address he evaded the question thus, """"Sir, I do not say that it may not be made a very good translation."""" Here nothing whatever in favour of the performance was affirmed, and yet the writer was not shocked. A printed """"Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain"""", came next in review; the bard was a lank bony figure, with short black hair; he was writhing himself in agitation, while Johnson read, and shewing his teeth in a grin of earnestness, exclaimed in broken sentences, and in a keen sharp tone, """"Is that poetry, Sir?--Is it Pindar?"""" JOHNSON. """"Why, Sir, there is here a great deal of what is called poetry"""".'"
