"He [Evelyn] read to me very much also of his discourse he hath been many years and now is about, about Guardenage; which will be a most noble and pleasant piece. He read me part of a play or two of his making, very good, but not as he conceits them, I think, to be. He showed me his """"Hortus hyemalis""""; leaves laid up in a book of several plants. kept dry, which preserve Colour however, and look very finely, better than any herball... He read me, though with too much gusto, some little poems of his own, that were not transcendent, yet one or two very pretty Epigrams: among others, of a lady looking in at a grate and being pecked at by an eagle that was there.'"
