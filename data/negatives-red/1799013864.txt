"I have not read 'La Gar√ßonne'.  I got about half way through it and then I had to give up, not because of its indecency but because it its dullness, poorness, and badness.  The indecency is only episodic, but I have never read such indecency in the work of a reputable author published by a reputable firm.  . . . It has also to be remembered that M. Margueritte has written, whether alone or in collaboration with his late brother, several novels of genuine importance, such as 'Le D√©sastre'. "
