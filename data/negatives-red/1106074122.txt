"I finished Keats?s Lamia, Isabella, Eve of St Agnes & Hyperion, before breakfast.  The three first disappointed me.  The extracts I had seen of them, were undeniably the finest things in them.  But there is some surprising poetry ? poetry of wonderful grandeur, in the Hyperion.  The effect of the appearance of Hyperion, among the ruined Titans, is surpassingly fine.  Poor poor Keats.  His name shall be in my ?Poets Record.?  "
