" [Macaulay's marginalia at the end of Cicero's last Philippic]: """"As a man, I think of Cicero much as I always did, except that I am more disgusted with his conduct after Caesar's death.  I really think that he met with little more than his deserts from the Triumvirs.  It is quite certain, as Livy says, that he suffered nothing more than he would have inflicted."""""
