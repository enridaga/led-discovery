"Talking of the Reviews, Johnson said, """"I think them very impartial: I do not know an instance of partiality"""". He mentioned what had passed upon the subject of the """"Monthly"""" and """"Critical Reviews"""", in the conversation with which his Majesty had honoured him. He expatiated a little more on them this evening. """"The Monthly Reviewers (said he) are not Deists; but they are Christians with as little christianity as may be; and are for pulling down all establishments. The Critical Reviewers are for supporting the constitution both in church and state. The Critical Reviewers, I believe, often review without reading the books through; but lay hold of a topick, and write chiefly from their own minds. The Monthly Reviewers are duller men, and are glad to read the books through"""".' "
