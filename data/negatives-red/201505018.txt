"[Mrs Ward's report of a conversation with Gladstone] 'I spoke of Pattison's autobiography as illustrating Newman's hold. He agreed, but said that Pattison's religious phase was so disagreeable and unattractive that it did small credit to Newman. He would much like to have seen more of the autobiography, but he understood that the personalities were too strong. I asked him if he had seen Pattison's last 'Confession of Faith', which Mrs Pattison decided not to print, in MS. He said no.'"
