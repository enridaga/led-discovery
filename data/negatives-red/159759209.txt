"Weeton's reading becomes important in communication with friends, but also a point of conflict: when she visits her brother and his wife, they complain that she spends all her time reading, though she insists that she read very little (""""only... Gil Blas, now and then a newspaper, two or three of Lady M. W. Montagu's letters, and <i>few</i> pages in a magazine'), and only because her hosts rose so late. Since her literacy is important as a sign of status, she repeatedly presents herself not as a reader of low status texts like novels but of travels, education works, memoirs and letters, including Boswell's """"Tour of the Hebrides"""", the Travels of Mungo Park, and Mme de Genlis' work. She approves some novels, like Hamilton's """"The Cottagers of Glenburnie"""", but generally finds them a """"dangerous, facinating kind of amusement"""" which """"destroy all relish for useful, instructive studies'."
