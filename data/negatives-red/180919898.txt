"I expressed a liking for Mr. Francis Osborne's works, and asked him what he thought of that writer. He answered, """"A conceited fellow. Were a man to write so now, the boys would throw stones at him."""" He, however, did not alter my opinion of a favourite authour, to whom I was first directed by his being quoted in """"The Spectator,"""" and in whom I have found much shrewd and lively sense, expressed indeed in a style somewhat quaint, which, however, I do not dislike. His book has an air of originality. We figure to ourselves an ancient gentleman talking to us.'"
