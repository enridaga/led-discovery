"I received your book some time ago, from the publishers.  My life is made terrible by my 'Evening Standard' article.  When I took the job on it was clearly understood that I should be absolutely free to review or not to review or not to review, just as I chose.  I cannot read all the books which I ought to read, nor even 10% of them.  Often I am so puzzled how to be fair that I ignore a whole lot of books and write about some general subject. It is a way out."
