"When you have time & spirits for it, pray read """"Sketches by Boz"""" with Cruikshank's designs. Except ones daily Scripture reading, I like no books that do not make me laugh, provided the laugh is not provoked by anything bordering upon indecency. - A little innocent vulgarity or even coarseness, I do not mind, if accompanied by wit & humour. Dickens has edited a delightful Life of poor dear Grimaldi. Have you seen Benson Earl Hill's """"Recollections of an Artillery Officer""""? I was much amused by it.'"
