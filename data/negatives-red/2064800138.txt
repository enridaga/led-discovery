"When I first ventured to write a sentence for publication, having a deep sense of my profound ignorance of the rules of punctuation, I applied myself to the study of Lindley Murray's grammar -- then the one accepted authority for English people.  He gave seventeen rules for the right placing of the comma, and I thought it my duty to endeavour to master them.  But my patience did not hold out [...] I threw aside the seventeen rules of punctuation, and in their stead placed on one mental page the simple definitions of the respective values of periods, colons, semi-colons, and commas which I had learnt as a child, and then took which ever common sense and observation pointed out as suitable to my purpose; and in the end I found that I had escaped any special criticism.'"
