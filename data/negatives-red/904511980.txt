"?Talking of books, you will perhaps be in the way of seeing a volume of Essays on Reform just published. You may find there some remarks by one you know on American experiences. I always think impudent in any one (let alone Dixon) to talk about a big country on the strength of 3 months experience & I admit that the remarks of the other author are open to this objection. Still they are chiefly directed to the negative conclusion that an argument from the US to England is necessarily unsafe & often directly fallacious? There is a more positive article by Goldwyn Smith on America & one or two of the other essays are worth reading especially one by Cracroft (nominally & really as to the facts by Goschen) giving an analysis of the House of Commons, wh. I think you would find instructive.? "
