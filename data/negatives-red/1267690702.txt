"[Wordsworth's] first mention of ... [Francis Jeffrey, review of Robert Southey, Thalaba, in the Edinburgh Review 1 (Oct 1802)] comes in a letter of Jan. 1804 to [John] Thelwall ... """"That review of Thalaba I never read entirely, having only seen it in a Country Bookseller's shop, who would not permit me to cut open the Leaves, as he only had it upon trial.""""'"
