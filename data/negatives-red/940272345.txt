"You say [in Walpole's critical study """"Joseph Conrad""""(1916)] that I have been under the formative influence of """"Madame Bovary"""". In fact I have read it only after finishing """"A.[Almayer's] F.[Folly]"""" as I did all the other works of Flaubert; and anyway my Flaubert is the Flaubert of """"St. Antoine"""" and """"Ed[ucation] Sent[imentale]"""" and that only from the point of view of rendering of concrete things and visual impressions.'"
