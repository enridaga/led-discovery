So he thought, as I had been those years in school, I ought to read a bit to him -- and I couldn't . . . But somehow, by trying to read to him, I came across little bits which made me interested, and I took to the newspapers in the end. The more I got on the more interested I was, and I got hold of an old 'Robinson Crusoe' -- I was nineteen when I read 'Robinson Crusoe'."
