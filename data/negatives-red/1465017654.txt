"If one read at all one was soon noticed. I lay in bed one night with a book I had bought at Smith's. They had a shop near our hut in Catterick Camp. It was S. R. Crockett's <i>The Smugglers</i>. I was snuggling down in my blanket and enjoying the look of printed pages and only wishing for quietness to read. A cinder fell on my bed. I glanced up but no one was looking my way. This happened two or three times, till one hit my face and fell on the book. I just caught Simpson as I looked up. He was a potter's lad from Hanley. I got out of bed and went for him. He had no idea of boxing, and I could hit him anywhere. He was swinging and kicking all the time. The hut was in an uproar. They were all for him ... Someone kicked me in the ribs as I crawled back to bed. My face was like a melon at one side next morning.'"
