"?My Godmother sone [sic] provided me a testament but my mother not being able to Read the first Chapter of St Matthews Gospel I began the second and read it through as well as she could teach me and then I began it again and Read through the 4 gospels and by this time I begun to enquire into the meaning of that which I Read and my mother taught me something of the meaning thereof as far as she knew and I was somehow affected with the sufferings of Christ because I thought it was great Cruelty but I knew nothing of Christ thereof after this book I took a fancy to Read the Bible and began the first Chapter of Genesis but I did not those Chapters with hard names but when I Came to the history of Joseph and his Breathern [sic] I was very much affected with their Cruelty towards him.?
