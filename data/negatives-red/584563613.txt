"I have not read """"Self control"""", and am determined not to read it, till my own eternal rubbish is concluded. I was a week in the house, at John Street with the two first volumes, but never looked at them. Miss Jardine lent them there. She spent a sociable evening with us, and made me laugh by observing that the book began with a sort of ravishment that almost enclined her to shut it up after the first forty pages, and never to open it again. Sister Burney likes it; not the ravishment but the tout ensemble; but thinks the last volume flags.'"
