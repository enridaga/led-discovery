"Dear Miss Mitford, I rejoice in finding an occasion to address you, that I may express the very great pleasure both my husband and myself have always derived from your writing.  We know your """"village"""" and all its crofts, and lanes and people, and we wish we had the happiness of peronally knowing you.'"
