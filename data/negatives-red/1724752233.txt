"Henry James, in letter to Edmund Gosse, 9 November 1912, mentions 'having recently read [...] [Andrew Lang's] (in two or three respects so able) Joan of Arc, or Maid of France, and turned over his just-published (I think posthumous) compendium of """"English Literature"""" [...] The extraordinary inexpensiveness and childishness and impertinence of this latter gave to my sense the measure of a whole side of Lang [goes on to attack Lang's """"Scotch provincialism""""]'."
