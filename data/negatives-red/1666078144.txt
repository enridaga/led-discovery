"Byron to Francis Hodgson, 8 December 1811: 'I have gotten a book by Sir William Drummond (printed, but not published), entitled Oedipus Judaicus, in which he attempts to prove the greater part of the Old Testament an allegory, particularly Genesis and Joshua.  He professes himself a theist in the preface, and handles the literal interpretation very roughly.  I wish I could see it.  Mr Ward has lent it me, and I confess it is worth fifty Watsons.'"
