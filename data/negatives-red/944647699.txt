"Henry James to Charles Eliot Norton, 15 November 1893: """"The two beautiful volumes of dear J[ames] R[ussell] L[owell] constitute a gift for the substantial grace of which I lose as little time as possible in affectionately thanking you ... I have read the whole thing with absorption and with a delightful illusion [of Lowell's being present]."""""
