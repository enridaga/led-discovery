"JOHNSON. """"O! Mr. Dilly-you must know that an English Benedictine Monk at Paris has translated """"The Duke of Berwick's Memoirs"""", from the original French, and has sent them to me to sell. I offered them to Strahan, who sent them back with this answer:--""""That the first book he had published was the Duke of Berwick's Life, by which he had lost: and he hated the name.""""--Now I honestly tell you, that Strahan has refused them; but I also honestly tell you, that he did it upon no principle, for he never looked into them"""". DILLY. """"Are they well translated, Sir?"""" JOHNSON. """"Why, Sir, very well--in a style very current and very clear"""".'"
