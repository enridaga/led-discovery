"The clerk who cashes my cheques at the bank is quite a bright, intelligent-looking boy. To-day I had a copy of [italics] Bouvard et Pecuchet [end italics]. He looked at it with curiosity then said """"I expect you think I'm rude, looking like that. But I used to read a lot of those sorts of books once"""" """"What sort of books?"""" """"Oh, yellow books like that. I picked up a lot in a booksellers. But mine were much bigger than that"""" """"What were they?"""" """"Oh I don't remember their names or what they were about"""" """"Do you remember the authors?"""" """"Can't say I do. I seem to remember one was some sort of a Japanese story"""" """"And they were in French?"""" """"Oh yes, in French of course"""".'"
