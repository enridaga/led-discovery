"Byron to John Murray, 2 April 1817: 'There have been two Articles in the Venice papers one a review of C. Lamb's """"Glenarvon"""" ... the other a review of C[hilde] Har[ol]d in whiich it proclaims me the most rebellious and contumacious Admmirer of Buonaparte -- now surviving in Europe; -- both these Articles are translations from the literary Gazette of German Jena ... they are some weeks old ... I have conserved these papers as curiosities.'"
