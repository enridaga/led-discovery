" [Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Plato's Euthydemus]: """"It seems incredible that these absurdities of Dionysodorus and Euthydemus should have been mistaken for wisdom, even by the weakest of mankind.  I can hardly help thinking that Plato has overcharged the portrait.  But the humour of the dialogue is admirable."""""
