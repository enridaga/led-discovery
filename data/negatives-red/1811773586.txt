"My dear Miss Mitford, May I be permitted to address thus familiarly a lady with whom, though not personally acquainted, I have long been on terms of intimacy, and for whom I have felt the most lively sentiments of regard and esteem.  Ever since I had the pleasure of being a fellow contributor of yours in the Ladies? Magazine, I have most anxiously wished for an introduction to you, but was deterred from seeking an opportunity of making myself known by the consciousness of my own obscurity?When, however, I became an inhabitant of the house in Hans Place, which I knew to be the scene of your juvenile days, from the description given in the """"Boarding School Recollections,"""" and began to entertain a hope that my intimacy with Miss Landon and the acquaintance of Miss Skerrit would sanction my long-cherished wish?.'"
