"Did you ever read """"The City of the Plague""""? If you have, did you not regret that so many passages, such pure poetry, tenderness, and sublimity are mixed with descriptions that would almost prevent one from ever re-opening the volume.  Plague and famine are fine subjects for the Muse, but she need not give one a medical detail of their physical horrors.'"
