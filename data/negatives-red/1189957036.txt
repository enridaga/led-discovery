"I have seen a newspaper published by the [Wilmington] committee's order, where the whole story of the battle [of Bunker Hill] is denied, tho' it is said that the Americans had made an attack on us and killed many of our officers, amongst others they mentioned Major Pitcairn. I hope it is not the Pitcairn that was married to a Miss Dalrymple, as I know many of her relations.'"
