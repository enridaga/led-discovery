"There was always poetry. Campbell, just then at the top of his short-lived vogue; Ossian, the unreadable of to-day; Milton -- and with the New Year of 1812 a Captain Boothby (met during the London season) as a visitor with whom to read the last, but not the other two. For he did not admire either Campbell or Ossian [...] They were reading Paradise Lost; he said that he """"believed almost all the events in it."""" Only almost; and he went on to point out a passage in Book X which proves that, when diction was his theme, he knew what he was talking about [cites lines 'While yet we live, but one short hour perhaps, / Between us two let there be peace,' and notes Boothby's admiration of their simplicity].'"
