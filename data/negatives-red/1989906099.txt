"I have laughed at least as heartily at the continuation of """"Daniel"""" as you did at the original the conceit is excellent indeed I see that mine was quite an imperfect thing without some description of the forces on the other side - the third chapter however is very faulty - the characters are made too plain and the language of scripture compleatly departed from. I have remedied that in proof in great measure but alas it is out of time! - As it is it will create great interest I am certain of its popularity as well as its being blamed. """"Maggy Scott"""" is likewise a good fancy it has no faults but one the name should not have been """"Dinmont"""" else he should have spoken [italics] Scotish [sic, end italics]'."
