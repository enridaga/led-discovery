"[Marginalia in Keats's annotated copy of """"Paradise Lost"""", Book 9, 179-91]. Keats underlines the whole passage, excluding """"where soonest he might find /the serpent"""", and writes: 'Satan having entered the Serpent, and inform'd his brutal sense - might seem sufficient - but Milton goes on """"but his sleep disturb'd not"""". Whose spirit does not ache at the smothering and confinement  -the unwilling stillness - the """"waiting close""""? Whose head is not dizzy at the prosaible [sic] speculations of satan in the serpent prison - no poetry ever can give a greater pain of suffocation.'"
