"Labour Party pioneer F.W. Jowett..., reading Heroes and Hero-Worship as a young millworker, was attracted by its vision of a new society but repelled by its authoritarianism: """"there must have been something in me that could not respond to his powerful and eloquent glorification of the supermen - including the captains of industry who would organise production not for profit but for use - for in all things else he made a deep impression on my young mind... The more I read of Carlyle's heroes, the less attraction they had. I did not like his Luther, his Frederick the Great, nor his Cromwell... the more Carlyle crowned and canonised the ruling class, the more I felt I was on the side of the common people'."
