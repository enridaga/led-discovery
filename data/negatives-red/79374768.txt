"Mary Berry, Journal, 9 June 1808: 'Dined at Lady Donegal's with Agnes [Berry, her sister].  Philippa (Godfrey), Charles Moore, and Anacreon [ie Thomas] Moore at dinner.  I praised highly the two poems (""""Corruption"""" and """"Intolerance"""") that I had been reading in the morning, before the author (little Moore), without knowing it.  After dinner he owned the fact, and was much pleased with my unsuspicious praise.'"
