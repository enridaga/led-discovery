"Stephen Duck's habits in reading whilst working, as recorded by Joseph Spence in 'A Full and Authentick Account of Stephen Duck' (1731): '""""his method was to labour harder than any Body else, that he might get Half an Hour to read a Spectator without Injuring his Master.  By this means he used to sit down all over Sweat and Heat, and has several times caught colds by it.'"""" (p.11)."
