"Even eight-year-old Willy [Godwin] went once in a while to hear his Papa [William Godwin]'s friend [S. T. Coleridge] speak [in London Philosophical Society lectures, 18 November 1811-27 January 1812], and by February he was giving weekly lectures a la Coleridge, reading from the little pulpit specially built for him a lecture written by one of the girls [Fanny Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Claire Clairmont].  [Aaron] Burr was much amused at one he heard on """"The Influence of Governments on the Character of the People.""""' (From Marion Kingston Stocking's Introduction to Claire Clairmont's first journal)."
