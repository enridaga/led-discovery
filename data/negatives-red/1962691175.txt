"Byron to John Galt, 8 June 1813: 'I have to thank you for a most agreeable present [apparently a copy of his Letters from the Levant] ... I wish you had given us more ... no one has yet treated the subject in so pleasing a manner. - If there is any page where your readers may be inclined to think you have said too much - it will probably be that in which you have honoured me with a notice far too favourable ... I know nothing more attractive in poetry than your description of the Romaika [dance] ... thank you for a volume on Greece - which has not yet been equalled - & will with difficulty be surpassed.' "
