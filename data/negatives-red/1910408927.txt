"When he [Johnson] was a child in petticoats, and had learnt to read, Mrs Johnson one morning put the common prayer-book into his hands, pointed to the collect for the day, and said, """"Sam, you must get this by heart"""". She went upstairs, leaving him to study it: But by the time she had reached the second floor, she heard him following her. """"What's the matter?"""" said she. """"I can say it"""", he replied; and repeated it distinctly, though he ciould not have read it over more than twice'."
