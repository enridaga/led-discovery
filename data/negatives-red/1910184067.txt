"These artless idealists had their favourite authors, which I now proceeded to read...Their piece de resistance was Sir Thomas More's """"Utopia"""", closely followed by the prose works of William Morris, """"The Story of the Unknown Church"""", and the like. There was quite a spate of novels with this ideology, but the only one that has come down to the present day is Edward Bellamy's """"Looking Backward"""".'"
