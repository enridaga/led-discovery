"I am reading Mr Procter's """"Ch.Lamb"""", - so full of affecting signs of his own failure, and so interesting in all ways. I could not help enjoying Ld Cornwallis, though half-ashamed to own it. Mrs Grote sends me her vol: of """"Collected Papers"""", and some unpublished records of our time, - very interesting. They and I seemed to have rushed into a more vigorous intercourse than ever, as by a sort of accident'."
