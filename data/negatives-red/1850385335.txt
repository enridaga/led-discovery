"Then, when I was twelve we had a really good poetry book which contained extracts from """"The Excursion"""", part of """"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"""", """"The Eve of Saint Agnes"""", """"Adonais"""", """"The Pied Piper of Hamelin"""", and Mathew Arnold's """"Tristram and Iseult"""". We were given """"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"""" and """"The Pied Piper"""" to learn by heart in consecutive years. I never liked """"The Pied Piper"""", which, being written consciously as a child's poem, made me feel conscious, and most of """"Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"""" seemed unreal to me... The poems in the book which I liked best were """"The Eve of Saint Agnes"""" and """"Tristram and Iseult""""...'"
