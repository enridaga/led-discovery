"Mr Layard has lent me Sir Humphry Davy's """"Consolations in Travel, or the Last Days of a Philosopher"""". It is a posthumous publication, & the editor says that """"Had his life been prolonged, it is probable that some additions and some changes would have been made"""". - There are many fanciful and unwarranted ideas on the subject of the creation of this world, & the state of existence in the next: but, on the whole, it is a most interesting work, and shews a mind anxious to discern the right, and well prepared to love and glorify its Creator.'"
