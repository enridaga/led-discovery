"?And this reminds me by a further association of ideas that you would do well to look ? if you like to have your stomach turned ? at Farrar?s Life of Christ ? the gospels done into Daily Telegraphese & drowned in a torrent of flummery. Lord? what are we coming to? If I have time, I think I must give Farrar a rap over the knuckles; though he was an old college friend of mine & a clever fellow; but his damned nonsense is really sickening & gives matter for the sneers of the cynic. I could lay on the whip with pleasure, & I know the beggar feels it.?"
