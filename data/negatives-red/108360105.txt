"?With this proposal I of course readily closed and accordingly the next day my father gave me the 1st vol of the """"Universal History"""" (beginning with the life of Mohamed) and the 1st of Rapin?s """"History of England"""", to begin with, an each of which in turn, I bestowed an hour in reading on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Friday mornings, allotting the other two mornings to a more amusing kind of reading such as Dryden?s """"Virgil"""", """"Telamachus"""", """"Charles 12th"""". etc. I also began a translation of """"Diable Boiteaux"""" & a prose one of Virgil?s """"Eneid"""".?"
