"Wilson who is one of the most noble fellows in existence swore terribly about the [italics] fishing [end italics] and challenges you fairly to a trial but after a serious perusal of """"Wordsworth's excursion"""" together and no little laughter and some parodying he has with your assistance fairly confessed to me yesterday that he now holds the [italics]school [end italics] in utter contempt Wordsworth is really a fine intelligent man and one that must ever be respected but I fear the [italics] Kraken [end italics] has peppered him for this world - with its proportion of beauties (by the by they are but thin sown) it is the most heavy and the most absurd work that I ever perused without all exception - Southey's new work will be published in Novr.
