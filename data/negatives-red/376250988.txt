"Along with her old school books [Maud Montgomery] read whatever she could find both for pleasure and to learn from their authors how to improve her own writing: religious tracts, newspapers, the Godey's Lady's Book, Charles Dickens's """"Pickwick Papers"""", Sir Walter Scott's novels, Nathaniel Hawthorne's """"The House of the Seven Gables"""", Washington Irving's """"The Sketch Book"""", and Ralph Waldo Emerson's essays.'"
