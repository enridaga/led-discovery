I am quite distressed about my memory - after all the time and pains I have bestowed on this ancient history I find my mind retains but a faint outline of it.  - I did not read the dissertation on the arts and sciences it seemed lumpish stuff, and foreign to my present purpose[.] However if you think it for my good to spend a fortnight on these three volumes I will not grudge it.'"
