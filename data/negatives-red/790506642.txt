"Thursday 9 May 1935: 'Sitting in the sun outside the German Customs. A car with the swastika on the back window has just passed into Germany. L[eonard]. is in the customs. I am nibbling at Aaron's Rod [by D. H. Lawrence, 1922]. Ought I to go in and see what is happening? A fine dry windy morning. The Dutch Customs took 10 seconds. This has taken 10 minutes already.'"
