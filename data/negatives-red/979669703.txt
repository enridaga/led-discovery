"Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Hamlet, by the conversation between Hamlet and the courtier, in Act 5: """"This is a most admirable scene.  The fooling of Osric is nothing; but it is most striking to see how completely Hamlet forgets his father, his mistress, the terrible duty imposed upon him, the imminent danger which he has to run, as soon as a subject of observation comes before him; - as soon as a good butt is offered to his wit."""""
