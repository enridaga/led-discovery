"I was one day called aside, and a hand-bill was given me; and thinking it to be a quack doctor's bill for a certain disease, I expressed my suprise at its being given to me in such a particular manner; but on reading it, I found it contained a particular account of the wonderful conversion of a John Biggs, when he was twenty-one years of age. Mr Biggs says, that ever since that time he has had communion with God his Father every hour. He publishes this bill (he says) for the glory of God; but that the public might have an opportunity of dealing with this wonderful saint and perfectly holy man, he put his address in capitals, John Biggs, No. 98 Strand. I keep this bill as a curiosity.'"
