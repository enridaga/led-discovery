"Mr Scott must have thought me very ungrateful in returning no acknowledgements for being [italics] entrusted [end italics] with """"Marmion"""", but I was prisoner with so severe a cold the last week I stayed at Dalkeith that I could not attempt writing. Lady Dalkeith undertook the care of the parcel, which I hope has been safely restored; but now my head is clear enough, I must tell you how much pleasure it gave me, and that this pleasure rose still higher on reading it over and over again. Like the """"Lay"""", it carries one on, and one cannot lay it down. It is, I feel, a great piece of presumption in me either to commend or criticise; but one passage, I confess, strikes me as more feeble than the rest, though by itself, or in a less spirited poem, I should never have affix'd to it that epithet. What I mean is that part of the introduction to the third Canto where you begin to give Mr Erskine your reasons for not adopting his advice; it immediately follows the compliment to Miss Baillie. Yet even in this the picture of the old Highland drover is beautiful. What ensues upon Smailhome Tower, etc., I was particularly charmed with, but I shall not pretend to point out all the beauties in this note'."
