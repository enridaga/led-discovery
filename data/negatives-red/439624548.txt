"?I have read with great interest your article on Victor Hugo & also that which appeared in the last number of Macmillan. I shall be happy to accept Hugo & if I have been rather long in answering you, it is only because I wished to give a second reading to the article? I think very highly of the promise shown in your writing & therefore think it worth while to write more fully than I often do to contributors.? "
