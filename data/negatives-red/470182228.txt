"Dorothy Wordsworth to Catherine Clarkson, 11 November 1814: 'Your anecdote of Tom [?Thomas Clarkson] that he sate up all night reading William's poem gave me as much pleasure as anything I have heard of the effect produced by it ... It speaks highly in favour of Tom's feeling and enthusiasm that he was so wrought upon.'"
