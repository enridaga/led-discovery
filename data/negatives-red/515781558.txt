"'I read all my new school books as soon as I got them; I read """"The People's Journal"""", """"The People's Friend"""", and """"The Christian Herald"""". I read a complete series of sentimental love tales very popular at that time called """"Sunday Stories"""". I read novels illustrating the dangers of intemperance and the values of thrift. I read a new periodical called """"The Penny Magazine"""" which my brother Willie got: it was modelled on """"Tit-bits"""", and contained all sorts of useless information. But I had no children's books and no fairy-tales: my father's witch stories made up for that.'"
