"Have been reading in """"Tait's Magazine"""" an elaborate review of a new book by the indefatigable Government literator, Macaulay - no less than a """"History of England"""". """"Tait"""" gives copious extracts from which I easily perceive that the book is a piece of authentic Edinburgh Reviewing, declamatory in style, meagre in narrative, thoroughly corrupt in principle, as from all this man's essays on subjects of British history must have been expected.'"
