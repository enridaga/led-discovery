"I wonder whether you have read that first book of Miss Eyre's (""""Mary Eyre"""" of the Times) """"A Lady's Walks in the South of France"""". What a disgusting book it is, - a begging book, avowedly written to get money, and disclosing the family poverty, and bemoaning herself all the way through, and preaching and censuring, right and left, and with such adulation of Brougham, as the patron!'."
