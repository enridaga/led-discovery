"What really brought us [Ford and Conrad] together was a devotion to Flaubert and Maupassant. We discovered we both had F√©licit√©, """"St.-Julien l'Hospitalier"""", immense passages of """"Madame Bovary"""", """"La Nuit"""", """"Ce Cochon de Morin"""" and immense passages of """"Une Vie"""" by heart. Or so nearly by heart that what the one faltered over the other could take up.'"
