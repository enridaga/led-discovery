" [Macaulay's marginalia on Cicero's Third Philippic]: """"The close of this speech is very fine.  His later and earlier speeches have a freedom and an air of sincerity about them which, in the interval between his Consulship and Caesar's death, I do not find.  During that interval he was mixed up with the aristocratical party, and yet afraid of the Triumvirate.  When all the great party-leaders were dead, he found himself at the head of the state, and spoke with a boldness and energy which he had not shown since his youthful days."""""
