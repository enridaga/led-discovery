"Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of King Lear, by the quarrel between Kent and Cornwall's steward: """"It is rather a fault in the play, to my thinking, that Kent should behave so very insolently in this scene.  A man of his rank and sense would have had more self-command and dignity even in his anger.  One can hardly blame Cornwall for putting him in the stocks."""""
