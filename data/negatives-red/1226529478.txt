"I read a great deal of """"Agathon"""" a very fine German novel taken from a grecian manuscript written by Wieland. It is very interesting and expressed with equal grace, elegance and nature. One thing which shows that no man is free of a vanity in which he seeks to hide is that the Author takes every opportunity to mention himself and appears afraid that """"Agathon"""" should make you forget Weiland'."
