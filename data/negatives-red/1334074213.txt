"I am much obliged to you for Tytler, which I have read with pleasure and not without profit: it is a smooth, easy Book; seems well-founded, accurate, authentic; and without pretending to be a classical History, may well enjoy several years of extensive popularity.  I shall be very glad to see the First and all the other Volumes, when they appear.'"
