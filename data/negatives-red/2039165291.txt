"Dawdling over Keightley's history of the war in Greece, compiled out of all the newspapers and all the memoirs. Full enough of incident certainly; for the author seems to give different versions of the same event as so many different transactions, and he ruthlessly kills more Greeks in the course of this war than there have been in all Greece at one time since the days of Philopoemen not to speak of incredible multitudes of Turks, whom he generally slays at least thrice.'"
