"Among the eminent women who sought my [Harriet Martineau's] acquaintance by letter [in the early 1830s], and whom I have never seen, [is] [...] Miss Kelty [...] I have lately received from her her autobiography, published under the title of """"Reminiscences of Thought and Feeling.""""  It is a painfully impressive biography; but [...] Systems of religion and philosophy are evidently something very different to her from what they are to me [...] But I am glad to have read the Memoir, and glad that it exists [...] for it is a striking emanation of the spirit of the time'."
