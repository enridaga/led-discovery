"I have had within these few days a curious MS. sent to me by an English gentleman a Dr T. Brown who intreats me to take a hand in editing it and I think it would take remarkably well both in schools and as a cabinet work. It is """"The art of reading and conversing on the works of the living poets of Great Britain"""" with many most beautiful extracts [...] If close printed it would be 7/ and you might have it on your own terms. I go over it every word and will answer for the ingenuity of it but it is not really mine so cannot be in my name but I declare on honour it is a great deal more ingenious than I could have written it'."
