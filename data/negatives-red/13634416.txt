"C.H. Rolph... picked up [a message that """"well-trained impis could outwit upper-class English duffers""""] from S. Clarke Hook's stories of Jack, Sam and Pete in the Boys' Friend Threepenny Library. Jack and Sam were white boys and their friend Pete was a black superhero, """"who was not only stronger than Samson but richer than Croesus"""".'"
