"Read a little more of """"Amelia"""", which is about the worst planned story I ever read - no plan at all in fact; """"Gil Blas"""" has always some tangled connection and momentary interest; """"Don Quixote"""" is so intensely amusing that the want of plan is easily forgiven; but to bring on a storm merely that a hero may escape in a boat is the kind of thing I had not expected to find in what is said to be one of the first of English novels. The irony is forced, and the feeling bad; but the characters are highly and equisitely finished, and clearly conceived.'"
