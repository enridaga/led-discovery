"?Besides the standard works of our great writers, I subscribed to a few serials, mostly educational. These included """"British Controversionalist"""", Cassell?s """"Popular Educator"""", """"Historical Educator"""" and """"Educational Course""""? Cassell?s publications, cheap and solid, were a great book to me. The """"Popular Educator"""" was my chief handbook. Always fond of linguistics studies, I tackled lessons in English, in French and in Latin.?"
