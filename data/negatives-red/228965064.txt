"Charlotte Bronte to George Smith, 18 September 1850: 'You should be very thankful that books cannot """"talk to each other as well as to their readers"""" ... Dr Knox alone, with his """"Race, a Fragment"""" (a book which I read with combined interest, amusement and edification) would deliver the voice of a Stentor if any other book ventured to call in question his favourite dogmas.'"
