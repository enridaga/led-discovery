"Read Arthur Stanley's Three Introductory Lectures on the Study of Ecclesiastical History Parker Oxford - price [italics] perhaps [ed italics] 2s-6d, not more. I do so like them and so does Meta. And Dasent's Norse Tales, which are charming, & the introduction best of all and """"Adam Bede"""" - you read Scenes from Clerical Life? did you not?'"
