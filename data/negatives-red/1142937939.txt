"Horace Walpole to Mary Berry, 27 September 1794: 'I was diverted a few days ago by a paragraph in the """"True Briton"""", which, supposing that the Prince [of Wales] is to reside at Hampton Court, said that, as there is a theatre and tennis court in the Palace, Twickenham will not want a succession of company, even when the [italics]venerable[end italics] Earl of Orford [i.e. Walpole] shall be no more.  I little thought I was as attractive as a theatre or a tennis court, or served in lieu of them.'"
