"Lady Gordon wrote """"In most novels you are amused for the time with a set of Ideal People whom you never think of afterwards or whom you in the least expect to meet in common life, whereas in Miss A-s works, & especially in M.P. you actually [italics] live [end italics] with them, you fancy yourself one of the family; & the scenes are so exactly descriptive, so perfectly natural, that there is scarcely an Incident or conversation, or a person that you are not inclined to imagine you have at one time or other in your Life been a witness to, born a part in, & been acquainted with.""""'"
