"[Marginalia in Keats's annotated copy of """"Paradise Lost"""" in Book 1, lines 53-75]. Keats underlines the following phrases and lines: 'round he throws his baleful eyes'; 'At once, as far as Angel's ken, he views/ The dismal situation waste and wild'; 'sights of woe,/ Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace/ And rest can never dwell; hope never comes/ That comes to all'.  He writes after line 75: 'One of the most mysterious of semi-speculations is, one would suppose, that of one Mind's imagining into another. Things may be described by a Man's self in parts so as to make a grand whole which that Man himself would scarcely inform to its excess. A Poet can seldom have justice done to his imagination - for men are as distinct in their conceptions of material shadowings as they are in matters of spiritual understanding: it can scarcely be conceived how Milton's Blindness might here ade [for aid] the magnitude of his conceptions as a bat in a large gothic vault'.
