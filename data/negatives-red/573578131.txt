"The first volume of Symond's """"Studies of the Greek Poets"""", issued in 1873, was """"perpetually"""" in Wilde's """"hands"""" at Trinity [Dublin]. The second volume came out in 1876, when he was at Oxford. On the title-page, he wrote """"Oscar F.O'F. W. Wilde. S.M. Magdalen College, Oxford, May '76."""" The date indicates that Wilde purchased the book hot off the printing press.'"
