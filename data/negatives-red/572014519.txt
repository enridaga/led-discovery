"In the even finished reading Wake's """"Catechism"""", which I think is a very good book and proper for all families, there being good instructions in it and also something which is prodigious moving. It is wrote in a lively, brisk manner and not as if the author wrote more out of form than for the good of people's souls, and at the same time it is a very plain, familiar style, suitable I think to the meanest capacities that can read. And so far as I can judge there is everything contained in it necessary to a man's salvation."
