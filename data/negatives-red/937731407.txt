"I was indeed surprised to find my name in """"Patronage"""" but my surprise was principally caused by finding such honourable mention made of me and by seeing myself in company with those whom I have no pretensions to associate with. No person but Miss Edgeworth would call """"Patronage"""" a trivial performance, but even she has not a right to call it so. Like most of her other works, under the form of a mere book of amusement it conveys the most important lessons. I hope that the publication of it will add greatly to the lively satisfaction she must feel when she reflects how greatly her writings have contributed to improve the condition of mankind, and what mischievous follies and frailties they have in numerous individuals corrected or repressed'."
