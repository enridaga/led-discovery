"[Aneurin Bevan] burrowed through the Tredegar Workmen's Institute Library, and acquired his characteristically grandiose vocabulary through close study of Roget's Thesaurus... When he chaired the Tredegar Library Committee, ?60 of its ?300 acquisitions budget was delegated to a colliery repairman to buy philosophy books. Bevan could quote Nietzsche, discuss F.H. Bradley's """"Appearance and Reality"""", and deeply impress an Oxford tutor with his crique of Kant's """"Categorical Imperative""""... Bevan was... deeply influenced by """"The Theory of the Leisure Class"""".'"
