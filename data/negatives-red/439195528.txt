"I do not like Lord Byron's English Bards and Scotch reviewers, though, as my father says, the lines are very strong and worthy of Pope and the Dunciad! But I was so much prejudiced against the whole by the first lines I opened upon about the 'paralytic muse' of the man who had been his guardian and is his relation and to whom he had dedicated his first poems, that I could not relish his wit. He may have great talents, but I am sure he has neither a great not good mind; and I feel dislike and disgust for his Lordship.'"
