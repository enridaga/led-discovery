"Journey into Scotland in Aug 1834 with husband and two daughters: 'At Kenmore, they enjoyed a quiet Sunday and tolerable highland accommodation. In the evening, anxious to turn the day to some good account, Mrs Fry invited the servants of the inn, to attend the reading she intended to have with her own family. Some ladies were polite enough to offer the use of their sitting room as it was more roomy; a large congregation of barefooted chambermaids, and blue-bonnetted hostlers, assembled. She read part of her brother Joseph John Gurney's letter to a Friend, on the evidences of Christianity; the people were very attentive and anxious each to possess a copy, that they might read the remainder of the book to themselves. The next day, some gamekeepers who came to the inn requested a similar gift, having heard from the people there all that had taken place.'"
