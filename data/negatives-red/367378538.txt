"With autodidact diligence [Leslie Paul] closed in on the avant-garde. He read """"Prufrock"""" and """"The Waste Land"""", though not until the 1930s. He smuggled """"Ulysses"""" and """"Lady Chatterley's Lover"""" past customs. In """"John O'London's"""" and """"The Nation"""", in William MacDougall's Home University Library volume on """"Psychology"""" and F.A. Servante's """"Psychology of the Boy"""", he read up on Freud. In a few years he knew enough to ghost-write BBC lectures on modern psychology'."
