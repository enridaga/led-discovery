"After """"Trilby"""" came the effect of """"Peter Ibbetson"""". """"It came to me"""", writes the poet of this book, """"just when I needed an inner life"""". From """"Peter Ibbetson"""" he learned of the existence of Villon and of de Musset. He read these poets but """"the time was not ripe for either""""."
