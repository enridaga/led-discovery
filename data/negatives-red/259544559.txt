"[Kent] Carr cites a letter [Marie] Corelli received from a colors sergeant in the Boer War in May 1900: """"Now to tell you about your delightful books which were invaluable to the troops during the siege; one, 'The Sorrows of Satan,' was read and re-read by me, and then handed round.  As many as three would be wanting to read it, so where literature was scarce, you can imagine what a blessing it was to have a book like it.'"""""
