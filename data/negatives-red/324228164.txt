"I am much obliged by your kindness in sending me The Pirate. You know how much I admire the genius of the author, but even that has its limits and is exhaustible. I am afraid this novel will depend upon the former reputation of the author, and will add nothing to it [...] I do not blame him for writing himself out, if he knows he is doing so, and has done his [italics] best [end italics] and his [italics] all [end italics]. If the native land of Scotland will supply no more scenes and characters, for he is always best in Scotland [...] pray (wherever the scene is laid) no more [italics] Meg Merrilies and Dominie Sampson [end italics] - very good the first and second times, but now quite worn out, and always recurring. All human themes have an end (except Taxation); but I shall heartily regret my annual amusement if I am to lose it'."
