"[Charlie] Lahr lent [Bonar] Thompson Andre Gide and """"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man"""". """"It was wonderful for me to feel that I belonged to the elect who had read these giants of the future"""", wrote Thompson, who credited Lahr with introducing him to """"writers of whom I should not otherwised have heard until years later"""". The difficulty was that """"As soon as authors did become well known, Charlie had done with them. He felt, I suppose, that they had been bought over, or had taken to writing for the mob, else why were they popular with the wrong kind of readers?"""".'"
