"On many nights I would sit beside the kitchen fire, listening to my father reading or telling tales. There was no wireless then and no gramophones, and our fireside talk was little different from that which had been going on for generations by any Connaught fireside ... At other times my father would read to me from a book. These tales were usually of the """"creepy"""" variety‚Äî<i>Thrawn Janet</i>; or one of Marion Crawford's uncanny stories; or <i>Green Tea</i>, or <i>The Watcher</i>, by that master of the macabre, Sheridan Le Fanu; or the most vivid ghost story in English, Bulwer Lytton's <i>The Haunted and the Haunters</i>; and many another tooth-chattering tale, as Stevenson called them.'"
