"I related a dispute between Goldsmith and Mr. Robert Dodsley, one day when they and I were dining at Tom Davies's, in 1762. Goldsmith asserted, that there was no poetry produced in this age. Dodsley appealed to his own Collection, and maintained, that though you could not find a palace like Dryden's """"Ode on St. Cecilia's Day"""", you had villages composed of very pretty houses; and he mentioned particularly """"The Spleen"""".'"
