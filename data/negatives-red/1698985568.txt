"?His [Sir Alfred Lyall] little volume of poems too is very good in its way. When I came back from America last time, I made a reputation on board by reciting one of the poems ? Theology in Extremis ? at a sort of penny reading? I have never been the object of so many attentions before or since and gave my autograph to a dozen ladies. Independent of that, Lyall is a man worth knowing & unluckily so popular in society that I don?t often get a chance of seeing him.?"
