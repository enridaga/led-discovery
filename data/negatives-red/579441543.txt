"‚ÄòAbout this time I read and appreciated Jane Austen‚Äôs novels ‚Äì those exquisite miniatures, which no doubt her contemporaries identified with as much interest. Her circle was as narrow as mine ‚Äì indeed, narrower. She was the daughter of a clergyman in the country. She represented well-to-do grown-up people, and them alone. The humour of servants, the sallies of children, the machinations of villains, the tricks of rascals, are not on her canvas; but she differentiated among equals with a firm hand, and with a constant ripple of amusement. The life I led had more breadth and wider interests. The life of Miss Austen‚Äôs heroines, though delightful to read about, would have been deadly dull to endure. So great a charm have Jane Austen‚Äôs books had for me that I have made a practice of reading them through regularly once a year.‚Äô"
