"Mary Berry, Journal, 27 March 1818: 'I went with the Comte Bardi to the Laurentian Library.  Saw the travels (MSS.) of Cosmo III. in England in the year 167-, accompanied by Magalotti, who gives the description of the travels, and by an artist who made drawings of all the small towns where they stopped, and of all the country houses they saw. I remarked Wilton, Billingbear, Audley Inn, &c.'"
