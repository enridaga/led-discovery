" [Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Plato's Euthydemus]: """"There is hardly any comedy, in any language, more diverting than this dialogue. It is not only richly humorous.  The characters are most happily sustained and discriminated.  The contrast between the youthful petulance of Ctesippus and the sly, sarcastic mock humility of Socrates is admirable."""""
