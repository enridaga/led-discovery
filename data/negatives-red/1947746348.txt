"An annotated copy of John Hart's """"Orthographie"""" which undoubtedly belonged to [Gabriel] Harvey [...] is replete with his comments on spellings and punctuations [...] On sig. Diiir where the text states """"a writing is corrupted when any worde or sillable hath more letters, than are used of voyces in the pronunciation"""" Harvey cites as examples: """"Comptroller, Bloudde, Adde, Speake"""".'
