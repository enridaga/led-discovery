"I have read nothing, but half of one German novel, last sunday! Not long ago, all this would have made me miserable; but at present I submit to it with equanimity, and even find enjoyment in the thought that in this humblest of spheres of existence I am doing all I can do save my spirit and my fortunes from the shipwreck which threatened then, and to fit me for discharging to myself and others whatever duties my natural or accidental capabilities, slender but actually existing as they are, point out and impose upon me.'"
