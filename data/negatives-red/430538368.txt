"I have had a weekend's C.B. Unshaven on parade ... from six to ten on Saturday and Sunday nights I had to double 600 yards to the guardroom, to report, every half-hour, when """"defaulters"""" blew. It meant I could not read for more than a few minutes at a time, and I had <i>Tom Sawyer</i>. I was the only man in the hut those two evenings, except for the old hut orderly, asleep on a form near the stove. How I would have loved to lie down and read or sleep in the quietness.'"
