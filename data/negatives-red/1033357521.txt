"Dr John Campbell, the celebrated political and biographical writer, being mentioned, Johnson said, """"Campbell is a man of much knowledge, and has a good share of imagination. His """"Hermippus Redivivus"""" is very entertaining, as an account of the Hermetick philosophy, and as furnishing a curious history of the human mind. If it were merely imaginary it would be nothing at all."""".'"
