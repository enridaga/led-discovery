"I have read [The First Men on the Moon] in Strand, & hasten to insult & annoy you by stating that the last two instalments are among the very best things you have done.  I have read Anticipations in Fortnightly, & hasten to say that I have been absolutely overwhelmed by the breadth & the sheer intellectual vigour of them, not to mention the imaginative power.  These articles really have made me a little afraid of you.'   "
