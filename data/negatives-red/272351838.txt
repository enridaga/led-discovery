"After a less than frugal luncheon (no ice aboard) I made an attempt to read """"The Egoist"""" (a tattered copy of which lay on the desk) but gave it up and lay, practically for the rest of the voyage, a high heaved and higher-heaving log of uncomplaining misery.[...] In more conscious moments contrived almost to finish the unique """"Egoist"""" (last read at Cambridge): near the end it approaches a high tragic Vaudeville, and [De] Craye's wit does not wear well; but how direct and simple the whole effect, and how much easier and more compelling than Henry James.'
