"I am glad to hear that you are getting forward so well with Homer. I know almost nothing about him - having never read any thing but Pope's translation, and not above a single book of the original - & that several years ago. Indeed I know very little of the Greek at any rate. I have several times begun to read Xenophon's anabasis completely: but always gave it up in favour of something else - You complain that nothing that you do leaves a vestige behind it: - what do you make of Homer?'"
