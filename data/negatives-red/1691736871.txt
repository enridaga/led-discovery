"I have just read through the Zeromski novel you mean: """"History of a Sin"""". I don't think it will do for translation. The international murderess episodes take but a little space after all. The whole thing is disagreeable and often incomprehensible in comment and psychology. Often it is gratuitously ferocious. You now I am not squeamish. The other work the great hstorical machine  is called """"Ashes"""" (Popioly). Both of course have a certain greatness.[...] [but] both take too much for granted in the way of receptivity and tolerance.' "
