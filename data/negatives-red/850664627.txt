"I haven't any right to criticise books and I don't often do it except when I hate them.  I often want to criticise Jane Austen, but her books madden me so that I can't conceal my frenzy from the reader; and therefore I have to stop every time I begin. Every time I read """"Pride and Prejudice"""" I want to dig her up and hit her over the skull with her own shin-bone.'"
