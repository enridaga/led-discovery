"Dorothy Wordsworth to Catherine Clarkson, 30 March 1818: 'Mr Clarkson's letter [refusing support to Lowther interest in Westmorland elections] was published in yesterday's paper; and I have read it with delight, as an admirable letter and a faithful picture of his noble mind, but I feel assured that it will serve a cause  which he would not wish to serve if he were acquainted with all its bearings.'"
