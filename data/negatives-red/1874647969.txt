Jackson notes Francis Douce's reading and annotations (which are """"not generous"""") of copies of John Whitaker, The Ancient Cathedral of Cornwall Historically Surveyed (1804) and The History of Manchester (1771; 1775), both bequeathed by him to the British Museum; quotes extensive note in which Douce attacks Whitaker's scholarship at point where Whitaker has attempted to correct one of his (Douce's) previous remarks on etymology."
