"Henry James to Edmund Gosse, 28 April 1891: """"I return the Ibsenite volume with many thanks -- especially for the opportunity to read your charming preface which is really ... more interesting than Ibsen himself ... I think you make him out a richer phenomenon than he is.  The perusal of the dreary Rosmersholm and even the reperusal of Ghosts has been rather a shock to me -- they have let me down, down."""" "
