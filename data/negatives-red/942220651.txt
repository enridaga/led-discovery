"[PRIVATE LETTER] 'I have at last overtaken all your letters from August 23rd down to September 4th. Do not imagine I am such an ass as to leave letters ‚Äúrotting‚Äù in Poste Restante; I always change my address; and keep them all floating about from place to place until, after an infinity of calculation and seamanship, I can manage to make my own line of movement and theirs converge upon the same point. [‚Ä¶]As for the question about shopping in your Antwerp Letter, I wrote you about that already."
