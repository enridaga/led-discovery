"Dr. Mayo having asked Johnson's opinion of Soame Jenyns's """"View of the Internal Evidence of the Christian Religion"""";--JOHNSON. """"I think it a pretty book; not very theological indeed; and there seems to be an affectation of ease and carelessness, as if it were not suitable to his character to be very serious about the matter"""". BOSWELL. """"He may have intended this to introduce his book the better among genteel people, who might be unwilling to read too grave a treatise. There is a general levity in the age. We have physicians now with bag-wigs; may we not have airy divines, at least somewhat less solemn in their appearance than they used to be?"""" JOHNSON. """"Jenyns might mean as you say"""". BOSWELL. """"[italics]You[end italics] should like his book, Mrs. Knowles, as it maintains, as you [italics] friends [end italics] do, that courage is not a Christian virtue"""".' "
