"There was another impression, almost as horrible, but this time it was caused by an illustration, not a story. Sutherland sometimes had sent to him by a cousin in Leith a weekly paper called, I think, """"The Police News"""", a record of brutal crimes. He left it lying in the kitchen one day, and with my usual hypnotised interest I went across to take it up. On the cover was a picture of a powerful man standing in his shirt sleeves with an axe raised above his head... My father snatched up the paper as soon as I put my hand out for it, crammed it into his pocket, and said sternly, """"That's no for thee!""""'."
