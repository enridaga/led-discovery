"[Letter from Boswell to Johnson] Be pleased to accept of my best thanks for your """"Journey to the Hebrides"""", which came to me by last night's post. I did really ask the favour twice; but you have been even with me by granting it so speedily. [italics] Bis dat qui cito dat [end italics]. Though ill of a head cold, you kept me up the greatest part of last night: for I did not stop till I had read every word of your book. I looked back to our first talking of a visit to the Hebrides, which was many years ago, when sitting by ourselves in the Mitre tavern, in London, I think about [italics] witching time o'night [end italics]; and then exulted in contemplating our scheme fulfilled, and a [italics]monumentum perenne [end italics] of it erected by your superiour abilities. I shall only say, that your book has afforded me a high gratification. I shall afterwards give you my thoughts on particular passages. In the mean time, I hasten to tell you of your having mistaken two names, which you will correct in London, as I shall do here, that the gentlemen who deserve the valuable compliments which you have paid them, may enjoy their honours. In page 106, for [italics] Gordon [end italics], read [italics] Murchison [end italics]; and in page 357, for [italics] Maclean [end italics] read [italics] Macleod [end italics].'"
