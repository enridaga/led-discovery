"Read """"King John"""" completely for the first time; I like the historical plays myself better than the pet ones. """"Midsummer Night's Dream"""" I like least of any in Shakespeare. I think the death scene in """"King John"""" one of the very finest things in Shakespeare; but Constance talks too much Billingsgate.'"
