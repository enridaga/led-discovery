"It was in this state of feeling that I first got hold of a little volume called """"The Wreath"""", containing a collection of poems by various authors. Among these pieces was """"The Grave"""", which soon commended itself to my hearty and unqualified approbation...Besides this poem the volume contained """"The Minstrel"""", of which I venture to say that I consider it to be of almost unequalled beauty and interest... There was here yet another poem which arrested my attention as fully as much as did """"The Grave"""" or """"The Minstrel"""". This was entitled """"Death"""" - a prize winning poem written by that eminently good man Dr Porteus...' "
