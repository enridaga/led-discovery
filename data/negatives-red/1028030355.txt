"The Cottagers of Glenburnie. 1 vol. by Miss Hamilton. A little tale tending to shew the folly of adhering to old customs merely because they have been habitual for many generations, particularlythe scottish tenacity, indolence, and want of cleanliness in their houses and about their farms. The tale is told in such a manner as scarcely to offend even a scotchman, and may very probably have some influence in effecting a reformation."
