"?In the works of Fielding our credulity is not taxed for superfluous admiration by any of those faultless monsters? Fielding?s chief excellence appears to lie in the delineation of his characters that combine simplicity, ignorance and benevolence. His Parson Adams and his Partridge will still induce us to tolerate even Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones. His mind appeared incapable of concocting a character of real virtue. His Allworthy is a prosing, self sufficient moral pedant; in Joseph Andrews virtue is ridiculous; in Tom Jones vice is honourable. Nobody now reads either but the school boy, and one of the earliest signs of an improved taste, and an advancement in Christian morality, is the rejection of both.?"
