" I want you to tell R.M. du Gard how highly I esteem 'Barois'.  When I first bought it, ages ago, I was so impressed by it that I had it charmingly bound, and I often read in it again. . . . I am very pleased with 'Amants, heureux amants', especially that last story; Valery‚Äôs best work, I think.    "
