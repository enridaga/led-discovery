"William Wordsworth to Hans Busk, 6 July 1819: 'Dear Sir, Your writings are not to be hurried over; this must plead my excuse for not having thanked you earlier for the """"Vestriad""""; which, though detained on the road, by a fault of some of Mr Longman's people ... reached me some time since ... I was particularly pleased with the descents into the submarine regions, and the infernal.  These two Cantos I liked best ... The serious passages ... will excite a wish in many as they did in me, that you would favour the world with something in downright earnest ... I noticed in your Vestriad with particular pleasure, your flight in the Balloon.'"
