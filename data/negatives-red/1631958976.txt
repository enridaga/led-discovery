"Brougham's pamphlet accidentally happens to be very dull. It is not of much importance but there was no absolute necessity for its being so. Wit and declamation would be misplaced, but a clever man may be bright and flowing while he is argumentative and prudent. He makes out a great case in general: and nobody would accuse Lord Lonsdale and the Bishop of undue precipitation if they were to make some sort of reply to the charge of particular delinquencies levelled against them'."
