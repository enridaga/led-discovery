"[GENERALISATION/ ALLUSION]...it is not Shakespeare we take to, when we are in a hot corner; not, certainly, George Eliot - no, not even Balzac. It is Charles Reade, or old Dumas, or the Arabian Nights, or the best of Walter Scott; it is stories we want, not the high poetic function which represents the world; we are then like the Asiatic with his improvisatore or the middle-agee with his trouvere."
