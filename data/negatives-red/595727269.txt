"Mr Wilson introduced us to another author - Victor Hugo... in 1925, """"Les Miserables"""" gripped us even more than """"Pickwick"""". Mr Wilson must have abridged it ruthlessly, but he made everything in nineteenth-century France sound as if it were happening in the England of our own day...The reading of """"Les Miserables"""" bound us together in one common experience.'"
