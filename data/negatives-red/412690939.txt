"Janet Fraser . . . had gone out to the fields with a young female companion, and sat down to read the Bible . . . [Going to get a drink of water, she left] her Bible open at the place where she had been reading . . . the 34th chapter of Isaiah, beginning """"My sword shall be bathed in heaven"""" . . . . On returning she found a patch of something like blood covering the very text. In great surprise, she carried the book home, where a young man tasted the substance with his tongue, and found it of a saltless or insipid flavour. On the two succeeding Sundays, while the same girl was reading her Bible in the open air, similar blotches of matter, like blood,fell upon the leaves. She did not perceive it in the act of falling till it was about an inch from the book.'"
