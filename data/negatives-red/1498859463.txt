"We got up and 9 am surrounded by the females of the farm who were in the kitchen. I in my pyjamas. However, I hid behind the table when I dressed. I just read a ridiculous account of the attack here last Monday 14th, in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. How the Royal Scots and Gordons took four lines of trenches, that our cavalry were used on the flank, and that the Germans were surrounded by """"a ring of khaki"""". Unfortunately it was most the other way on: there are no cavalry within miles, nor could they have been used in this enclosed wire country sodden with water; and we took one trench with awful loss.'"
