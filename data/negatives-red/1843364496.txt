"William Wordsworth to Lord Lonsdale, 6 April 1818: 'Had the Correspondence [between Henry Brougham and William Wilberforce, 1806] been published upon Mr B[rougham]'s first appearance in the Country, I think it might have done much service ... the sooner it sees the light the better. With Lord L[owther']'s approbation I have glanced at it, in a passage added to some able Comments on Mr B[rougham]'s first speech at Kendal, by a Friend of mine, which are about to appear.'"
