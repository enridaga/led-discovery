Wells, 6 July 1915: 'I was given yesterday at a club your volume """"Boon, etc."""", from a loose leaf in which I learn that you kindly sent it me [...] I have just been reading, to acknowledge it intelligently, a considerable number of its pages -- though not all; for, to be perfectly frank, I have been in that respect beaten for the first time -- or rather for the first time but one -- by a book of yours'.
