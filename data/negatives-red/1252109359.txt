"I know that during Elections songs & squibs are fair on each side & much bad wit & many severe things must be said--but I am sure that neither you nor Sir Frances Burdett can see without disgust what is now handed about and sent here & every where and must be sanctioned by some of the people in your Committee [...] I know you are too clever & far too much of a Gentleman to have any thing to do with the common placards sent about in the way this is--but as I read part of it in the Statesman I think you could at all events stop its being inserted and ask yourself what your feelings would be if your found the grossest insults & imputations sanctioned by any of our Party against yr Birth or yr relations'."
