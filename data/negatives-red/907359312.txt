"I [Harriet Martineau] was spending a couple of days at Mrs. Marsh's, when she asked me whether I would let her read to me """"one or two little stories"""" which she had written.  From her way of speaking of them, and from her devotion to her children [...] I concluded these to be children's stories.  She ordered a fire in her room, and there we shut ourselves up for the reading. What she read was no child's story, but """"The Admiral's Daughter.""""  My amazement may be conceived.  We were going to dine at the Wedgwoods': and a strange figure we must have cut there; for we had been crying so desperately that there was no concealing the marks of it.' "
