"[Gaskell describes handing over the gift of a signed copy of Tennyson's poems to Samuel Bamford] 'I said, 'Look at the title page', for I saw he was fairly caught by something he liked in the middle of the book, & was standing reading it there in the street. 'Well! I am a proud man this day', he exclaimed, - then he turned it up and down, & read a bit, (it was a very crowded street), and his grey face went quite brown-red with pleasure [...] Then he dipped down into his book, and began reading aloud the Sleeping beauty, and in the middle stopped to look at the writing again, and we left him a sort of sleep[-]walking state, & only trust he will not be run over'."
