"Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal, Tuesday 23 March 1802: 'He [William Wordsworth] is now reading Ben Jonson ... It is about 10 o'clock, a quiet night.  The fire flutters, and the watch ticks.  I hear nothing else save the breathing of my Beloved, and he now and then pushes his book forward, and turns over a leaf.'"
