"Passages transcribed at length into E. M. Forster's Commonplace Book (1938) include 'The Rev. John Newton on the Messiah' (Forster's heading) noted underneath by Forster as 'From a Sermon preached at St Mary's Woolnoth in 1784'; passage about how mortals distract themselves, by means including setting of scriptures to music, from proper awareness of God's impending judgement of them."
