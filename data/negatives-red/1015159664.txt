"Mary Berry to a friend, 19 November 1798: 'Don't let me forget to advise you to to read the """"Natural Son,"""" or """"Lovers' Vows;"""" it is the entire and literal translation of the play which is now acting with such success at Covent Garden, but [italics]not[end italics] as it is acted; you can get it at Todd's [bookseller's], where I did, to read in the chaise [...] Another  book which I purchased at Todd's and read in my chaise was the """"Essay on Population"""" which Mr. Wrangham left with you. It is uncommonly clearly thought and written, and contains much curious and uncontrovertible reasoning on the subject in question.'"
