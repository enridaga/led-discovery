"?I have read two books lately wh. interested me. One for wh. you will not care is a history of English law down to the time of Edward I by F. W. Maitland?. The other book is A. J. Balfour?s Foundations of Belief, wh. are, I think about the very oddest foundations that any man ever tried to lay ? being chiefly reasons for believing nothing. I preached a kind of sermon about it to the Ethical Society here; taking his arguments & working out their proper result. It will, I believe, appear in the Fortnightly for June; but it is not worth taking the trouble to read.?"
