"I have had a great treat this morning in perusing L. Byron's 3d Canto - Considered as a continuation of Child-Harold [sic] it has some incongruities and perhaps too much egoism still it is a powerful and energetic work and superior to every long poem of my noble friend's - I have had only time to read two articles of the Review which I was in a great hurry to do because I knew the authors of both and was informed of their being in Giffords hand before they were put to press, but I hope all the other articles are better'"
