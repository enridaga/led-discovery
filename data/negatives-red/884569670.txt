"In the evenings of late, we have been reading Harriet Martineau's sketch of """"The British Empire in India"""", and are now following it up with Macaulay's articles of Clive and Hastings. We have lately read H.M.'s Introduction to the """"History of the Peace"""" and have begun the """"History of the Thirty Years Peace"""".'"
