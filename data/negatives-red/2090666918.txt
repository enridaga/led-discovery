"When Wordsworth was then spoken of as a great poet, the ordinary question was, """"Why is he not more popular?"""" The process through which public opinion gradually turns from an ephemeral popularity, permanently to repose upon works of imagination  that are not extravagent stimulants, is admirably illustrated by his own experience. I remember distinctly, when """"Lalla Rookh"""" first came out, I read it through at one sitting.  To say I was delighted with it is a poor word for my feelings; I was transported out of myself-entranced or what you will.'"
