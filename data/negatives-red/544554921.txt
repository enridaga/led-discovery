"Henry James to Grace Norton, 6 April 1869, on fellow spa visitors, Great Malvern: """"They are mostly a plain, civil, amiable lot -- addicted to reading the Telegraph and Standard -- by day and playing interminable rubbers by night.  We have a number of Indian officers ... a high conservative and radically stupid fox-hunting clergyman -- a very gentlemanly and indifferent young squire ... and a great variety of other specimens of the British world."""""
