"While botanising to-day I had the good fortune to take an animal of the opossum (""""Didelphis"""") tribe; it was a female, and with it I took two young ones.  It was not unlike that remarkable one which De Buffon has described by the name of """"Phalanger"""" as an American animal.  It was, however, not the same.  M. de Buffon is certainly wrong in asserting that this tribe is peculiar to America, and in all probability, as Pallas has said in his """"Zoologia"""" the """"Phalanger"""" itself is a native of the East Indies, as my animals and that agree in the extraordinary conformation of their feet, in which particular they differ from all the others.'"
