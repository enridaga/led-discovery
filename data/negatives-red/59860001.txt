"""""[in November 1803, when Coleridge was thirty-one] Wordsworth had been reading Shakespeare's sonnets in Coleridge's copy of a set of the Works of the British Poets, in which both he and Coleridge's brother-in-law Robert Southey had made manuscript notes. Taking up the Shakespeare volume and coming upon a pencilled note of Wordsworth's critical of the sonnets, Coleridge answered with a long note of his own, in ink [disagreeing with Wordsworth's judgements].""""
