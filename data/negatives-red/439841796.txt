"I have been reading Marlow, and I was so much more impressed by him than I thought I should be, that I read Cymbeline just to see if there mightn't be more in the great William than I supposed. And I was quite upset!  Really and truly I am now let in to [the] company of worshippers-though I still feel a little oppressed by his-greatness I suppose.  I shall want a lecture when I see you; to clear up some points about the Plays.  I mean about the characters.  Why aren't they more human?  Imogen and Posthumous and Cymbeline-I find them beyond me-Is this my feminine weakness in the upper region?'"
