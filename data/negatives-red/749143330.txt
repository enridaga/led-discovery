"Byron to Augusta Leigh, 15 October 1816, from Milan: 'What has delighted me most is a manuscript collection (preserved in the Ambrosian library), of original love-letters and verses of Lucretia de Borgia & Cardinal Bembo ... the letters are so beautiful that I have done nothing but pore over them, & have made the librarian promise me a copy of them ... The verses are Spanish -- the letters Italian ... all in hr own hand-writing.'"
