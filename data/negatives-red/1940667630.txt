"On the next day (Saturday 9th) I went to Canterbury in the diligence, during w'ch I amused myself with reading part of Voltaire's """"Candide"""", w'ch having read a great many years ago at Salisbury & almost forgot, I bought the day before in duodecimo. Having dined at the King's Head I went out & got """"Caleb Williams"""" of w'ch I had heard much & of w'ch I read great part of the 1st vol. in the evening at the King's Head (where I also supp'd & slept) leaving the 2d. vol of """"Candide"""" to read on my return to London.'"
