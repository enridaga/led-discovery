"The neighbours and we have set up a book-club since the beginning of the year, & I want to beg you to tell me of some [italics] booklings [end italics] for it.  We have got Macaulay and Layard, and the """"Monasteries of the Levant,"""" and other big books, but I want some moderately moral French novel, or some very amusing two and sixpence or five-shilling English book to keep the thing going.  Such a book as """"La Mare au Diable"""", or """"La Chasse au Roman,"""" would be the thing, or Murray's """"Life of Conde"""", or his """"Memoirs of a Missionary.""""  Can you kindly recommend some?'"
