"[Tristan] Bernard is very engaging. I do not know why but he is.[...] It is very good of you to have sent me that volume with the others. [El√©mir] Bourges--ah, that's another matter.There are magnificent pages there. But all together more than anything else, it's surprising. You say to yourself: so that is """"Le Cr√©puscule des Dieux""""! And you continue  to be struck by the poverty of the subject.[...]. You told me to start with  that book. After fnishing it I opened the other [""""Les oiseaux s'en volent et les fleurs tombent""""]. It moved me by its splendour, the colours, the movement.' Hence follow 16 lines of reserved comment."
