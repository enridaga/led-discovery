"""""I have just been reading, for the fourth time, I believe, The Simple Story, which I intended this time to read as a critic, that I might write to Mrs Inchbald about it; but I was so carried away by it that I was totally incapable of thinking of Mrs Inchbald or anything but Miss Milner and Doriforth, who appeared as real persons... I think it the most pathetic and the most powerfully interesting tale I ever read."""""
