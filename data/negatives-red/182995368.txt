"I am very touched by all the tributes in your New Year's letter, & enormously pleased with The Last Post. I don't believe you have any last idea how much I admire your genius, & how proud it makes me of my association with you [Stella then talks about her own painting] But your letter, & the """"Last Post"""" together, seem to mark the end of our long intimacy, which did have a great deal of happiness in it for me, & which did involve us in a great deal of decent effort.'"
