"When he was ordained, the Bishop (who in those days was primus Presbyter, or Praeses) seeking to oppose him, asked him this Question, Have you read the Bible through? Yes (said he) I have read the Old Testament twice through in the Hebrew, and the New Testament often through in the Greek; and if you please to examine me in any particular place, I shall endeavour to give you an account of it. Nay (said the Bishop) if it be so, I shall need to say no more to you; only some words of Commendation and encouragement he gave him, and so with other assistants, he Ordained him. "
