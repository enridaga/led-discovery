"Rain again and rain forever. I read a great deal of Robertson's """"History of Scotland"""". I cannot forgive Elizabeth's behaviour and though Mary's is very shameful yet I cannot help feeling a sort of partiality for her, a partiality which is a tribute that I pay to her endless misfortunes and which prompts me to think that if Elizabeth had sought protection in Mary's arms she would have found a sure azylum and a hasty succour there. Robertson in giving Mary's character, perfectly expressed what you must feel in reading her history. """"You throw a veil over her frailties and faults, and approve of your tears as if they were shed for an object who drew much nearer to protection"""".'"
