"The routine of the """"Scourge"""" has grown familiar; and one tires of unbroken fine weather and smooth seas. No resource for me but the officers' little library. Therefore I must have been sleepily pouring over Dana's """"Two Years before the Mast"""": a pleasant, rough kind of book, but with something too much hauling of ropes and """"handing"""" of sails it in. ...I have been reading also """"The Amber Witch"""", a most beautiful German story, translated into English, by Lady Duff Gordon.'"
