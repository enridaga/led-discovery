"Henry James to Grace Norton, 26 September 1870, regarding process of Italian unification: """"[A] reflection I have ... ventured upon: to the purpose that the departure of the capitol from Florence may reconvert it in some degree into the Florence of old and arrest the rank modernization which we used to deplore.  But I stand aghast at these crude ratiocinations on a Cambridge basis: especially as on coming to consult a couple of newspapers, I find that there was a goodly amount of shelling and shooting on the occupation of Rome."""""
