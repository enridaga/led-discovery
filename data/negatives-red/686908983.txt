"I have just been remonstrating with Mr Knight about a couple of sentences in his charming new volume """"Some Passages in a Working Life &c."""". He quotes an early and witless sneer of Macaulay's against the Americans, and himself applies and points it in a most offensive way. As he asked for my opinion of the book, I tacked this one bit of remonstrance on the thanks I could honestly give. I must mention (as I did to him) that there is a story about me in it which has not a word of truth in it'."
