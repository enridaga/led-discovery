"I inclose you Roscoe's and Mr. Scott's letters of criticism but besides this Scott has written the margin from beginning to end and his hints are most rational - these letters will well make up to you what is unfilled up in my sheet. I send you likewise a volume of poems by a young friend of mine of very great poetical powers. I have been greatly instrumental in bringing them forward, and subscribed for ten copies and I beg you will accept of this as a small present to the neat collection upstairs which has erst been free to me'."
