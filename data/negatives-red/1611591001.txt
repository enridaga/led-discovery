"R.A., alias J.F.: 'He [uncle] sent me to an excellent school where I stayed two years. After leaving school I perused a vast number of novels and romances. I hardly ever went out of doors. I lived in a land of dreams. I was put to various occupations but nothing could please my fancy; at last I was bound to a surgeon, and while in his service I got entangled with bad associates.'"
