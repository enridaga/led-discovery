"... he devotes a whole serious and excellent essay to an exploration of the fame of Silas Hocking, who wrote novels calculated to please """"the taste of the Methodist million, who was unheard of in Knightsbridge but wildly popular in the dissenting provinces"""". Apart from any other interest, this essay throws light on Bennett's own reading background; he discusses the debate between Puritanism and the arts, describes the deep suspicion with which all fiction was regarded in Hocking circles and says: """"How often have I heard the impatient words: 'This is too exciting for me; if I went on I shouldn't be able to leave it'."""" It must have been up in Burslem, where reading had recently been regarded as a wicked sin, that he heard such remarks.'"
