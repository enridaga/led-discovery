"Barclay Hudson, an American living near by, lent him a new novel to read. It was published in Paris by the Obelisk Press, a publisher specializing mainly in pornography in English for visiting tourists, and in books banned elsewhere. The novel Hudson lent him was the recently published """"Tropic of Cancer"""" by Henry Miller. The impact was immediate, and he read it straight through twice...""""There isn't a good word to express its excellence"""", he wrote. """"Of course, like all works of genius it's strong fruit and you'd have to be careful about getting it into England"""".'"
