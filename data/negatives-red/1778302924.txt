"I note lately the evidence of an extraordinary activity on your part.  Perhaps you have observed how difficult it is to pick up a decent magazine without You in it.  I took in the """"Fortnightly"""" and the """"Strand"""" in order to run even with you.  And now damned if you haven?t let me in for """"Pearson?s""""!  And I hear rumour of a """"Dream of Armageddon"""" in something else. You make your readers work.'  "
