"?This evening my father has been reading out Gay?s Trivia to our great entertainment. I wished very much, my dear aunt, that you and Sophy had been sitting round the fire with us. If you have Trivia, and if you have time, will you humour your niece so far as to look at it? I think there are many things in it which will please you, especially the ?Patten and the Shoeblack?, and the old woman hovering over her little fire in a hard winter. Pray tell me if you like it.?"
