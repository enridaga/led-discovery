"I find distraction in writing, with a growing sense that it is not worth the trouble; but at 64 it is too late to learn a new trade. I read a bit too; though books have become dull of late. However, they amuse me at times. You sent me one the other day by a certain Santayana; who seems to be a bright & fresh sort of person. He irritated me a little by a rather meaningless philosophy; """"nothing"""", he said, I remember, """"is objectively impressive."""" How the devil should it be?'"
