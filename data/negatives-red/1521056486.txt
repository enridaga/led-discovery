"Charlotte Bronte to George Smith, 14 February 1852, after having been lent the first volume of W. M. Thackeray, """"Henry Esmond"""", in manuscript by her publishers: 'It has been a great delight to me to read Mr Thackeray's manuscript ... you must permit me ... to thank you for a pleasure so rare and special ... In the first half of the work what chiefly struck me was the wonderful manner in which the author throws himself into the spirit and letter of the times wherof he treats ... As usual -- he is unjust to women ...Many other things I noticed that -- for my part -- grieved and esxasperated me as I read -- but then again came passages so deeply thought -- so tenderly felt -- one could not help forgiving and admiring.'
