"As W[ordsworth] recalled in the Fenwick Note to We are Seven ... his reading of Shelvocke's Voyages inspired the killing of the albatross in C[oleridge]'s Ancient Mariner.  W[ordsworth] dates this reading """"a day or two before"""" the walking tour to Lynton - which would make it c.11-12 November 1797.'"
