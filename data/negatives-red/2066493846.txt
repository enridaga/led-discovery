"By the bye have you read Mr C.'s """"Adolphe""""? It divides the whole world, and I think the general opinion seems to be that it is not worthy of the talents he is supposed to possess. Nevertheless one must see that it has been written by a man of no common mind, and by a close observer of human nature under the particular situation which he describes. At least I should think he only expresses what hundreds of men have felt when they have been hampered and tied down by an unfortunate connection which they vainly wish but have not force of mind enough to break through. And now I must tell you that I am very bold in defending it for my oracle Mr Whishaw (my husband has not read it), is at the head of a large party who abuse it; but they will talk of it as a novel, and as such I am quite willing to allow that it has no great interest or merit; but take it as he calls it, an anecdote, and read it without the intention of being amused, but merely as a study of character, and surely it has considerable merit. It is impossible that the Lady can be intended for Madame de Stael, altho' many traits point out his own vacillating character in """"Adolphe"""", and perhaps some of the scenes may have been drawn from life. I should very much like to have your opinion, and still more Mr Edgeworth's, for a man must from his knowledge of men in the world, be a better judge of such subjects than a woman'."
