"Lord Francis Jeffrey to Mary Berry, 22 April 1842 ('Friday Evening'): 'I have just been reading over your admirable letter for a third time, and, after nourishing the meditations to which it led by gazing for half-an-hour on the long waves which come glittering in the moonlight to the beach below my windows [...] find that I cannot lay myself down with a quiet conscience till I have thanked you for the pleasure it has given, [italics]and the good it has done me[end italics].'"
