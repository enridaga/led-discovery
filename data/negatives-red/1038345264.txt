"We get a """"Dumfries Courier"""" here amongst us. Our third Number reached us a few days ago. It seems M'Darmaid [M'Diarmid] is become sole Editor; - it is not the opinion of the readers here, that the paper has been a gainer by the change. The Ranger seems (under favour) to be but a silly kind of person - and his friend Mr Bright is a very vapid gentleman. It is a pity that Spoudastes his labours have been curtailed, before he has completed his investigations. But we must make a shift to live without knowing who wrote Mary's dream.'"
