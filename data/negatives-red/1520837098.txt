"Dorothy Wordsworth to Catherine Clarkson, 12 May 1811: 'We have had no leisure for reading.  I have not opened a Book except on a Sunday, and when the rest of the family were in bed ... the only book which I have read through has been Beaver's account of the disastrous Expedition to Bulama.  I suppose you have read his book as it concerns Africa and the Slave Trade.'"
