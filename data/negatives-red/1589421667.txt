"I have been in bed 9 days now and still must not get up. My one enjoyment is in reading the letters of Carlyle and Jane Welsh before their marriage... She begins in the smartest, pertest, Jane Welsh way, but gradually the other Jane begins to break through, passionate, melancholy, impatient, fun-loving - fame-hungry almost - and nervous. But she seems to care for him only as a friend - the idea of marriage is disgusting to her. She is very like me; they had not met for months, had only two hours, and she wasted it all by forcing a quarrel she did not want. And her """"arch enemy"""" was headache.'"
