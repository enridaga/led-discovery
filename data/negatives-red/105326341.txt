"My mind also had become much quieted and strengthened by the reading of Butler's """"Analogy"""", which I had always heard mentioned with admiration, and which I stumbled upon, as it seemed accidentally (though doubtless it was a Providential help sent me), while we were spending a few days at the Hermitage. I took it up first for curiosity, and read it through nearly, but not quite to the end; feeling very much afraid all the time that some one would inquire into my studies, and being greatly humiliated by an observation made by William, who one day found me with it in my hand. His surprised tone as he exclaimed, """"You can't understand that"""", made me shrink into my shell of reserve, and for years I never owned to anyone that Butler's """"Analogy"""" had been to me, as it has been to hundreds, the stay of a troubled intellect and a weak faith'."
