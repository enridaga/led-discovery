"Read a little of the life of Baxter; very interesting, and apparently deserving Coleridge's recommendation. Dreadful picture of the state of the church at that time - players, gamblers, drunkards with forged notes; men 80 or 90 years old, of course never preaching; Maypole dancing &c. on the Sunday.'"
