"Rarely do the men write of their life out here; too illiterate; most of the letters are confined to remarks on their own health; questions to the welfare of those at home; and prayers; so very often, prayers to God to take care of those they have left behind them. From 90% of the letters you would never discover the men were on active service. A very strong religious strain runs through most of the letters, and I rather admire my old shell-backs for it.'"
