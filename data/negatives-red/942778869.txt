"Passages transcribed into E. M. Forster, Commonplace Book (1937) include extract from Cowley's Essay No. 5 ('The Garden'), dedicated to John Evelyn, and opening: 'I never had any other Desire so strong, and so like to Covetousness as that one which I have had always. That I might be Master at last of a small House and a large Garden, with very modern Conveniencies joined to them, and there dedicate the remainder of my Life to the Culture of them and the study of Nature.'
