"[extract of a letter from the Earl of Orrery to Dr Birch] I have just now seen the specimen of Mr Johnson's dictionary, addressed to Lord Chesterfield. I am much pleased with the plan, and I think the specimen is one of the best that I have ever read. Most specimens disgust, rather than prejudice us in favour of the work to follow; but the language of Mr Johnson's is good, and the arguments are properly and modestly expressed'."
