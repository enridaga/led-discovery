"As to books, we (in this house) are very old-fashioned; and I am only now indulging in Froude's """"Elizabeth"""". I did not mean to read it, - being disgusted by his dishonest treatment of evidence in his """"Henry"""": but the review notices tempted me at last; and I find """"Elizabeth"""" extremely entertaining, - however provoking'."
