"Henry James to William James, 1 January 1883, on having received William's farewell letter to their father too late for Henry James Sr to see it before he died: """"I went out yesterday (Sunday) morning, to the Cambridge cemetary ... and stood beside his grave a long time and read him your letter of farewell -- which I am sure he heard somewhere out of the depths of the still, bright winter air."""""
