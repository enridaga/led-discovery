"Of Ben Jonson's Alchemist he writes: """"It is very happily managed indeed to make Subtle use so many terms of alchemy, and talk with such fanatical warmth about his 'great art,' even to his accomplice.  As Hume says, roguery and enthusiasm run into each other.  I admire this play very much.  The plot would have been more agreeable, and more rational, if Surly had married the widow whose honor he has preserved.  Lovewit is as contemptible as Subtle himself.  The whole of the trick about the Queen of Fairy is improbable in the highest degree.  But, after all, the play is as good as any in our language out of Shakespeare.""""'"
