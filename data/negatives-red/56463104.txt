"[Letter from Mrs Ward to the Society of Authors when that body recommended Herbert Spencer not George Meredith for the Nobel Prize] If Mr Meredith had written nothing but the love scenes in """"Richard Feverel""""; """"The Egoist""""; and certain passages of description in """"Vittoria"""" and """"Beauchamp's Career"""", he would still stand at the head of English """"dichtung"""" [the quality Mrs Ward thought the prize should reward] There is no critic now who can be ranged with him in position, and no poet. As a man of letters he is easily first; to compare Mr Spencer's power of clear statement with the play of imaginative genius in Meredith would be absurd - in the literary field'."
