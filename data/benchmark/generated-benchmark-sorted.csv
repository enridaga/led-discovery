The signals to the choir and band worked admirably, and I must add that Dr. Alcock (now organist of Salisbury Cathedral) at the organ extemporised so effectively that the whole affair, which might have proved an awkward moment if not a catastrophe, passed off as if it had been rehearsed as a part of the programme.

rehearsing these two distinguished pupils, and they 
each accepted a Book of the Music from me as a 
reward for their keen attention to their studies ! 

The Processional anthem ""I was glad"" made a 
splendid effect, the Westminster boys' "" Vivats "" 
coming in with superb effect. And they had an extra 
chance also, for in consequence of His Majesty the 
King not entering the Choir until some time after Her 
Majesty the Queen, the "" Vivats "" had to be repeated. 
It was here that the value of Dr. Borland's system of 
signals, already referred to, was fully revealed, and my 
precaution in adopting them amply vindicated. The 
signals to the choir and band worked admirably, and 
I must add that Dr. Alcock (now organist of Salisbury 
Cathedral) at the organ extemporised so effectively 
that the whole affair, which might have proved an 
awkward moment if not a catastrophe, passed off as if 
it had been rehearsed as a part of the programme. 
Sir Walter Pariatt sat on the conductor's platform 
with me, taking his share in conducting the orchestral 
music and directing the performance of his own anthem. 

Concerning my Homage anthem no cut was 
necessary. The aged Archbishop Temple was a little 
slower over the ' 4 Homage "" than we had anticipated, 
the music in its entirety being required to accompany 
this picturesque function. 



194 A WESTMINSTER PILGRIM 

A striking feature of the ceremony was the Procession 
of the Regalia, which formed an early and interesting 
item in the day's proceedings. The Abbey clergy 
charged to bear the regal symbols from the Jerusalem 
Chamber into the Church were accompanied in pro- 
cession by the choir. Traversing the Cloisters, singing 
the hymn "" Rejoice to day with one accord,"" to the 
grand old tune "" Ein' feste Burg,"" a pause was made 
for a short service in Edward the Confessor's Chapel, 
and another pause near the Chapel of Henry VII., 
while Tallis's Litany was sung as above described ; 
then, supported by two trumpets and three trombones, 
the procession was resumed, to the strains of "" O God, 
our help in ages past."" At the last verse, as the singers 
comprising the choirs of the Abbey and the Chapel 
Royal neand the great West door, the hymn was taken 
up by the Coronation choir and the vast congregation,

The concert opened with an overture which is a great favorite here, and often played in public, though I have not heard it in America,— “Iphigene in Aulis,” by Gluck. It is a charming overture, and any one’s musical reputation might safely rest on the production of a single piece like this. Its subjects are at once natural and beautiful, and they are always treated in a most masterly manner; with elaborateness it is always intelligible, and with copiousness it is never diffuse. There is no departing from the main topic of discourse, no wandering in the mazes of thick darkness, or searching for ideas, but the leading thoughts are kept ever before the mind, presented now in this form, and now in that. Its analogies are perfect, its contrasts are striking, and its light and shade are applied with the hand of a Raphael or a Turner. It is full of pleasing melody, yet always subject to the laws of good taste, and manifesting both genius and science; it is in the performance, perhaps, equally satisfactory both to the musician and to the mere unstudied lover of song. The second piece was an extract (first and second movements) of Cherubini’s Requiem, written for male voices. This, which is one of Cherubini’s great works, was written under circumstances somewhat exciting, as I remember to have heard years ago. On some funeral occasion when a Requiem was desired, that which he had previously written was rejected, because composed for a mixed choir; this caused him to put forth his energies, in the production of a mass for men’s voices only. The music throughout is of a very high character, though it would not much interest those who desire musical gratification only from pretty tunes or pleasant voices. The first movement, “Requiem aeternam” with its accompaniment of violoncellos and double basses, is plaintive and sad, and tells only of sorrow, penitence and grief. In the “Dies irae,” the full powers of the orchestra are brought into requisition; and uniting, as was the case on the present occasion, with sixty well-trained and fearless men’s voices, the effect was awfully grand and commanding. The majestic movements, the severely dissonant harmonies, the wailings of the strings, the frightful appeals of the instruments of blast and percussion, and the cryings out of the voices, all combined to produce an effect which was, at times, truly terrific and overwhelming. The nineteen stanzas, however, have furnished an opportunity for musical contrasts which have been well introduced, affording variety and relief. The third piece was the very unique but, to the musician, highly interesting ""Concert fur 2 claviere (c moll) Von J. S. Bach."" Following the Requiem, it was like a delightful calm after a storm, enabling one to realize where he was, to breathe easily again, and put on a cheerful countenance. Several part-songs were then sung by the “Mannerchor” without accompaniment. The second part consisted of the “Sinfonie in C minor, by L. Von Beethoven” What a symphonie this is! We have often heard it, and it is well known in America. We will not attempt a description; we listened with intense interest to the whole of it, hardly daring to breathe in the piano and not having the power to do so in the forte passages.

at a charity concert, which she gave for the 
Swansea Hospital in the eighties. The distance 
from her home was about twenty miles by rail, 
and all along the embankments crowds of miners 
stood with their wives and children, watching 
the train go by, and cheering her and waving 
their caps and handkerchiefs as she passed 
along. On her arrival at Swansea she was re- 
ceived by the Mayor and some members of the 
corporation, and a company of the local volun- 
teers with their bands playing. She drove in 
an open carriage with her husband, and other

carriages followed with the rest of the artists 
and her friends staying at the castle, through 
the streets to the Albert Hall. The ships in 
the harbour were decked with flags, and on 
each side of the way, bunting with such mottoes 
as "" God bless the Queen of Song,"" "" Welcome,"" 
"" Long live Adelina Patti,"" etc., decorated the 
route. From the house windows the inhabitants 
cheered, and likewise the crowds of people in 
the streets. 

The Albert Hall at Swansea was crowded to 
suffocation. She sang several of her favourite 
songs, and ended with the ever-popular "" Home, 
Sweet Home,"" which made many of the audi- 
ence shed tears. Numerous floral offerings which 
consisted of the choicest flowers were handed to 
her on the platform. At the end of the concert 
the Member of Parliament for Swansea made an 
eloquent speech, in which he thanked her for 
her generosity and kindness in coming so far to 
help the hospital. A suitable reply was made 
for her by a friend. Our return to the railway 
station was again a scene of enthusiasm and 
deafening cheering, her castle being reached in

I went, first, to the grand opera, and was delighted with the magnificence of the scenery, decorations, and dresses, and, above all, with their choruses ; in that department they decidedly bear away the palm from every other country the orchestra was most minutely attended to, and more numerous than even that of San Carlo at Naples : but the principal singers (God save them) made a shriek louder than I thought any human beings capable of producing. The opera was Gluck's Iphigenia, which we had performed at Vienna ; but for decorations and effect, Paris beat us out of the field. The chorus and procession, where Pylades and Orestes in chains, were dragged on by Gardel, Vestris, and a host of first-rate dancers, were beyond any thing I could have conceived. I went the next night to the same theatre, and saw the first representation of the grand serious opera of ""Oedipe a Colon ;"" the music by Sacchini, was delightful and enchanting. I there heard, for the first time, the celebrated bass singer, Cheron, who played the part of Oedipe, and sang in a delightful style ; it was quite different from the performance of the night before, indeed I could scarcely imagine myself in the same theatre. I saw, too, the opera of Phedra, and had great pleasure in seeing Madame St. Auberti perform the part of Phedra ; she was a great actress, and when she sang in a demi voice, was quite charming. This unfortunate lady and accomplished actress subsequently married, and with her husband, the Count d'Entraigues, was robbed and murdered by their servant when in England. In this opera I felt much gratified by hearing Monsieur Lais, possessing a fine baritone voice, with much taste and expression ; but his greatest praise, in my opinion, was, that he was very unlike a French singer. The next theatre I visited, was the Francais. Their great tragedians, at the time, were on leave of absence in the provinces ; I had not, therefore, an opportunity of seeing a tragedy, but I was amply compensated by their excellent comedians ; their comic acting is always natural. I saw Mole act the part of Duretete, in Farquhar's Inconstant, admirably. Fleury was inimitable in Le Pupile (the guardian) ; and Madame Contare in Susan, Beaumarchais' Marriage of Figaro, exquisite. Dugazzon was a fine low comedian ; indeed, I thought all the actors good ; but my favourite theatre of all was the Theatre Italien, in the Rue Favart, where French comic operas were performed ; the orchestra was very good, and the actors and singers equally so, a Mademoiselle Renard had a most delightful voice, and was a sweet singer. I saw there "" Richard Coeur de Lion,"" and enjoyed its charming music. I thought it always Gretry's masterpiece. Clairval, the original Blondel, gave the air of "" O Richard ! O mon Roi !"" with great expression. His acting in the scene when he heard the voice of Richard from the prison, was electrifying : his joy, his surprise, at having found his king, the trembling of his voice, his scrambling up the tree to let Richard hear his voice, and the expression altogether, made an impression on me that never can be effaced ; and while I remained at Paris, I never missed going to see him.

before, indeed I could scarcely imagine myself in the 
same theatre. I saw, too, the opera of Phedra, and 
had great pleasure in seeing Madame St. Auberti 
perform the part of Phedra ; she was a great actress, 
and when she sang in a deml voice, was quite charm- 
ing. This unfortunate lady and accomplished ac- 
tress subsequently married, and with her husband, 
the Count (TEntraigues, was robbed and murdered 
by their servant when in England. 

In this opera I felt much gratified by hearing 
Monsieur Lais, possessing a fine baritone voice, 
with much taste and expression ; but his greatest 
praise, in my opinion, was, that he was very unlike 
a French singer. The next theatre I visited, was 



286 REMINISCENCES OF 

the Francais. Their great tragedians, at the time, 
were on leave of absence in the provinces ; I had 
not, therefore, an opportunity of seeing a tragedy, 
but I was amply compensated by their excellent 
comedians ; their comic acting is always natural. I 
saw Mole act the part of Duretete, in Farquhar's 
Inconstant, admirably. Fleury was inimitable in 
Le Pupile (the guardian) ; and Madame Contare 
in Susan, Beaumarchais"" Marriage of Figaro, exqui- 
site. Dugazzon was a fine low comedian ; indeed, 
I thought all the actors good ; but my favourite 
theatre of all was the Theatre Italien, in the Rue 
Favart, where French comic operas were performed ; 
the orchestra was very good, and the actors and 
singers equally so, a Mademoiselle Renard had a 
most delightful voice, and was a sweet singer. 

I saw there "" Richard Coeur de Lion,"""" and en- 
joyed its charming music. I thought it always 
Gretry^s masterpiece. Clairval, the original Blon- 
del, gave the air of "" O Richard ! O mon Roi !"" 
with great expression. His acting in the scene 
when he heard the voice of Richard from the prison, 
was electrifying : his joy, his surprise, at having 
found his king, the trembling of his voice, his scram- 
bling up the tree to let Richard hear his voice, and 
the expression altogether, made an impression on me 
that never can be effaced ; and while I remained at 
Paris, I never missed going to see hi"

There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again.

It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently 
so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. 
There is always so much caution and incredulity, and some- 
times suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to 

fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties.

84 SYMPHONY BY HERMANIT, 

Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner m 
""Which his work was received, and probably a young composer 
does not often obtain greater approbation. There were un- 
doubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste 
and judgment. Its themes were concise and dear, and there 
seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine 
feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious 
repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, 
though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the 
melodic passages ; a greater variety of coloring in this respect 
might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural 
and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a raptur 
ous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The 
interest too was well sustained through the four movements, 
and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this 
Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author 
may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his 
study, and try again. ^ 

Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, Lon- 
don, sang with approbation ; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from 
Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux 
Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charm-

At the precise hour the organ prelude commenced; it continued two minutes, and the first Lied immediately followed. There was no introit, or introductory motette as in the Nicolai and Thomas churches. The choir consisted of three boys and two men; and beside these, the organist, another person walking about in the organ loft, and myself, there was but one person present — a goodly old lady; so that when the service commenced, the congregation in fact consisted of but one woman. It reminded me of the clergyman who, when he had no one present but the clerk, took the liberty to alter the prescribed form of the service, reading not “Dearly beloved brethren” but “Dearly beloved Roger.” Here was an occasion then, when the singing was indeed congregational. The members of the choir were all singing, the old lady appeared to sing, and I joined the general chorus. The organ was full and made up for any deficiency of vocal power. I observed that in some stanzas the voices commenced without the organ, and sung three or four syllables, when they were joined by the full organ; though in some other stanzas the voices and organ were simultaneous in their commencement. This, however, can have nothing to do with that which we sometimes call expression or the adaptation of the tune to the different stanzas of the hymn, for no attention whatever is paid to this subject here; there is no variation of soft and loud, but every stanza is loud, and is apparently sung and played without the slightest reference to the principle above mentioned. Indeed the principle of adaptation (as generally understood by us in the United States), seems not to belong to the Congregational style of singing. The minister, who was not present at the commencement of the service, came in during the singing of the last stanza, faced the cross upon the altar for a few moments, and then turning towards the people (by this time numbering perhaps between twenty or thirty), he commenced the responsive chanting service. His first sentence is confined to about half a dozen words, which are given in the tones three and five of the scale; this being responded to by the choir, the minister chants quite a long sentence, after which the choir respond Amen. The response closed upon five of the scale, ascending to it by the sharp four — thus five, three, sharp four, five. After this the minister read about two minutes — the people rising. This was followed by the organ, and another hymn. The minister retired the moment he had finished reading (prayer) and was not present during the singing that followed; but at the close of the hymn, as before, he came in and read a scriptural lesson; again he retired, and again the organ announced another choral. By this time some fifty or sixty persons had assembled, and they succeeded in raising quite a chorus. At the close of the last stanza the minister appeared, not at the altar, but in the pulpit, and after half a dozen words of prayer, commenced his sermon. And now the choir, three boys and two men, took their turn in going out; as the minister seemed to have nothing to do with their part of the service, so, I suppose, they were alike relieved when he began to preach. Considering myself by profession and long habit as more nearly allied to choristers than preachers, and especially as I could not understand what was said, and as I could retire without being noticed, and without disturbing others, 1 followed their example.","this afternoon.

It may be stated, in confirmation of the judgment of 
the London audience, that "" I Masnadieri "" was never 
successful on any Italian stage. The libretto was even 
worse constructed than is usually the case with adapta- 
tions of foreign dramas to the purpose of Italian 
opera. To Her Majesty's Theatre the work was sin- 
gularly ill-suited. The interest which ought to have 
been centred in Mademoiselle Lind was centred in

Here was again a success- nay, a great and noisy success — but yet a doubtful one. After the comparative unanimity with which ""Nabucco"" had been received, it seemed necessary for the forces of the opposition to recommence the attack against a school which now threatened to make its way with the town. Party spirit on the subject was again rife. Whilst, by the Anti-Verdians, ""I Lombardi"" was declared to be flimsy, trashy, worthless ; the Verdi party, and the adherents of the modern Italian school, pronounced it to be full of power, vigour, and originality. The one portion asserted that it was utterly devoid of melody — the other, that it was replete with melody of the most charming kind; the one again insisted that it was the worst work of the aspirant — the other, that it was the young composer's chef-d'oeuvre. And in the midst of this conflict — so analogous to the old feud between the partizans of Gluck and Piccini — public opinion, as usual, seemed undecided and wavering, uttering its old formula of ""Well! I don't know!""

Party spirit on the subject was again rife. Whilst, by 
the Anti-Verdians, "" I Lombard!"" was declared to be 
flimsy, trashy, worthless ; the Verdi party, and the ad-

that it was replete with melody of the most charming

young composer's chef-d'osuvre. And in the midst

They are held in a somewhat smaller room, and at a small subscription price, and are given only once in two weeks. The orchestra consists of about sixty talented musicians, and if Dreyschock and David are not seen leading the violins here as at the Gewandhaus, they, together with the other instruments, string and wind, are in the hands of artists of deservedly high reputation. The selections are also of the highest order, and the Euterpe presents its patrons with the works of the great masters in a style worthy of a Leipzig concert. At a quarter of an hour before the time of commencement, the members of the orchestra were in their places, talking, tuning and getting ready. This, together with the general conversation of the people assembled, produces a buzzing chorus of great power — a chorus with which the Leipzig concerts commence. Every ticket was sold at an early hour, and of course every seat was occupied. The concert commenced precisely at the hour appointed, with a new Sinfonie in E flat Major, in manuscript, by W. Westmayer, who conducted the performance. He is a young candidate for fame, who has been educated at the Conservatory here, and who is regarded as already a successful composer. The Sinfonie consisted of four parts, and occupied in its performance exactly thirty-eight minutes. I dare not attempt anything like a particular description of it, or comparison of it with other like compositions; it was listened to with good attention by a discriminating audience, and met a favorable reception. It seemed to me, however, to want light and shade, and variety in the treatment of the different subjects introduced. Parts of it were exceedingly interesting, considered in reference to modern combinations and contrasts of the different orchestral elements, but there was a too constant forte, and a too frequent reiteration of the tonic and dominant harmony, with brass instruments, in military rhythm — this, indeed, is a general resort of such composers as are sometimes at a loss for an idea, or in a similar condition with the public speaker who is obliged to speak, but has nothing in particular to say. I do not mean that Mr. Westmayer was minus thought, but still there was not such a flow as we often find in a Mozart. The Sinfonie was truly good, and seemed to give much satisfaction — and yet I could not help thinking that it was an excellent preparation for the high appreciation of the next orchestral piece, which was no less an overture than the celebrated No. 2, C Major, to Leonore, and which was given with an effect far beyond what can be often heard. The overture by C. M. Von Weber, to Oberon, was also played with such an energy and brilliancy as to take one’s breath away. The stillness of the pianos, the gradual and immense range of the crescendos, the thundering power of the fortes, with instantaneous contrasts and startling sfortzandos, were enough to work up the feelings to a perfect phrenzy. Wonderfully effective were these ever favorite overtures by Beethoven and Weber. It was no small attraction of this concert that the piano forte was played by the Fraulein Maria Wieck, the sister of the celebrated Clara, wife of Robert Schumann. Mdlle. Wieck is a very superior player; she has not the strong hand of a DeMeyer or a Listz, but she has a most finished touch, and plays with great elegance and expression. Her first piece (hear it, oh ye of the exclusive modern school,) was nothing more nor less than Dussek’s 12th Concerto in E fiat major, the Adagio and Allegro movements of which she played — a most beautiful composition, elegant and tasteful in the highest degree, played both by the principal and by the orchestra as near perfection as such things can be done. There is nothing in the music to astonish, or to excite wonder or surprise, but there is that in it which is adapted to call forth perfect delight. It is full of peace, and innocence, and purity, and joy, and it is from beginning to end a constant appeal to the perception of the beautiful. I am no enemy to the modem school; it is indispensable to an accomplished pianist, and every well-educated musician will delight in it; but they err who suppose that in Clementi and Cramer and Dussek and Pleyel, there is nothing good or worth being saved. The fact is, the pianists, previous to him who is generally regarded as the head of the great modern school, had worked out a very satisfactory solution of the problem of piano forte playing, or certainly so if considered with reference to the more natural and legitimate powers of the instrument. Thaiberg, Listz, and others, have certainly much enlarged the boundaries, or the available capacities of the piano, but some of their followers have gone to extremes; so much so that there has seemed to be danger of losing altogether the ordinary effects of piano forte playing, or that they would he swallowed up in the extraordinary feats of left-hand melodies, flights of octaves, and the various methods by which amazement and wonder are excited. Thanks for the signs of returning soberness and good sense; we greatly mistake if other authors like Dussek are not yet to be brought back to the concert room, and to the parlor, to fill with delight the spirit of the true lover of music, and of the most beautiful of all keyed instruments, the piano forte. A word to another class. There are some who condemn altogether the modern school, and who seem to suppose that all true musical genius left the world with Haydn and those of his day. Fraulein Wieck is not of their number, for while she played Dussek, in the first part of the concert, she played not Thalberg, or Listz, or DeMeyer in the second part, but Pagannini! Yes, the Carnival of Venice, arranged for the piano, and if music pleased legitimately in Dussek, the Fraulein excited no small degree of feeling by her exquisite touch, and facility of execution in the composition of the Prince of violinists. What if it be mere trickery; a dexterous artifice will always, at least, call forth admiration, and one does not always want to sit in sober judgment; and decide on the grounds of intrinsic musical merit — relaxation must be indulged, the beautiful give way to the ornamental, and true pleasure to mere amusement. If there is a time for all things, surely there is room enough for the old and new school of piano forte playing — yes, and for both schools of organ playing too, although this is not the place to dwell upon the latter. There was still another interesting feature in the Euterpe&nbsp;Concert — it was the singing of Mdlle. Louise Wolfl.

As a matter of fact, however, Seidl scarcely had an opportunity of displaying his powers in London as a concert conductor. His appearances there were solely in connection with opera— the “Nibelungen "" performances at Her Majesty's in 1882, and the German representations at Covent Garden in 1897. In the course of the latter I saw him frequently, and one night he accompanied me to a Richter concert at St. James's Hall. He had not seen his great Viennese rival upon the platform for many years, and was especially curious to hear his rendering of Tschaikowsky's “Pathetique "" symphony. He was delighted with every feature save one. Directly after starting the second (5-4) movement, Richter laid down his baton and allowed the band to proceed without guidance to the end of the piece. Seidl knit his brows and looked stern, but did not utter a word till the room was ringing with applause. Then he turned to me and said: ''I wish he had not done that. It was to show that, in spite of the awkward rhythm, his men could keep perfectly together without the beat, and maintain the necessary precision all through the movement.

I was fortunate in being engaged as one of the second violins, and was much gratified when, during the first rehearsal, Berlioz said, ""Ganz, I want you to play the small cymbals with Silas in the scherzo"" We were rehearsing his Romeo and Juliet symphony, which has a wonderfully light and fairy-like scherzo to represent ""Queen Mab,"" and he had had two pairs of small antique cymbals made to give a particular effect in it. There were several orchestral rehearsals, which for England at that time was a really great innovation. Every one was intensely enthusiastic, and anxious to please Berlioz, who was a wonderful conductor. His beat was clear and precise, and he took endless trouble to get everything right. I remember his asking Silas and me to come and see him in King Street, St. James's, just to try over the passage for the little cymbals. I mention this to show the care he took over every detail. As a result, the first concert proved a veritable triumph for him, and it was generally admitted that no such orchestral performance had ever before been heard in England.

ists, such as Sivori, Jansa (violinists), Goffrie 
(viola), the great 'cellist Piatti, Bottesini, the 
famous contrabassist, Remusat the flautist, 
Barret the oboist, and Lazarus the clarinettist. 
I was fortunate in being engaged as one of the 
second violins, and was much gratified when, 
during the first rehearsal, Berlioz said, "" Ganz, I 
want you to play the small cymbals with Silas 
in the scherzo"" We were rehearsing his Romeo 
and Juliet symphony, which has a wonderfully 
light and fairy-like scherzo to represent "" Queen 
Mab,"" and he had had two pairs of small antique 
cymbals made to give a particular effect in it. 
There were several orchestral rehearsals, which 
for England at that time was a really great in- 
novation. Every one was intensely enthusiastic, 
and anxious to please Berlioz, who was a wonder- 
ful conductor. His beat was clear and precise, 
and he took endless trouble to get everything 
right. I remember his asking Silas and me to 
come and see him in King Street, St. James's, 
just to try over the passage for the little cymbals. 
I mention this to show the care he took over 
every detail. 

As a result, the first concert proved a veritable 
triumph for him, and it was generally admitted 
that no such orchestral performance had ever

Rantzau'' on July 7. Mascagni's third opera had

of ^^Cavalleria Rusticana^' and founded upon a 
novel, '^Les Deux Freres,'' by MM. Erckmann- 
Chatrian, the authors of ^'L'Amico Fritz."" Un- 
fortunately, the material of the plot proved alto- 
gether inadequate for a four-act opera, while the 
love interest which so largely predominated in 
^'L'Amico Fritz'' was here subordinated to the 
events of a sordid quarrel between two wilful, ill- 
tempered brothers. Moreover, Mascagni treated 
the quarrel in an intensely tragic vein, which is 
nowhere more strikingly exemplified than in the 
long and elaborate finale to the first act. This

were by Mendelssohn, and one of which may be fi>und in the

MASONB.txt,1448276340407,30017:39003,1099,0.12230135766748275,"I have this evening had an opportunity of attending one of the famous subscription concerts in this city, known as the Gewandhaus Concerts. The concert room is not large, but convenient, and good for musical effect. The centre of the room is occupied by ladies, and the outer seats mostly by gentlemen. A narrow gallery, in which are a number of private boxes, runs round the room. The first object of attraction, after entering the room, is a fine large medallion of Mendelssohn, back of the orchestra; there is no other bust or picture in the room. It makes one feel sod when looking at this fine representation of the great modem composer, in the very room where he has been, and still is, so highly appreciated, and where he has so often triumphed gloriously, to think that he was cut off in his youth, and that the musical world, after so short a time of enjoyment, was deprived of the talents and learning of one who promised to do for music, perhaps, more than any man living. At almost every concert, more or less of his music is performed; his memory is cherished, not only here, where he was so well known, but by all the musical world, and his name shall be held in everlasting remembrance. A crowd of people were waiting round the door, when we arrived; and, although it was an hour before the time for the performance to commence, the room was filled, (save the reserved seats in the gallery,) in a few minutes after the door was opened. One must be on hand at an early hour to get a good seat. In about half an hour the members of the orchestra began to make their appearance, and as all the people in the house were talking loud, so the musicians, as they came in, one after another, began to tune, to try their instruments, and to amuse themselves by running over the scales; so that by the time they were all there, thus employed, the room was filled with sound; the more so because, as the musicians began to exercise themselves upon their instruments, the talking and laughing grew louder and louder, and at a quarter of an hour before the commencement of the music, it was a perfect Babel in the concert room, and as difficult to hear one speak as it is in a railroad car, with all the windows open, in summer. But a few minutes before the hour, the room began to grow quiet, musical expectation began to awaken, and when, as the precise moment arrived, the conductor’s signal was heard, everything was still, and perfect silence took the place of noise and confusion. Another signal, and the whole band, as one man, were heard interpreting and presenting to a most attentive audience, one of the great works of the immortal Beethoven. It was the Sinfonie No. 8, F major. This is not regarded as one of Beethoven’s greatest triumphs; but, although it is light and playful, it abounds in each of its four movements, with the most fanciful and imaginative melodic figures, contrapuntal points, and instrumental contrasts. Ever lively and ever new, it never tires, but holds one in a kind of musical ecstasy from beginning to end; there seems to be no place where one can relax attention, or cease to be filled with musical delight; so that at the close of each part, a good long breath naturally comes in as a relief; and one becomes conscious of the intensity of the application he has been giving to the discourse. The very first thing which strikes one, on hearing such an orchestra as this, is the perfect oneness of the violins. They do, indeed, constitute a perfect chorus — ten or more persons are playing the first violin, and as many more the second; but they are all artists, and, therefore, each one loses himself; no one is heard above the others; but all so beautifully blend as to constitute one perfect whole. This is the perfection of a chorus, be it vocal or instrumental; and this effect is produced by the Gewandhaus Orchestra. Another point, immediately noticed, is the proper proportion of wind and stringed instruments; but perhaps the most striking point, as contrasted with our American orchestras, is the perfection of the wind instruments. It is too often the case in our orchestras that some wind instrument is wanting; thus the oboe or the faggotto is often missing; and again, it is not unfrequently the case that, although there may be some one to hold these or other instruments in the hand, or up to the sight of the audience, a tone is seldom permitted to escape from them; they are seen but not heard, Not so here; every instrument is not only represented to the eye, but is in the hands of a master who makes it speak to the ear. The consequence is, that such combinations fall upon the ear as are not heard with us. The brass instruments too are made to tell their story without any impediment of speech; whereas, with us, they stutter, or falter, or hem, or cough, to the no small disturbance of the equilibrium of one’s temper. We do not know that in this concert every instrument is played in all respects right; we do not know but some notes may have been omitted, or wrong tones produced, but certain are we that we did not discover any such imperfections. There are four things, (technical points,) that we have seldom heard well exhibited elsewhere, which were exceedingly well brought out here, viz.: Piano, Crescendo, Diminuendo and Fortzando. These, with the other technicals of playing were so well observed, that added to the pure tone peculiar to each particular instrument, and connected with a most perfect amalgamation or blending of all the different elements of the orchestra, they seemed to produce, not a mere musical performance to be listened to, but a living being, or moral, spiritual existence, capable of expressing the deepest feeling, and of calling forth the strongest sympathies of humanity. The Sinfonie being over, and a few moments for rest having been given, old Handel visited us in an Arie from his Opera “Aerio” — “Folle e colui che al tuo favor si fida.” It was sung by Herrn Salvatore Marchesi, who was the only vocalist for the evening. The song was well sung; but we sometimes hear quite as good singing across the Atlantic. Belletti is decidedly his superior. The third piece was a Flute Concerto; it was a tiresome affair. A Flute Concerto is a Flute Concerto, whether in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or the Melodeon; and although it may not be always played by Herrn W. Haake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is always the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances. In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of Ossian, (often played in New York and Boston,) by N. W. Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, “Qui sdegno non s' accende."" 3d. Mendelssohn’s concerto for the piano forte, in D. Minor. 4th. Arie from Don Giovanni, by Mozart, “Madamina, il catalogo e questo,"" and 5th. The very fine overture to the opera, “Der Wassertrager,” by Cherubini. Gade’s overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime. Something like an Old Chorale pervades the whole, which seems to tell of worship, and to call forth humble adoration. With what grandeur this subject was given out, and oft in the course of the piece alluded to by the brass instruments, or exemplified and illustrated by the others, cannot be told. The overture is known with us, but it requires and deserves dose study. The Piano Forte Concerto, D (not G) Minor, failed for want of a performer; a highly promising young lad of the conservatory attempted it, but he had neither grasp of mind nor of hand enough for Mendelssohn. Herr Marchesi sang both airs well, gaining for himself decided applause. On the whole, here is a highly-talented and well-regulated orchestra. The conductor for the evening was Julius Rietz, well known to the musical world. I will mention one or two things about the audience: 1st. Gentlemen took off their hats before passing the door of the hall, all of them, without a single exception; and this, although they were there an hour before the performance commenced. There was not a single man standing under the galleries or near the doors, uncovered. The ungentlemanly act of standing or sitting in a concert room with hats on, could not be seen in the Gewandhaus. 2d. Ladies were all in full dress. 3d. There was silence during the performance of music. The moment the music ceased, then indeed there was a perfect buzzing of voices, and very loud talking all over the room; but at the signal for the commencement of the music, all was still; and we were not prevented from hearing the music by those whisperings, so annoying in some places. On the whole, this was a very fine concert; the orchestra playing was as near to perfection, I doubt not, as can often be found; and that constitutes the great attraction of the Gewandhaus. Every man seems to be able to play on his own instrument well; every man seems to give undivided attention to the music, and to endeavor to observe carefully, not only the time, as given by the conductor, but all those little gesticulations by which expression is indicated. &nbsp;","gallery,

in the Gewandhaus, Hanover Square rooms, Tripler Hall or 
the Melodeon ; and although it may not be always played by 
Herm W. Sdake, (who certainly did his duty well,) it is al- 
ways the most dry and uninteresting of musical performances. 

In part 2d was given, 1st, the beautiful overture Echoes of

Gade. 2d. Arie from Zauberflote, by Mozart, "" Qui adegno

"" Madamina^ il catahgo e quesio^'* and 5th. The very fine over-

Gade's overture may be regarded as a sacred piece. It 
speaks of greatness, and calls forth emotions of the sublime.

We played in a room adjoining the parlor where the religious service was held. We began with the

My second concert was in June 1856, given in 
conjunction with my uncles, Leopold and Moritz 
Ganz, the Conzertmeister to the King of Prussia, 
who had come over from Berlin, and my eldest 
brother, Eduard Ganz, who was a pupil of 
Moscheles and Thalberg. 

At this second concert we had many artists 
of European reputation to assist, such as Madame 
Clara Novello, who had a beautiful, bell-like, 
soprano voice. For years people used to rave 
about her singing of "" God save the Queen "" at 
the opening of the great Exhibition in 1851. 
The last time I heard her was at her farewell 
concert in 1860, at which she sang in Benedict's 
cantata Undine. I do not remember any other 
English singer with such a beautiful voice, and 
she was a very handsome woman as well.

The success of the work on the first night was ""tremendous."" Never, perhaps, had any new opera been received with such frenzied acclamation. The opera, there is no doubt, abounded in striking and captivating morceaux, and had been composed with earnestness and power. Of melody, there was a rich store, although the ever popular air, by Dr. Arne, ""Where the bee sucks,"" judiciously employed by the composer for the pantomimic music of his Ariel and as the finale of the opera, stood out amidst all its modern companions with a delicious freshness.  After the performance, Monsieur Halevy, while on the stage, was overwhelmed with congratulations. All the foreign artists were warm in their expressions of delight. One after the other they approached him to say, ""How beautiful! How charming! How exquisite is this motivo!"" Each hummed a melody. The melody was invariably the same. It was that of Arne. Poor Monsieur Halevy must have winced under it, even in the midst of his glory. Moreover, there was a drawback in the decrescendo nature of the composition. Each of the three main acts of the opera (the tempest at sea having formed a prologue) was less effective (even though good in itself) than the preceding one. Nevertheless, the opera was received with a species of wild enthusiasm. Artists, composer, author, conductor, and finally the manager, were one and all called and recalled to receive the overwhelming plaudits of the crowded house.  The singing of all employed on the occasion was ""first-rate."" Madame Sontag won herself fresh laurels, and made the part of Miranda one of the very best. But, in the midst of all that was excellent, Lablache stood out in popular estimation as the striking impersonation of the character of Caliban. It was the last, as it was the best ""creation "" of this rare artist. The music as well as the acting taxed to the utmost the powers of one already on the wane. But he rose superior to every difficulty. His Caliban was not only adjudged to be the finest delineation of the character known, even amidst the many great actors who had figured in this extraordinary part upon the English stage, but was hailed as one of the ""finest creations"" ever seen!

His ""dull earthiness"" and ""brute ferocity,"" his expression of animal love for Miranda, his savage exultation under the influence of wine, and his grovelling, but still revengeful despair, combined to form a masterpiece, and raised Lablache — if anything could raise him — to a loftier pinnacle of fame than before.

One was the first production in London of Wagner's “Lohengrin”; the other, the first appearance there of the Carl Rosa Opera Company. The former was regarded almost in the light of an experiment. Never before had an opera by Wagner been performed at Covent Garden. In 1870 his “Fliegende Hollander” had been given at Drury Lane, under the Italian title of “L’Ollandese Dannato"" (Luigi Arditi conducting), but without any very marked success. And now here was “Lohengrin”, a more advanced example of the composer's method, about to claim the suffrages of a public still notoriously unprepared for the comprehension or enjoyment of what was generally described as the “music of the future”. Yet, thanks to the growing numbers of the German community, the event aroused intense excitement, and the opera-house was packed to overflowing. I think it was the worst performance of “Lohengrin” ever seen in an important theatre. Albani (then in her third season) made a sympathetic Elsa; Nicolini presented a heroic-looking Lohengrin and sang wonderfully well, considering how completely out of his element he was in Wagnerian opera; and Cotogni did creditably as Telramund. But the remainder of the cast were beneath notice, while the chorus sang dreadfully out of tune, and the orchestra, under Vianesi, did its best to drown the singers throughout. Yet, in spite of these drawbacks, the beauty of the music exercised its inevitably powerful sway, and the opera was received with a warmth that grew and grew till it culminated in a tremendous climax of enthusiasm. The “tooth-and-nail” opponents of Wagner, who flourished exceedingly in London at this time, were simply dumfounded. In all probability, “Lohengrin” was as new to them as it was to Covent Garden habitues, and they did not know whether to be more astonished at the subtle fascination of the music or at the ease with which its charm and significance had been grasped by an “unripe” public. In vain did James Davison print Cassandra-like utterances in the “Times”; equally in vain did my dear and valued friend Joseph Bennett limit himself to lukewarm admiration in the columns of the “Telegraph.""

sidering how completely out of his element he was

Telramund. But the remainder of the cast were 
beneath notice, while the chorus sang dreadfully 
out of tune, and the orchestra, under Vianesi, did 
its best to drown the singers throughout. 

Yet, in spite of these drawbacks, the beauty of 
the music exercised its inevitably powerful sway, 
and the opera was received with a warmth that 
grew and grew till it culminated in a tremendous 
climax of enthusiasm. The ' ^ tooth-and-naiP ' op- 
ponents of Wagner, who flourished exceedingly in 
London at this time, were simply dumf ounded. In

not know whether to be more astonished at the

The church is a large one, and the stone walls and uncushioned seats are very cold, yet is there no fire found there, save the burning candles on the altar, which, though they shed some light around, afford no warmth. It is not a Papal, but a Protestant church; the Lutherans use the crucifix, candles, &amp;c., though less than the Romanists. There are two galleries, one rising high above the other, each capable of containing, perhaps, five hundred people; so that the church may accommodate, say three thousand, on its three floors. The organ is large, with three rows of keys, pedals, and fifty-four registers. The exercises commenced punctually at the hour, by a short prelude, played in fine organ style, but not more than about two minutes long. This was followed by a choir piece, sung without any accompaniment, by a choir of men and boys, and without much effect. The choir had not power sufficient for so large a building. An interlude of a few minutes upon the organ followed, when a chorale was sung by the congregation, accompanied with full organ. The congregation was not yet large, but the people were constantly coming in, and it was fast increasing. Still the effect of the general singing was quite animating. This being concluded, the minister began his part of the service, by chanting a short sentence, which was immediately responded to by the choir; and again the minister, and again the response. By this time the church was well filled. From an estimate that I made, I concluded that there could not be less than about twenty-five hundred people present. The organ loft, too, capable of accommodating, perhaps, a hundred, was completely filled with vocal and instrumental performers, including the common orchestral instruments, with trumpets and drums conspicuous. When the slow solemn chant was ended, the organ burst out in a loud minor voluntary, which continued three or four minutes, during which time the violins, violoncellos, double basses, and wind instruments tuned. Yet so carefully was this done, that it was hardly perceptible, for the organ was giving out its full progressive chords, so as to nullify the tuning process, at least upon the ears of the people. Tune being secured, the choir, with organ and orchestra accompaniment, sung a motette, or hymn by Beethoven. This had been announced in the newspapers of Saturday, and was, I suppose, with many an object of attention. It occupied, perhaps, fifteen minutes, and was very well done; the drums and trumpets especially doing fine execution in the great church in the forte passages. It closed with a short fugue, in which the points were distinctly taken up and marked. The choir did not number more than from thirty to forty persons, and had not sufficient power for the building; but still the performance was quite effective. I perceived that while most of the people gave close attention to the music, others were not so much interested, and one goodly-looking old man directly in front of me spent the time in reading over his psalm-book. As soon as the motette was concluded, the members of the orchestra took up their instruments and left the house, having nothing to do with the remaining service. And now came the grand singing — for the great congregation were now together. The organ gave out a choral, when all the people lifted up the loud chorus of praise. The whole house was filled with sound. It was sublime, and I found myself much more moved by this than by the previous choir and orchestra performance. The hymn (486) was indicated on tablets in different parts of the house, and every person had his book in his hand. Even the standers-up in the aisles (for there were hundreds of these) had their books and joined in the song. The singing was in unison; I could not tell, being at the opposite side of the house, whether the choir sang the parts or not; the organ did indeed pour forth full harmony, but even this was vastly overpowered by the multitude of voices — men’s voices, and women’s voices, and children’s voices, mingled in one mighty torrent of sound, rolling through the high arches like the rush of many waters. At the end of each line of the stanza there was an interlude of a few chords upon the organ, but there was no long interlude at the end of the stanza, as in the American churches. Indeed the hymn seemed to flow along from beginning to end, as a whole, and without interruption. I observed, too, that in the hymn-singing I heard in England, the interludes between the stanzas were very short, and often omitted altogether. A very pleasing effect was produced at the close of this and every choral hymn, thus: as soon as the voices ceased on the last word of the last stanza, every head was inclined forward as in the attitude of prayer, while the organ died away piano, in a very short post-lude of perhaps half or three-quarters of a minute, the people retaining their position until the last sound was heard, when they gently resumed an erect posture. After this followed liturgical prayers, read by the clergyman, for a few minutes; and then the chorale was resumed, another stanza or two of the same hymn being sung to the same chorale as before. After this followed the sermon. I did not understand it, but if one might judge by the appearance of the people, it was good, for they all seemed to give close attention for at least three-quarters of an hour. When the sermon was ended, and a short prayer offered, “Vater unser,” the hymn was resumed again, and still another stanza sung to the same tune as before; so that the same tune was sung three times in the same service. A closing prayer of a few words, and the great congregation gradually dispersed, amid the loud rolling of the diapasons.","it

The subject of the fugue was, perhaps, a little too chromatic for the dignity of worship, but it was played slowly and with great precision and certainty. At the close of the voluntary, the minister, followed by the session, entered; the former took his place in the pulpit; the latter took their places in seats appropriated to them, on each side, facing the congregation. The organ then gave out the tune Iosco — the melody was made very prominent, the bass was played by the pedals, and an intermediate figured accompaniment filled up the harmony, producing a fine effect. The hymn, the subject of which was prayer to Jesus for his spirit, was finely sung by the whole assembly, all singing the melody. At the end of the first line of the last stanza, which was doxological, the minister rose in the pulpit, not to find his place in the Bible as if he was in a hurry to cut off the last act of praise, but apparently as an act of reverence, as he kept standing, without any movement, and was soon followed in his example by all the male part of his congregation.

After several songs had been sung, Storace, who was present, asked me to give them the Canzonetta. Now thereby hung a tale, new to the company ! The truth was this: There was an old miser of the name of Varesi, living at Vienna, who absolutely denied himself the common necessaries of life, and who made up his meals by pilfering fruits and sweetmeats from the parties to which he was invited ; the canzonetta for which Storace asked, he was particularly fond of singing with a tremulous voice, accompanied by extraordinary gestures, and a shake of the head ; it was, in fact, this imitation which I was called upon to exhibit, and I did so. During my performance, I perceived Casti particularly attentive, and when I had finished, he turned to Paesiello, and said, "" This is the very fellow to act the character of Gafferio, in our opera ; this boy shall be our old man ! and if he keep old Varesi in his eye when he acts it, I will answer for his success."" The opera was brought out, the drama was excellent, and the music was acknowledged the chef-d'oeuvre of Paesiello. Overflowing houses, for three successive seasons, bore testimony to its merits. I played the old man ; and although really little more than a boy, never lost sight of the character I was personating for a moment.

The conductor was Robert Schumann himself; the pianist was his wife. The orchestra was large, and the best that Leipzig could furnish. Robert Schumann has great celebrity, and especially in those cities where he has resided and has brought out his music under his own immediate direction. No one since Mendelssohn’s death stands so high in the estimation of the German musicians. There are places where he is not known, because his music is not understood; but even in these, and throughout Germany, he is regarded as standing at the very head of his profession, and no one commands aa. he does the universal attention of scientific men. Some go so far as to regard him as the greatest symphonist that has ever lived; but time can only determine this. The concert had been advertised for some time, and the expectations of the lovers of music were fully awake. Not only were the musicians and lovers of music of Leipzig present, but literary and scientific men of the various professions, and the beauty, and wealth, and fashion of the city came to do homage to talent of so high an order, and to learning so extensive. Like the people at Lystra, so here, they lifted up their voices, saying, not in the speech of Lycaonia, but in that of Saxony ""The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.”&nbsp; [...] But it was not only from this city that the audience was gathered on this occasion; it had been noised abroad that this concert was to be given, and musical men of high standing, Kapellmeisters and Concertmeisters, from the region round about, came up to Leipzig. Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, and other places were represented. At the head of this foreign company, and indeed at the head of the whole company, was Lis[zt];— the very Lis[zt] himself came from Weimar to listen, and to pay honor to greatness. But Robert Schumann is not alone, he has a “help meet” indeed. Clara Wieck was perhaps the most distinguished female pianist who has ever lived; and, unlike many ladies, she did not give up her instrument when she became Clara Schumann, but rather devoted herself with greater assiduousness under her new instructor, than she had previously done under the teachings of her father, to the profession which had been the choice of both her husband and herself. No wonder that the people should assemble on the occasion of a visit from this far-famed couple. But they came not to hear any one sing or play on an instrument, for although the wife is indeed a most accomplished pianist, yet the husband neither plays nor sings; but they rather came to hear the new music that the master had produced. They looked for some new musical revelation, for new chords (if possible), or new progressions; at least some new method of treatment, or harmonic development was expected. It was not to be the same tune over again. They went away satisfied; for, not only was the musical performance pronounced to be one of the very best, but the music, or the principal piece of attraction, was regarded as worthy of its author. The first piece was the “Overture zu L. Byron's Manfred&nbsp;von R. Schumann,"" This is an overture in the true learned German style, and as unlike the overtures of the modem Italian and French schools as can be imagined; of course, it cannot be popular, that is, it cannot take with the people generally; on this occasion, however, it was fully appreciated and listened to, by one of the most intelligent musical audiences that could be brought together in Germany, with unmingled delight. The second piece was “Concert No. 2, F moll, fur Piano Forte mit Begleitung des or Chester, von F. Chopin,” performed by Clara Schumann. This is said to be in Chopin’s peculiar style, and one of his most difficult productions. Mad. Schumann played it with apparent ease, and with a delicacy of touch and distinctness of articulation not to be excelled. She has not so great a power as some; in this respect she resembles Chopin himself, but in everything else requisite to the perfection of piano forte playing she is fully accomplished. The third piece was a song by Herr Behr, necessary for variety’s sake; after which Mad. Schumann played most charmingly two pieces- “Andantino von W. Sterndale Bennett"" and ""Lied ohne Worte (F major), von F. Mendelssohn Bartholdy.” The second part of the concert (and here was the attraction) consisted of “Die Pilgerfahrt der Rose” (the pilgrimage of the rose), a new composition for voices (solo and chorus) and orchestra by Robert Schumann. This has been performed here a week or two before, and was noticed in a previous communication. Anything like an analytical notice of it from one who has heard it but once or twice would hardly be expected, and in the present case it would be quite absurd. It will be known in a few years. The orchestra never played better; the idea of playing under Schumann inspired every man with new life and energy, and the improvement in the performance of the music under the direction of the composer (there having been a previous rehearsal also under his teaching), was said to be very apparent. We can hardly imagine a musical occasion that would be more interesting or exciting especially to the truly enlightened musician than this.

Well do I remember the sharp round of applause with which the band greeted the Viennese conductor as he mounted the rostrum.

He rapped again, implying that the players had not been ready to begin; then he said, “We will try again.” He gave the signal—and out piped the two flutes. That caused a little titter of surprise, and we all looked quizzically at each other. Mr. Webb, however, dutifully gave the signal for the next “ hold ” or chord, when two clarinets joined the two flutes! More surprise. At the third hold (chord) the fagotti and horns were added, and at the fourth hold (chord) the entire wood and wind instruments, all sounding most distressingly out of tune. This dissonant and unlooked-for result was followed by a dead pause; then every one of the players broke out with a hearty laugh of derision.

I then heard her sing on two occasions. The first time was in the “Messe Solennelle"" of her beloved teacher and friend, Rossini, which the master had rescored for full orchestra some four years previous,—in fact, only a few months before he died. Thirteen years had elapsed since Alboni was last heard in London, and some time since she had retired from the stage altogether. Even then she was only in her forty-ninth year, and, despite her unusual stoutness, her tones retained well-nigh all their pristine charm of quality and organ-like richness of volume.

Anticipating this, our company, consisting of three persons, went a little before the time appointed for the opening of the door; but yet we found a crowd gathered; the room filled immediately as the door was opened, but we succeeded in obtaining good seats. We had now to wait a full hour before the music commenced, but in the midst of such a multitude of good-looking and well-dressed ladies and gentlemen, all in conversation in loud and merry voices, it soon passed away. Half an hour before the commencement, the oboe was heard, running the scales, &amp;c.; this was soon followed by faggotti, corni, clarionetti, and strings; every man tuning and getting his instrument and his fingers in readiness. Mendelssohn seemed to look down from his bust immediately opposite the orchestra with approbation. At half-past six precisely, Kapelmeister Rietz takes his stand — the signal is given — every one is silent and attentive, and Beethoven’s overture (op. 124) fills the whole company with delight. This is a very pleasing overture; it is less learned, but of a more popular character than most of Beethoven’s. It is often marked with a rhythm like the music of the march or dance; and the flourishes of the brass instruments and drums almost lead one to suppose that he is listening to a military band. But still the hand of the master is seen, and although Beethoven comes down and freely holds conversation with the people, yet he always preserves his dignity, and never dishonors his profession in this pleasing composition.

The fourth movement especially seems to partake in the highest degree of this character, and stirs up the deep feelings to awe and reverence. But vain is any attempt at description, especially by one who has heard it but at a single performance. It was played with great energy; every member of the orchestra had enough to do.

Mr. Mapleson had seen it at the Brussels Monnaie during the preceding winter, and it was on the strength of the success won there, alike by the work and by the exponent of the title-role, that he had determined to transfer both to the boards of Her Majesty's.

Her Carmen was already famous. It was considered as good dramatically as that of Mme. Galli-Marie, and in a vocal sense far superior.

The only question was how to obtain an orchestra. After some reflection, Wagner determined to procure the services of the celebrated Meiningen performers, but of course without their conductor, then no other than Dr. Hans von Biilow, Frau Cosima Wagner’s first husband. The project was kept a profound secret, and young Anton Seidl was forthwith despatched to Meiningen to arrange matters with the band. He arrived there early in the morning, and went direct to the hotel at which von Bulow was staying. The worthy doctor was practising, and, being unacquainted with Seidl, sent out word that he could not see him until eleven o'clock. Accordingly, at that hour he presented himself at the great pianist's apartment and was duly ushered into his presence.

When all was ready, Wagner gave the signal, and his much-honored wife awoke from her slumbers to hear for the first time the mystic phrases of the prelude to “Parsifal”.","

Early in December, 1878, Wagner made up his 
mind that his wife should be serenaded on her 
birthday at Christmas with the strains of the '^ Vor- 
spiel"" to ^'Parsifal,"" of which work he had then 
completed the first act. The only question was 
how to obtain an orchestra. After some reflec-

tion, Wagner determined to procure the services 
of the celebrated Meiningen performers, but of 
course without their conductor, then no other than 
Dr. Hans von Biilow, Frau Cosima Wagner ^s first 
husband. The project was kept a profound secret, 
and young Anton Seidl was forthwith despatched 
to Meiningen to arrange matters with the band. He 
arrived there early in the morning, and went direct 
to the hotel at which von Biilow was staying. The 
worthy doctor was practising, and, being unac- 
quainted with Seidl, sent out word that he could 
not see him until eleven o'clock. Accordingly, at 
that hour he presented himself at the great pian- 
ist's apartment and was duly ushered into his pres- 
ence. At the first mention of Wagner's name von 
Biilow drew himself up and inquired in an icy tone 
what it was that Herr Wagner wanted. Seidl 
explained the object of his mission. 

*^Well,"" replied the doctor, ^'you must permit 
me to inform you that I do not occupy myself at 
all with the engagements of my orchestra. If Herr 
Wagner requires their services, his ambassador 
must be good enough to address himself to my

In both she was eminently successful, and her performance both surprized and delighted me.

This little history will account for the possibility of assembling, on occasions like the Gilmore Peace Jubilees, a chorus numbering five to ten thousand singers who were at home in oratorio music.

<em>cantante di piazza</em>, and as such, having attracted notice by her fine voice, she had been taken from her humble calling, taught, and brought out as a singer in concerts, first at Paris, and then in England, as before mentioned, at the Pantheon, under the name of Giorgi. But though she had the best masters, she was an idle scholar, and never would apply to the drudgery of her profession: but in her, genius supplied the place of science, and the most correct ear, with the most exquisite taste, enabled her to sing with more effect, more expression, and more apparent knowledge of her art, than many much better professors. She never was a good musician, nor could sing at sight with ease; but having once learnt a song, and made herself mistress of its character, she threw into all she sung more pathos and true feeling than any of her competitors. Her natural powers were of the finest description: her voice, sweet and beautiful throughout, had not a fault in any part of its unusually extensive compass. Its lower notes, which reached below ordinary sopranos, were rich and mellow; the middle, full and powerful; and the very high, totally devoid of shrillness: the whole was even and regular, one of those rich 
<em>voci di petto</em>, which can alone completely please and satisfy the ear. In her youth it extended to the highest pitch, and was capable of such agility, that she practised and excelled most in the bravura style, in which she had no superior; but losing a few of her upper notes, and acquiring a taste for the cantabile, she gave herself up almost entirely to the latter, in which she had no equal.
