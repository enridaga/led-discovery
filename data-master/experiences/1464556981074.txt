<p>The rehearsal began with the&nbsp;<em>Scythian Suite&nbsp;</em>(but they had already had two rehearsals before my arrival). Then Schmuller in the Violin Concerto. Finally we read through No. 3 [Piano Concerto] with me as soloist, an excellent first reading. Monteux is very conscientious, precisely carries out everything I tell him and has an attentive ear for all mistakes. Schmuller is also very meticulous, takes slow tempi and plays every note.</p>
