Bit of scoring before going to RCM. to see Herbert Howells - show him Psalm 130 - he is very encouraging & nice. Meet a pupil of his - Lord (Howard de ?) Walton. Go to Orchestral (in part vocal) rehearsal of Benjamin's opera - Devil Take her, in opera theatre. It's very amusing, & in places quite beautiful.
