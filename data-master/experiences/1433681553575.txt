<p>There are some trumpet players who died that you never hear about. Now Chris Kelly was a master and played more blues than Louis Armstrong, Bunk [Johnson], and anybody you ever knew.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p>New Orleans, through the years, had some thirty-odd halls [... each] had a different class distinction based on color, family standing, money, and religion. The most exclusive was the Jean Ami, which very few Jazzmen ever entered--down to the Animal Hall, where every washboard band was welcome if they could play the blues.</p>
<p>So, Chris Kelly, who was dark of color, low on finance, Baptist from birth, and cultured in the canebrakes, never gave a thought to ever blowing his blues in the Jean Ami Hall and a dozen other amusement places.</p>
<p>Chris could play slow, lowdown gut-struts until all the dancers were exhausted and dripping wet. His masterpiece was <em>Careless Love</em>, preached slow and softly with a plunger. He always played it at twelve o'clock, just before intermission. He'd blow a few bars before knocking off, and his fans would rush about, seeking their loves because that dance meant close embracing, cheek-to-cheek whisperings of love, kissing, and belly-rubbing.</p>
