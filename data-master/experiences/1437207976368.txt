<p>Beth &amp; I go to B.B.C. at 9.0 for a perf. of Kodaly's Spinning Wheel.* Mostly folk song. There is some very attractive stuff - beautifully done. choral writing excellent. Some of it was rather dull, banished from the stage. Performance, conducted by K. was rather perfunctory tho' chorus, Roy Henderson, &amp; Enid Cruickshank. v. good.&nbsp;</p>
