<p>From infancy I was surrounded by music. You might say music was for me an ocean in which I swan like a little fish. Music was inside me and all about me; it was the air I breathed from the time I could walk. To hear my father play the piano was an ecstasy for me. When I was two or three, I would sit on the floor beside him as he played, and I would press my head against the piano in order to absorb the sound more completely.</p>
