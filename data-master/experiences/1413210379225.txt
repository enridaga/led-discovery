St. Georgeâ€™s Chapel is a noble structure; has a fine organ, and a choir that does duty every day, performing the entire cathedral service; and, what is curious, at the end of every psalm a couplet is chanted praying for the knights of the garter. Surely this must be a relic of Popish purgatory. I was complimented by being requested to choose.the service; and, in honour of the great composer who once presided here, I fixed upon that of Orlando Gibbons.
