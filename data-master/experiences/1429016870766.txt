At the station I got into the midst of a regiment of ' Landwehr ' (militia), returning to 
their homes from the late war, and such a row I never heard before ; such singing, such shouting I believe I am half deaf still. They seemed to have been at the station, which was cram full, for a long time already, as they were in full song, and there, and afterwards in their carriages till Diisseldorf, where I left them, they repeated incessantly the following spirited and patriotic lines, singing them well, too, and with proper emphasis: 
Die Landwehr hat Huh, 
Die Landwehr hat Ruh; 
Und wenn die Landwehr Ruhe hat, 
So hat die Landwehr Ruh! 

I append a literal translation for those that might miss 
the point otherwise),: 

The Landwehr has rest, 
The Landwehr has rest; 
And when the Landwehr has rest, 
Then has the Landwehr rest! 

Undeniable, and logic and patriotic sentiments equally sound. Who can wonder now that the Austrians have been beaten by a people capable of such efforts in poetry ? It took a long time to get those noisy warriors into their carriages.
