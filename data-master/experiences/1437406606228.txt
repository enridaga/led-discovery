<pre>After spending a delightful summer, which was productive both of pleasure and <br />profit, I returned to London about the end of September 1807. On the 3rd May, <br />1808, Mr. Cumberland produced, at Drury Lane Theatre, a piece entitled "The <br />Jew of Mogadore," to which I composed the music: It was with great reluctance <br />that the Board of Management at Drury Lane accepted it : therefore, when I had <br />finished the music of the first act, I rested upon my oars until I knew their <br />final determination. I met Mr. Sheridan one day in Essex Street in the Strand, <br />and told him of it. He desired me to go on with it by all means ; "For," said <br />he, "if the opera should fail, you will fall with a fine classical scholar, <br />and elegant writer, as well as a sound dramatist," (such was his expressed <br />opinion of Cumberland's abilities.) "Go, instantly," continued he, "to those <br />discerning critics, who call themselves the Board of Management, and tell 
them, from me, if you please, that they are all asses, to presume to sit in <br />judgment on the writings of such a man as Cumberland ; and say, further, that <br /><em>I order</em> the opera to be accepted, and put into rehearsal." "And pray, Sir," <br />said I, "in what light am I to view this ' Board of Management?' What are 
they?" "Pegs to hang hats upon," said Sheridan. I went to the pegs, <br />communicated Mr. Sheridan's command, and the opera was performed accordingly- <br />Braham sang in it charmingly. </pre>
