<p>The concert was at three o'clock. When Ptashka had been with Getty, Getty in reference to her 'nerves' had told her, 'Sing as if you were singing for God.' I thought of this today. It is good advice. I played well and was not nervous. The old man accompanied reasonably accurately, and the orchestra was better than at the rehearsal, although not as good as the Paris orchestra. The hall was not full, but the Prince of Monaco was in the royal box.</p>
