Yesterday afternoon I was a long time alone with Mendelssohn, who played me some numbers which had been intended for 'St. Paul,' but which were never performed or printed. They are admirable, only treated in a more dramatic way, and therefore perhaps more adapted for isolated pieces in the concert-room than to be heard in connection with the oratorio itself. He played me also some charming MS. 'Lieder ohne Worte.'
