<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%;">Kryzhanovsky was very interested in folk music. Every time I visited him he used to bring out a pile of music &ndash; his collection of folk melodies &ndash; and play or sing me examples. All this must certainly have helped to establish my own interest in folk music. It was then, too, that I heard the great Russian singers Fyodor Shalyapin and Ivan Yershov. And all this was part of the Conservatoire &lsquo;milieu&rsquo;.</p>
