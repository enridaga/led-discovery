...today I must write, because last night I heard the test pressing of the 2nd Hurricane recording which will be out in time for your birthday.  It’s badly engineered in places, especially when there is choral complexity (the voices are too distant and unclear, the orch. is too present) – but in general I think you’ll be delighted.  Of course, it’s similar to the TV version, with me narrating, preserving a line or two of dialogue here & there, & cutting Fat’s Song plus 2 other small cuts.  But mainly I’m writing because I’m so impressed all over again with the music.  It is lovely & endlessly fresh; neither the simplicity or the grandeur stales.
