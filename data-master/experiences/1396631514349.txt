On the way home we met a battalion coming in from the trenches for a rest - a ragged, sandy-looking crew, but very happy, singing and cheering as they marched along to the music of a drum and fife band.... They were cheering for anything and nothing - they cheered when they passed us - and the little band, away at the head of the line could hardly be heard from the noise they made.
