I passed a most pleasant & comfortable week at Skreens, in every respect, except our Music, which was miserable for want of better fiddlers than Mr. Bramston, Mr. Leake, & Mr. Morgan. Miss Bramston, however, made some amends. She is (I think) not 16, & has learned but a year or two; yet she plays admirably for the time, and, if she persists, will be capital.
