<p>Beethoven's "Spring" Sonata on WNYC this morning. I never fail to be surprised at how unsurprised I am at how little surprise figures in even Beethoven's most proven chestnuts (those endless root position tonics &amp; dominants). Just as I'm always surprised at my own lack of surprise in America's Puritanism.&nbsp;</p>
