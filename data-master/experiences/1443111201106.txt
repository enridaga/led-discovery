<p>In the afternoon to the last Music Society concert: Gioconda di Vito, a solid, grave, embattled woman, with a superb large bullneck - pleasure to see her sternly settling the pas on her shoulder, a privy smile vouchsafed when she had got it right.&nbsp; She played that dull Leclair sonata then Brahms in A. I could have yelled for joy as she swept along the first entry of the theme.&nbsp; Then La Folia: the cadenza most enthralling, for she managed to make it sound extemporised, &amp; it flagged, &amp; then rose with whirls of wings to the close.&nbsp; By now she was looking rather pleased with herself.&nbsp; Then the Kreutzer Sonata - in which Ernest Lush played with great brio, &amp; Beethoven substantiality.</p>
