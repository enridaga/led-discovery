     Being pinned or “engaged to become engaged” to a sorority girl was serious business. The entire fraternity would get together and rehearse a few Cole Porter songs sung in modern four part harmony. We would then serenade the girls outside their dorm windows or sorority houses, standing on encrusted snow in below zero weather singing A cappella. It was the most awesome thing the fraternity did. The choir and boys’ voices were fabulous and I felt like Bing Crosby in a college movie. There’s no doubt in my mind the girls remembered that special occasion the rest of their lives.
