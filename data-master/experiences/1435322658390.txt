Tickets from B.B.C. I take Mrs Bridge to Symphony Concert at Q.H. at 8.15. H. Wood conducting. Egmont ov. (a la Valse), Haydn Symp. Horn Call & D. with some first-rate horn playing. Busch plays E maj. Bach Vln concerto badly for a first-rate fiddler. 3 Excerpts from Berg's Wozzeck - thoroughly sincere & moving music. God & Verkl√§rung seemed dull & banal after this.* Orchestral playing throughout evening technically good but dull & uninspired as usual. Back via Bridges
