In the mean time several hymns are performed on board the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;"><em>bucentoro</em>,</span> by the band of music belonging to St. Mark's church, and several prayers appointed for the occasion are read or sung, till the <em><span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic;">doge</span></em> has passed the two forts of Lido and St. Erasmo. </span></p>
