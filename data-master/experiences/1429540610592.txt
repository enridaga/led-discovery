Weber conducted the never-failing overtures to ' Oberon' and ' Euryanthe'; his still unknown cantata 'The Festival of Peace', and a new ballad, written for and sung by Miss Stephens; Braham gave the air from ' Freyschütz' very finely; Furstenau, the flute-player, was heard for the first time, in some variation from ' Oberon ; ' Kiesewetter played his inevitable Mayseder Variations in E major, and Moscheles took his subject for improvisation from the Cantata 'Festival of Peace,' interwoven with 'motives' from the 'Freyschütz' Madame Caradori and Braham were the soloists in the cantata. To think of such music in an empty room.
