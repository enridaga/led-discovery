<p class="MsoNormal">Mr. Eichberg came to this country in 1847, and was in New York for two years. In 1849 he removed to Boston, and was appointed director of music in the Boston Museum. While in that position he composed and produced several operettas of charming quality, notably the <em>Doctor of Alcantara,</em> though as a composer he was academic. In that vein he wrote a good quintette for strings, which was played by our Club ; also a concerto for four violins, which was performed at a benefit concert for the Musical Union.</p>
