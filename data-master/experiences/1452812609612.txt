<p>I met Vsevolod Meyerhold, who was staging Mayakovsky's&nbsp;<em>The Bed-Bug</em>, and wrote music for the play. Meyerhold was an outstanding musical producer. His production of&nbsp;<em>The Queen of Spade</em> was, in my opinion, a stupendous operatic achievement, and I should like to see this production revived. I have vivid memories of Meyerhold's production of Lermontov's&nbsp;<em>The Masked Ball</em> with music by Glazunov.&nbsp;</p>
