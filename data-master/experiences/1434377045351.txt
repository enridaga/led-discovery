The concluding advice received was that Bunsen should try the effect of days,
or weeks, at Baden-Weiler, to which beautiful spot he proceeded, the fourth day after reaching Basle: he had been there once before, and was willing to
anticipate a renewal of the refreshment then experienced. The sunshine, the spring-temperature, the rich vegetation, the abundance of blossom,â€”all these
circumstances combined to grace Bunsen's return to his native country ; and he hailed with delight the many pleasing characteristics of a German and Protestant village; more especially the part-singing of a numerous assembly of youths, under a tree after night fall, guided by the schoolmaster of the place, who was discovered on enquiry to be one of those persons of education, far above his condition in life, often found in Germany, who are not vulgarised by the struggle with each day's necessities. He had been in the habit of bestowing part of the scanty leisure left by his laborious calling, in keeping up the power of song and its humanising influences in his former pupils, who were past
the age of school, by selecting good music, and helping them to perform it. Bunsen enjoyed the performance, and yet more did he delight in its origin. One song more especially gave him particular pleasure. It was one which contained the often -repeated lines : ' Wo ist mein Haus ? Im Himmel ist mein Eaus !' ( ' Where is my home? In heaven is my home ! ' )
