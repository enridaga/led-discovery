<p>After I got into Kansas City, I remember walking into the Sunset, and there was Pete Johnson and a drummer named Merrill and an alto player named Walter Knight. This was about 1933. I have never heard anybody play a sax like he did in my life. I can hear a little of it in Charlie Parker today. They only had three pieces in that group. But since that club had sessions so late and the other clubs closed early, they would soon have an augmented bandstand. There were jam sessions that I used to watch there in Kansas City, even before I got with the Basie band, that were unlike any other jam sessions I have heard since. It has to do with head arrangements in the Basie band and how we didn't have to rehearse back in Kansas City. It was just there and we played it.</p>
