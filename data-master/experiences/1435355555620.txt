<p>On the 17th of February, the Italian Opera company removed to the Pantheon in Oxford Street, which was converted into a theatre. I went the first night: the house was very small, and the stage particularly so; but the company was extremely good. For the serious opera, the celebrated Pachierotti, who is just dead, was engaged as first soprano ; the tenor, Lazzerini ; the prima donna, Madame Mara. " L' Ararida," was the serious opera. For the comic opera, they had Signors Cipriani, Morelli, Leperini, and Signora Cassentini, who afterwards married Signor Bergi, then stage manager for the Committee, which consisted of the Duke of Bedford, Lord Salisbury, and Mr. William Sheldon.</p>
