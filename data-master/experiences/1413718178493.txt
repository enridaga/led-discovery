I copy out my 3 fugues in morning, & pratice. Practice with Lauricella in aft. Go to Covent Garden with Miss Alford to see Ida Rubenstein’s ballet. Psyche & Cupid – (Bach-Honegger) David (Sauguet) – Ravel’s Mère L’oye (orch. only – v. bad) & Bolero. Don’t think much of Rub. but scenery & corps de ballet – Wonderful. Bach v. beautiful (quite brilliantly arranged by Honegger) tho’ long. David, dramaticque but music poor. Bolero taken very slowly; interesting but not exhilerating.
