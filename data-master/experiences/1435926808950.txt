<p>In the Exhibition year of 1851 performances were given almost every evening at Her Majesty's, while in previous seasons only three performances a week used to be announced, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. One of the new operas performed was Auber's <em>Enfant Prodigue</em>, in which the Parisian prima donna, Madame Ugalde, sang most charmingly, and M. Massol, the French baritone, also took a leading part. The scenery and dresses were magnificent, and, in fact, the opera was sumptuously mounted. I played the little bells in the orchestra, to imitate the bells of the camels in the Desert Scene.</p>
