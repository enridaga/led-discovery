<p>Mum comes down with me to station when I catch 8.30 back to town. Taxi at once to B.B.C. where I hear end of rehearsal of wireless singers (8 + 2 for boys pt.) doing my Boy. That from 12-12.45; &amp; again aft. lunch back here 2.30-3.30, then a run through for the B.B.C. music staff to hear. I am relieved to say that it all comes off splendidly. They sang it excellently considering they were sight-reading it from M.S. parts (copied at 5.30 in morning!). I am very pleased &amp; bucked.</p>
