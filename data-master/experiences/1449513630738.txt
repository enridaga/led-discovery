<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I attended the very first NFJO jazz concert in July 1951.I had a seat in a box opposite the two princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret. The concert was a sellout, that was to be expected as everything was brand new and the acoustics superb.I remember the 'Saints' jazz band from Manchester brought the house down with their rendering of 'I want a girl just like the girl that married dear old Dad'. I also remember that Humphrey Lyttelton's band were smartly turned out in neat light blue suits, and that Ken Colyer's were dressed in jeans! It was a wonderful experience and it was very fortunate that the event was recorded by Parlophone, although not all of the concert was released. It would be nice now to have a CD of that day, if the masters are still available.</p>
