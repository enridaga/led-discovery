<p>A new opera, specially composed for Her Majesty's, called <em>La Tempesta</em>, after Shakespeare's <em>Tempest</em>, with music by Halevy and libretto by Scribe, was given for the first time in June 1850, under the direction of these two distinguished Frenchmen. Madame Sontag was the Miranda, Carlotta Grisi the Ariel her part being written only for her dancing and quasi flying about and Lablache the Caliban. The latter impersonated Caliban splendidly, his physique lending itself to the part. Arne's pretty melody, "Where the bee sucks," was interpolated into the music with good effect, and the opera proved a great success.</p>
