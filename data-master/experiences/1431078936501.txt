<p><em>Which improvisers made an impression on you when you were starting out?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Earl Hines. Several local pianists, because this was before there were many records available. Our principle local pianist though, was also influenced by Earl Hines. Jay McShann lived in town too, so that was another influence, and I remember having some lessons from Jay. Then I listened to broadcasts, mainly from the Grand Terrace in Chicago, though there were also some from L.A. There was much more good live jazz on the radio then than there is now. Live musicians were also employed by the radio stations. Remember, there even used to be NBC and CBS symphony orchestras.</p>
