<p>Madame Alboni was the next very fine singer who visited America. Oh, what a glorious contralto voice was hers ! It was of a silk-velvet quality (if I may be allowed to use such a figure of speech), with deeply sympathetic, expressive tones resembling very markedly the lovely reedy tones of a violoncello. Moreover, what technical wonders Alboni could accomplish with that voice! Her colorature in songs like <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Una Voce</em> created the same effect as a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Carnaval de Venise</em> performance on the violin.</p>
