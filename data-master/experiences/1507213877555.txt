<p>The twentieth day of March was taken up at Westminster again with a hundred lights King Edward the Confessor in the same place where his shrine was, and it shall be set up again as fast as my lord abbot can have it done.

And so he was carried and goodly singing and censing as has been seen and Mass sung.</p>
