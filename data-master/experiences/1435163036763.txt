We thus discovered the short but delicious comic opera, 'La Colombe', written for the theatre at Baden-Baden in the reign of Napoleon III, and we found also that little masterpiece, 'Le Médecin Malgré Lui'. Diaghileff also happened to run across 'L’Education Manquée', a charming piece by Chabrier. His great importance is still not fully appreciated by his own compatriots, who persist in treating him with kindly indulgence, seeing in him nothing more than an amusing and lively amateur. It is clear that ears corrupted by emotional and sentimental verbiage, and inoculated with academic doctrine (which, however, is less serious), cannot but remain deaf to the quality of such a real pearl as 'Le Médecin Malgré Lui', which has against it the misfortune of being purely music.
