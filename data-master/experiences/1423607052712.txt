<p>From "Concerts Attended", an 'O' level music exam project by Anita Gabrielle Tedder (aged 15) 17 January 1970: When I was a child growing up, the music of Ray Charles was always playing in our house. My Dad was a dedicated fan, so much so that we all grew up thinking that Ray Charles was our uncle. Every time Ray came to the UK, my Dad would go, with a large crowd of other family members and friends, all devoted fans. When I was 14, it was deemed that the time was right for me to be allowed to attend my first 'grown up' concert. I was so excited, it must have been 1975 I think. It was always an occasion, we all dressed up in our best clothes, in fact I think I was bought a new dress for the occasion, my first 'little black number'! There were about 10 of us in the party, and we had seats in the front stalls, as good as you can get! Ray Charles came on with a huge band, with all the special stands, just like you used to see for big bands. I knew most of the songs, however was completely amazed by the huge sound, and how the musicians all stood up for their separate solos. I think I was so overwhelmed I cried for most of the concert, just the sheer joyfulness of the occasion and seeing a real big band for the first time. It was of course at the Royal Festival Hall, little did I know that 20 years later I would playing saxophone in bands myself, and be working here!</p>
