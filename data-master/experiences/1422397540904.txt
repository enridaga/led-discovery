After our lesson was over yesterday, Ehlert took his leave, and left us to wait for Tausig – my dear! – who was to hear us each play….he turned on me and said imperiously, “Spielen Sie mir Etwas vor. (Play something for me)”. I got up and played first an Etude, and then he asked for scales, and after I had played a few he told me I “had talent”, and to come to his lessons, and I would learn much.
