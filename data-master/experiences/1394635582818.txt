This Paramount [cinema] in London is exactly like the one in Paris: both of them boast of being the most up to date in the world. And then there is Movietone â€“ and I do not understand why they do not speak more about this, since it provides the answer to cinematography with speech. This is the only way films are produced from real life. And the military reviews with their music in motion, the rhythm of the steps, the roar of the cannon, the sound of the commands and the applause of the crowd are rendered quite perfectly.
