<p>We remember a fine compliment paid to Mr. Bach by the celebrated organist, John Schneider, whom we afterwards met in Dresden. When on the way from Mr. Schneider&rsquo;s house to the church where he was about to play, he said, &ldquo;I will play for you some of Bach&rsquo;s fugues.&rdquo; &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; we replied; &ldquo;we are always delighted to hear these charming organ pieces, and had the pleasure a few days since of listening to several of them as performed by W[ilhel]m. Bach, of Berlin.&rdquo; &ldquo;So!" said Schneider; &ldquo;if you have heard Wilhelm Bach play Bach&rsquo;s fugues, I will play something else, for I do not like to play the same music which you have heard by so excellent a performer as he is.&rdquo;</p>
