The service of the mass was very magnificent. First of all the apparelling of Cardinal Wolsey was performed by bishops, who also placed on his feet a pair of very valuable jeweled sandals. The water for his hands was given him by some of the chief noblemen of England.  The French and English singers chaunted, with occasional accompaniments of trombones, cornets, and organs.
