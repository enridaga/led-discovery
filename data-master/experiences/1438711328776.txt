<pre>In the year 1818, I composed the music to a piece called "The Bride of Abydos;" <br />and in 1820, to another called "Abudah;" and my last production was a musical <br />entertainment, called the "Lady and the Devil," for Drury Lane. Between the years <br />1797 and 1821, I produced, at different theatres, sixty-two pieces, by far the <br />greatest number produced by any one English composer, Bishop excepted. Most of <br />them, I have the satisfaction to say, have been received by the public with <br />favour; and I have thought it might not be disagreeable to my friends to see a <br />list of them, for which reason I have subjoined the titles, dates, the names of <br />their authors, and the theatres where they were performed. </pre>
