Whitsunday. By water to Whitehall and there to Chappell in my pew, belonging me as Clerk of the Privy Seale. And there I heard a most excellent sermon of Dr. Hacket[t], Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry - upon these words: "Hee that drinketh this water shall never thirst." We had an excellent Anthemne sung by Capt. Cooke and another, and brave Musique; and then the King Come down and offered, and took the Sacrament upon his Knees - a sight very well worth seeing.
