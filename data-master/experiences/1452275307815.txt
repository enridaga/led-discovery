<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the one opera I heard in Petersburg - Glinka&rsquo;s <em>La Vie pour le Czar</em>. I love the Russian language, which, when sung, sounds to me particularly soft, and full of charm, and it was during that performance that I saw a polonaise danced for the first time. It roused me to absolute enthusiasm. I never saw anything more graceful than the way, at the end of the dance, each man threw himself at the feet of his partner. The music of the opera is charming ; though simple in character, the score contains many delightful folk-songs.</p>
