<p>The contrast between the organ-playing of this morning and that which we heard on the last Sabbath, cannot be expressed in words. It was at a popular chapel attached to a large establishment where poor children are cared for and protected, and which is much visited by strangers coming to London. Here the organ-playing is frivolous, light and trifling, we had almost said, as is Jullien's Quadrille Orchestra in Drury Lane. It is amazing that any one who has musical knowledge should so pervert the powers of his instrument. But yet the&nbsp;organist has fine powers of execution; he plays with a rapidity of finger, with a clean piano-forte touch, producing the staccato with as much distinctness as stringed instruments, and at times&nbsp;almost the pizzicato. So it was on the occasion when we last heard him, when the song, "Why do the nations," from the Messiah, with the chorus, "Let us break their bands," were sung to an organ accompaniment as brilliant almost as that of a grand orchestra.&nbsp;</p>
