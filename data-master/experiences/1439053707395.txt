<p style="text-align: justify;">I made the acquaintance of Minnie Hauk in London during the season just referred to. A year or so later she married a well-known traveler and writer, Baron Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg. It was in 1880 that she joined the Carl Rosa troupe, and appeared at Her Majesty's in "Lohengrin," "Aida," and "Mignon" when these operas were given for the first time in English; also she made an admirable Katharine in Goetz's "Taming of the Shrew." In Wagner's opera she was ably supported by Herr Anton Schott; in "Mignon," by that admirable singer, Joseph Maas, the best English stage tenor since Sims Reeves. In fact, these were all representations of the rarest excellence; and they all threw into a strong light the singular versatility of Minnie Hauk, who could bring out the poetry of Elsa or the deep passion of Aida as completely as she could the diablerie of Carmen or the petulant tempers of Mignon and Katharine.</p>
