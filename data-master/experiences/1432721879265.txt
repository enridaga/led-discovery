My dear Camille: 
I was officially informed yesterday that you are the author of the symphony which they played on Sunday. I suspected it; but now that I am sure, I want to tell you at once how pleased I was with it. You are beyond your years ; always keep on and remember that on Sunday, December 11, 1853, you obligated yourself to become a great master. 
Your pleased and devoted friend, 
CH. GOUNOD.
