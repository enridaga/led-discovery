<p>Miffed by Shirley's remark during intermission at the Boulez concert: "Don't you agree that in the future it will still be Beethoven and Schubert that people listen willingly to, and not all this?" But I too am a composer, and although my musical language is not like "all this" I listen willingly to it, whereas I never listen to Beethoven and Schubert.</p>
