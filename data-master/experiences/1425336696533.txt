My first teacher was Father, who, although a violinist, thought he could teach me. “They are all one big family,” he said. But once, when trying to demonstrate something on the cello and producing a series of squeaks and scratches, he conceded that sometimes relatives are incompatible and he had better find a good cello teacher for me.
