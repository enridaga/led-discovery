Alberto Lysy was sixteen or seventeen when he came from his home in the Argentine to compete in the Brussels concours in 1955. Not as schooled as some of the other contestants, he secured only fifth or sixth place, but played with a communicative passion far and away beyond all the others. Whatever he touched, one felt that here was a boy to whom music meant everything.
