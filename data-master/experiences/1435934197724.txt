<p>[...] I heard that Erroll Garner was opening at a place on Fifty-second Street. I could hardly wait to hear him again[. &hellip; H]e was playing more than ever before, yet seemed to have got on a Tatum kick, playing fast runs and all.</p>
<p>I reminded Erroll of his own original manner of playing which I had admired so much when he was working in Pittsburgh. before very long I was glad to hear him back on his own style.</p>
<p>In those times, Garner made a habit of going over to Inez Cavanaugh's apartment, an inspiring spot for musicians, where Erroll used to play and compose all day. She told me he once sat gazing at a subdued table lamp of hers, then composed something to fit the mood, which he titled, "Lamplight."</p>
