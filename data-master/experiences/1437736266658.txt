A certain gay and intrepid march tune, characteristically called "Garibaldi's Hymn," was shouted, blown, scraped, and rattled on drums in and out of season. The whole spirit of the volunteer movement seemed to be in it. When I first heard it at Genoa, it sounded poor and commonplace; but as day by day and all day long it sounded in my ears, it began at last to ring in my head; and by the time I got to Naples I was humming and whistling it with all the world. To see the jaunty, ragged volunteers marching along the hot roads covered with white marble dust, and keeping pace to "Garibaldi's Hymn," is one of my most vivid memories. It was to Italians of 1860 what the "Marseillaise" was to the French of 1793 but as much purer and more joyous than that fierce and gloomy stave, as the movement for freedom under GARIBALDI and MAZZINI was brighter and purer than the confused and murderous cries for liberty in 1793 under ROBESPIERRE and DANTON.</span></p>
