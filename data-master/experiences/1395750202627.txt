Called on the Lawrences to ask for a subscription for the harmonium. They were very kind and readily gave me 12/6. Then Mrs. Lawrence burst forth with a harangue and her views upon Church Music. 'I like the music in Church. I don't like everything to be so melancholy, melancholy. I had rather hear a good whistle in Church than nothing. I knew two young ladies who whistled beautifully a first and a second. No, they didn't whistle in Church.'
