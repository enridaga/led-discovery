Many German musicians at that time affected rather to look down on the Italian maestro with a sort of condescending superiority, wondering how in the world Ferdinand Hiller, the conductor-in-chief of the Festival and an excellent musician, could have chosen for performance at one of their classical institutions a work by the author of <em>Il Trovatore</em>, <em>Rigoletto</em>, <em>Traviata</em>, and other operas of street-organ popularity. Hiller, however, knew what he was doing. Already at the first rehearsal Verdi's fine musicianship and powerful personality made a great impression upon chorus, orchestra, and soloists, of which latter I had the honour of being one. From hour to hour we felt more and more strongly the fascinating influence of a master - mind, and both the beautiful, deeply felt work and its genial creator at the end of the excellent performance&mdash;Lilli Lehmann was the soprano&mdash;met with a most enthusiastic reception.</span></p>
