Left Leeds at 7.20 and arrived at Greenheys towards 10 o'clock. Piatti and Sainton arrived at 3 o'clock, and we began the rehearsal for tonight's concert at once...The trio in B [Beethoven; trio in B, Op. 97] gave us special pleasure, and made a great impression on the public, as also did the Sonata, which I played with a little hesitation.
