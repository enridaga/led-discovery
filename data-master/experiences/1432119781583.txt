The second section of the tour ended in Montreal, after a couple of concerts had been added; though only a single day's notice of the extension could be given to the local press, the large Windsor Hall was sold out on both occasions. Parry's St. Cecilia's Day was again performed and a repetition of Jubal had been requested, and as my forces were now thoroughly familiar with these cantatas, a more sympathetic rendering could not have been desired.
