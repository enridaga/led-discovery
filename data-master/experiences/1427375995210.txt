There were several rooms, but in the great school-room, into which I was introduced, there were some singing, others playing upon the violin, hautboy, clarionet, horn, trumpet, &amp;c. &amp;c. each different music, and in different keys. The noise was horrible; and in the midst of this terrific Babel, the boy who studied composition was expected to perform his task, and harmonize a melody given him by his master. I left the place in disgust, and swore to myself never to become an inmate of it.</p>
