<p>I'd like to tell you about Miles [Davis]. When I first heard him, he was working in St Louis, which is Miles' home. He used to ask to sit in with the band. I'd let him so as not to hurt his feelings, because then Miles was awful. He sounded terrible; he couldn't play at all. But by the time we got to California, he had blossomed out. He'd been going to Juilliard, in New York, and playing with Bird [Charlie Parker], so he came in and took over the same songbook, the solo book which was originally Dizzy's Miles stayed with me until I broke up, which was in 1947.</p>
