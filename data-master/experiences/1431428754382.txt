<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s concert in the Great Hall [of the Conservatoire] by Peter Pears and Benjamin Britten was a great joy to me. They performed Schumann&rsquo;s 'Dichterliebe', Britten&rsquo;s 'Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo', and his own versions of English and French songs. The whole concert have me the greatest pleasure.</p>
