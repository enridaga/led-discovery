Sir
In October last, by a ship call'd the St nicolas order'd to mr Sowton, I sent you a pair of Lapps-boots, and the history of Lapland in Latin.1 They were put up in a wooden case, in the which there was also another pair of Lapps boots design'd for my Lady wood. From the marchand here who sent away the vessell, I understand that hee hath long since receivd newes of its arrivall at London, which makes me hope you may with it, have receiv'd what I sent..

Formerly upon this subject, I told you, the Devil had declar'd hee had not power to come into this town, but the great want of provisions in the country I am afraid hath forc'd him hither. For the other day under my window there was a great young strapping jade who play'd the possess'd, by howling, kicking, sprauling, and makeing wry faces, whilst three of the plot who were with her, kept her down, and lying upon her brest endeavour'd either to crush the Devil out again, or make his lodging uneasy. By this time a great croud of people were gather'd about her, who immediately began to sing Psalmes, which being a musicke Satan likes not, hee left his prize, which yet seem'd not to be fully herselfe again, till most of the company had given her monyes, to dispossesse her pocket; which had so wonderfull an effect, that shee look'd as merrily as if by that means shee had conquer'd the Enemy of all mankind. But I hear since that time she is sent to the correction house, and then I leave it to you to thinke how well the Devil will like whipping. and:  
I beg the continuance of your former kindnesses and friendship, and remain
Sir
your very much obligd and humble servant
Wm: Allestree.
