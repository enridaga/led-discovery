<p>I call to mind a private rehearsal of the Mozart Sinfonia Concertante with Ysa&yuml;e at Queen&rsquo;s Hall the day before the Beecham concert, at which Ysa&yuml;e arranged all the phrasing he wanted. This went as planned at the orchestral rehearsal the next morning but unaccountably he radically altered a good deal of his phrasing at the performance at night! As some of my readers probably know, the phrases of the Concertante are very similar for the solo instrument &ndash; question and answer so to speak, and I had to copy him on the spur of the moment. Phew!</p>
