At the next performance,&nbsp;his rabid worshippers strove with all their might, by&nbsp;hissing and groaning, to suppress the general public's&nbsp;manifestations of approval, upon which he angrily&nbsp;exclaimed to my father, 'These Wagnerians are the&nbsp;stupidest people in the world ; I should like to break&nbsp;down the theatre doors with their heads. They must be&nbsp;hissing, indeed! It is disgraceful!' And he did not&nbsp;hesitate to tell them so to their faces, later on.&nbsp;</p>
