<p>In the afternoon I tried accompanying Ptashka in 'The Grey Dress', transposing it a tone higher. Musorgsky I could transpose without difficulty, but my own music I could not do at all: the result was a complete mess, and when eventually I got it right it was still not my music at all. A strange phenomenon! The composer grows ever more inextricably intertwined with his tonalities.</p>
