<p>[Gardiner comments on 'four sons of harmony', Bartleman, Harrion, Knyvett and Greatorex.]</p>
<p>[Their] next visit was to Sir Charles Hudson, at Wanlip... Miss Greatorex, then living in Leicester, used to avail herself of such valuable aid at her annual concert. This took place in the assize week, and was fully attended by the county families. As vocalists, they were the most perfect set of English singers that ever joined their voices together. Bartleman, for tone and expression, has never been approached. His enunciation was bold and intrepid, having all the force of elocution, added to the power of song. <em>Hark! my Daridcar, we're call'd below</em>, and the animated strain of <em>Lucinda's Eyes</em>, were fine exhibitions of his rhetorical powers. It may be said the music of Purcel died with him.&nbsp;</p>
