<p>For instance, the equanimity with which these people listened to the singing of a wearisome duet thirty seconds after the close of the &ldquo;Eroica&rdquo; was an altogether new experience for me; everyone assured me that no one was in the least scandalized by it &ndash; and the duet was applauded just like the symphony! This by the way&rdquo; &ndash; I placed all my hopes of satisfaction in my dealings with the orchestra, which is very devoted to me, and in the hope of a fine performance for its own sake. In particular I counted very much on being allowed two rehearsals for the next concert, as I hoped it would give me the opportunity of getting the orchestra really well in hand. But yesterday&rsquo;s first rehearsal dashed that hope as it showed me that two rehearsals are too few for my purpose. I had to pass over many important points and I see that I shall never be able to make up in just one more rehearsal, so I shall have to be satisfied with no more than a relatively good performance of the Ninth Symphony.</p>
