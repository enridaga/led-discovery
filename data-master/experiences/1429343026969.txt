[Everything 'Tricky Sam' Joe Nanton did] was up the top of the horn. Luckily we had Bubber Miley as his plunger mate. Tricky had been using the plunger before, and he had all those sounds, but they were a little too sophisticated to be appreciated by the average listener who would walk into a jam session.

A whole strain of West Indian musicians came up who made contributions to the so-called jazz scene, and they were all virtually descended from the true African scene.
