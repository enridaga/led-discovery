<p>Judy's annual concert Friday opened, at my suggestion, not with one of those moody modal folk things, but with the driving breakneck <em>Hard Losin' Lover</em>. Still, it didn't come off. The scoring was sloppier than on the disc, and Judy cast a coltish spell from the Carnegie stage. She needs a friendlier stance vis-&agrave;-vis her players, a more intimate hall, and a new repertory.</p>
