Tristan and Isolde&nbsp;was set and mounted with the utmost splendour in the&nbsp;spring of 1884; its cast comprised Winkelmann, Scaria&nbsp;and Frau Materna; its "tone-poem" was interpreted by&nbsp;the finest operatic orchestra in the world; but it is a&nbsp;pity that so handsome an amende honorable could not&nbsp;have been made but one twelvemonth sooner, to&nbsp;the living Master, instead of to his justly offended&nbsp;shade.&nbsp;</p>
