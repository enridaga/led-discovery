    I’ve been to circuses in many parts of the world but I still prefer those we have in Scotland. Admittedly, the most remarkable act I’ve ever seen was in the Moscow State Circus when it was celebrating its fiftieth year. State circuses from all over Russia were invited to send their outstanding acts and the one I’ll never forget was from a far outlying part of Russia — in the deep South. It consisted of a high wire act in which the wire stretched to the topmost pinnacle of the circus.
    Up this wire rode a cyclist with a beautiful girl balanced on his shoulders. As he drove slowly up she sang an aria from an opera. I regret I can’t remember which aria it was because I was so absorbed in the performance, but I do recollect that she was a brilliant soprano and that she was accompanied by the Moscow State Circus orchestra, which is of symphony proportions.
