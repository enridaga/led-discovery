<pre>The "Orazj," or, "Gli Orazj ed i Curiazj," was got up for Grassini with all care <br />and attention: the music (the finest serious opera Cimarosa ever produced) was <br />delightful, and drew crowded houses to the King's Theatre, as it did at Venice, <br />where it had been originally produced. In my opinion, the acting of Grassini in <br />this opera was almost as fine as Mrs. Siddons" : higher praise she could not 
wish for ; the passage, where she exclaimed, "O, Orazio, mio bene," leaning over <br />her dead husband, was positively heart-rending. </pre>
