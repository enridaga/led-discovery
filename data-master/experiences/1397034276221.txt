When a boy, glee singing was a very favourite amusement, especially in convivial parties; and, as I could sing at sight, and well maintain my own part, I was generally present. A meeting professedly for singing catches and glees was held at the Three Crowns, February the 28th, 1785, which was the last time I had any claim to be called a vocal performer; for, after my voice broke, I never possessed a good one. At this time Danby, Webb, Paxton, and Lord Mornington were in their zenith as glee-composers, and a sufficient variety, with the addition of some catches, was obtained to amuse a company for two or three hours. It is remarkable that the Duc de Chartres arrived at the Crowns inn that evening, and, on hearing the music, was curious enough to enter the room and remain for a short time as an auditor. If I remember rightly he had come from France on a visit to the Prince of Wales, and, in one of their frolics at Windsor, the prince pushed him into a fishpond, which nearly produced a serious quarrel.
