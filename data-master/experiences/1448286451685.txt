<p>A charming Quartette performance was recently given by a few of the very best artists here, as David, Dreyschock, (violinist,) Rietz, and others whose names are less known. They were assisted by a pianist from Munich, Herr Speidl. The following pieces were played. 1st. Trio for pianoforte, violin and violoncello, by Beethoven, (op. 70,) by Speidl, David, and Rietz. 2d. Quartette for strings, composed by David. 3d. Variations for pianoforte, by Mendelssohn. 4th. Quartette by Beethoven, (op. 59,) performed by Dreyschock, Rongen, Hermann, and Rietz.</p>
<p>There are only four of these concerts in the annual series, so that they are much more rare here than in Boston. They seem not to be so popular as the concerts by full orchestra, yet they draw out a musical audience of great intelligence, and on this occasion the learned ones were there. It is indeed a great luxury to hear these choice works of Beethoven and others, so perfectly given. The Quartette above mentioned (op. 59) is well known, is always a favorite, and was on this occasion the crowning piece.</p>
