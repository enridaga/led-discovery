<p>After dinner [with Rinck] I had to play something; Rinck had not yet heard me. I first played the variations on ' Am Rhein ! Am Rhein ! ' and I must say I had not played so well for a long time. That I had pleased Rinck, I guessed by the way he shook hands with me when I had finished; ' God preserve you,' was all he said. When I had rested a little, I had to play again, and this time I chose the first movement of Kalkbrenner's concerto, which pleased him very much.</p>
