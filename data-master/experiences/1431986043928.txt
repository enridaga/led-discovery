We went on to Bremerhaven, the great port that was later to play such an important role in the war. The conductorâ€™s name was Flick and the orchestra was very fine. Before he began the Brahms, Flick clicked his heels together, I suppose out of respect, and then flicked his baton all over the place, almost catching the head of my cello. More than once he sent me into helpless laughter and it was all I could do to keep on playing.
