<p>After drinking tea, Lady Mary went away; Capel proposed going on the water : we accepted the offer, took up Mr. Wesley in our way, drove to Whitehall Stairs, took the boat we liked best, and rowed away very pleasantly &mdash; the water smooth, the sky serene, the company in good humour, Philomell was soon called upon to make use of her sweet pipe, which she did. A boat with two ladies and one gentleman was immediately attracted and pursued us. As soon as they were near enough for us to see their faces, who should we behold but the Duchess of Ancaster, an odd woman with her, and my Lord Tyrconnell! I was not a little diverted at the interview, but much more so when he opened his wise mouth, and told Mrs. Donnellan her singing was "the finest water language he ever heard, nay, the finest language he had ever heard by land or by water," and many more polite speeches we had. They were in an open boat, ours was cover'd: it would have diverted you to see how the wretch peeped to look at us, which was no easy matter. My companion's voice charmed them so much that they did not quit us till she had sung several songs. Capel asked the Duchess of Ancaster to sing, which she in a droll way did very readily; at last they agreed to sing a duetto out of y<sup>e</sup> Beggars' Opera, but such catterwauling never was heard and we all laughed.</p>
