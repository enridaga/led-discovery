But it was our turn to be awed afterward, when the girls of the school came on and sang. We were professionals and we had done our best, but those little girl singers put us in the twilight by the sea at high tide. The professional never lived who could compete with them. 

It is hard for me to describe the emotion roused in my breast as I listened. For this was pure. Those little girls sang and praised their God, and it must have been how women first sang before there were teachers to coach youngsters how to imitate others. 

When the girls sang there was nothing between them and their God. Nothing to stop their voices, rich and full of heart, from reaching Him. These were voices untampered with, and they were raised in song not to impress people or to earn money. They were singing to express something they felt and that they never could say in words if they went to all the Vassars and Howard Universities on earth.
