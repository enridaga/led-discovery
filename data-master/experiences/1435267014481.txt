Two programs of my music, plus roundtables on Quakerism and on "Art and the Church". This even, which occurred last night and was repeated the evening, consisted of Catherine Crozier performing on the organ all eleven movements of "A Quaker Reader" interspersed with the spoken and expanded version of the eleven paragraphs that I had drawn from Jessamyn's collection and used as epigraphs.
