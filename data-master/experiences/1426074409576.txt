I must tell you that our society is frightfully busy with music-making, not even pausing during Easter week, and last Monday there was a grand soiree at Filipeus's house, where Mme Sowan sang charmingly a duet from Semiramide and I had to accompany a comic duet from [Rossini's] II Turco sung by Soliva and Gresser: it was 
encored.
