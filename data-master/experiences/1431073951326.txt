<p>Of course, I was a Billie Holiday fan, too. Ella Fitzgerald, Billie, Beverly White, Mildred Bailey&mdash; they were my favorite singers of those days. But I'm more instrumentally oriented. I'd actually rather listen to [saxophonist] Benny Carter than Billie. I liked to hear Ben Webster play his tenor, and Roy Eldridge, trumpet, and [saxophonist] Lester Young&mdash;he did an awful lot for that band. See, those records are unique because every one of those men became a household word in the jazz world, though in those days we were all unknown, except for Johnny Hodges with Duke, and Benny Carter, who'd been with the Fletcher Henderson band and a leader himself. Billie was known at a little club in Harlem called Jerry's, but until these records were made, nobody else knew who she was.</p>
