On the 31st I went to the concert given at noon in the assemÂ­bly hall of the States by the piano teacher, Kunz, for the benefit of the Institute for the Blind and under the sponsorship of the noblewomen. The auditorium was packed with listeners. The unusual concert opened with the overture from Jean de Paris, played on twenty pianos. [...] The second number was a March of Triumph, with two trios, composed by Moscheles, which was performed on four pianos, each played  four-hands. [...] Then Herr Bogner stepped forth and played some variations by Dressler on his flute. The interpretation by the virtuoso was far better than the composition deserved. As conclusion of the first part of the program, there followed a song for four voices, composed and directed by Salieri; this had to be repeated in response to thunderous applause.
