     Al came up with a new arrangement which required two more trombones. The tune was “Holiday For Strings,” by Leroy Anderson. I'd be playing the lead; Bobby and Al, the valve trombones; Red, the 4th part on baritone sax, and Nancy played the electric bass. I couldn’t believe how well our two new trombone players did. Bobby had played trumpet in the high school band, so he knew about brass. He had enough lip to play it once, possibly twice a night as a part of our main show. The quality arrangement was actually a showcase for me. As the lead player and only real trombonist, it featured my range, tonal quality, technique, and style. It was a workout!
     We got a terrific review from the entertainment columnist of the the local newspaper. “If you want to hear an outstanding singer with looks to match,” he wrote, “then Porky’s the place to stop, with ‘Nancy Lee and the Bachelors.’ This group not only plays great, they dance and act as well. Trombonist Felix Mayerhofer blows up a storm with a tone that can’t be matched. Keep your eyes and ears open in the future for this ‘cat.’”
