<p>late tea at 5.30, &amp; we go to opera at 6.30. A lovely show of Siegfried, the only snag being that S. while being a lovely person to look at &amp; a fine actor - hadn't the first idea of singing - literally painful (Schubert). Mime (Zimmermann) was magnificent, a wonderful singer &amp; actor - quite the best. The others good but not astounding. The scenic effects were wonderful, &amp; the dragon fight, far from being ludicrous, was very exciting; &amp; the last act was touchingly beautiful. The orchestra, under [Krauss] wasn't as impeccable as usual, but the horns (esp. the horn call) were just incredible. And the Music . . . . . . . . .!!!</p>
