Seats were not only at a high premium but virtually unobtainable, and I owed the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>possession of mine to the courtesy of Jean de <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Reszke. Many a time I have looked upon the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>heavily gilded and slightly sombre interior of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Paris Opera-house, but never when it contained<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>such an audience, such a gathering of famous men,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of elegant, jewel-bedecked women, as appeared <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>there on that memorable night. The grandes <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>dames of the French aristocracy were present, displaying a sartorial splendor that recalled the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>halcyon days of the Second Empire, and what that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>implied I can only leave my fair readers to guess. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>On taking the conductor's seat, Gounod was overwhelmed with acclamations. His calm, serene <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>countenance wore an encouraging smile, and no one would have dreamed that the veteran composer was as anxious as though it were the first <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>performance of a brand-new opera. At the outset, indeed, every one was nervous. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Many years had elapsed since Mme. Patti had appeared at the Opera, and, often as she had enacted <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Juliette - this was the first time she had sung the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>part in French; in the waltz air &mdash; long one of her<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>favorite concert-pieces &mdash; she did what was for her the rarest imaginable thing: she made a slip <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that carried her four bars ahead of the accompaniment (&ldquo;Elle sautait quatre mesures!&rdquo; as <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Gounod subsequently put it). Yet, thanks to her extraordinary presence of mind, the great prima donna regained her place so quickly that probably <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>not twenty persons in the audience noticed the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>error. Moreover, she sang the whole waltz with such grace and entrain that an encore was inevitable, and on the repetition her rendering of it was <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the most brilliant I have ever heard her give. The <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>youthfulness and charm of her assumption were <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>astounding, while her fine acting in the more tragic <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>scenes indicated a startling advance in histrionic <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>force over her effort in the same opera ten years <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>earlier. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The new Romeo proved worthy of his association with this perfect Juliette. The mere fact that it was Jean de Reszke may be deemed sufficient guarantee of that to-day; it is not easy, however, to convey an idea of the striking revelation which<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>his impersonation offered as, step by step, scene by scene, it unfolded itself for the first time upon <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the same plane with Patti's exquisite conception. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Every attribute that distinguished the one arose,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>strong and clear-cut, in the other. Never before, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>at least in their operatic mold, had the hapless <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Veronese lovers been so faultlessly matched.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Where was &ldquo;monotony&rdquo;, where was &ldquo;tedium&rdquo;, now? The interest of that delicious sequence of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>love-duets acquired a fresh intensity, and became <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;cumulative" in such a degree that the final scene <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>in the tomb formed a veritable climax of musical <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>as well as dramatic grandeur. The genius of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Gounod stood in a new light; and his personal triumph on this occasion was a fitting corollary to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that of the great artists who were his chief interpreters. Again and again did they appear before<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the curtain, hand in hand, an illustrious trio, &mdash; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to be converted into an illustrious quartet after Edouard de Reszke had invested with his own <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>unique organ notes the grateful phrases of Frere <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Laurent. From first to last, it was a historic performance.</span></p>
