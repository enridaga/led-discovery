<p>Trekked north with JH to a vast gymnasium near Columbia University, the only venue (as it's said today) sufficient to stage the premi&egrave;re of Boulez's <em>R&eacute;pons</em>... A few healthy boos would have been in keeping. Not that <em>R&eacute;pons</em> was all that bad. I rather liked it, but for quite different reasons than what Boulez doubtless thinks is in it. It was ornamental, amusing, kind of sugar, thoroughly non-intellectual, utterly sensual, completely derivative, right in the tradition of French Impressionism and (with those flashing lights and cooing females) the Folies-Berg&egrave;re. He's not a charlatan, though anything that lavish is suspect, including Wagner.</p>
