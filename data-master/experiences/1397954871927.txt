My song "The Lordy Hudson" (1947) is dedicated to Janet Fairbank, a kind and needed lady who died the day it was published. Everett Helm gave a Christmas party in 1946. But it was John Edmunds who got all of us to write songs, and in their presentation as an "affectionate garland" to Janet, it was he who presided. After everyone had played his piece and Janet's initial thrill was calmed, the performers each sang. We did my "Alleluia"; then Romolo DiSpirito sang Poulenc. I had never heard "C" before, and at the final words "Oh ma délaissée" when Eva Gauthier began to weep, I began to compose as I often do when my brain is befuddled (this time on hot punch)... I went to meet George Perle and played for him what I could remember of "C". He retched! My guilt began. We drank a lot of beer and went through a lot of music (mostly twelve-tone, and Machaut, on whom he was writing a thesis).
