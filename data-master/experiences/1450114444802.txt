First, there was a really excellent orchestra, and second, a highly efficient conductor. The way in which the members of the orchestra play at sight is quite astonishing. Unfortunately, the time allowed for rehearsing this huge programme (1<sup>1/2</sup> hours of music) was extremely brief; in spite of this, everything went very well, only here and there the tempi were not quite true (and, unfortunately, I blundered a few times in the piano Concerto!!), for there was no time to discuss everything thoroughly. I met Herr Vogel several times; he also came to the rehearsals. / The programme was divided into two parts, the first for the French-language transmission and the second for the Flemish one. I wonder if you were able to pick it up. In Part 2 they gave <em>Village Scenes</em>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Rhapsody for violin + orch. And the <em>Mandarin </em>music. I was delighted with the (terribly difficult) <em>Village Scenes</em> and the end Rhaps., for I have never had the chance of hearing these 2 works performed satisfactorily.&nbsp;</span></p>
