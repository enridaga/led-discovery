<p>I shall often think of those last holidays at Kekker and of our two beautiful musical soir&eacute;es. That last evening, when I insisted on hearing 'Tu vois le feu du soir', I&nbsp;<em>knew</em> that I would not be hearing it again ... let's say for quite some time. Think of your Poupoule. Love his music. That is all I ask you.&nbsp;</p>
