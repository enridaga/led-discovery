In his compositions, of which I, like my BBC Symphony colleagues (he was our principal conductor from 1971 to 1978), have had very wide experience, Pierre Boulez is abstract, unemotional and Euclidian. The sounds are always pleasant and unstrident, but the rhythms are of a complexity few have equalled, and Boulez is entirely capable of conducting these with security and style. To see him at work in Moscow in 1976, where such music was unknown when we played it, was a remarkable experience - and the young Moskovites loved it.
