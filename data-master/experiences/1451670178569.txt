<p>It is with extreme diffidence that I attempt to record&nbsp;my impressions of the pianoforte-playing of the greatest&nbsp;and most lavishly-gifted performer [Franz Liszt] upon that instrument&nbsp;whose executant feats have heretofore come under my&nbsp;personal cognizance...The&nbsp;Canon of Albano was an elderly man when I heard him&nbsp;play most firequently during the Ecumenical winter in Rome, between sixteen and seventeen years ago, and later&nbsp;on lost the inimitable force and flexibility which then&nbsp;characterised his execution ; but at that time his normal&nbsp;powers were unimpaired (at least, so I was assured by&nbsp;musicians who had heard him in his prime), and the&nbsp;miracles he worked upon the clavichord were at once so&nbsp;astounding and so beautiful that, by comparison with&nbsp;them, all I had thitherto experienced in the way of&nbsp;accomplished pianism appeared to me as naught.</p>
