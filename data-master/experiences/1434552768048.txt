Letter from Mrs. Delany to Bernard Granville, Esq., Park Street, Grosvenor Square. Delville, Dec. 18, 1750 -
I was at the rehearsal and performance of The Messiah, and though voices and
hands were wanting to do it justice, it was very tolerably performed, and gave me great pleasure â€” 'tis heavenly. Morella conducted it, and I expected would have spoiled it, but was agreeably surprized to find the contrary ; he came off with great applause. I thought it would be impossible for his wild fancy and fingers to have kept within bounds ; but Handel's music inspired and awed him. He says (but I don't believe him) that he never saw any music of Handel's or Corelli's till he came to Ireland.
