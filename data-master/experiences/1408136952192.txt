And after sitting long at dinner, I had a barge ready at Tower wharfe to take us in; and so we went, all of us, up as high as Barne elmes, a very fine day, and all the way sang; and Mrs. Manuel sings very finely and is a mighty discreet, sober-carriaged woman, that both my wife and I are mightily taken with her; and sings well, and without importunity or the contrary. At Barne elmes we walked round; and then to the barge again and had much merry talk and good singing; and came before it was [dark] back to the New Exchange stairs, and there landed and walked up to Mrs. Pierce's, where we sat awhile and then up to their dining-room; and so having a violin and theorbo, did fall to dance, here being also Mr. Floyd come thither, and by and by Mr. Harris.
