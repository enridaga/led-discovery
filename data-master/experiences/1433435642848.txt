<p>I was just like the rest of the kids--wanted to know all about that new music called jazz. I was a "second line" kid. That meant I'd follow the big bands down the streets and, man, what a thrill when [Lorenzo] Tio or George Baquet would let me carry their cases while they played! I'd walk alongside them feeling just as important as could be.</p>
