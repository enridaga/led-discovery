<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Five years ago in 1952, when Prokofiev&rsquo;s Seventh symphony was first heard, it was perfectly clear to me that this was one of his greatest successes. The Seventh Symphony is truly joyful and lyrical, and delights the ear with its light, clear content and fresh, harmonious idiom. Once again we feel Prokofiev&rsquo;s wonderful gift for melody. Looking back over the almost five years of the symphony&rsquo;s literally triumphant march round the world&rsquo;s concert halls, I would not change a single word in my original evaluation of the work. Indeed much more should be added to do full justice to this outstanding example of modern symphony music. / Each of the four movements taken on its own is a precious masterpiece of fine musicianship, of inspired poetry in music. </span></p>
