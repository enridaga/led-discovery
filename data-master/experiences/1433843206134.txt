Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: 22nd January -
The Court was in full splendour, but the most striking and affecting spectacle was that of the old soldiers and men of the various working classes, wearing the Iron Cross, or some other decoration of honour, who on no other occasion
can see the King, neither in his grandeur, nor as the father of his family, and who now surround him as his guests, mingled with persons of the highest station. Three hundred and fifty, with the Black and Red Eagles, sat at table in the Picture Gallery, two hundred and fifty of the others in the hall adjoining, the latter sitting down first. I sat between Schonberg and Nicolovius; the sounds of wind instruments securing privacy of conversation.
