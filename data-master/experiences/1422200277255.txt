As soon as I could  play the Finale I put it into my act at Sunday School concerts and the like, with great confidence. The audience, who should by rights, I thought, have fallen about in astonishment, hardly seemed to notice it. When they did, it was just to mutter, 'Well, you can't play as fast as Willie Walker, can you?' Nor could I, then; and I can't now, either, because, having heard them all now, I know that nobody else can play as fast as Willie either!
