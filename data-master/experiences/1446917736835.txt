<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Beautiful auditorium with excellent seating - everyone could see [the] stage without having to peer between heads, peer over another head, accoustics were good.&nbsp; All productions used the stage well and were well selected.&nbsp; Saw 'On Your Toes' and 'Follies', enjoyed immensely.&nbsp; Building is a structure of its time.</p>
