<p>Taking my two grandaughters (6and 8 years )to see the Nutcraker Ballet in the mid -80;s is one of my lasting memories.Neither had ever been to the RFH or any London Theatre or concert .It was Chrisrmas time and both of them were aboslutely spellbound.We had a box and the younger one was so immersed in the ballet that she was unaware of what was going on around her. It was such a happy experience that we repeated the visit for a few years.</p>
