On his [Antoine-A. Le Texier's] being appointed manager of the opera, he stopt Cramer in every movement to say this was too fast, that too slow, & something else did not go well &c. Cramer only cut him short with saying that it was his affair, not M. le Texier's, how the band went. - But Giardini on hearing of this impertinence, told me that he could not have let him off so easily; - for he should have said, when he pretended to say anything about Music, 'Monsieur, laissez-moi faire: le violin est a moi - mais, pour la Caisse, a la bonne here.'

I will condescend to allow that Pacc's Cadences are not always equally happy: that, sometimes, when well intended they are manqu√©es from defect or infirmity of voice; but I'll knock down any one that shall scruple to allow that I have sometimes heard him makes closes, which, to my judgement & feelings, were the most learned, the most pathetic, the most original & fanciful, or the most brilliant I ever heard in my life from any Singer: - now, take care how you dispute this matter with me, je vous en avertis. I know that Made Le Brun's are very good Hautbois-Closes - & that Miss Harrops would be tolerably good on the Harpsichord, whence they are derived; but for truly vocal closes, such as are human, & discover the performer to have kept good company, to be of a good schools, & to be possessed of a creative genius & unbounded invention, Pacchierotti against the field. 

Rinaldo is a charming Opera, full of fine things in a variety of styles. As a whole it is admirable; but the Recitative accompd in the last act is higher wrought, & more interesting & learned than I ever heard in any Opera. The author was literally & figuratively full of gout when he composed it.
