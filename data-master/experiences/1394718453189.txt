Saturday July the 9th being one of our practise evenings at Mr Wafer's, at which were Mess'rs Lethin, McArthur, Ducket etc (to whom I, as I frequently now did) play'd the bass on the tenor, my cousin Pratten, sister & Miss Wood came to hear us & were much pleas'd with our concert, w'ch seemed to exceed their expectations.
