<p class="MsoNormal">En route, after a voyage of fourteen days, we stopped at Honolulu. It had been arranged for us to give a concert in that city if circumstances permitted. When our ship was approaching the shore, on June 5, 1882, but was still about two miles from the wharf, a fleet of small boats came out to meet friends, and from one of them came the questions, &ldquo; Is the Quintette Club on board ? Are they ready to give the concert ?&rdquo; To which we joyfully replied, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Thereupon, the boat signaled <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the wharf, and the news was sent to the telephone office. Thence it was promptly speeded round the city, reserved seats were taken with a rush, and we had a fine audience. Nearly all the passengers on our ship, 250 in number, were present, as well as the best society in the place, including King Kalakaua and his court, crowding the boxes of the opera house. After the concert we were feted by a German society at their club-rooms, where we &ldquo; made a night of it,&rdquo; until it was time for the ship to sail, early next morning.</p>
