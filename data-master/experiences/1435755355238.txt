<p>Manuel is here to conduct Poulenc's <em>Carm&eacute;lites</em>, which he does luminously. His secret, he says, is that he treats the orchestra members as individual virtuosos. Actually, he's better, indefinably, than they. He makes the score shine. I complain of Poulenc's orchestration, especially go his thickening the <em>Ave Maria</em> with useless timpani strokes.</p>
