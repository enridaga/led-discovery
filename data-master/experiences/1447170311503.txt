<p>The first concert after the Festival of Britain.&nbsp; The visit of the Leningrad Philharmonic in 1961. First visit of Chicago Symphony Orchestra - Solti. Vienna Philharmonic with Karl Bouhm. [My ?] programme (in the VIP box on that occasion!). Stokowski, Horowitz no less. Then the concerts with Russian and Czech orchestras interrupted by anti-Soviet demonstrators shouting and walking on to the platform! Thank God for the RFH. (DUNKERQUE AND NORMANDY VETERAN!!!)</p>
