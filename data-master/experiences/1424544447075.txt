Incidentally I knew that the former leader of the viola section, a Mr Patos, and another player already possessed T.M. violas. Mr Patos eventually came to London and I discovered what a fine player he was, and not only that but he had written two concertos for viola and orchestra, one of which he performed in London. I heard the rehearsal and was delighted to find it a really good work.
