<p>My functions at the subscription concerts were of a different nature. I had taught myself the violin up to a certain degree, in the hope of being enrolled as an amateur second violin, but it so happened that the gentleman who played the kettle-drums left the town, and I, although seven years old, was considered so good a time- keeper that my father promoted me to that important and dangerous post. And for eight years did I hold it, though not altogether to my credit ; for although I found no difficulty in coming in at the right time, perhaps on the third beat after fifty-seven bars' rest, I could never accomplish a satisfactory roll, hard as I laboured at it. The kettle-drum is not exactly an instrument suited to a drawing-room, so I could get no practice, and I remember even now how I envied and admired the drummers of any military band that passed through our town, recognising them by far my superiors.</p>
