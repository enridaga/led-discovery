<p>Borovsky's concert with Koshetz. Her success - not entirely deserved, since every now and then she resorts to vulgarity. But she is now more famous than she ever was in Moscow, and has become very rich.</p>
<p>As for Borovsky, his performance of&nbsp;<em>Sarcasms</em> was the first I had heard for seven years (except for No. 3 when it was reprinted in America). B.N.* sat beside me and breathed noisily throughout. The pieces were played so fast as to be incomprehensible. The Toccata was alao played at a ridiculous tempo, so inevitably the piece suffered but the pianist gained a victory. My heart had palpitations.</p>
