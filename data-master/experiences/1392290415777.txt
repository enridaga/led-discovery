I have to admit that until it happened, I'd never thought of the Rolling Stones as bereavement music…. [Brian Eno] makes a pretty good case for the therapeutic impact of "emotionally neutral" ambient music, music that is as "ignorable as it is interesting".

… But when my husband Peter died, I realised the last thing I wanted was "emotionally neutral" – what I needed, in fact, was the exact opposite. So I drove through France blasting out Keith Richards' Talk is Cheap, which I found in an Oxfam shop, feeling a cathartic release.… There was something particular about the clanging density of the best of the Stones that made me feel, for the first time in months that, pain and loss notwithstanding, there might be more fun lurking about if I kept my eyes open for it….

It was what I needed; something powerful to blast away all the other thoughts.
