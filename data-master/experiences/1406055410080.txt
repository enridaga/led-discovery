The original concert booking that Daniel had planned for Jackie before they knew each other had arrived at last. On 5th April, Jackie performed the Haydn C major Cello Concerto, conducted by Daniel with the English Chamber Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall. Jackie had hinted at an engagement as I, the nosy younger brother, probed for ‘juicy’ information. When the audience broke into its customary enthusiastic applause, I turned to Gran, who was sitting next to me and said:

‘I think Danny should announce his engagement to Jackie when the clapping stops.’
