I this season received a most flattering mark of attention from Mr. John Beard, the celebrated English tenor singer. He did me the honour to come from his house at Hampton (as he told me) to hear me sing " Spirit of my Sainted Sire," in "The Haunted Tower ;" he sat in the Drury Lane orchestra box, with his trumpet to his ear, for he was very deaf ; and after the opera was over, came upon the stage to me, and was pleased to express himself in high terms of approbation. I confess such a tribute from such a man was gratifying in the extreme.
