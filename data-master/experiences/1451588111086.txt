<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">My entire musical career has been linked to the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. Beginning with my First Symphony, which was first performed in 1926, all my new works have been premi&egrave;red by this excellent orchestra. Especially memorable were the premi&egrave;res of my Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, wonderfully interpreted by Yevgeny Mravinsky. I am happy that this first-rate orchestra is now rehearsing my Seventh Symphony. Judging from their first rehearsals with the conductor, they will give a superb performance. I am eagerly looking forward to the day of the premi&egrave;re. / I am very glad that I have managed to come to Novosibirsk-one of the industrial and cultural centres of the Soviet Union- to hear the familiar, inimitable sounds of the Leningrad Philharmonia. Many orchestras, both here and abroad, have played my works, but no other has captured my ideas so perfectly. </span></p>
