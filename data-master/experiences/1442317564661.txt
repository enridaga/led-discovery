<p>&hellip;Some of the violinists in these caf&eacute; orchestras are a real treat to listen to; one learns no end by watching them.&nbsp; They play mostly Tangos and Rhumbas for dancing &ndash; not this horrible stuff you get to dance to in England&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;There is every sort of orchestra here varying from Symphony orchestras, sort of Park bands, Modern dance bands American style, Dance bands Greek style, to odd little bands which play a very Arabic sort of music.&nbsp; The less primitive Greek music is very fascinating to listen to.&nbsp; Since most of their words end in a vowel their songs are specially characterised by the sustaining of the last note of each line which is usually a rather raucus (bother, I can&rsquo;t spell it) (rawcus?) vowelsound which they hang onto till the last possible moment.&nbsp; From a distance it sounds rather like this:</p>
<p>Tum-tum-tum-tum tiddle iddle&nbsp; ahaaaaaaa (these vowels have a squiggly line Over the top)</p>
<p>Tum-tum-&hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tiddle iddle&nbsp; eeeeeeeee</p>
<p>&hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ai ai ai ai</p>
<p>&hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip;..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oh ooooooo</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>They always sing in two-part harmony; at least two part. [The squiggly line over the vowels] represents the sort of rasping noise the particular chorus I can hear at present is making&hellip;.</p>
