<p>Good morning - worship and breakfast. Then the Sunday reading. He was very much interested in all that I read. I always selected the numbers of the hymns for him, found his text and the Bible chapter which he had Mr. Branch to read. On the way to church he told me he wanted the Pastor's Aid Society of Thornwell Memorial Church to put up a slab of some kind on the front of the church, having the name of the church, pastor, time of Sunday service, and prayer meeting, and "All are welcome." A duet by William and Edna which was very pretty. Text I Corinthians, third chapter, sixteenth verse. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and the spirit of God dwelleth in you." Song, "Holy Spirit, Faithful Guide." Doctor felt tired and took a nap sitting in a rocking chair on front porch.</p>
