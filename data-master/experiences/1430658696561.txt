In the years to come, this wireless unit [attached to Miles Davisâ€™s trumpet mouth piece] never failed us. The first time we set up the unit and Miles tried it, he was knocked out: It gave him a whole new ability to wander the stage, which added a new and very interesting quality to his shows. He was free physically, not tied to anything--he could even go offstage and play, if he wanted to. Miles was like a child with a new toy. Eventually he would find a new use for the device, lifting the bell of the horn and punctuating the music with verbal sounds. For a man whose raspy voice had prevented him from speaking much in public, this wireless unit represented new freedom in more ways than one.
