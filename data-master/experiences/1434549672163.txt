<p>[T]he new Orleans Creole Jazz Band came in town and gave an audition for Mrs. Jones [owner of a music shop where jazz musicians gathered and played]. When they started out on the <em>Livery Stable Blues</em> I nearly had a fit. I had never heard a band like that; they made goose pimples break out all over me. I'm telling you they played loud and long and got the biggest kick out of the fits I was having over their music.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>The band consisted of violin, clarinet, cornet, trombone, bass, and drums, so they had to add a piano player to accompany the girl singer.</p>
<p>[... Lil Armstrong auditioned and got the job &hellip;]</p>
<p>The band was a sensation from the first night at the De Luxe Cafe.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Sugar Johnny played a growling cornet style, using cups and old hats to make all kinds of funny noises. Dewey's clarinet squeaked and rasped with his eleven scales and trills. Roy was sliding back and forth on the trombone, making a growling accompaniment to Sugar Johnny's breaks. Jimmie's violin sighed and wheezed while he scratched the strings with his bow. To top all this, Montudi Tubby and I beat out a rhythm that put the Bechuana tribes of Africa to shame.</p>
<p>But this was New Orleans jazz, and the people ate it up. Ah, what fun! Everybody in town falling in to dig us. No dancing, just listen and be sent. De Luxe Cafe&hellip; deluxe business&hellip; deluxe jazz by the New Orleans Creole Jazz Band.</p>
