<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">1951 - a special train was chartered by my school (Weymouth Grammar School) to bring us to the South Bank (Waterloo) from Weymouth. My main memories of the Skylon and the Royal Festival Hall and the fact that it was a hot day. 1970s - first opportunity to see famous conductors "Live" - notably Andre Previn and Willy Boskovski.</p>
