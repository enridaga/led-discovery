<p>Premiere last night of Douglas Moore's Carry Nation with the extraordinary Beverly Wolff. She is not exactly a silk purse, nor is Douglas' opera a sow's ear, but Wolff made something big out of something medium-sized, and I'm thrilled at the prospect that we'll be collaborating in December. I'm 100 percent sympathetic with the language Douglas speaks through song, though he sometimes uses an awfully corny accent.</p>
