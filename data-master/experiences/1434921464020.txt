Go to B.B.C. concert (in area) at Queen's Hall at 8.15. Ansermet conducts a poor perf. of Der Freischutz, & a not too thrilling one of Debussy's incomparable Nocturnes. Eliz. Schuman sings 3 delightful Mahler songs* & Et Incarnates (C min. Mass) of Mozart marvellously. A competent performance of the astounding Sacre to finish with.
