In the evening there was a concert, which Her Royal Highness, attended by several Ladies of the Court, honoured with her presence. She was perfectly affable to all the professors in the orchestra, and presided herself at the piano-forte ; the whole band was worthy of its reputation. If there were any superiority amongst them, in my opinion, it was in the French horns, played by two brothers (whose names I have forgotten) ; such tones I never heard from the instrument as those which they produced, in a duet they played. 

I sang Sard's rondo of " Teco resti, anima mia," and accompanied myself on the piano-forte. Her Royal Highness did me the honour to approve, and 
asked me who was my instructor ; when I mentioned Aprile, she said that I certainly had had the advantage of the best of singing-masters.
