<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">In the summer of 1939, with war-clouds looming nearer and nearer, Toscanini conducted the BBC Orchestra for the last time, crowning the cycle of the Beethoven symphonies with two performances of the <em>Missa Solemnis</em>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I managed to get a rehearsal pass for this but did not realise it was an &lsquo;admit two&rsquo; until I arrived at the Queen&rsquo;s Hall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I raced off to find Olive Zorian, with whom I had been lunching, and by the time we got back the <em>Kyrie</em> had started and we had to wait in the corridor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But the extraordinary projection of spiritual beauty took no notice of such material obstacles as closed doors, filtering through with no loss of impact and holding us transfixed until we were allowed into the circle at the start of the <em>Gloria</em>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It had taken no more than a split second to realise that this was a very different work from the one I had heard Beecham conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With Beethoven, and especially late Beethoven, one cannot be half- or even seven-eighths-hearted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is all or nothing, as it was for the composer himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Beethoven was never more movingly personal than in his reiteration of certain words of the Mass &ndash; &lsquo;credo, <em>cre</em>do&rsquo; he sang &ndash; and at the end of the final prayer for inward and outward peace he changed, as though spontaneously, &lsquo;dona nobis pacem&rsquo; into &lsquo;dona <em>pacem</em>, pacem&rsquo; to a musical phrase fit to melt the heart of the most wrathful deity.</p>
