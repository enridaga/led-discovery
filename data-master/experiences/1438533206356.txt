<p class="MsoNormal">In the following week Mascagni <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>found some consolation for this disappointment <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>in the congratulations of the Queen, before whom <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>he conducted the second act of &ldquo;L'Amico Fritz'' <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and &ldquo;Cavalleria Rusticana." I had the pleasure <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of accompanying him to Windsor on this occasion. We had barely arrived at the Castle in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>afternoon before Her Majesty sent for the composer, and bestowed upon him the unusual honor of an audience in the private apartments just <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>before going on her customary drive. The Queen,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>speaking sometimes in Italian, but mostly in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>French, reminded him that she had already heard <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Cavalleria&rdquo;, and expressed the deepest interest <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>in his music. We took dinner with the members <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of the household, and the performance began at<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>half-past nine. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

Calve, Sir Augustus Harris, Signor Vignas, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and Signor Ancona, all of whom received handsome souvenirs. The composer was presented<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>with a portrait of Her Majesty in a silver frame <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>bearing the autograph inscription, &ldquo;Victoria R. I., <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>July 15, 1893."</span></p>
