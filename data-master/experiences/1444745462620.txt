I met in the streets a company of laudisti. They are called Fratelli della Venerabil Compagnia D.S. Maddalena de' pazzi e S. Giuseppe in S. Maria in Campidoglio. They had been at Fiesole and were proceeding in procession to their own little church. I had the curiosity to follow them, and got a book of the words they were singing - Laudi da Cantarsi da'Fratelli etc. in Italian. They stopt at every church in their way to sing a stanza in 3 parts, and when they arrived at their own chapel, in to which I went there was a band of instruments to receive them who between each stanza which they sang played a symphony. They performed vespers in canto fermo assisted by their chaplain. It was very decorous and certainly very innocent.</span></p>
