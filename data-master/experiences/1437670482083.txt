He was about sixteen, and held a violin. His name was JOACHIM. He laid his head upon his Cremona, lifted his bow arm, and plunged into such a marvellous performance of BACH'S "Chaconne" as was certainly never before heard in London. The boy seemed to fall into a dream in listening to his own complicated mechanism. He shook out the notes with the utmost ease and fluency. It all seemed no trouble to him, and left him quite free to contemplate the masterpiece which he was busy in interpreting. MENDELSSOHN, after hearing him play the same masterpiece on one occasion, caught him in his arms and embraced him before the audience.</span></div>
