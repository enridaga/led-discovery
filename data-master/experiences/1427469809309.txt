On my return to Manchester after the summer season of 1849 I found the town in a state of excitement, caused by the announcement that Jenny Lind would give a concert for the benefit of the infirmary. She was then at the height of her popularity, had never sung in Manchester before, and it was natural, therefore, that every ticket should be sold long before her arrival. The hall was consequently crowded, and I was accommodated with a seat on the platform. I had never heard her before and my curiosity was at the highest pitch, but the reality surpassed all my expectations. Never had I been moved by any singer as by her, and never again shall be, I feel certain. Her first air was the grand scena from 'Der Freischutz,' and never shall I forget the impression it made upon me. Her singing in the first recitative of the long high note with the descent which follows, npon the words ' Welch' stille Nacht ' nearly suffocated 
me. I was sobbing audibly, and yet this extraordinary effect was produced by the simplest means. It was indeed true art coupled with enthusiasm and unconscious inspiration. Added to this there was a perfection of execution which was itself a marvel, and I can say without fear of contradiction that we shall never hear her like again.
