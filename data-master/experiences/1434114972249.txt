<p>Listen to B.B.C Symp. concert on wireless in evening. Henry Wood. Beethoven - Coriolan; "Der [Die] Frist ist um" (Flying Dutchman)* - well sung by Herb. Janssen (wobbly intonation occasionally tho'). Sibelius 1st Symphony - amazingly fine - rather Brahm's like. He does some very commonplace things tho'. Har. Bauer in G maj Beethoven Concerto. 1st &amp; 2nd movs magnificent. 3rd too fast, &amp; rather ragged. To end - Liszt's brilliant &amp; amazing Mephisto Walser.</p>
