On Monday evening we hope soon to contrive at least checked a fortnight to enjoy again a treat which we had once a week five weeks last summer - of hearing some of the Motetts of Palestrina executed in the right manner, without instruments, at home. We had long tried to get together some dilettanti acquaintances, who knew how to sing other music, to execute them, with the help of a simple accompaniment; but at length finding that no dependence could be placed on dilettanti, we committed the extravagance of calling in professional aid - and yet no great extravagance, for to our one singer from the Papal chapel we gave 6 pauls a night - or 2s. 9d. sterling, for singing in  six pieces: our contralto, the Maestro Giovannini, was satisfied with an occasional regalo, of a few pounds of chocolate, or bottles of wine: our tenor was a Dane, named Bai, late Consul at Algiers, with a most exquisite voice, and great knowledge of music: and for the bass we were rich enough in Sardi, but sometimes Maldura came also. Bai, alas, has now left Rome, therefore we shall have the tenor to seek and to pay whenever we get our musicians together again - for which reason we mean to be economical, and not have the indulgence every week. Charles has often given utterance it the wish that my Mother could be present, when we have been listening to these Motetts. I am sure if anything on earth can give an idea of the angelic choir, it must be the music of Palestrina! and yet I do not forget the glorious effect of HÃ¤ndel - but all music to which instruments contribute, must be a degree more earthly, than that in which human voices are alone themselves sufficient, where nothing mechanical is needed.
