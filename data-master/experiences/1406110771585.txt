<p>Debussy, to this day, has had very few advocates, and at the beginning the greatest advocate of his music on the piano was Walter Gieseking, who played it really very beautifully, but in a completely one-dimensional way. Everything is ethereal; everything is a wash of colour. And suddenly came Pierre Boulez with such a sense of structure. And he gave not only wonderful performances of Debussy&rsquo;s music, but also a very clear direction towards understanding the depth of this music.</p>
