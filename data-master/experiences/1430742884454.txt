His Wagner (pace Peter Heyworth!) must have been the slowest on record, it nearly stopped and, as Weingartner said, however slowly you play Wagner it must move. With Reggie one could begin to understand why Nietzsche said that Wagner's music must had "the heartbeat of a slug". We really did fall out over the Dance of the Apprentices in "Meistersinger" when I was again playing first clarinet and he took it so slowly that my musical conscience refused to allow me to play it at that speed and I put down my instrument.
