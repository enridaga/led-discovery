<p class="MsoNormal">At a jam session at Small&rsquo;s Paradise, there was this tenor player who had just bought a tenor a few days before. Came up on the stand and didn't know anything. He was playing this one lick; that's all he knew. The musicians were just rolling, but Bird was sitting there like he was really listening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Somebody said, &ldquo;Come on, Bird.&rdquo; Bird said, &ldquo;I hear what he's trying to do.&rdquo; The next set Bird went up on the stage and played what the cat was trying to do, but he <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">played</em> it!</p>
