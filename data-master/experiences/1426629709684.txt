Yesterday, as I was having my lesson with Chopin, several ladies and gentlemen came to hear me play Chopin's concerto. I played the solo part and Chopin the orchestral part. I had the pleasure of meeting Baroness Rothschild and there were also present Count Apponyi, Meyerbeer, the ambassadors of Saxony and Hanover and others.
