I have played before the Queen, Prince Albert, the Prince of Prussia and the most elegant social circle at the Duchess of Sutherland's. They say it went very well, but now there is Court-mourning until the 23rd for some royal aunt. There will be nothing at Court, so I doubt whether I shall be invited.
