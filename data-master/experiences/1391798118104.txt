How good it was of you to gratify me with another canto of the Haydniad! It is all most interesting to me. I don’t know any thing — any musical thing -- that would delight me so much as to meet him in a snug quartett party, & hear his manner of playing his own music. If you can bring about such a thing, while I am in town, either at Chelsea or at Mr. Burney’s, or at Mr. Salomon’s, or at I care not where, if it were even in the black hole of Calcutta (if it is a good hole for music) -- I say, if by hook or by crook you could manage such a thing, you should be my Magnus Apollo for the rest of your life. I mention Salomon because we are a little acquainted. He has twice asked me to call upon him, & I certainly will do it, when I come to town. I want to hear more of his playing; & I seem, from the little I have seen of him, to like the man. I know not how it is, but I really receive more musical pleasure from such private cameranious fiddlings, & singings, & keyed instrument playings, than from all the appret of public & crowded performances.
