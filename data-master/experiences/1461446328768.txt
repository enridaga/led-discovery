<p>Thank you very much for your greetings on our wedding anniversary. It turned out to be a real festival with sunshine from morning to evening, with thousands of happy people, with fires on the islands in the Nordasvand and with masses of boats on the calm water. Up at Troldhaugen as many guests as possible in the house and garden, singing and "sk&aring;ls" long into the wonderful brightly shining summer night. Finally a beautiful song by Sinding to the most moving words of Jonas Lie.&nbsp;</p>
