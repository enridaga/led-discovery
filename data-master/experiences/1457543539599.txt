<p class="MsoNormal">My father had had no musical training, but he played the piano &ldquo;by ear&rdquo;, and had a fund of popular tunes at his finger tips, although backed-up by sketchy harmonies in the left hand!&nbsp; The most exciting musical event for him was the yearly visit to Northampton of the Carl Rosa Opera Company, and I often went with him to hear his favourite Verdi operas, <em>Il Trovatore</em> in particular.</p>
