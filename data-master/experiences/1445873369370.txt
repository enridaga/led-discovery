<p>Snow still on the ground and it is very slippery. Clerk here to prepare things for Church.&nbsp; Not many at Church nor at the Sacrament.&nbsp; I walked to Asholt and some of them came in very late. As I passed Rich of Peperell's I heard musick. It was the Overstowey Band so I gave them half a crown for they serenaded us in the morning.</p>
