I cannot describe to you in words the searing fire that blazes through the work...I was at times excited into a frenzyâ€¦Of the excellence with respect to the harmony I am not in a position to tell you anything; you know this great master already too well, to require an analysis of the individual beauties of this work, in order to deem him a perfect master of harmony.  Only this much must I say to you: you would find there a wealth of new, grand, and sublime features and modulations that are perhaps to be encountered in no other musical work.
