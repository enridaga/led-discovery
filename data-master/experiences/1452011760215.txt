<p>Nearly twenty years ago, when I&nbsp;sojourned in the fairest of European lands, [Italy] I was an&nbsp;inveterate theatre-goer ; moreover, it was the fashion in&nbsp;Italian society at that time to spend some portion of&nbsp;every evening at the theatre &mdash; not necessarily to attend&nbsp;to the piece, but to exchange the news of the day, pay&nbsp;visits to one's friends in their boxes, and, above all, to&nbsp;talk scandal &mdash; and I did as everybody else did...I observed&nbsp;that applause, as well as its converse, was almost&nbsp;invariably led and insisted upon by dilettanti of this&nbsp;class ; while society in the boxes, as a rule, only gave&nbsp;expression to its approval in sotto voce murmurs, and&nbsp;rarely vented its displeasure in sibilation or whistling.All the box-people seemed to know one another, and to&nbsp;pass their time in animated conversation, instead of&nbsp;listening to the opera. The pittites and gods, on the&nbsp;other hand, were eagerly attentive and audibly critical;&nbsp;no flaw in the accompaniments, no false note in the&nbsp;singing, no hitch in the stage business escaped their&nbsp;notice, or failed to elicit from them some appropriate&nbsp;utterance...It never seemed to strike any native&nbsp;member of an Italian audience that he might possibly&nbsp;be marring his neighbour's enjoyment by ventilating his&nbsp;own feelings viva voce. I have frequently sate between&nbsp;able-bodied fanatici to whom every well or ill-sung&nbsp;phrase suggested a sonorous cry of " Bene!" or an ireful&nbsp;growl of "Male!" all through an opera; and have&nbsp;remembered how savagely I had been snubbed in Berlin,&nbsp;by fanatics of another variety, for daring to whisper a&nbsp;word or two in the ear of my companion for the time being, while some popular cantatrice was singing stead&nbsp;fastly out of tune.</p>
