The subject seems extreamly well adapted for musical expression, the stern note of the judge, the indifference of the false mother and the tenderness of the true, are all susceptible of musical colouring. The music, far from bad, was by a young composer who had begged employment in order to have an opportunity of displaying his talents. His name is Giuseppe Maria Magherini.</span></p>
