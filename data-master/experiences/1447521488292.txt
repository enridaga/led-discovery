<p>I worked hard, unpacked my books and trunks and have lived three full weeks in as many days. I whistled and sang to drive away the blues which however have come gradually stealing over me. The more they came the more banged I away, unpacking my boxes. At last one little tiny something fell on my hand. I looked at it with amazement. It was a drop of salt water. That must never, never be. Away I worked with redoubled vigor, but the blue devils danced around me like mad. I threw down my duds and took up a pitcher and ran to the well. I determined to wash my face and thus drown my tears. Alas! alas me! It was to no purpose. I've got the blues!</p>
