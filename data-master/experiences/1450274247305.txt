Thomas Starr King, pastor of the Hollis Street Church] was passionately fond of music. I remember that when Mr. J. Trenkle was organist of the church, it was part of the musical programme that after the second hymn the organist should make an extensive improvisation or play some set piece of fine music. Mr. King believed it was as worthy a jubilate as any human speech could utter; and that good music, artistically given attuned his moral and mental faculties to a fine spiritual state, and invigorated him for the sermon yet to be delivered.</span></p>
