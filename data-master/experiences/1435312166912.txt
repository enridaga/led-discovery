[Looking] out of my window, who should I see, but my old friend and country- 
man, Jack Johnstone, who told me he had just returned from the Federation at Paris. I mentioned to him that the day after the girl's benefit my party and myself were going there ; " Egad," said he, " I should like to make one of your party, and go with you." I said, " I should be delighted with your company ; but you tell me, that you are only this day returned from Paris." " That," said he, u makes no difference ; I shall be ready to accompany you at an hour's warning ; and," added he, " if you think that my playing Mat-o'-the-Mint, for the poor girl, will be of any use or strength to the performance, you may command my services." The offer was most liberal and kind; for the high rank he held in his profession, made it a condescension in him to play such a trivial character. He introduced a song in the thieves' scene at the table, which he sang admirably, and was most loudly applauded, a just tribute to his talents and good nature ; indeed, the whole of the performance gave satisfaction to as crowded an audience as ever filled a theatre. The receipts of the house, and many liberal presents sent to the poor girl, were by her patronesses invested in an annuity, which produced her at least a comfortable subsistence for the remainder of her life.
