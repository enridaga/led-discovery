<p>Miss Viney is now in her element, having sat up three nights together till 2 and 3 o'clock &mdash; Wednesday and Thursday at the assembly and last night at a ball Mr. Mee gave. Mrs. Viney, poor Nancy, and I passed the evening very agreeably with oratorios and talking. Mr. Dewes had enough of the music on Wednesday and Thursday morning, and went to Cheltenham Thursday evening on his way home.</p>
