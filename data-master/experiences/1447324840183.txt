<p>Arriving from Canada in 1956 as my parents' chauffeur, to drive them 13,000 miles round Britain and 10 European countries for an 8 month period, which became a lifetime; I was delighted to find it possible to enjoy outstanding music nightly. In Montreal a season ticket was necessary. To be able to walk in, and in many cases, be able to buy a ticket and have a memorable musical evening without fuss, was splendid. The Festival Hall was then, and will be again, an important part of life.</p>
