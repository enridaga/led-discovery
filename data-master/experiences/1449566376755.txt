<p>In my early years in Boston, foreign artists, singers, and players, came to the United States pretty much as they come now, but relatively in smaller numbers. Boston was even then quite a Mecca for instrumentalists.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Among those who made the greatest impression on me were three genuine artists who formed a little company,&mdash;Sivori, violinist, Knoop, violoncellist, Henry Herz, pianist. The latter was spoken of with great acclaim by the newspapers as the composer of variations on <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Home, Sweet Home</em>. His position was thereby fixed at the top round of the art ladder. He did play his own compositions quite neatly, also those of Rosellen and kindred composers, and I was present when he took part in a piano trio by Haydn; but I fear his playing would not pass muster in these days. The cellist, Knoop, was of the regulation pattern of well- trained virtuosi, who could play the elder Romberg&rsquo;s compositions. But Sivori was really a master violinist&mdash;an advance Wieniawski, without the latter&rsquo;s ability to compose violin music. Sivori had a marvellous technique. He had been the only pupil and protege of Paganini, and he played on the latter&rsquo;s famous Stradivarius, left by will to him.</p>
