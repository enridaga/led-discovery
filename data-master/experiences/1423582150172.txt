     One of the worst jobs we played was in Hull, Canada, across the bridge from Ottawa, and it was Allen’s fault. He once more became self-destructive. Allen made the sudden decision to play rhythm guitar rather than piano. It was disastrous right from the start but he wouldn’t give up. He wanted the three of us to stand abreast of each other, swaying back and forth like rock bands did at the time. A vocal group is backed by full piano chords and without that you sound weak. And that’s exactly what happened! Allen chunked, chunked, monotonously on the guitar without sustained chords or solo ability to support us.
     Most of the patrons were Hungarian laborers. The longer they heard us play our “cutesy” music the drunker they got, and they were mean when they got drunk. The owner who kept us there for only two weeks never talked to us.
