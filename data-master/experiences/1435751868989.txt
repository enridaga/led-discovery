JH, on hearing Lukas Foss's String Quartet (the one Seymour Barab said was how music must sound to a dog), called it "airplane music," meaning music written in a plane en route from there to here. If you don't have time to write a good old sonata, just write whole notes stuffed with fermatas in largo tempos - it will last just as long and cover only one page.
