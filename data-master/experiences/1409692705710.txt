<p>Perched high on the Curran Theatre cliff on concert afternoons, I let my gaze slide past the conductor, whose part in the delightful goings-on below rather defeated my comprehension, to focus on the concertmaster, Louis Persinger.

During one such performance I asked my parents if I might have a violin for my fourth birthday and Louis Persinger to teach me to play it.</p>
