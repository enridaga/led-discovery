About 1925 it was customary every Monday morning for the artists and musicians from the Club Alabam, Plantation, Cotton Club, Small's Paradise, et cetera, to gather in one club to enjoy themselves dancing and drinking. All the big-shot musicians would sit and sip and then if the urge struck them, they would grab a horn and how they would blow to that wonder audience.
