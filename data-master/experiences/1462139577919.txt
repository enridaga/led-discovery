<p>My dear Friend. I must just send you a line in appreciation of your work - although my own productions may not be over sympathetic to you- yet I hope that will not lead you think I can not rise to the beauties of yours!! If appreciation depended on what one could do one's self, the auditorium would be distinctly empty. The sound of that pizzicato var. was simply celestial - not to talk of original. Delightful! - &amp; so much more&nbsp;<em>you</em> - than the concerto which I could not help feeling was not an adequate epxression of yourself. / Please do not trouble to answer this &amp; once more bravo!</p>
