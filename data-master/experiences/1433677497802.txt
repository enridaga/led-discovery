<p>I took a job playing in a tonk for Dago Tony on Perdido and Franklin Street and Louis [Armstrong] used to slip in there and get on the music stand behind the piano. He would fool around with my cornet every chance he got. I showed him just how to hold it and place it to his mouth, and he did so, and it wash't long before he began getting a good tone out of my horn. Then I began showing him just how to start the blues, and little by little he began to understand. Now here is the year Louis started. I twas in the latter part of 1911, as close as I can think. Louis was about eleven years old. Now, I've said a lot about my boy Louis and just how he started playing cornet. He started playing it by head [without reading sheet music].</p>
