This is one of the most brilliant and difficult of bravuras, trying to any voice, and absolutely cruel to the generality of singers, from the very high passages in it which few are capable of reaching; and when the performer seems to be painfully exerting herself in attempting their execution, the pleasure of the auditors is greatly diminished. Such, I am sorry to say, was the case on the present occasion. Miss Stephens, to whom the air was allotted, is no longer equal to it, and it appeared to be a task of labour and difficulty. At times she was but faintly heard, and was almost overpowered by the accompaniment of the trumpet. Under such circumstances, she should not have been required to undertake it. Now, indeed, Mara was sadly missed.</p>
