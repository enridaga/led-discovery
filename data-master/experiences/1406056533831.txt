In July 1968, when I was seven months pregnant, the Newbury String Players, conducted by Kiffer, gave a performance of Bach’s St. Matthew Passion in St George’s Church, Walsh Common. Wilfred (Bill) Brown was the Evangelist and I was spellbound by his singing and his complete absorption in the music. I became so inspired, I forgot all the complications of playing the flute and for that performance was able to play uninhibitedly and from my heart.
