So certain good musicians of that time [early twentieth century] who did not have the chance to record will remain forever unknown. Have you ever heard anyone talk about Frankie Quartell? He was the first trumpet player I ever heard use a glass as a mute. Do you know the name of Arnold Johnson, an excellent pianist of that time?
