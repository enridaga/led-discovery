<p>In 1917, we bagan to improvise after hearing recordings of Livery Stable Blues and stuff like that. Also some of the boys had drifted up from New Orleans. There was George Williams, around 1912 and 1913, a great trombone player and a very good musician, composer, and arranger, who also improvised. He played with Handy's reading band [playing from sheet music].</p>
