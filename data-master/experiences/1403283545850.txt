On the third day in Bath we have our first children's show of the season, always an ordeal. It's a story about a disc jockey who suffers an accident in his studio and, as a result, is wandering around in a dazed state, exhibiting an antipathy to silence and insisting on playing his loud radio, which he carries on his shoulder. The moral of the tale is that he learns how to turn off his radio, listen to music and finally learn to play an instrument himself so that he learns that it is pleasant to control the amount of sound in his life, and learns to enjoy silence too. The depiction of this tale is not quite so Victorian as the outline sounds. It begins with a cameo performance by Krysia and me of two charladies cleaning up the dome and discussing the dirty habits of musicians in the hearing of the audience. Then the 'concert' begins and Robin, attired in ludicrous wig and assortment of freakish clothes, interrupts it as the dazed disc jockey wielding ghetto-blaster radio. Various amusing episodes lead up to the conversion of the whole audience into a human radio with different groups of kids representing different stations on the dial with their characteristic kind of music and in the background I provide all the sound cues for this music at the piano. Felix comp√®res with his usual flair. The Bath children respond perfectly, picking up all their cues correctly and generally failing to demonstrate the cynicism which made our London shows so difficult last year. It is pretty much a success, though a great deal more tiring than our adult concerts because we are not used to acting.
