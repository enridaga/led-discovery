The public quite as numerous, but very intelligent and appreciative. I have seldom played better ; my pieces the same as last evening: Beethoven's Sonata in C. Op. 53, Thalberg and de Beriot, Heller's Truite, and the Finale of Lucia by Liszt. The duet pleased so well that part of it had to be repeated, and after Liszt's Fantasia I had to play Mendelssohn's 'Volks' and 'Fruhling's Lied' as an encore. The whole evening, as well as the drive there and back, was very pleasant, and reconciled me to the whole undertaking.
