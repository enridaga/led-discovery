There were a great many people yesterday, in a charming room that I had not seen before . . . everything went well. The concert ended with the Kreutzer sonata, after which we were thrown a bouquet, which we both looked at with no little astonishment. As Vieuxtemps did not budge. I picked it up and offered it to him before the public, but he would not accept it.
