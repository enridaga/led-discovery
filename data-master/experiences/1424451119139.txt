The annual four weeks of summer music-making at Dartington from 1954 to 1957 were a source of most pleasurable satisfaction to me, not only my coaching of chamber music classes of amateurs musicians whose love of music was so enthusiastically genuine, but particularly the evening concerts seven times a week, with tip-top programmes by tip-top artists, which somehow or other William Glock miraculously provided. The delightful concert hall was crammed from floor to – I was going to say ceiling, for there were benches arranged in tiers half-way up the walls all around the auditorium. Two of these concerts stand out particularly in my memory, both of them by the famous singer Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau with William Glock at the piano. / I had never heard of Fischer-Dieskau – it must have been among his earliest appearances in this country. He had the most beautiful voice I had ever listened to, with absolutely perfect artistry, and William Glock’s exquisite accompanying made them a pair of most evenly matched performers. Incidentally, Fischer-Dieskau is the first and only singer who has moved me to tears.
