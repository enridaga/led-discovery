The opera of "Ernani" was selected, to enable Madame Pasini, Signor Castigliano (a pupil of Rubini), and Signor Bencich to appear, as soprano, tenor, and baritone, in the principal characters of that opera. All three failed, Signor Bencich alone being voted tolerable. </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /></span></span></p>
