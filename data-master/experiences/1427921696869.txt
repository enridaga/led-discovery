I spoke of these people, my acquaintances, in various ways throughout my life. Occasionally I contradicted myself – and I’m not ashamed of that. I changed my mind about these people and there’s nothing shameful in that. There would have been, had I done so because of external pressures or to improve my life. But that was not the case. These people simply changed and so did I. I listened to new music and grew to know the old better. I read, I was told many things; I suffered from insomnia and I spent my nights ruminating. All this affected me.
