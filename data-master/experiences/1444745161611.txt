It cost more than 300 zechins. The music of the mass was composed by Signor Soffi, Luchese. There was a trio in the 1st part of it for Manzoli, Verole, and the 2nd maestro del annunciata - Verole beat time, the composer not being present, to the choruses. The band, vocal and instrumental, was very numerous. Manzoli sung a motet charmingly, very well composed by Monzi of Milan; but with less voice, I think, even in a small church, than he had in the opera house, when in England.</span></p>
