<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In my early teens I used to be taken to concerts at the Festival Hall by my grandmother who loved Bruckner. I remember fighting to stop my eyes closing and falling asleep on her shoulder - the seats were so comfortable and the ambience so warm. She also had a stock of barley sugar sweets in her bag in case of coughs.</p>
