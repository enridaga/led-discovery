An interesting musical event with which I had much to do was the Exhibition of music and musical instruments held in Fishmongers' Hall, under the auspices of the Musicians' Company, in 1904. We assembled a splendid collection of old instruments, among which was a reputed reproduction of theGraeco-Roman hydraulus or "water-organ," in which there is no bellows, the wind being maintained and equalised by the weight of a column of water raised by a pump worked by a lever. The Prince and Princess of Wales (now King George and Queen Mary) visited the Exhibition, and I was asked to contribute a selection on the "water organ." It proved a very wheezy affair, and I found it difficult to play even the National Anthem upon it. However, after a little practice I thought it could be managed, my friend Sir Homewood Crawford, a prominent member of the Company, undertaking to blow. His Royal Highness and the Princess of Wales were very much interested in the instrument, so I set
to work to play, and Sir Homewood Crawford to blow, but the effect was certainly rather ludicrous.It amused the listeners very much. At the end of my "recital" I apologised for my poor effort, and added, "Sir Homewood is not a very expert blower."
