On...the eighth of October, Don Giovanni was given at the Karntnertor Theater; I attended the perform足ance with my brother. I was convinced that the production of this masterpiece was much superior in Prague and, in short, was by no means pleased with the entire performance. Mme. Campi, who had been the prima donna of the Quardason Opera Com足pany some years earlier, had not gained in artistic accomplish足ment since then, but had indeed lost the fresh quality of her voice; consequently, I found her Donna Anna quite unenjoy足able. Besides, she had the additional habit, induced by her remarkably fluent throat, of concocting endless - and therefore tasteless - roulades over a chord that was meant to be sustained for but one measure; in the process, she forced the other singers to prolong a measure six-fold. This is just what befell the Masked Trio, to the consternation of all Mozart-lovers... The style and manner in which the colossal masterwork was presented here convinced me more than anything else that Vienna at that time was not yet far enough along to be able to appreciate the gigantic nature of Mozart.
