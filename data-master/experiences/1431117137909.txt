Meyerbeer's L'Africaine (another revival) afforded me far greater enjoyment, the performance being an admirable one and the famous turning of the huge ship by the steersman a fine bit of stage engineering. That master's unfairly decried works, in spite of obvious weaknesses, have always had a warm corner in my affections. In the art of instrumentation, if in naught else, he taught us much more than is now acknowledged.
