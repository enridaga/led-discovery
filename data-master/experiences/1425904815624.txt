The general opinion is that I play too quietly, or rather too delicately for those accustomed to the banging of the Viennese pianists. I expected to find such a reproach in the newspaper in view of the fact that the editor's daughter bangs the piano frightfully. It doesn't matter. There must always be some kind of "but ..." and I should prefer it to be that one rather than have it said that I play too loudly.
