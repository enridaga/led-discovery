Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: Monday, 14th January, 1828 -
The continued kindness of the King towards me is even more affecting, when I think how much he has done for me already, and only because the Lord has given me grace in His eyes. How thankful I should be to be enabled to prove my gratitude ! perhaps in a way that the King would least anticipate. This day I was invited to Potsdam to hear the compositions which are his favourites in the music sung during public worship, partly of ancient German origin, partly from Palestrina, partly Greek-Russian : they were performed, on the whole, well, by a chorus of soldiers and of boys from the Orphan School, who were afterwards regaled with an abundant meal.
