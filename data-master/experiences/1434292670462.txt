Go straight to Hampstead to dinner with Howard Ferguson at 6.30. Go to concert with Him & Gerald Finzi at Conway Hall The Erhart Chamber orchestra. Rather a bad show - orch. not very good R.V. Williams Charterhouse Suite. 3 Canzone Ricercate (R.O. Morris, which we went to here). V. contrapuntal & academic. A terribly long & meandering "Ode to Nightingale" for Strings, Pft & Tenor by Dorothy Erhart. & 2 Grainger pieces. Back by 10.45.
