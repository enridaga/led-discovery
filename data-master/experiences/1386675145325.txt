The entertainment at the Castle yesterday was very superb. There were above a hundred people, Ministers of State and foreigners, invited to come to the Castle. At seven o'clock, and after the drawing-room was over and all compliments paid and received on the day, the company were conducted into the music-room, where there was a very fine concert, chiefly of Mr. Handel's music, most exquisitely performed.
