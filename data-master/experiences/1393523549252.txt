I should not like to live in Lancashire, excepting for the musical talent which exists to a greater degree than in any other county. The Church service was performed in two different parishes better than you would hear it in many Cathedrals, and one night we had a concert at Heaton, led by Lady Wilton Cattie and Sim Egerton, which really did the greatest credit to them and their pupils. There has long been a large colony of Germans at Manchester, so I presume they have infused a taste for music, which is very marked in that town and country.
