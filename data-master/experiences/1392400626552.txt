I gave him [Mr Hughes] the account of my introducing myself to Arch-deacon Leigh: principally because I knew it wd. entertain Mrs. H[ughes]. who has the true taste for humour & pleasantry, & as good an eye for the ridiculous as I ever met with: and, by the bye, she is no bad mimic, yet in all her badinage I never perceived a grain of satire or ill nature, & with a great share of good sense, she has good temper enough to make even a fool amiable. She has but one fault that I could find. She sings too much. This is not the less true for her singing admirably well, as she does. But she is always singing. Music is not an indifferent thing to me: I can’t hear it by the bye. It either pleases me a great deal, or fatigues me a great deal. I dare say you have remarked something of this, tho’ your ears are made of leather & can’t therefore feel so much, either of pleasure or offence, as my ears.
