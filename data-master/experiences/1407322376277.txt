Lords day. Up and to church alone in the morning. Dined at home mighty pleasantly ; in the afternoon I to the French church - where much pleased with the three sisters of the parson, very handsome; especially in their noses - and sing prettily... So home, and there found Mr. Andrews and his lady, a well-bred and a tolerable pretty woman, and by and by Mr. Hill; and to singing and then to supper. Then to sing again, and so goodnight. To prayers and bed. It is a little strange how these psalms of Ravenscroft, after two or three times singing, prove but the same again, though good - no diversity appearing at all almost.
