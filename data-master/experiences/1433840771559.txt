At five o'clock the bells rang in the festival-season, and the Crown Prince dismissed us to go himself to the King, who always passes this evening alone with the royal family. I went to Groben, who had gratified me much by an invitation to spend the festival with him and his family ; there I found Gossner, and the Countess Dernath, and a few youthful relations. First a hymn was sung, then the door was opened to the lighted chamber, where tokens of friendship were given and received, after which Gossner read and commented upon Scripture passages. Afterwards I entered at eight the house of Bernstorff ; the daughters had gone to the Countess America Bernstorff, to a party of children ; the Count, on his bed of pain, and the Countess sitting by him, were alone in the dark and desolate house, where only on the last Christmas eve, their only son and heir of three years old had played
around them in health. I knew they would receive me, and so they did most kindly.
