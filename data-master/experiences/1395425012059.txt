I stayed to dinner [at Whitney Rectory] and Armine and Helen played very nicely. The night was cool and pleasant as I walked home under the stars. About midnight I passed over Rhydspence border brook, and crossed the border from England into Wales. The English inn was still ablaze with light and noisy with the songs of revellers, but the Welsh inn was dark and still.
