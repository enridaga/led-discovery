The concert on Saturday was again crowded; the platform had been made narrower, and thus about three rows of reserved seats gained, the first row being, nearly in its entirety, occupied by twenty blind people who were treated to the concert by Lady Clarke. After Wilma's first solo there came an extraordinary shower of bouquets down upon her; half the platform was full of them, and it took several people to pick them up. After my last solo three very handsome bouquets were thrown at me also, with which I walked off proudly.
