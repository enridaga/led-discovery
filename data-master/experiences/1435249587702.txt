<p>This season, a singer, of the name of Bowden, made his appearance at Covent Garden, in " Robin Hood." I remember going to see his debut with Madame Mara, who had known him when he was in a mercantile house at Manchester, and was very much interested in his success : he was received with great applause, his voice was good, and he sang with taste. Johnstone played the part of Edwin, and their voices blended well together in the duet of " How sweet in the Woodlands." Mrs. Billington was the Angelica, looked beautifully, and sang the simple ballad, " I travelled India's barren sands," like a true Angelica. In the same box with Madame Mara and myself, sat Charles Bannister, who had originally acted the same part of Robin, Hood ; a person next to him, who was vehemently applauding Bowden, had the bad taste to say to Bannister (purposely, I suppose, to mortify him), " Ay, ay, Sir, Bowden is the true Robin Hood, the only Robin Hood ;" on which Bannister replied, " Sir, he may be Robin Hood this year, but next season he will be robbing Harris." This <em>jeu d'esprit</em> produced some merriment.</p>
