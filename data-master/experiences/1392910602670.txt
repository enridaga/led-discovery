On entering the house, the cornets and trumpets [sic.; this is an erroneous translation of Piffari et i Tromboni] to the number of fifteen or twenty began to play very well a sort of recitative, and then after his Majesty had seated himself under the canopy…he caused the ambassadors to sit below him on two stools, while the great officers of the crown and courts of law sat upon benches ...

They danced awhile to the sound of the cornets and trumpets [piffari, et tromboni] performing various and most extravagant antics.
