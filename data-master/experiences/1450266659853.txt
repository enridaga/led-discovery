<p class="MsoNormal">Among the guarantors [of the Boston Jubilees] was the noble, large- hearted Mr. Oliver S. Ditson.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">[&hellip;]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">He gave the Jubilees, both in advance and afterward, the benefit of his (let us call it mildly) disapproval. In fact, it was reported that John S. Dwight had spent the week of the first Jubilee at Nahant, where the noise of the cannon fired off to accentuate the rhythm of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">God Save the Queen</em> (or <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">America</em>, whichever you choose to call it), and the blows on the one hundred anvils (sic/') in the Anvil Chorus from <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">II Trovatore</em>, could not reach his ears and torture him.</p>
