<p>We had the three youngest Princesses to breakfast with us during their Majesties absence last week; and I entreated Princess Mary to play a lesson of Handel's that <em>mama does</em>. &mdash; I gave her that as my reason for asking for it ; and <em>then</em> she with all ihe sweetness in the world, played it <em>twice</em>. When Princess Mary finished Princess Sophia said, "Now I will play to you if you like it," and immediately played the Hallelujah Chorus in the Messiah; and she and Princess Mary sung it. Princess Mary has realy a <em>fine voice</em>, and Princess Sophia a weak but sweet one. So between them both I was highly gratified, and I wished for mama to hear and see them, for they looked like little angels!</p>
