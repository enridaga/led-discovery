In the morning I was awakened by the orchestra playing a Schumann symphony. I thought it was rather nice to rest on the couch there, unseen, and enjoy fine music in the morning. During the intermission it was quite easy to get dressed un-noticed behind the drapery and to slip out of the loge. / In the menâ€™s room I found soap and a clean towel, and in the pocket of my cello case a toothbrush, toothpaste, and razor. With Petronian solemnity I completed the morning with a thorough attendance to my external self. The orchestra was still rehearsing when I walked out of the building.
