<p>Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Clarges Street, 10th Nov. 1743 - That night Mrs. Percival came to invite us to dine with her yesterday, and to go in the morning to Whitehall Chapel to hear Mr. Handel's new Te Deum rehearsed, and an anthem. &nbsp;It is excessively fine, I was all rapture and so was your friend D.D. as you may imagine ; everybody says it is the finest of his compositions ; I am not well enough acquainted with it to pronounce that of it, but it is heavenly. I dined at the Percivals, many enquiries after you from everybody. D.D. and I made a visit of about two hours to Sir Robert and Lady Sun. ; they are all complaining there.</p>
