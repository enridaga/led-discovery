On April 27th, 1882, the funeral of Charles Darwin took place in the Abbey. It seemed to me the ordinary funeral anthems were hardly appropriate to Darwin,
so I ventured to suggest the words which I afterwards set to music (Proverbs iii., 13, 15, 16, 17), " Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. She is more precious than rubies, and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace." This anthem was beautifully sung by the choir, and Canon Prothero called to congratulate me on its success immediately after the service.
