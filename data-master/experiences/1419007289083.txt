<p>Feb. 8, B.B.C. : Boult : Hymn of Jesus, King David</p>
<p>It must be a very long time since I heard the Holst [Hymn of Jesus] &ndash; possibly not since two Oxford performances in the successive summers of 1920 and 1921. It does not seem to me so exciting as it did then &ndash; I have heard a great deal in the meantime &ndash; but I am&nbsp;still very much impressed by it &ndash; it&rsquo;s beauty and inevitability. It seemed to be well done &amp; the reduction of the semi-chorus to very small proportions gave an excellent effect of remoteness.</p>
<p>The Honneger [King David] was new to me apart from the selections which I have on the gramophone. It was written, in 1921, as the incidental music to a Biblical Play, using an orchestra of 15 instruments of which the double bass was the only stringed instrument. Later it became a sort of oratorio, arranged for normal orchestra with a narrator (mostly unaccompanied[)] to sum up the episodes of the story. It&rsquo;s [sic] origin probably accounts for the fact that the string part has little individual interest, tho&rsquo; the wind is used very effectively &ndash; especially the trumpets &amp; trombones &amp; sometimes, the horns. It is really a very beautiful and effective work. The two sections which I have liked most on the gramophone &ndash; the Penitential Psalm &ldquo;Mis&eacute;ricorde O dieu piti&eacute;&rdquo; (Pity me God, in my distress&rdquo;) and the Angel&rsquo;s song at the end still seemed to me the most beautiful tho&rsquo; there are other fine passages. The choral writing is often most effective. Elsie Suddaby has just the right light high soprano &amp; sang more beautifully than ever. Astra Desmond, with less to do was also good. The tenor&rsquo;s part is rather subdued &amp; does not exploit his high notes. Parry Jones (an inevitable choice, apparently, for any out of the way work[)] made the most of it. But the narrator (Leslie Banks) was really dreadful. He shouted monotonously, with no feeling or expression &ndash; a much quieter delivery would have been 10 times as effective &ndash; and in the &ldquo;accompanied&rdquo; Endor&nbsp;invocation (not a recitative, for it was still spoken) got so far out that he had to omit several sentences in order to catch up. But he was the only blot on a very good evening.</p>
