<p>A Dance of Life was splendidly played by the Symphony Orchestra &amp; admirably conducted by Arbos - first class - better than Haym or Buths. Unfortunately the Albert Hall is so enormous that one could not hear anything - It might have been played in Hyde Park. Legges notice is excellent - Brigg fair went also splendidly and Bantock conducted very well - It was no public success, but found enthusiastic admirers among the young lot. I was very pleased with it - it sounds very well - I shall leave tomorrow morning at 11.&nbsp;</p>
