After dinner B.B.C. Symphony Concert with Bridges. Bantick's ghastly Sappho ov. Bridge's heavenly Enter Spring. Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto - atrocious work (Mischa Elman - superb fiddler but impossible musician), & Franck's symphony, lovely in spots.* Boult's speeds were wrong almost without exception. There is magnificent material in the orchestra but it's tired out.
