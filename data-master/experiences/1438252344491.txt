<p>Letters etc. after tea, and listen to a but of H&auml;nsel &amp; Gretel from Berlin, but wireless is v. bad. Beethoven's Mass in d comes over better from Hilversum at 8.0-9.45. An excellent show (as regards playing &amp; singing), the best Solo singing I've ever heard in this work - &amp; orch &amp; Chorus superb. Mengelberg who conducts, leaves alot to be desired - so[me] of it is very much out of the picture - not even being effective (end of Gloria &amp; Credo), but the Agnus Dei is a great show. Of course one daren't talk about the work. It is just above criticism.&nbsp;</p>
