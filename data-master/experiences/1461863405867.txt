<p>As far as I can see I have absolutely no chance here - Strauss plays his own things - Weingartner plays his own things &amp; Nikisch plays nothing new - The last Concert was a Haydn Symphonie - Mendelssohn Violin Concerto &amp; a slow ungifted Dramatic Overture by Scharwenka "beaucoup de bruit pour rien" Strauss of course is always interesting - but as I am here I might as well stay a bit &amp; hear as much new as I can -</p>
