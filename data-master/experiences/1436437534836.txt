I then took a gondola on the Grand Canal 
and passed the house where Wagner lived and 
died, and saw the Bridge of Sighs and the other 
wonderful sights of the city. In the evening I 
went to the Teatro Rossini and heard Boito's 
fine opera, Mefistofele. It was being given as a 
farewell performance to Signer Tamburini, who 
had quite an ovation, being called and recalled 
many times, and was not only presented with a 
great many bouquets, but with a small statue 
of himself. In the last act the audience in the 
gallery joined Tamburlini in his singing, and 
altogether it was a most impressive performance. 
The theatre is rather small, but the orchestra 
and chorus were good and the principal singers 
quite acceptable.
