I also did a lot of listening, of course, and the great clarinettists of the day - Charles Draper, his nephew Haydn Draper and Frederick Thurston as well as Reginald Kell - would have been astounded at the things they taught me, without a penny piece changing hands. I had no desire to be a carbon copy of any of them, fortunately. There is no sadder fate for any musician than to lose his own identity in this way.
