Had a late night yesterday. Went to the Canadian concert at the YMCA. Was a sort of revue, based on a show of waxworks, and a man dressed up as Mrs Malaprop showing off the figures - wonderfully well made up and dressed most beautifully in fashionable attire. Quite made the performance. A lot of people took part. They all did a little turn either singing or dancing.
