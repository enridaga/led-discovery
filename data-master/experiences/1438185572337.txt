Great art joys may come to you in later life, but nothing can ever equal a first hearing of Beethoven's A Major Symphony, or Schubert's C Major Quintet, in the company of kindred spirits like the Rontgens and others then unknown to me for my greatest musical friendship was yet to be. When the orchestra was tuning for my first Beethoven symphony, I remember trembling all over like a horse at covert side, and being far too agitated to note the themes.</span></p>
