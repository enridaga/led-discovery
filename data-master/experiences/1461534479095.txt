<p>This morning I went to the Hauptprobe of the Philharmonisch C - the overture to Lalo's "Le roi d'Ys" -&nbsp;<em>medium</em> - A very slow Concerto by Saint Sa&euml;ns for pianoforte, Clotilde Mieberg. Written in 4 or 5 different styles - Bach - Mendelsohn &amp; Meyerbeer - And then "Til Eugelspielgel" - Richard Strauss - I like this piece more &amp; more &amp; it was admirably played - It is so light &amp; fantastic &amp; so full of humor. The public is certainly the most easily pleased that I have ever seen - They applauded everything with frenzy - except "Til Eugelspiegel" the only thing worth hearing -&nbsp;</p>
