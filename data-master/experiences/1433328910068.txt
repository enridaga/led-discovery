In June a last pleasant visit was made to Brocklesby, and later on Sir George and Lady Elvey, with the "little chap," again visited Penmaenmawr. He seemed stronger than on the previous occasion, and spent many long days driving to
see various points of interest in the neighbourhood.
In this way Beaumaris, Bangor, Lake Ogwen, Trefrew, Llanrwst, and many other places were visited. 
Every morning, as Lady Elvey and Handel returned from their early bathe, Sir George would be out watching for them at the top of the hill. 
The church services here were a great pleasure to him, and at the harvest festival one of his anthems was performed, in which he took great interest, attending a rehearsal.
