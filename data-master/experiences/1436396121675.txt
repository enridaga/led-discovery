<p>Sunday. Twenty-four hours in Philly for concert of works by the comp students. Proud of Erick Vivian (now, after three years, all of eighteen)'s Wind Quintet, and of Kam Morrill (who dyed his ponytail copper for the occasion)'s <em>Suite for Two Cellos</em> and a set of songs on Yeats poems for tenor and three instruments.</p>
