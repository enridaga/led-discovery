The concert on Saturday was perhaps the most successful of all; the hall was crammed and the demonstrations of the public as enthusiastic as possible. A floral tribute was offered to Wilma on the part of her compatriots, which was extremely handsome and costly; a thousand pities that it must fade away. Altogether, we were extremely gratified, and the people cheered us in the street when we left the hall. We can be sure of a hearty welcome on our return.
