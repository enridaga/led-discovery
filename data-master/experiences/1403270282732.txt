This city is famous for its conservatorios or musical schools, of which it has four, the Ospidale della Pietà, the Mendicanti, the Incurabile, and the Ospidaletto a S.Giovanni e Paulo, at each of which there is a performance every Saturday and Sunday evening, as well as on great festivals. I went to that of the Pietà, the evening after my arrival, Saturday, August 4. The present Maestro di Capella is Signor Furlanetti, a priest, and the performers, both vocal and instrumental, are all girls; the organ, violins, flutes, violoncellos, and even French horns, are supplied by these females. It is a kind of Founding Hospital for natural children, under the protection of several nobles, citizens, and merchants, who, though the revenue is very great, yet contribute annually to its support. These girls are maintained here till they are married, and all those who have talents for music are taught by the best masters of Italy. The composition and performance I heard to-night did not exceed mediocrity; among the singers I could discover no remarkable fine voice, or performer possessed of great taste. However, the instruments finished with a symphony, the first movement of which, in point of spirit, was well written and executed.
