Cavalleria Rusticana! It has been performed here three times and has been a great success, of course. But believe, it will not have a long run and the second opera will not materialize. We’ll see whether I’m right. It is a tragic operetta, very humdrum and even more pompous.  / I don’t think that the more intelligent audience will be fooled very long. Really, in our Wagner-impregnated atmosphere with chromatics and enharmonics for oxygen, it isn’t surprising that suddenly a piece with melody (though its melodious character may be somewhat questionable) should take hold – only to disappear again soon. Believe me, this success has come too early to last. Don’t think my opinion is due to jealousy or envy. For all I care, people can write as many operas as they like.
