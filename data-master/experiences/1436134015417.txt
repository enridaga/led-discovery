Sunday afternoon, Jos√© Serebriern's concert with the Curtis Youth Orchestra at the Port of History Museum by the river. A dazzling day. And a dazzling orchestra. My god, they sound like the Philadelphia Symphony, glistening and shimmering and playing smack on pitch. My "Six Irish Poems" (sung by a young soprano, Beth MacLeod, with an agreeable but too-light voice) were revived by Serebrier.
