This quality of Jewish folk music is close to my idea of what music should be. There should always be two layers in music. Jews were tormented for so long that they learned to hide their despair. They express despair in dance music. All folk music is lovely, but I can say that Jewish folk music is unique. Many composers listened to it, including Russian composers â€“ Mussorgsky, for instance. He carefully set down Jewish folksongs. Many of my works reflect my impressions of Jewish music.
