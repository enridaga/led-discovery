Webern seems to have been obsessed with the device of the silent or &lsquo;suspended&rsquo; beat, with the note on the anacrusis. He employs it most successfully, to my mind, near the end of the Concerto, and most controversially in the last dozen measures of the piano Variations, where, because of attenuating changes of <em>tempo</em>, the effect seems to belong to the category of <em>Papiermusik</em>. The metrical accent obtains only if the listener is watching a score or a conductor, the ear otherwise perceiving the notes not in relation to silent beats but as beats themselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
