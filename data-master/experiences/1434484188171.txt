Listen to B.B.C. concert after supper Fogg - Bassoon concerto. Tho' well played by Archie Campden - I hate a whole work for Bassoon - anyhow there wasn't much music in it.* Dvorak's 5th Symphony** - which I really enjoyed in spite of it's being so hackneyed & some v. ragged playing. But Dvorak does things so well.
