<p>Ernst gave a Matin&eacute;e which, I grieve to say, was poorly attended. He looks wretchedly ill, but played with great energy and passionate feeling. We had a novelty in F. Hiller's Symphony in E major, with the motto: 'Es muss doch Fr&auml;hling werden,' a work in grand style, with excellent points in it. I recognize in all Hiller's music a composer aiming at what is true and beautiful. Liszt played part of a concerto by Henselt, and his Don Juan Fantasia, with all his gigantic power. The tossing about of his hands, which he seems to think a mark of inspiration, I still regard as an eccentricity, although it is no doubt remarkable that he accomplishes the most perilous jumps with scarcely a single mishap.</p>
