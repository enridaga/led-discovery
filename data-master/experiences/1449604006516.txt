<p>&nbsp;Something inspired Marti [Manager of Havana Opera Company] to bring his troupe to Boston. They came from Cuba in a sailing vessel, and gave opera at the Howard Theatre for about two months during two consecutive summers. The average of the performances was good. The operas were by Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, Mercadante, Rossinis&mdash;all up-to-date Italian works. The troupe was well supported, being a great novelty and delight to Bostonians; it was also the advance-guard of the many opera troupes afterward brought to our city by enterprising managers.</p>
