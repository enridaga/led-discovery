<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I first attended a concert on the 2nd night&nbsp; the RFH opened, and was overwhelmed (after the Queen's Hall and the Wigmore) that at last we had an auditorium to rival Paris and Vienna! Then I won a ballot for the 2nd of Toscanini's last 9 (?) concerts - again astonishing - both musically and "socially" 1952 I think also Barenboim's first concert or it may have been a recital; - over 50 years later, thanks to my wonderful friend Kenneth Robart, tho' disabled, I still come frequently.</p>
