The first concert here was a great surprise to us. Adelaide boasts of being a very musical town, and the Town Hall, not a very large one, was half empty. True, the weather was bad, but so it has been in the other towns often enough without a similar result. Those that were there made noise enough, and we are curious to see what to-night may bring. Lord and Lady Kintore were there, and were announced to be there; so they do not draw here either. At 10.30 the Liedertafel a very small body of fifteen or sixteen members serenaded us, and I had to stand on the balcony, where it was bitterly cold, to listen to their not remarkable singing.
