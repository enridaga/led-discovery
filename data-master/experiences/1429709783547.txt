In 1963, I found myself in Paris with an unusual contract that gave me authority to act as a. and r. man for Reprise Records and record six or seven people of my choice. The first one I got was Alice Babs, for she is probably the most unique artist I know. She is a coloratura soprano, an unlimited soprano. She sings opera, she sings lieder, she sings what we call jazz and blues, she sings like an instrument, she even yodels, and she can read any and all of it! No matter how hard the intervals, when you hand her the music, she sight-reads and sings it as though she had rehearsed it a month. Every word comes out perfectly enunciated, understandable and believable. Alice Babs is a composer's dream, for with her he can forget all the limitations and just write his heart outâ€¦

She is just one of the rare people, one of the rarest artists. Whenever I get an opportunity to do anything I feel is out of the ordinary, I think of her.
