<p>A really great blues song has certain things about it. [...] Anything can turn to blues . It just goes with the flow of the facts of life.</p>

<p>A good example of a great blues musician who could bring out that kind of emotion would be one of the world's greatest as he is known today. He's a guitarist and he's recognized. The person that I'm speaking about is known to be one of the world's greatest at this sort of thing. That would be B.B. King, because to my knowledge he can do all styles of blues. The next person who also can do that is Bobby Bland. You've got what is called hard-core blues. It can go from that to blues tradition. The way it is today, both of those guys are the greatest to me as being vocalists, even though B.B. plays his instrument. They can take today's music to any level. I would say that those two would be the ones who are alive today, who really have been able to polish that off.</p>
