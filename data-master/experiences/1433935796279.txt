<p>Our last Entertainment here was a Concert, in the great public and very fine Room appropriated for Musick or Dancing. The celebrated Madame Catalani had here a benefit. The Queen of the Netherlands was present: not, however, in State, though not incognita: and - the King of Warriours, Marshall Lord Wellington, surrounded by his <em>Etat Major</em>, and all the officers and first persons here, whether Belgians, Prussians, Hanoverians, or English.... [H]e seemed enthusiastically charmed with Catalana, ardently applauding whatsoever she sang, - except the Rule Britania: and there, with sagacious reserve, he listened in utter silence. Who ordered it I know not; but he felt it was injudicious, in every country but our own, to give out a Chorus of Rule, Brittania! Britannia, Rule the Waves! - And when an Encore was begun to be Vociferated from his officers, he instantly crushed it, by a commanding air of disapprobation; and thus offered me an opportunity of seeing how magnificently he could quit his convivial familiarity for imperious dominion, when occasion might call for the transformation.</p>
