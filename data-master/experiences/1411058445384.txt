<p>The Women of Africa concert in the late 90's transformed my singing and catapulted me into a love of ethnic music from around the world. Sally Nyolo, Sibongile Khumalo, Oumou Sangare and Hanitra Rasoanaivo. What amazing and inspiring women. "I meant to add in my last contribution...having been inspired by women who sang, danced and played percussion in the Women of Africa concert, I went on to join an African drumming ensemble myself - and ended up performing with them on the terrace outside the Festival Hall! It's easy not to notice the ongoing impact of individual events on one's life; writing down this memory has made me appreciate those past experiences. "</p>
