<p>&nbsp;After the second act [of <em>La belle Helene</em>] I repaired, by appointment, to the house of Herr Reinecke, with whom, and another musical friend, I spent a most delightful evening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Here, again, music was all in all; for four hours we were entirely absorbed in it: now one plays the piano, then another ; now a duet, then an improvisation ; now a new original work, then an examination of some novelties by other composers; now a discussion on the state music of England, then the government support of music in Germany ; now organs and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>organists. And then (the creature comforts were not neglected) we adjourned to supper; but music, music is still the theme of our conversation.</p>
