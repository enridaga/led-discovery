<p>Once or twice &mdash; notably, one dreadful evening when the Mallinger was playing Susanna to her detested&nbsp;rival's " farfallone amoroso " &mdash; the performance came to&nbsp;a dead stop, and the curtain had to be lowered in the&nbsp;middle of the action of the piece, owing to the absolutely&nbsp;riotous behaviour of the antagonistic factions. Some&nbsp;minutes later on, when &mdash; the disturbance having been&nbsp;partially quelled by the energetic interference of the&nbsp;police &mdash; the curtain again rose, discovering Cherubino&nbsp;and Susanna " as before," Frau von Khaden considerably astonished the audience by advancing rapidly to&nbsp;the footlights, withering her persecutors by such a look&nbsp;of indignant contempt as no one present had ever theretofore seen gleaming from her bright blue eyes, and&nbsp;scornfully exclaiming, "You are very badly bred&nbsp;people! I am not accustomed to be insulted; pray understand this, once for all!"- with which she turned her back&nbsp;on the house and quitted the stage ; nor could she be&nbsp;induced to return to it that evening.&nbsp;</p>
