<p>I grabbed any old book in a ruh to the john, to discover upon my lap H. L. Mencken's&nbsp;<em>Diary</em>, which for years had sat unread in the shelf... turning inadvertantly to page 41 I find this 1931 reference to a Koussevitsky concert: "Willa Cather surprised me by saying that [Mahler's Ninth] Symphony was too much for her, but that she liked the Ravel. The latter was a very cheap piece of trash".</p>
