There was a record shop where we all used to go on Saturday mornings. You could ask to listen to a record in one of the booths. These were not closed off and more than one person could squeeze in... It was the whole thing, looking through the racks of records together, talking about the singers and so on. It was how I spent most of my Saturday mornings during 1971 and ’72. We couldn’t often afford LPs and even buying single 45s was not something we did every week.
