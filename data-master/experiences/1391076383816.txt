A warm room has, in part, restored my Piano Forte to the use of its faculties. But the worst of it is, that it goes out of tune as fast as I tune it. When I come to town, I must talk to Pohlman. I had a most comfortable musical week here, with my friend. You will respect his taste when I tell you, that he is charmed with Em. Bach, even thro’ my imperfect scrambling, & tho’ not at all used to him, I played: he sat with his hands over his eyes in a corner, & I heard him muttering at all the right places. We played Vanhall together, & he was much pleased with it. For my part, I find the Carlophilipemanuelbachomania grown upon me so that almost everything else is insipid to me.
