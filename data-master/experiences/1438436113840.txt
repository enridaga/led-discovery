<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New';">The following is the translation of a letter which Gounod addressed to Jean de Reszke in 1892 (the year of the composer's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>death), on the day after the tenor's appearance in the one-hundredth performance of &ldquo;Romeo" at the Paris Opera: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New';">My dear Jean: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New';">You literally surpassed yourself last night. Perhaps that surprises you? It does me, too. Nevertheless, it is true. Never<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>have you carried to such a height that beauty of diction and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>gesture, that correctness and expressiveness of accent, that control of voice production &mdash; in a word, that perfectly balanced proportion which alone makes the great artist by placing him beyond <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the danger of extremes, the perpetual temptation of the incompetent. Thanks and bravo, again and always! May heaven preserve you and leave us your beautiful art as long as possible! <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Of such as you we have great need. Remember me to dear <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Edouard, who, like yourself, has the air of having been born in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>his role, and believe me, both of you, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New';">Cordially yours, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
