True, I did go to the Bolshoy Theatre not long ago, to hear Yevgeny Onegin conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich. Slava was very good, and once again gave proof of his phenomenal talents. I was struck by the exceptionally low standard of the singers, all of whom except Vishnevskaya as Tatyana were at best average. Lensky was extremely feeble. Maslennikov, who sang the role and was a good singer once upon a time, has evidently lost his voice either through drink or for some other reason. Gremin (Ognivtsev) was positively indecent.
