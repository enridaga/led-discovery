<p>We have been at the Play a few times&rsquo; we hope to go to morrow night to the Miser &amp; the Farmer, bespoke by Mrs Marwood. The Gramar School Play was last Friday a pretty good House but not near so full as the Farce &amp; easy Britons play just before. I wish you had been with us that night to have joined in the Chorus of God save the King w[hi]ch was very well sung.</p>
