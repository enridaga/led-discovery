Beecham conducted Delius' "Mass of Life" which meant that we had to send for a certain Captain Waterhouse who played the bass oboe. He was a total mystery to me, I never knew his first name - he was always referred to simply as Captain Waterhouse - I never talked to him; he would appear, tallish, faintly military, not young, and vanish again. I often wondered what he did during those long, long spells when he was not playing the bass oboe, an instrument for which opportunities of employment were very rare indeed. But I never discovered.
