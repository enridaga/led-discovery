At the close of a gospel service in Evanston, Illinois, the minister was requested to visit a man who was not likely to live many days, and who was a
spiritualist. Though pressed by other engagements, the minister said, " I will take time." He called,but thought it not best to introduce the subject of religion because of the patient's known hostility to evangelical views. Seeing a little organ in the room, the minister asked if he might sing a song. Consent being given, he sang " I have a Saviour, He's pleading in glory." The sick man seemed pleased, and asked the minister to sing it again.
