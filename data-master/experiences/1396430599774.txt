In the evening there was a concert at the Castle, where I heard the full and prolonged tones of Giardini’s violin. He played a concerto, in which he introduced the then popular air of ‘Come haste to the wedding,' which moved the audience to a state of ecstasy, but now would disgust every one by its vulgarity. He was a fine-figured man, superbly dressed in green and gold ; the breadth of the lace upon his coat, with the three large gold buttons on the sleeve, made a rich appearance, which still glitters on my imagination. An Italian, whose name I think was Ramondi, sang a song.
