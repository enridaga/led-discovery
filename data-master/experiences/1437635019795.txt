Dr. Colborne again presided at the organ, and at the opening of the service, as the surpliced clergy and choir entered the chancel, he played Chopin's "Funeral March" with all its doleful solemnity. The service was Palestrini in F; the 37th Psalm was chanted without the organ accompaniment; at the interval before the first lesson Dr. Colbourne played Mendelssohn's "Funeral March." Goss's beautiful anthem &mdash; " If we believe that Jesus died and rose again " was substituted for the one originally appointed. The hymn " O Sacred Head once wounded " (iii. A &amp; M), was sung before the Benediction to the tune of Bach's Passion Choral, and at the close the " Dead March in Saul " was magnificently played, the Cathedral being completely filled, a large number of people having come in to hear the March played after leaving other places of worship.</span></p>
