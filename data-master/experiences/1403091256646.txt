     L'Iphigenia was soon put into rehearsal, and a corps de ballet engaged for the incidental dances belonging to the piece. The ballet master was Monsieur De Camp, the uncle of that excellent actress and accomplished and deserving woman, Mrs Charles Kemble. Gluck superintended the rehearsals, with his powdered wig and gold-headed cane; the orchestra and chorusses were augmented, and all the parts were well filled....

     For describing the strongest passions in music, and proving grand dramatic effect, in my opinion, no man ever equalled Gluck - he was a great painter of music; perhaps the expression is far fetched and may not be allowable, but I speak from my own feelings and the sensation his descriptive  music always produced on me. For example, I never could hear, without tears, the dream of Orestes, in Iphigenia; when in sleep, he prays to the gods to give a ray of peace to the parricide Orestes. What can be more expressive of deep and dark despair?  And the fine chorus of the demons who surround his coach, with the ghost of his mother, produced in me a feeling of horror, mixed with delight.
