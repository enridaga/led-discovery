<p>How I wish I could listen to your beautiful playing again! Was it all a dream - our tour in Holland last winter, your brilliant reception everywhere, particularly at Rotterdam, and the torches carried in our honour. You played the E-flat Concerto, Beethoven&rsquo;s sonatas in C major and F minor, Chopin&rsquo;s studies, Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Songs without Words, and my new Konzertst&uuml;ck in D in such glorious fashion.</p>
