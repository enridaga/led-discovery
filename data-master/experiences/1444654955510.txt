<p>I am shirking Bobo's rehearsal, which I meant to describe. Miss Craig is a rosy, ruddy 'personage' in white waistcoat, with black bow tie &amp; gold chain loosely knotted.</p>
<p>Stop those monkey tricks, do Saunders - &amp; let us have some light.</p>
<p>Miss Craig (Saunders stands right up to the footlights &amp; shouts through her hollowed hands:) 'There's a short on the battens Miss Craig.'</p>
<p>Let's have the floats then...</p>
<p>Now, all of you.&nbsp; I want you to listen carefully to the music.&nbsp; Make the movements that suggest themselves to you.</p>
<p>...as usual, it is the atmosphere I want to get.&nbsp; The supple, candid, free &amp; easy good sense of theatrical manners, as I noted them at tea.</p>
