At Notre Dame I was fortunate in being present at a very effective service. It was doubtless an echo of the Christmas services, and the hymn "Adeste fideles" was sung in procession round the Cathedral, the last verse being sung in the Sacrarium. The effect of the procession wending its way in the columned distances, with the organ at the West end coming in between the verses, was indeed beautiful. We have been able to turn this experience to account in the Abbey, when on great Festivals we sing some well-known hymns in procession, the choir and clergy traversing the Ambulatory and returning through the Choir into the Sacrarium. As a rule our singing in procession is
unaccompanied, but between the verses we bring in the organ with, I hope, some of the effects heard long ago in Notre Dame.
