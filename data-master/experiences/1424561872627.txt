Some of the most memorable of my orchestraâ€™s concerts were directed by guest conductors. Fritz Busch, Koussevitzky, Richard Strauss, Pierre, Monteux, Klemperer, Stravinsky, Arnold Schoenberg, and other eminent conductors and composers came to Barcelona at my invitation. I derived a particular pleasure from their concerts, and also from those that features the performances of distinguished guest artists- some of whom were old friends and colleagues of mine, like Thibaud, Cortot, Kreisler and Harold Bauer.
