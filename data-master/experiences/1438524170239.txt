Her<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>singularly rich, flexible soprano voice, her refined and expressive singing, and her graceful bearing won for her warm admiration and instantaneous<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>success. She looked Goethe's heroine to the life, and her conception of the character charmed alike<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>by its naturalness and its tender womanly feeling.</span></p>
