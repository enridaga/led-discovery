Homer Nods. Did it really happen? I seem to remember Otto Klemperer - early 70s - Cosi concert - me sitting close to the stage - the conductor and the orchestra gave the impression of being at different points in the opera. Could the maestro be having 40 winks? Not long afterwards the parties re-established contact. Did it really happen??
