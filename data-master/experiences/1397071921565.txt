From this place I passed on to Swaffham, and breakfasted at the principal inn. While I was having my hair dressed, with nearly a pound of powder and pomatum, rubbed into an enormous plait, turned up behind and fastened at the top of the head with a comb, I heard the sound of instruments in the room above. I asked my tonsor what it could mean, and was informed that it was a morning concert, which took place every week, the landlord, his son, and daughter, being first-rate performers. It was supported by four or five neighbouring gentlemen, who joined with their several instruments, and was strictly private, as it was for their own amusement. By the time I had received this piece of intelligence, they had nearly performed Piciniâ€™s overture, La Buona Figliola. The novelty of the thing agreeably surprised me, and I requested to know of the landlady whether, as an amateur who played a little, I could be admitted. I was invited up by the landlord, and in ten minutes joined them in their fiddling, while my horse was grinding his corn in the stable. I spent a couple of hours most agreeably.
