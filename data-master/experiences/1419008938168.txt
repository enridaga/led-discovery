<p>Feb. 18, Sadlers Wells, Don Carlos</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad that I didn&rsquo;t miss this last performance for the season of a splendid work which in view of the resources of the Wells is astonishingly well given. I&rsquo;m surprised to find that it has been done only six times in 2 &frac12; months &ndash; yet there were not many empty seats, except amongst the expensive ones, tho&rsquo; perhaps there is always a good house on a Sat[.]y night. The end of the prison scene (after Rodrigo&rsquo;s death) is now omitted, but even so the performance lasted about 3 hours + 40 minutes of intervals. The chief change in the caste [sic] was that Roderick Lloyd was replaced by David Franklin in the small but important part of the Grand Inquisitor in which his bass was quite impressive. Tudor Davies (Carlos) shouted in the first scene but was better, later. Jeanne Dusseau (as Isabella) seemed better than before &amp; several times sang really finely. Redvers Llewellyn was a tower of strength vocally &amp; dramatically as Rodrigo. Stear (as Philip) adds another to his successes. But it is Edith Coates with all Eboli's opportunities, who gives the most magnificent performance &ndash; almost worthy of any company &amp; surely the best thing she has done. The orchestra (Warwick Braithwaite conducting) showed how much improved it is &amp; the whole performance has much more life than in December. What a lot of gorgeous music there is in it &amp; what fine dramatic scenes[.]</p>
