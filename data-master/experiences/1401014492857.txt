The lunchtime concert today - Beethoven Serenade and Mozart K.414 - attracts one of our fullest audiences yet, and the playing is given extra impetus by the presence of the Irelands, and in particular by Patrick (Robin's Dad), who sits very centrally on a cushion and looks unusually attentive. Michael later says that he did several things in the Beethoven only because of Patrick, and playing the Mozart  concerto, I keep seeing Patrick's smile of comprehension reflected in the front of the piano, which inspires me to do various new things with phrasing and dynamics in an attempt to keep that smile sustained.
