<p>As far as working is concerned, Eisenstein&rsquo;s film 'October' has been released, with a score that A. A. Kholodiliv has put together from various works of mine. I have seen the film, and believe that overall my music has by and large added to it. But the film itself does not appeal to me; I really cannot understand why Eisenstein, and for that matter Dovzhenko, are considered such geniuses. I don&rsquo;t much like their work. No doubt this simply reflects my lack of understanding, since the experts agree that they are geniuses.</p>
