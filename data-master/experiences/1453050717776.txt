<p>An opportunity of thanking His Royal&nbsp;Highness personally for his kindness presented&nbsp;itself soon, for the Emperor had commanded a&nbsp;morning performance of Handel's Hercules,&nbsp;under Joachim, to take place at the White Hall&nbsp;of the Royal Castle in Berlin, with the Chorus&nbsp;of the Royal High School of Music, which was&nbsp;still in its early youth then, and in which the&nbsp;Emperor took a great personal interest. The&nbsp;performance, in which Mme. Joachim took the&nbsp;part of Dejanira and I that of her ill-fated lord,&nbsp;was a very interesting occasion, the audience&nbsp;consisting only of the Emperor, the Crown&nbsp;Prince and Princess, and some generals and&nbsp;Court officials with their wives. The Emperor&nbsp;seemed much pleased, and at the end had all&nbsp;the soloists presented to him. This was the&nbsp;only time I personally met that aged monarch,&nbsp;and the kind and sweet expression in the dear&nbsp;old fatherly face made a deep impression on me.</p>
