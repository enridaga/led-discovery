Today at the rehearsal of the Pupils' Concert I would have my way. 'Studies' by Chopin and Thalberg for two pianos were to be played by two pupils at once; I opposed this, and successfully. No, the piano is not an orchestral instrument like the violin; mere strictness in keeping time is not enough, and above all it will not do for Chopin's music; all its poetry would be lost if played on two pianos unisono.
