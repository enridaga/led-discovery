One doesn't really enjoy the work of someone dear to you at a public performance (as I always feel when Heinrich's things are being done) and my real pleasure was at the rehearsal on Saturday, when my old heart beat with joy only. At the concert I was oppressed by a feeling almost of shame for the work of art thus laying bare its soul - specially in the C# minor movement, when I felt as if you were undressing before the horrid Leipzig public! But luckily they know nothing about what that piece might tell them! In other respects, too, I listened differently as one of the public, in some ways more sharply; both I and Heinrich noticed for the first time that there are too many stopping-places in the first movement, and afterwards made the remark to each other in the same breath. ... Strange how clearly a wretched thing like a public makes one see; one is then feeling with the man in the street, more naively, more amateurishly - at the same moment more stupidly and more intelligently. ... Thurmer [<em>the viola</em>] played wonderfully in the C# movement, especially the E# at the end - a point I drove into him well at the very first rehearsal.</span></p>
