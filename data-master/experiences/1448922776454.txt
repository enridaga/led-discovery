<p>The great Hall now presented a most splendid appearance. It seemed as if all the beauty and fashion of the kingdom, all the colors of the rainbow, and all the resources of embellishment, had been called in to enliven and give effect to the brilliant spectacle. Not the least interesting was the organ gallery, choir, or orchestra; its towering seats being so arranged as to bring within the view of almost every spectator the whole number (nearly five hundred) of instrumental and vocal performers. As the time for beginning approached, the organ poured forth its full and prolonged chords in the majestic and solemn key of D minor, setting the whole atmosphere in motion, and filling the space with a torrent of sound. This continued for three or five minutes, and afforded an opportunity for the instrumentalists to tune and prepare for action.</p>
