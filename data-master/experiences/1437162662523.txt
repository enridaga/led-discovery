<pre>[At] one of my benefits at the Opera House, when Madame Catalani did me the <br />favour to sing for me ; the rush was so great, that the doors were broken down, <br />and the pit crammed to excess : the return in money was only 25<em>l</em>. Of course, <br />great numbers got into the pit without paying ; and though an appeal was made, <br />and a request that those who had not paid, would send the price of their <br />admission to the box-office the following day, not a single person sent; they <br />seemed all to be of Falstaff's way of thinking, "They did not like that paying <br />back." </pre>
