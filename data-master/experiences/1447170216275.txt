<p>In 1951 for the Festival of Britain, I was a member of the Watford Boys' Grammar School Choir which performed in this newly opened hall and the concert was broadcast. We sang Britten's "Spring Symphony" and I was specially chosen for a solo part for my whistling ability. We also met the composer. I also remember that there was a particularly wonderful view from the side entrance of the railway line into Charing Cross and watching the engines using the sidings which existed alongside the Hall. But in December 1959, after attending a concert in the Hall, outside the hall and opposite the Shell building, I proposed to the young lady who became, and still 46 years later, my wife. Over the years we both have very many fond memories of attending concerts in the Hall and from time to time we have listened to our daughter a professional flautist.</p>
