<p>In my visit to town, 1837, I found the taste for private musical parties much increased, and preferred to the crowd you meet with at the public concerts. At a soir&eacute;e I heard a quartett of Beethoven's played by Eliason, Ella, Dando, and Lucas. Music of this delicate texture cannot be heard in a public room. The symphony is of a bolder cast, and requires a vast assemblage of instruments, and a spacious place to bring out its effects.&nbsp;</p>
