<p>Once Ren&eacute;e [Anson Funderbuurgh&rsquo;s future wife] started traveling with us, we had this dog that would come along. Her name was Muddy. We were playing this outdoor show down by the river outside of Kansas City. It was on a flatbed truck, and Mud was up there with us. She was the greatest dog in the world, went everywhere with us. Even Sam loved that dog. He was always accusing us of not feeding her, and he would always be giving her some of his food, fried chicken or whatever he had. He'd always give her a little bite. So we were playing that show, and nobody had a hold of Muddy. She was down at the truck when Sam started singing, "I'd rather drink muddy water ..." I guess Muddy must have thought he was calling her. She came down out of that truck, ran up onto the stage and started playing around, chasing Sam's feet. Sam was startled, jumped back and started doing this little dance while Muddy was running around his ankles. It looked like they were dancing and the audience just went crazy, thinking this was all part of the act.</p>
