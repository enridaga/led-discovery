<p>[As reported in the New York press] "... &nbsp;rioting was wholly unknown to Hogan, when he left the Cherry Blossom Grove, where he had been doing his turn as usual.</p>
<p>'All Coons Look Alike to Me,' Mr. Hogan's own composition, had been rendered, to the applause of a large audience. Hogan, fashionably dressed, stood on the curb, twirling his cane.</p>
<p>A cry came from Forty-fourth street and Eighth avenue, and a mob of five hundred men, armed with clubs and stones, surged over towards Broadway. Hogan was seen. "Get the nigger!" was the chorus. Hogan dropped his cane and started down Broadway on a run. The mob followed and for the next three minutes it had a life and death race for Hogan".&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Hogan eluded the mob]&nbsp;</p>
