<p>I loved to see Jo [Jones] teaming with Walter Page, the bassist. Page showed Jo what to do and when to do it, and it was really something to dig those two great musicians. I have caught Basie's orchestra at times when there was no one on the stage except Page and the horns and, believe me, "Big One" swung that band on his bass without much effort.</p>
