We are in a very poor state psychologically for this first event, which ironically is sold out, and contains several critics and important festival people in the audience....  Nevertheless the concert runs fairly smoothly. Krysia and I don't enjoy it very much, feeling the lack of unity amongst the group, which is expressed in the usual symbolic way. Felix is wearing grey trousers and a pink and green jumper... and at the last moment he also declines to introduce any of the pieces. This kind of mutiny, which Robin insists we make light of and disregard, affects both Krysia and me emotionally and we feel that our differences are cruelly exposed to the public.
