Sometimes, I awakened in the morning to the sound of folk songs, the villagers – fishermen and men who worked in the vineyards- singing as they went to work. Sometimes in the evening there were dances in the plaza and sometimes festivals at which the gralla was played. The gralla is a reed instrument which, I think, is probably of Moorish origin – it resembles an oboe and has a very strident sound.
