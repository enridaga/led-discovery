I was successful in obtaining a ticket, by ballot, for one of the opening concerts. The conductor was Arturo Toscanini. I was rather disappointed with his interpretation of Brahms! Later I heard Beethoven's Missa Solemnis conducted by Klemperer (who conducted sitting down) . As a member of the LSO Club I attended a rehearsal there. Passed the great shambling figure of Vaughan Williams on his way to his box for a performance of one of his Symphonies. My wife and I enjoyed dinner in the Restaurant overlooking the Thames on our wedding night in 1957. The original acoustics were criticized for their lack of resonance.
