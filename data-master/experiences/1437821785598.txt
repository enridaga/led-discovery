To ROLLA was the boy taken; but ROLLA was ill. Whilst waiting in the ante-room little NICOLO took up a violin, and played off at sight some difficult music which he found lying on the table. The invalid composer raised himself on his bed to listen, and eagerly inquired who the great master was who had arrived, and was playing in his ante-room? "A mere lad! Impossible!" but on PAGANINI'S making his appearance as an humble pupil, ROLLA at once told him that he could teach him nothing.</span></p>
