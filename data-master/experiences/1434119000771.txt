Sunday, 19th June.â€” We had a hint in time that the Cologne singers meant to take us by surprise in the evening, to bid farewell, and sing a chorale. About half-past eight they began to pour in, and were taken upstairs, where they dis-
persed through the rooms and balconies, our small party mixing in, and each endeavouring to converse in turn with as many as possible, that no individual might pass unnoticed. Then they marshalled themselves in the inner hall below, while we were posted on the stairs and landing-place (termed the ' Green Terrace'), and their voices sounded magnificently. Pastor Wallbaum, Professor Larson, Dr. Osiander, Dr. Banke, the Prince Salm Salm, and Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, being the only hearers besides ourselves. After this my father led them through his library into the dining-room, where two bowls of
punch had been manufactured, besides wine, and ices, and cakes in abundance.
