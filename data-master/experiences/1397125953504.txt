Go to BB.C. Studio for concert which Mr. B. conducts, with Mrs. B. & Miss Fass (?). Revel in Haydn (Symp. 104), & Bridge 2 Tagore Songs - marvellous creations, not superbly sung by Astra Desmond. P. Herrman plays Schumann Vlc Concerto poorly, R-Korsakov Cap. Espagnol, Marvellously played by the orchestra as was every item, the B.B.C. Orch is awfully fine, but discipline (owing to No. of conductors) faulty. Wind-excellent; L. Kennedy & F. Thurston (clar.) simply superb. Bridge conducted marvellously. Back by taxi at 11.10.
