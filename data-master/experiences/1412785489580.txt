    ...Willie Frame...to begin with...was a sentimental singer; in fact, he often at this time acted as soloist in the “Messiah” at the church (Springburn Parish) with which he was connected as precentor for many years.
    Soirees, festivals, assemblies, and so forth were all the rage in the ’sixties...and as soon as Frame showed talent and a disposition to sing for the love of the thing, he was greatly run after by the promoters of these affairs.... 
    Once he began on the public platform, Frame didn’t stick to sentimental songs for long, however. He developed a turn for humour, started to sing comic songs, worked on funny patter of his own devising, and very soon found that his forte was not serious stuff, but sheer fun.
