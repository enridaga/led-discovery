We in Britain did try to keep the arts going in spite of the holocaust, and I remember, to quote just one instance, Adrian Boult’s first appearance in the Queen’s Hall in February 1918. My participation in this concert was Benjamin Dale’s Romance for viola and orchestra and the unaccompanied Bach Chaconne (which I played on the viola transposed a fifth down). What was indelibly impressed upon me was how, on the first occasion and the very many others when thereafter I made music with Adrian Boult, I always felt comfortable in any variation of tempi, dynamics and so on knowing that Boult’s control of the orchestra would be co-ordinated with every whim of my personal reflection in the work I was playing.
