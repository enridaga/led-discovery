<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My first memory of the Festival hall was when as a school child I visited the Festival of Britain.&nbsp; We attended an informal concert in the Festival Hall, arranged to check on the acoustics.&nbsp; I still have the programme of the Festival.</p>
