I was a boy of fourteen when I came to London
with my father in 1848, having been born
on November 6th, 1833. My father, Adolph
Ganz, had been for more than twenty-five years
Kapellmeister at the Opera at Mainz, on the
Rhine, and the Grand-duke of Hesse-Darmstadt
bestowed on him the title of Grossherzoglicher
Hofkapellmeister Grand Ducal Court
Conductor. He brought the opera there to a
high pitch of perfection. It was his forte that
he could conduct most of the classical operas
from memory I mean, without having the
score before him and could also write out each
orchestral part from memory. Furthermore,
although self-taught, he could play every instrument
in the orchestra.
