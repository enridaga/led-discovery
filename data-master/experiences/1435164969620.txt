<p>The success of this opera was never surpassed ; it was a lasting favourite for many years : the first season it was played fifty nights. The under plot was taken from an Italian intermezzo opera ; the entire scene of the Baron of Oakland reading a letter, was taken from it. Storace was greatly received in Adela, both as a singer and an actress. Bannister and Baddely were excellent in the comic parts ; Mrs. Crouch, as Lady Elinor, was in the full bloom of beauty, and the richest voice. I had two fine allotted to me, " From Hope's fond dream," and " Spirit of my sainted sire," one of the most difficult songs ever composed for a tenor voice ; indeed, all the music was beautiful : the admiration of the audience at the sestetto, " By mutual love delighted,'" I can never forget ; certainly, nothing could exceed the composition or the execution of it ; both were perfect.</p>
