The story of jazz is a long list of great names, rather like those lists of kings and queens and presidents in history booksâ€¦

To listen to jazz without any knowledge of its history is to miss much of its charm. The first "king" we have any knowledge of was Buddy Bolden, a powerful trumpet man who could be heard right across the Mississippi in New Orleans. When he was ready to begin playing in a dance hall or club, he would tune up, stick his trumpet out the window, and "call his children home."
