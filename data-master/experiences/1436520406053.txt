In a letter he (Hans Richter) wrote me shortly after he had 
conducted The Ring at Covent Garden in 1903, 
he says : 
[...]
" For me the finest and most delightful thing 
was the Public ; what a solemn stillness during 
the acts, and what enthusiasm afterwards ! To 
experience what honouring Wagner means one 
must really go abroad. The pupils of the Berlin 
Music-school are still warned against attending 
performances of Wagner's works ; even in the 
time of the worst misjudgments of Berlioz, no 
Professor or Director of the Paris Conservatoire 
would have dared to warn the pupils against 
going to Berlioz performances ; but in Germany 
it is still possible twenty years after the Master's 
death to hear disparaging remarks about 
Richard Wagner. I am happy that I have seen 
the last of this unhappy state of things, and 
these last performances have made me really 
feel how right it was to seek, and, if I may add, 
to find my Home in England."
