Malibran sat down to the piano and sang for an hour. At last, however, she called out to Thalberg [...] Thalberg played by heart, and in a most masterly way, several of his 'Studies', and fragments of a newly written Rondo, then my 'Studies', 'Allegri di Bravura', and 'G minor Concerto'. We had supper afterwards; there again it was Malibran who kept us all going. She gave us the richest imitations of Sir George Smart, the singers Knyvett, Braham, Phillips, and Vaughan, who had sung with her at a concert given by the Duchess of C.; taking off the fat Duchess herself, as she condescendingly voice and nasal tones of Lady [...], who inflicted 'Home, sweet Home' on the company. Suddenly her comic vein came to a full stop; then she gave in the thorough German style the scena from Freysch√ºtz, with German words, and a whole series of German songs by Mendelssohn, Schubert, Weber, and my humble self; lastly, she took a turn with 'Don Juan,' being familiar not only with the music of Zerlina, her own part, but knowing by heart every note in the opera, which she could play and sing from beginning to end. She went on playing and singing alternately untii eleven o'clock, fresh to the last in voice and spirits. When she left us, we were all rapturous about her music, languages, painting; but what we liked best was her artlessness and amiability.
