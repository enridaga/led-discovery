The church boys, acquainted with the practice of laying the hymns on the clerk’s desk that were to be sung the following day, contrived to put in their place the old song of Chevy Chase. After the Scriptures had been read, the clerk gave out, in a sonorous voice,
"God prosper long our noble king.
Our lives and safetyes all ;"
upon which, the minister, leaning over the pulpit, cried “John, John, you must be wrong.“No, master,” replied the clerk, looking up, “ it is so,”
and stoutly began the tune, the congregation joining heartily. But upon coming to the third and fourth lines,
“A woefull hunting once there did,
In Chevy Chase befall:"
The reverend pastor cried, “Stop, stop, let me see it.” John having handed up the paper, the cheat was discovered.
