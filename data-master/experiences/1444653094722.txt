<p>During a university exchange program from the united States in 1986, I often went to RFH&nbsp; to see my favorite conductor, Klaus Tennstedt, lead the London Philharmonic. I had first seen Tennstedt conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra in the US, and having him conducting throughout my term abroad was a very special experience for me. One night, after a typically rousing performance at the RFH, I waited outside the stage door for almost an hour bone-chilling weather for Tennstedt to sign my program. He could not have been more gracious - and apologetic for unknowingly making me wait so long! The signature remains on my wall to this day.</p>
