We wound up 1982 by playing a New Year's Eve show at The Felt Forum, which was the side room to Madison Square Garden. It's a standard, medium-sized modern venue, and holds about 4,000 seats.. Roberta Flack was on the bill as wellâ€¦

Things went like clockwork. Miles played first, and the crowd loved the music. There was a lot more blues than funk in the music that night, and Scofield was enjoying his home-town debut as a member of the band. It was strange, since John is primarily a jazz player while Miles tends to be more bluesy, but after John's arrival the blues became a bigger element in the shows.
