<p>Letter from Bunsen to his Sister Christiana, 27th November, 1819 - . . We live almost entirely out of what is called the world ; and that has come about naturally, without effort.Throughout the day, I work undisturbedly, till dinner time (at this time of year five o'clock). Not always have I leisure before, or after dinner, to walk out for an hour. The evenings from seven o'clock are thus engaged :&mdash; Sunday and Tuesday we read the Bible with Schmieder, and he expounds to us and a small number of friends : we have already read through Genesis. Every Thursday we are at Niebuhr's, who receives the Germans on that evening. Monday we remain at home, receiving any friends that wish to visit us, or to meet for the singing of ancient church music.</p>
