Letter from Bunsen to Fanny and Theodore, The Palace at Berlin, Friday early, 11th September, 1857 -
Then, I presented to the King, in succession, three Australians (natives of Germany), then about eighty English, then the Magyars, then the Belgians, then the Dutch (among them Cappadou, a converted Jew), then the Swiss(Merle d'Aubigne), then the French (Matter-Pressense was there), then those of German tongue, and the Berlinese last. All made short and good addresses. At the close ' Lebe hoch!'—then sudden silence—the Germans had formed a circle, and as the King entered the portal of his Palace they burst forth
with ' Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott.'
