<p>I wish you could have been there on Sunday and Wed: Its been one of the joys of my life rehearsing with that Orchestra: their wonderful responsiveness &amp; flexibility (when you say 'pp please' they <em>play</em> pp - shades of the L.S.O.!) &amp; they know what you want before you know it yourself.</p>
<p>I had 3 rehearsals and really didn't know what to do with them. The 1st one (thank heaven) was only supposed to be two hours, but I gave out 1/2 hr before time &amp; the final one nearly an hour before time. I told them I wished I could have kept them at it merely for the pleasure of hearing them play.</p>
