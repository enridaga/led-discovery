In the evening we went to the Folies Bergeres and saw a Revue and, what was better, had a fine picture of a French audience. For the lights suddenly went out, after the show had been going about twenty minutes, and for a time the audience took possession of affairs. It was either a Zeppelin alarm or the rehearsal of one. There was no sort of panic, but a terrific hubbub; shouts and suggestions came from the gallery, and the place was soon dimly lit by 
flickering candles, tied to pillars or leaning dizzily over the edge of balconies. After about three-quarters of an hour, the band got candles, and played an overture to some light opera and 'God save the King'. Then the curtain went up, and the 'management' announced that they were going to continue the performance by candle-light. The leading lady appeared and stood over the footlights, arguing with the conductor and the audience as to the best positions
for the candles; and while she gesticulated and appeared to direct operations, various characters of the Revue appeared and dotted the front of the stage with candles, while the gallery shouted its approval and its advice - 'Ca va tomber' etc., etc. Altogether an amazing scene.
