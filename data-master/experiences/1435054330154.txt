This was also the time when we had the world's most exciting piano contests, night after night, with the following pianists regularly present--James P. Johnson, Willie 'The Lion' Smith, Thomas 'Fats' Waller, and Joe Turner. Very rarely did other pianists dare to play. Of course there were times when Stephen 'The Beetle' Henderson was getting in on the contest, and he demanded the greatest repeat for his perfect left hand. And there would be two others who would try their luck occasionally in the contests-- 'Corky' Williams and, especially, Willie Gant.
