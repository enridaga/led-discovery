<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I have an eternal memory of a London Philharmonic Monday 1st December 1969. Bernard Haitink conducted and the entire concert was played by the late Artur Rubenstein.&nbsp; He played Beethoven 5th before the interval &amp; Schumann &amp; Saint-Saens in the second half of the concert.&nbsp; The atmosphere created by this unique genius of the piano grew and grew as the concert progressed.&nbsp; It was as if the whole auditorium was filled with electricity and the explosion of applause at the concert end was something I have never experienced again, nor ever expect to.&nbsp;</p>
