I was now a PT/Music/English instructor in RAF, because all my spare time was spent in leisure activities which either involved talking about, or playing, music. There was jazz, a lot of it, played with some of the finest of the young players of the day who were 'passing through' at the time - people like Kenny Baker on trumpet and Ray Ellington on drums. There was chamber music, with the odd fiddler from a famous orchestra or quartet now in uniform: Leslie Hatfield from the LSO, Harvey Philips the well-known cellist, and on a course at Uxbridge the famous Griller Quartet, now all in RAF blue for the duration. There was also some conducting with the string orchestra, and the playing of solo items not only with that but with the famous Boyd Neel orchestra on their way through on an ENSA tour. As a result, with demobilisation there came a sense rather of anti-climax in musical terms.
