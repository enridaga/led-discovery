1st May 1998. The stunning silence at the end of Parsifal. After the most amazing performance of Parsifal by the Royal Opera with Placido Domingo in the title role the audience sat in rapt silence for what seemed an age. You could have heard a pin drop after Heinz Fricke lowered his baton. Then simultaneously the audience rose to their feet in a tremendous standing ovation - as if choreographed.
