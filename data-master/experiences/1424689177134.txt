Gluck's masterpieces alone held their place in the repertoire of the rue de Richelieu, but it was plain that this contributed more to the convenience of the company than to the pleasure of the public, which apparently found no enjoyment in them. I remember that at these performances the audience  might  easily  have been counted. It consisted almost entirely of  those  to  whom these works brought pleasant  memories of  departed youth.  The aged Gossec, taking his place in the first row of the balcony, was to be seen regularly at the Gluck operas. His genius was highly regarded by connoisseurs, and the old man, then eighty-five, had the happiness of seeing the deserted opera house visited by the chief figures of the musical world when, on rare occasions, Racine's Athalie, with his choruses, was presented by  the company from the Theatre-Francais.
 
I still look on those performances as among the most impressive that I have ever been privileged to attend.
