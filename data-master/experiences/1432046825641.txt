An officer of the English army sends me the following incident : "A soldier was stationed at Edinburgh Castle, and one evening left his post on a pass until midnight. He had a week's pay in one pocket and the washing money earned by his wife in the other, and was on his way to the public-house to have a night in gambling. His eye caught the poster outside the Tolbooth Church, announcing your meetings. The soldier liked the singing, and went in just to hear one song. As he entered, Mr. Moody was preaching on ' The Blood.' That had no interest for him. After the address you sang, ' Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.' He listened with deep interest to the hymn. ' Too late, too late,' was God's arrow to his soul.
