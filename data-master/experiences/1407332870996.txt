Being come thither, we went to my Lord Lauderdale's house to speak with him about getting a man at Lieth to join with one we imploy to buy some prize goods for the King. We find [him] and his lady and some Scotch people at supper - pretty odd company; though my Lord Brouncker tells me my Lord Lauderdale is a man of mighty good reason and judgment. But at supper there played one of their servants upon the viallin, some Scotch tunes only - several - and the best of their country, as they seemed to esteem them by their praising and admiring them; but Lord, the strangest ayre that I ever heard in my life, and all of one cast. But strange to hear my Lord Lauderdale say himself, that he had rather hear a Catt mew than the best Musique in the world - and the better the music, the more sick it makes him. And that of all instruments, he hates the Lute the most; and next to that, the Baggpipe.
