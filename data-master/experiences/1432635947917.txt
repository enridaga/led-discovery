<p>Count Basie was the first guy to acclaim B.B. as the world's greatest. B.B. made some appearances with Count Basie for a while. People would look at him like, "That's just a guy on stage playing jazz." Now B.B. could play jazz as well as he could the blues. He might be on stage just like one of the guys in the band, with a uniform on. Then when he came out again he'd be dressed different and be like wildfire, which is great. I could understand what he was reaching. If an idea comes to you, you should just go ahead and do it right then, because if you mess around, you'll forget it. Just do it while it's there in front of you. That's why B.B. does what he does so well.</p>
