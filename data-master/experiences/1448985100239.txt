<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Your writing of a Schoenberg Festival as a dream reminds me of the European times when such a thing would have been possible had not anti-Semitism (and particularly its Jewish brand) prevented it. To judge by the experience I had in Denver two years ago (when there was four-day chamber-music festival of my works and [works of] some of my school), that would very much please and interest me. One positively sees how one grew and developed. </span></p>
