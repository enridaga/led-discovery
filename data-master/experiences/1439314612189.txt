<p style="text-align: justify;">[Franz Liszt] attended a reception given in his honor at the Grosvenor Gallery by Walter Bache. This was in some respects the most striking function of the series. The gathering was in every sense a representative one, and the famous abb&eacute;, as he went round chatting from group to group, seemed positively radiant with happiness. To repeat his own words, addressed to myself: "You have so overwhelmed me with kindness in this country that I shall be quite sorry when the time comes for me to leave you." The programme comprised his "Angelus" for strings, a chorus for female voices, a pianoforte piece, and some songs; and finally, amid a scene of great excitement, he himself played the finale of Schubert's "Divertissement a la Hongroise" and his own Hungarian rhapsody in A minor. This glorious treat furnished the crowning feature of a memorable evening doubly memorable because it was the last time but one that Franz Liszt touched his instrument in the presence of a public or quasi-public assemblage.</p>
