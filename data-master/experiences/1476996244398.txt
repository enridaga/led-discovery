<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">My father&rsquo;s tastes were simple and middle-brow: on Sunday mornings he would strum on the old Dimoline upright with its rattling candlesticks and its twangy tone that became smothered in cotton-wool when the left pedal was used out of mercy to the neighbours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Our rising social position eventually demanded a Chappell baby grand, gentle and even after the Dimoline, but my father&rsquo;s repertoire remained unchanged &ndash; <em>The Druid&rsquo;s Prayer</em>, <em>Country Gardens</em>, and Rachmaninov&rsquo;s Prelude (no need to specify which) were his favourites.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But how magic was the power of music to evoke nostalgia!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For if my father chanced to launch into Rachmaninov on a weekday evening, which rarely happened, its parallel bell-like chords transplanted me into the quiet austerity of an English Sunday, with summer sunshine, open windows, and the smell of lilac.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless music came far more strongly from my mother, who had studied singing seriously but without pretension, and played fluently enough to accompany herself in songs I recall in my mind&rsquo;s ear to this day &ndash; Edward German&rsquo;s <em>Charming Chloe</em>, Dell&rsquo;Acqua&rsquo;s <em>Villanelle</em>, &lsquo;The Pipes of Pan&rsquo; from <em>The Arcadians</em>, French Bergerettes, and countless popular ballads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
