<p>After tea, letters &amp; after dinner 'Carmen' at the Volksoper. Of course it wasn't like the 'Oper'*, but not half a bad show - Carmen being the incredible Maria Olszewska (a guest) who rather overshadows the rest. Orchestra quite good &amp; whole show very lively. Of course the Music is from the beginning to the end just 'it' - &amp; that's all that can be said.</p>
