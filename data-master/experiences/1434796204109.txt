On Whit- Sunday we repaired to Westminster Abbey, to hear the responses of Tallis, always performed on this day. They are grand specimens of the simple evolutions of harmony in the time of Henry the Eighth, and give us an exalted idea of the genius of his chief musician. In the course of the service we had some pieces from Orlando Gibbons, a style more melodious than the preceding age, yet far from the perfection of the present day ; for, though melody is the result of harmony, it has not developed itself till within the last fifty years. The service was admirably played on the organ, by Mr. Turl, with a gigantic hand, grasping as many notes as lie had fingers, added to the double diapasons played by his feet.
