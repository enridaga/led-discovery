<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I first came to the Festival Hall when I was ten years old, in 1953. During the 1950s I remember the marvellous children's concerts. In particular I recall hearing Dennis Brain play the horn. We were also taken to see the special Christmas shows - the one I particularly recall is 'Where the Rainbow Ends' which I think starred Alicia Markova although I'm not sure.</p>
