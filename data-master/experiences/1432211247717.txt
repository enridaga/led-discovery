A lieutenant in the Union army, having received his death-wound in a gallant charge at the head of his regiment was visited in the hospital by the chaplain, who inquired how he felt. He said he had always been cheerful, and was now ready to meet God in peace. " Chaplain," he added, " I was passing through the streets of New York once on a Sunday night, and I heard singing. I went in and saw a company of poor people. They were singing ' There is a Fountain filled with Blood.' I was overpowered with the impression the hymn made upon me, and I gave my heart to God. Since then I have loved Jesus, and I love Him now." That was his last speech.
