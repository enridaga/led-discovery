<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I first became acquainted with the music of Karol Szymanowski a long time ago. He is a very distinctive composer, with an excellent command of the orchestra&rsquo;s full potential. His miniature are much more successful than his large-scale works, and in general lyricism, reverie and contemplation are more suited to his talent than action, heorics and &lsquo;big&rsquo; themes. /Tadeusz Kassern&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Concerto&nbsp;</em>was, in my opinion, the least successful item in the concert. The composer has clearly not yet found his own musical language. His music is unexpressive, though technically fine. / Roman Palester&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Polish Dance </em>is just a charming bagatelle. /The concert was conducted in spirited fashion by the talented Grzegorz Fitelberg. / Whatever my impressions of the individual works may have been, for me the most important and most enjoyable aspect of the concert was that it acquainted us with the distinctive and interesting music of our Polish neighbours. </span></p>
