My birthday was a truly happy one. A great plan had long been in preparation, of which I was to know nothing, for its celebration, and I did in fact know no more, but that something was in agitation, which I scrupulously ignored, and so was surprised by the performance of the Precieuses of Moliere, and a little French Proverbe besides, ushered in by a Prologue compsed by Meyer and recited by himself and my three daughters, and closed by a Duo Buffo, sung by Meyer and Sternberg.
