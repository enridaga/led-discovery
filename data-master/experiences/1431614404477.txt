One evening we went to a concert, which was crowded with military men and beautiful women, where I had the pleasure of being introduced to the justly popular composer, Pleyel ; he was engaged as director of the concerts ; he came to the hotel and supped with us, and seemed delighted to hear that 
we had left his old master Haydn in good health and spirits. In the morning I went with him to the top of the spire of the cathedral, reckoned the highest 
in Europe ; a foolish fellow, a week before, disappointed and crossed in love, had thrown himself from the top of it, and been dashed to pieces. In the body of the church, lie the remains of the famous Marshal Saxe, to whose memory there is a fine monument ; and its clock is a curious piece of machinery. In the evening I heard the celebrated French actress and comic singer, Madame Dugazzon, who sang the popular ballad of " Mon bon Andre, mon cher Andre," charmingly. The house literally overflowed with elegant company.
