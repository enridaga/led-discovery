<p>I composed this symphony [one of Stravinsky&rsquo;s first symphonies] at the time when Alexander Glazounov reigned supreme in the science of symphony. Each new production of his was received as musical event of the first order, so greatly were the perfections of his form, the purity of his counterpoint, and the ease and assurance of his writing appreciated. At that time I share this admiration whole-heartedly, fascinated by the astonishing mastery of this scholar. It was, therefore, quite natural that side by side with other influences (Tchaikovsky, Wagner, Rimsky-Korsakov) his predominated, and that in my symphony I modeled myself particularly on him.</p>
