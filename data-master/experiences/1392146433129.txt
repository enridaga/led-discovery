It was my first proximity to a great triumph [the defeat of the Turkish Army in Syria] and I celebrated it on return from work that night  by playing upon my Steinway a medey of “Vittoria” from “La Tosca” Handel’s marches from “Jephtha” and “Scipio”  Parry’s Wedding March from the "Birds" of Aristophanes, the Pilgrim's Chorus  and the Entry of the Gods into Valhalla.
