Sir Malcolm Sargent... Certainly as a soloist one found him not only helpful, but deeply understanding. I recall playing the very fist TV performance of Aaron Copland's concerto with him in about 1952 in the Maida Vale Studio at one of the series of Sunday afternoon concerts they always televised from there. He was most anxious not to over-tire me at the morning rehearsal, and insisted that we should 'mime' the interminable repetitions of the necessary camera-shots.
