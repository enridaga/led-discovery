After six months of enduring the east winds blowing on the Norfolk headlands, it was something of a relief to be posted back to Pembrokeshire. I was now attached to the Trials Wing of the School of Artillery... One memorable Saturday I arrived in Tenby to find the streets teeming with American soldiers. The following day, on my weekly visit to the morning service, I found every seat in the church taken by an American. The worship was movingly enriched by a solo from the New World Symphony.
