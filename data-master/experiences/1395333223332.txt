[Colonel] Harrison's Christmas was appreciated more by his followers perhaps  than by himself. He held a Church Parade and, while officiating, reading a Lesson or so, was interrupted by the Band, which somehow mistook its cue. The Colonel is thought to have said, "Hold your b--- noise" on this contretemps, which did not dampen the ardour of the congregation, especially the back part of the room, as they thundered out "While Shepherds Watched."
