<p>&hellip;[A]t nights everybody used to carry their horns round with them and wherever there was a piano you'd find horn players sitting and jamming. There'd be maybe a piano player, and a drummer, and about six different cornet players; everybody trying to outblow everybody else. And whoever owned the place would stand drinks all night long. It was OK by him, he got free music that way&hellip;</p>
<p>The earliest bands I can remember (about 1923) were those of Fess Williams, Wilbur Sweatman, Jack Hatton the trumpet player, and the famous trumpeter, Johnny Dunn. Mamie Smith had a wonderful band working at the Garden of Joy, which was built on top of a rock which is now 140th and Seventh Avenue. Bubber Miley was playing trumpet; Sidney Bechet, soprano; Earl Frazier, piano; and Cecil McCoy, claret. There were many colorful hot spots scattered about Harlem, and no curfew to dampen the spirits or curtail early morning activities.</p>
