Conclusion of letter from Bunsen to his wife, begun 3rd November, 1827 -
Before I write my chronicle I must tell of this evening (Tuesday, midnight). Having worked till noon, then discussed matters of public business till three, dined and rested, I went at half-past four to Groben, refreshed myself with the sight of those dear faces, and accompanied the Count to the Sing-Akademie, where ' O Roma nobilis,' and some of the choruses in ' Judas Maccabaeus ' were performed by two hundred voices. During the chorus, ' Give us freedom or death,' I thought of the Greeks confronting the Turkish artillery undismayed, and the heroes of Missolonghi.
