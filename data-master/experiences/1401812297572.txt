(1) 1960s Victor Gollancz memorial concert.  LPO with Otto Klemperer second half Leonora No. 3 Beethoven was absolutely perfect.  Klemperer hobbled onto platform and got steadily stronger as concert went on.   (2) Artur Rubenstein Last Concert at Festival Hall.  Mainly Chopin.  The perfect exponent of Chopin.  At the end an old lady in the audience presented him with a red rose.  His encores were wonderful.  (3)  1970s perhaps 1980s Klaus Tennstedt conducting Mahler 1.
