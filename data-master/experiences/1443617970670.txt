<p>I remember the Festival Hall from the beginning in 1951 at the Festival of Britain and especially 30th June 1955 when my mother brought me to the Hall for my 21st birthday. We had dinner and then went to hear Solomon playing Beethoven's Emperor Concerto - No 5. It was an unforgettable evening. Over the years since, I visited the Hall on innumerable occasions&nbsp; for concerts and ballet bringing first of all my children and later grandchildren. I especially recall bringing my youngest daughter and friend to hear Dvorak's Cello Concerto in the 1970s which they were studying for their "O" levels in Music. They studied the score carefully and at the interval muttered to each other - Tortellier plays his better than this chap. (Shsh! Poor Julian Lloyd Webber!)</p>
