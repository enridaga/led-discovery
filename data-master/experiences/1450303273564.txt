<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">The first time I heard his [Erik Satie]&nbsp;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Socrate</em>, at a s&eacute;ance where he played it for a few of his friends, he turned around at the end and said, like the proprietor of a caf&eacute; or a store, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&lsquo;Voil&agrave;, messieurs, dames</em>.&rsquo; I was deeply moved by the gravitas and dignity of his music for Socrates&rsquo; death, though the piece as a whole is rhythmically monotonous. I don&rsquo;t think he knew much about instruments; I prefer <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Socrate </em>as he played it on the piano to the orchestra score. </span></p>
