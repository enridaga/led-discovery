<p>Now, with my Studio habitable, &amp; another servant perhaps, I shall aim at haphazard, bohemian meetings, music (we have the algraphone, &amp; thats a heavenly prospect - music after dinner while I stitch at my woolwork - I go to Lewes this afternoon to meet Nessa &amp; buy wools) people of our own standard dropping in; ease, slippers, smoke, buns, chocolate.&nbsp; For I'm naturally sociable; it cannot be denied.</p>
