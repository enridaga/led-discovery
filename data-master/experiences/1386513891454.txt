Today being her majesty’s birthday, there was a grand review of troops. At midday Lord Raglan and an immense staff came on the ground: then followed three cheers from the troops, but all the bands playing in different keys ‘God Save the Queen’ spoilt the effect it otherwise would have had. There were about 16,000 men on parade.
