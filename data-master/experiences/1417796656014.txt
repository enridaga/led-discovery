     The only music you could get on the car radio after midnight in Tennessee was Country or Western. It drove the heavy jazz musicians crazy. “These people are a bunch of ‘hayseeds,’” they’d complain, then switch to different stations looking for something better. I didn’t mind. When I was about five, our Sicilian neighbors played country records and it came through loud and clear and I liked it.
