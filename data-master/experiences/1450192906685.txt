<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I became acquainted with Var&egrave;se myself only toward the end of his life. A big, gruffly restless man, he had extraordinary power to vivify, and I will not soon forget him as he moved about his basement studio one night striking his beloved gongs, then rushed around the block to buy a pizza. I also remember him &ndash; it was the last time we were together &ndash; listening to the electronic interludes of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Deserts</em>, which he had just revised (the machine-guns were made to enter at new places, I think). He pleaded with the sound engineer to increase the already fuse-and brain-blowing volume, I recall, and he could hardly contain his eagerness to wiggle the dials himself. I am deeply saddened by his death. </span></p>
