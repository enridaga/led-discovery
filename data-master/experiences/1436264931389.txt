In the evening there was a gala performance 
at the Opera, and Guillaume Tell was performed. 
As this masterpiece of Rossini's is very seldom 
performed in England, I venture to say that, 
being French in character and style, it will live 
with II Barbiere, which is thoroughly Italian in 
character, for many years to come. This was 
the old Opera-house in the Rue Lepeletier. 
The Emperor and Empress were present, and 
the doors of all the private boxes were left open 
and guarded by gendarmes, which was done in 
case some maniac should fire a shot at the 
Emperor or Empress ; but, fortunately, nothing 
happened. During the entr'actes I saw the Em- 
peror and Empress visit some of their relatives, 
who sat in the middle boxes of the grand circle. 

The performance was very fine, and the 
scenery splendid ; but, unfortunately, I cannot 
remember the names of the principal singers.
