Among the things we heard at that time and which we never hear now I must note especially Berlioz's Corsaire and King Lear. His name is so much beloved by the present day public that this neglect is both unjust and unjustifiable. The great man himself came to the Societe St. Cecile one day to conduct his L'Enfance du Christ which he had just written or rather La Fuite en Egypt which was the only part of the work that was in existence then. He composed
the rest of it afterwards. I remember perfectly the performances which the great man directed. They were lively and spirited rather than careful, but somewhat slower than what Edouard Colonne has accustomed us to. The time was faster and the nuances sharper.
