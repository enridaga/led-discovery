This Popper Jubilee brings to mind another celebration, this time in honor of my master Hubay’s fiftieth birthday in 1908. During the preceding few years I had been extensively concertizing in England, making many trips to the Continent between my English tours; and now I came home specially to bring my tribute to the master whose worth had been revealed to me in ever-increasing degree during those years, paralleling my generally maturing outlook. / This concert- like the one given in honor of Leopold Auer in the twenties at Carnegie Hall- was one of those once-in-a-lifetime occasions at which all concerned, public and payers alike, are ready and even eager for the unusual and unorthodox. The program listed all four of the Hubay concerti: one played by Hubay himself, and the three others by the three then most widely travelled virtuosi from his school- Franz von Vecsey, who ever since 1904 had been covering himself with glory; Steffy Geyer, an outstanding woman violinist who now lives and teaches in Switzerland; and myself. Vecsey’s choice was the Concerto in G minor, No. 3, which Efrem Zimbalist has played in this country to Hubay’s often-voiced delight; Steffy Geyer’s, the Concerto all’antica; and mine, the E Major Concerto, No. 2, the first performance of which I had heard Hubay give some years previously. Hubay showed his youthful mettle in the first concerto, subtitled Concerto Romantique. To my barely sixteen years, his fifty seemed almost Methusalean and his performance correspondingly astonishingly youthful.
