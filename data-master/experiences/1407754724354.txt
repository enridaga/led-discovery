At Chappell I had room in the Privy Seale pew with other gentlemen, and there heard Dr. Killigrew preach...; the Anthemne was good after sermon, being the 51 psalme - made for five voices by one of Capt. Cookes boys, a pretty boy - and they say there are four or five of them that can do as much. And here I first perceived that the King is a little Musicall, and kept good time with his hand all along the Anthem.
