<p>Please tell Bantock that I shall be coming on Dec. 9th by the train leaving Euston at 2.30 p.m. - arriving B'ham at 4.30 p.m. He seems to imagine that I consider the Wood Variations I played the other night to be something important. Not at all! I quite agree with his judgment of them - but none the less they are better than somethings one is obliged to listen to -&nbsp;</p>
