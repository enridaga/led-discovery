<p>In aft Mum &amp; I go to Philarmonic Orch. concert at Music Verein - Knappertsbusch conducts. Not first-rate, &amp; terribly affected and extravagant in detail, &amp; uncontrolled. But does some things well. The audience went mad over the Bruckner 4th Symphony - why, I cannot imagine, as I find it a dismal work, with very very few redeeming patches. Certainly the orch. played it and the Tschaikov. Pathetic, which followed, magnificently - I have never heard such string playing or such horn tone, or many other details. But I felt they were being so wasted on this frantically boring Bruckner stuff.&nbsp;</p>
