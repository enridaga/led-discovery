I was very much pleased with this music, after playing it on the piano from a copy of the score; the orchestral performance has completely justified all the hopes raised in my mind by that first examination. The music is flowing and melodious, the instrumentation effective, and there is abundance of dramatic force; the artists, one and all, sang 'con amore' - nay, with positive enthusiasm. I think this composer has a great future before him.
