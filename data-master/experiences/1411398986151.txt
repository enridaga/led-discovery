There was sometimes soundless criticism at the Empire [Theatre, Glasgow]. I recall a night when a soprano was doing her act. She was not in very good voice — possibly she had a cold. When she got to her second number I saw a gentleman in the stalls produce his evening paper and proceed to read it until the lady’s act was finished. I can well imagine the dreadful effect this had on the unfortunate soprano.
