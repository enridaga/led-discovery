<p>The particular star at this concert was the celebrated pianist, Madame Annette Essipoff, who then made her first appearance in England and achieved a stupendous success in Chopin's E minor Concerto. She was recommended to me by Dr. Hans von Biilow, from St. Petersburg, as a "she star," and on that recommendation I engaged her at once. She was a pupil of Professor Leschetizsky of St. Petersburg, and became his wife. Her playing was delightful; rarely have I heard better, and she played with intense feeling. The audience were delighted, and I engaged her at once for the next concert. She was a most attractive-looking woman, with a beautiful complexion and very sweet smile in fact, I hardly ever saw a more fascinating-looking pianist.</p>
