<p>There were in the institute about ten large&nbsp;rooms, the entire furniture of which consisted&nbsp;of four, six, or even eight grand pianofortes,&nbsp;placed in dovetailed fashion, before each of&nbsp;which there would, at lesson time, sit a little&nbsp;pupil, and those four or six or eight girls and&nbsp;boys had to play, simultaneously, the same&nbsp;exercises and pieces to the ticking of a Maelzel&nbsp;metronome, the teacher going from pupil to&nbsp;pupil, noting the application of the fingers, the&nbsp;position of the hands, encouraging, scolding,&nbsp;as the case might be, and putting down the&nbsp;marks in each pupil's little record book which every Saturday had to be taken home to be&nbsp;shown to the parents and signed by one of&nbsp;them. To that school which, by the way, was&nbsp;also responsible for the primary musical education of that excellent pianist Mme. Haas, my&nbsp;father and mother, who had a deep love and&nbsp;feeling for music, though practical musicians&nbsp;only in a very modest way, with voice and&nbsp;guitar, sent me when I was just five years old.</p>
