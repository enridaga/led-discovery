Overture excellent, full of passion; choruses characteristic, the whole vocal part passionately felt, although not strikingly developed. There is a want of intelligible, flowing, rhythmical melody; I am one of Schumann's worshippers, but cannot conceal from myself this weakness. We applauded enthusiastically, and called him forward at the end, but there was not a single 'encore.'
