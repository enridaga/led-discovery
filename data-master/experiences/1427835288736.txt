<p>When they [musicologists] listened to The Nose and Katerina Izmailova, they try to find Wozzeck, and Wozzeck has absolutely nothing to do with them. I liked that opera very much and I never missed a performance when it played in Leningrad, and there were eight or nine performances before Wozzeck was removed from the repertory. The pretext was the same one they used with my Nose&ndash;that it was too hard for the singers to stay in condition and they needed too many rehearsals, and the masses weren&rsquo;t exactly beating down the doors to make it worthwhile. /</p>
