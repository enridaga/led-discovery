I came with a group from school to the Saturday morning Robert Mayer concerts, regularly for several years. Having been taken to the Albert Hall to concerts as a young child, the contrast of the amazing newness of the Festival Hall's design was overwhelming. I heard a range of modern music; Britten, Malcolm Arnold, Vaughan Williams, as well as the classical repertoire. It inspired in me a love of modernity in all its forms!
