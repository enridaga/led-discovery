What an interesting and gifted family the Kembles! Charles Kemble, for so many years one of the chief glories of the English stage, has two daughters - the eldest, Mrs. Butler (illustrious in her maiden days as Fanny Kemble), and the youngest Adelaide, gifted with a glorious voice, which she uses with equal success in Italian bravuras, German Lieder, or old classical music. She is so thoroughly versed in languages that when she sings you can fancy you are listening to an Italian, French, or German; she is gifted with an extraordinary musical memory.
