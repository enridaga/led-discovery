H. and I go every day about 6 o’clock to the church, which we have to ourselves, and have arranged a little service. I play and sing some hymns or bits of Beethoven. The harmonium isn’t bad, only I have so little the habit of playing an organ that I forget the pedals sometimes, and then the music stops with a sort of wheeze. I always finish with the evening hymn: “Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,” “God save the King,” and the Russian hymn. I don’t dare play the “Marseillaise” in the church. It would upset the curé dreadfully, and yet it is too bad not to play sometimes for our soldiers. The next time any one goes to Mamers I will ask them to bring me back the famous marche of “Sambre et Meuse,” which our troops love to march to.
