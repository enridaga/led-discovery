<p>In March 1999 I was in London for the 10th time and went to the Royal Festival Hall to hear the Bach "St. Matthew Passion". It was a wonderful performance, and at the intermission everyone had picnic tables laid out. A wonderful idea and something to look forward to each year.&nbsp; I was in London in 2004 and went to hear the Philharmonia 4 times.&nbsp; I am returning for 4 weeks this year and will miss the Hall. Perhaps when it is reopened I will be able to attend again.</p>
