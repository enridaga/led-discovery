<p>Listen to a flabbergasting show of Act III of G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung from Bayreuth. Leider &amp; Max Lorenz (Siegfried) were worthy of the music, &amp; Elmendorff rose to the occasion magnificently - I have never heard the Funeral March better played - the rhythm so strict &amp; stern. Atmospherics were troublesome, but could not upset my enjoyment of the work.&nbsp;</p>
