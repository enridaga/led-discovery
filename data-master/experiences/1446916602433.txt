<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I played with the National Children's Orchestra here in one of the Stilgoe concerts - what a fantastic experience.&nbsp; Playing in the great acoustic to a full hall (in a fantastic yellow t-shirt!) was such an uplifting experience - I was one of the lucky ones chosen to mix with the children in the foyer, teaching them the trumpet!&nbsp; This hall had such a relaxed vibe to it, whenever I had lunch in London I came here to listen to the foyer music - I am sure this will continue long into the future!</p>
