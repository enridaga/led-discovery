<pre>After reaping a golden harvest, in the fields of Thespis, we took leave of <br />Scotland, and agreed, on our way to London, to play two nights at Newcastle. <br />Stephen Kemble was the manager, who received us kindly, and we had two <br />overflowing audiences. It was at Newcastle, I first had the pleasure of meeting <br />that genuine child of Momus, Liston; and, on my return to London, strongly 
recommended Messrs. Sheridan and Richardson to engage him for Drury Lane : but <br />procrastination was their motto ; and it is to George (Dolman's discernment, that <br />the public are indebted for the invaluable acquisition of Listen's unrivalled <br />talents to the London stage: he made his first appearance in Zekiel Homespun, in <br />the "Heir at Law," at the Haymarket Theatre (14th June, 1805).
