<p class="MsoNormal">In these classic soirees of ours, we have played every composition for strings worth playing; and have given also special sets of concerts where only the most modern works, like the Brahms sextettes, Bruch, Goldmark, and Rubinstein, were played. We also gave for many seasons the so-called popular Saturday night concerts; for which we secured other artists to play septettes, octettes, and nonettes of mixed wind and string instruments. Nearly every pianist of distinction played repeatedly with us; among them were Mr. William Scharfenberg, Otto Dresel, Ernst Perabo, J. C. D. Parker, B. J. Lang, Hugo Leonard, Gustav Satter, J. Trenkle, John L. Hatton, and Miss Fay (now Mrs. Sherwood).</p>

One was Mile. Caroline Lehman, sister of our flute player, who came from Copenhagen and sang with us two seasons. Other vocal assistants were Mrs. J. H. Long, Mrs. Went worth, Mrs. Harwood, Miss Addie S. Ryan, Mrs. H. M. Smith, Adelaide Phillips, and Annie Louise Cary&mdash;all good singers. I think it can be safely said that the Mendelssohn Quintette Club has done its share in cultivating a taste for music, especially chamber music.</span></p>
