<p>Ev. went to 'Iesu'. A strange time - Rev. Williams Penmorfa... Heavy, stodgy, big coarse, painfully strenuous voice which gradually crescendoed into a painful continuous shout. In the seat he spoke for 4 minutes quietly &amp; far more effectively than the whole of the sermon. The singing good but, organ too strong. Starting note given &amp; the precentor's voice a little to "previous" at beginning of each verse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sequence starting:</p>
<p>Organ note</p>
<p>Precentor hitting the first note</p>
<p>Congregation stand</p>
<p>Absolutely no reason for 1 &amp; 2.</p>
