On being introduced to Kalkbrenner he invites me to play something. Willy nilly, not having heard him beforehand but knowing how Herz plays, I sit down at the piano, having put aside every shred of conceit. I played my E minor Concerto which the 
Rhinelanders the Lindpainters, Bergs, Stunzes and all Bavaria could not praise highly enough. I surprised M. Kalkbrenner, who at once questioned me as to whether I was a pupil of Field, for he found that I have the style of Cramer and the touch of Field. I was terribly pleased to hear that and even more pleased when Kalkbrenner took his seat at the piano to show off to me but got lost and had to stop. But you should have heard how he took the repeat I never imagined anything like it. From that time we have been seeing each other daily, either at his house or mine, and now that he has got to know me well he proposes that I should become his pupil for three years.
