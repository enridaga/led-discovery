Composition lesson at 10.0. Ireland is quite pleased with my latest carol. Go to Augeners & Chesters for Brahms op 21. variations & Prokofiev op. 12 prelude for pft. study. Practice in afternoon. No madrigals. Walk with Hendersons after tea. Go to Chamber Concert at R.C.M. 8.15. In a long programme Helen Perkin (Ireland's star & best comp. pupil) plays her own Ballade for pft. V. competant with only about 1 bit of original work. Too long, I thought, for material. Beethoven A min (op 132) quartet, tolerably played. Divine Work! as also is Brahms G maj vln sonata.
