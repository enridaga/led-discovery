<p>I met Liszt again in London on Saturday, April 3rd, 1886, when he came over to England as the guest of Mr. Henry Littleton, head of the firm of Novello &amp; Co. Liszt arrived at Westwood House, Sydenham, very late in the evening and very tired, and was received by a distinguished company of between three and four hundred people who had been specially invited to meet him. He had come over to hear his oratorio, <em>Saint Elizabeth</em>, performed at St. James's Hall on April 6th under the direction of Sir Alexander Mackenzie. I went to hear the performance, and noticed that Liszt occasionally fell asleep, but woke up at hearing the great applause that came at the end of each important part.</p>
