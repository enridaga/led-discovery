I saw Berlioz' "Damnation of Faust" at the Op√©ra - at least, I could see very little of the stage but I had a fine bird's-eye view of two trombone players who seemed to be having a fiery political argument whenever they had a few bars' rest. At one point they even left the pit, presumable to settle their differences once and for all.
