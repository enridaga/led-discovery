<p>&hellip;Jervis has an excellent radio-gram, and he claims to like listening to me practising the violin (it must have been the novelty of the noise), but I have plenty of time to practise while he is out&hellip;there is the possibility of my storing someone&rsquo; [sic] quite good piano in my rooms and having the use of it&hellip;. At present I&rsquo;m listening to a recording of Haydn&rsquo;s symphony no. 94 on the radiogram ---- the symphony over we now listen to a recording of Casals playing Dvorak&rsquo;s cello concerto&hellip;.</p>
