<pre>On the 29th of April, 1800, Miss Baillie's play of "De Montfort" was produced at <br />Drury Lane Theatre. I composed the music: the scenery was magnificent; the <br />cathedral scene, painted by Capon, was a chef-d'oeuvre; it had also the support 
of excellent acting. Mr. Kemble took every pains in getting it up, but it would <br />not suit the public taste, and was withdrawn after a few nights.</pre>
