Every day I would hear my father playing the piano or the organ. There were his songs and church music and compositions of the masters. He took me to all the services at the church â€“ the Gregorian chant, the chorals and the organ voluntaries became part of my daily life. And then, too, there were always the wonderful sounds of nature, the sound of the sea, the sound of the wind moving through the trees, the delicate singing of the birds, the infinitely varied melody of the human voice, not only in song but in speech. What a wealth of music! It sustained and nourished me.
