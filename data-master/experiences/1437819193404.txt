LULLI was a cook, but the COMTE DE NOGENT, hearing him play in the kitchen, brought him straight to MADAME DE MONTPENSIER, and he was soon afterwards installed as Court musician to Louis XIV. The "Petits Violons du Roi" the name of a Court band organised by LULLI soon became famous. LULLI himself was not only a good cook and fine fiddler, but an excellent actor and a merry fellow to boot. </span></p>
