<p>The general rehearsal for Koussevitzky's final concert of the series, devoted to Stravinsky. However, it was all old stuff! There's fashion for you. In fact for me there was one novelty:&nbsp;<em>Ragtime</em>, composed six years ago but I had never heard it. Ten instruments, conducted by Stravinsky (who is getting much better at conducting: he did not conduct&nbsp;<em>Ragtime</em> so much as dance it). Not that interesting a piece.</p>
