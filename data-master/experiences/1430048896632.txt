One hour after our arrival in Moscow we are guests of the Bolshoi Ballet. It is the young troupe--it is wonderful. Next day when we eventually arrive in Leningrad, we are met by a big band that marches across the airfield toward us playing Dixieland jazz, with trombones sliding, clarinets smearing off, and all the musicians blowing in the traditional manner.
