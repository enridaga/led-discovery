One work, however, in the cellist’s repertory, Brahms’s first sonata, the E minor, baffled even Casals in one respect. With all his art he could not help making the cello growl and grumble in the opening bars of the last movement; and the blame must be laid to Brahms’s charge. Brahms misjudged the medium when he wrote the fugue at that low pitch. (This is one reason why I took it on myself to arrange the sonata for viola, which of course is an octave higher, and therefore these incoherent growls were eliminated.) I heard Casals play the work in 1945 at Chelsea Town Hall with Gerald Moore as a pianist. I happened to know that there had not been time, on the eve of the concert, for more than one skip through the work. Yet the ensemble was excellent. But then Gerald Moore is astoundingly assimilative, as well as knowing the string repertory intimately.
