Daddy and I went at noon to see the 2nd Grenadier Guards march past Buckingham Palace on their way to who knows where? The Prince of Wales has been attached to the 1st Battalion. The Prince, with the King, Queen, Princess Mary and Queen Alexandra, were in the courtyard before the Palace, watching the march past.
    The crowds outside must have numbered five or six thousand. A great column of these splendid fellows filed past to the strains of The British Grenadiers. Everyone was too affected, I think, to cheer. It was a very stirring sight, but we are getting used now to seeing our regiments go by. Every day we have them trooping down the Fulham Road at the end of our street, bands and pipes playing and followed by a crowd.
