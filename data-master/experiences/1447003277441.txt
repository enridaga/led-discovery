<p>This morning I &amp; my wife &amp; Son in a Pearson&rsquo;s Chaise Set out early [...] &amp; got to Hull to Miss Cayley&rsquo;s; we all went together to the High Church to the Selection of Sacred Music. Mrs Billington, Mr Harrison &amp; Miss Cantilo sung delightfully indeed. The instrumental Band was not I think quite so good as when we had Oratorios at the Minster 20 years ago; but the Voices were so much superior that it was on the whole much preferable. My wife &amp; I sat in Side Gallery front seat &amp; after 1st act in East Gallery. The &lt;music...?&gt; organ with the Coronation anthem. I think I never heard any man sing so well as Harrison such chaste Simplicity, Taste, Delicacy, inexpressibly fine. Miss Cantelo sung charmingly especially &ldquo;He was Eyes to the Blind&rdquo; a sweet unaffected modest Singer &amp; hav[e] such a fine Swell, Mrs Billington had such Sweetness, Delicacy &amp; Judgement as can not be described. Sale, I dont like so well as Meredith &amp; I did not like Pearson at all. The Funeral Anthem was very fine. [...] Charming music!&nbsp;</p>
