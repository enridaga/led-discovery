Mme Viardot also told me she would visit you as she passes through your town. She sang me a Spanish song she has composed one she wrote in Vienna last year; she promised she would sing it to you. I am very fond of it and I doubt whether one could hear or think of anything better of its kind. This song will bring you and me together. I have always listened to it with rapturous pleasure.
