<pre>On the 13th December, 1806, Madame Catalani, and Signor Siboni, made their <br />debut in the serious opera of "La Semiramide." Madame Catalani's 
personification of Semiramide was a powerful effort of the scenic art she <br />looked beautiful, and a queen ; her songs were given in a manner which 
electrified her audience ; she possesses, in truth, what the Italians call the <br />novanta niove, i.e. the ninety-nine. When a singer possesses a superior fine <br />voice, the Italians say, he, or she, has got the ninety-nine points out of the <br />hundred, to make a fine singer. Her reception, by a crowded audience, was <br />enthusiastic. Siboni, in addition to a fine tenor voice, and a commanding figure, <br />was a tasteful singer, and a good musician ; his reception was also very <br />flattering.</pre>
