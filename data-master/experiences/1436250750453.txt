<p>In 1878 Senor Pablo Sarasate played Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto, and the "Rondo Capriccioso" by Saint-Saens. The last movement of the Mendelssohn Concerto he played at lightning speed, but every note came out most clearly. Sarasate was a most modest man, and gave himself no airs. His playing was always a great treat to listen to, and at this concert it was received with the greatest enthusiasm.</p>
