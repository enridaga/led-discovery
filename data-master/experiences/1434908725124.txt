<p>Carlo-Maria Giulini, had first appeared in May 1958 to conduct Verdi's "Don Carlos" in the most splendidly elegant production by Luigi Visconti with Tito Gobbi as Rodrigo and Boris Christoff as Philip II. Giulini, like Kempe, had very little English at first, he would attract our attention by saying gently: "My gentlemen..." I felt at once that this was how Verdi should be played, with a wonderful springing rhythm and singing quality - "sempre cantare" he would say and even in the staccato passages would give the apparently contradictory instruction: "Staccato - ma sempre legato" which somehow we understand quite easily!</p>
