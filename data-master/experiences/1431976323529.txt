Similar social enjoyments were mine in the hospitable Casa Placci–a family with which I was permitted to form a lasting and affectionate friendship–noted for its artistic gatherings attended by European celebrities. There I passed an evening with Salvini, who occasionally emerged from his retirement to delight Florentine audiences. In Edinburgh I had seen Otello, and his first performance of Macbetto in this country, and was present at what I believe to have been his last appearance on any stage, when he gave a magnificent representation of Il Re Lear in the Florentine theatre named after himself. The old actor's voice out-thundered the thunder Heath scenes, leaving the impression that it could do more–if it liked!
