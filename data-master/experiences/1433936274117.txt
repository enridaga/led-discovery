<p>Letter from Bunsen to his wife, The Hotel Baur, Zurich: 5th July, 1840 - On the preceding evening, in the garden of Frau Rosine Burckhardt, groups had formed for more close acquaintance ; now that all had participated in such abundance of interest and communication, none seemed to be strangers to each other. Herein an arbour, there on a grass-plot, a few or more collected to join in a hymn, or hear the communications of a speaker ; and sounds of softened harmony or of chastened cheerfulness pervaded the garden ; children played all around, without creating any disturbance ; there is here no question as to admission, no check or exclusion, and the soft evening air, the blue sky, the verdure and flowers seemed to blend with the social joy and melody.</p>
