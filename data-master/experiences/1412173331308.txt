I know that the lyrics of some of my favourite bands in the seventies actually mean something. Think about Neil Young’s song ‘Southern Man’ on his album ‘After the Gold Rush’, which was released in 1970. The whole thing is about racism in the Deep South. Many singers explored contemporary political issues in their music; these songs were designed to challenge listeners and make them think. This is not at all what modern music provides for teenagers today. The majority of the time, all they get now is a strong beat delivered at a high volume.
