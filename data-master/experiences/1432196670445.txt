At one of our crowded meetings in the Free Assembly Hall in Edinburgh, Mr. Moody called to the platform Lord Overtoun, who changed the meeting into a memorial service for King Edward's eldest son, the Duke of Clarence, who had recently died. After a number of addresses had been made by ministers and others, Lord Overtoun asked a member of my choir, Miss Jane Darling, if she had any song suitable to the occasion. I had gone to Dunfermline to commence meetings there. Miss Darling took her seat at my little organ and sang in the most touching and pathetic manner the hymn, " Some Time we'll Understand." At the conclusion of the meeting Lord Overtoun sent a dispatch to Queen Alexandra, then Princess of Wales, including in the message three of the verses of the hymn. The same evening he received a dispatch from her, thanking him for the verses. A few days later Miss Darling had the hymn beautifully engrossed upon parchment and forwarded it to the Princess.
