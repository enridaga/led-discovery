<pre>My next musical production at Drury Lane, was "Cinderella ; or, the <br />Glass Slipper." The piece was written by a Mr. James ; the story was well 
told in action, and the poetry of the songs appropriate. I was rather fortunate <br />in composing the music. The scenery, machinery, and decorations, were profusely <br />splendid ; and nothing could surpass the fine acting of Miss Decamp, as <br />Cinderella. It was produced in January 1804, and performed, daring its first <br />season, fifty-one nights. </pre>
