Last night Lee Hoiby played us his opera which only confirms my new convictions about the overall silliness of the genre. Why bother to sing such exposition as: the chamber pot has disappeared? Dwight Fisk fingered a continual elaborate improvisation as literal background to the text. His music wilted into descriptive padding but was funny because of it. Which is not to denigrate Lee, who's seriously in spite of it, and whose talent is singular and necessary. Yet jealously I see these boys, all younger than I, pulling down plump commissions while I go on living on $45 a week - too lazy to be untrue to myself.
