<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">Some years ago I went out of sheer curiosity to hear the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Huguenots</em>. I hated the whole thing from beginning to end, though I tried hard to recapture the mood in which I had first heard it as a child. But it was dead and gone. I couldn&rsquo;t even raise its ghost. Had I succeeded let us hope it would have frightened me! For, anything more alarming to a musician than to find that he or she was genuinely admiring that sort of music again, I cannot imagine!</p>
