<p>When a mere stripling of&nbsp;nineteen, he [Johann Strauss] contrived to get together a scratch orchestra&nbsp;of young players who had sufficient faith in his talent&nbsp;and energy to elect him their leader, and started from Vienna upon a concert-tour through Transylvania and Roumania. The slender fund with which this joyous&nbsp;company set out on its wild expedition was soon exhausted, and at Fancsova, a small town in the Lower&nbsp;Banat (situate on the left bank of the Danube and&nbsp;famous, of late years, for the excellence of its beer),&nbsp;Strauss and his merry men found themselves one fine&nbsp;morning without a kreuzer in their collective pockets.&nbsp;What was to be done? The band performed a serenade&nbsp;under the mayor's bedroom windows, and its leader succeeded in borrowing from that functionary a sum sufficient to purchase the immediate necessaries of life, but&nbsp;only on condition that the loan should be repaid out of&nbsp;the proceeds of certain concerts to be given in Pancsova&nbsp;itself.&nbsp;</p>
