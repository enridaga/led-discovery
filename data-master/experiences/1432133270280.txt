The concert was in aid of the Red Cross and was packed. As I began the beautiful Bach Chorale with Anthony Bernard, whom I had met in England, had arranged for me, I felt as though I was in a dream and I could hardly see the audience. It was really quite a delicious sensation, for all pain had left me and I was as if dreaming. I was however brought back to earth somewhat when I noticed that the liquid powder was coming off and that I was half white, half-bruised-looking yellow!
