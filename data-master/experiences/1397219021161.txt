Our whole delightful day has been and gone and today C[hristie] and I are at work again but feeling much refreshed, in mind at least, for our little holiday. It has really made a wonderful difference and I wish whole days off might come oftener.

We started away for our journeying fairly early, feeling we must get away as soon as possible and enjoy our complete freedom.... Got to Eu safely and wandered round the market, delightfully foreign in atmosphere, full of life and colours. Then we went into the fine, old cathedral and sat listening to a young priest play the organ.
