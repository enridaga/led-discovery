<p>This season [in 1795] Miss Mellon made her first appearance. Mr. Sheridan had seen her the previous season at Stafford, where she was acting ; she was much patronised at that place by the leading families, particularly by Mr. Horton, an intimate electioneering friend of Mr. Sheridan's. She was engaged at Drury Lane, and proved herself a valuable acquisition to our dramatic corps. She was a handsome girl, and much esteemed ; and in gratitude, I feel called upon to say, that, both as Miss Mellon and Mrs. Coutts, I have received from her the most marked and friendly attentions ; and am happy to have it in my power, thus publicly, to express my acknowledgments.</p>
