Carl Friedberg, the partner of my scheduled sonata recital, was naturally unable to travel to Berlin from Cologne where he was then living, but I went through with my project nevertheless, improvising the program with the pianist Frau Kwast-Hodapp, then greatly admired in Central Europe. As all means of intracity communication were suspended- whether buses, trolley cars, or taxis â€“ and as electricity was not functioning either, we played our Beethoven, Brahms, and Schubert to a bare few dozen of the faithful from a candle-lit platform that was, I must admit, most 'stimmunsgsvoll' and congenial to the chamber music we were playing.
