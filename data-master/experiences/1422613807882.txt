I did feel quiet, perhaps it is because of the work, I am tired of that place... I was just in the humour for music, so I had a good long practice, then I tried to prepare the lesson for Eliza's class on Sunday, I feel afraid of taking it. Lily came for me tonight, we went on the course, the band played some nice tunes.
