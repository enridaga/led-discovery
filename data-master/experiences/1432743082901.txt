One of the most notable things I remember at this time in my musical experience was being allowed to sit with the organist, Dr. Hopkins, at Exeter Hall, during a performance of "Elijah" in which Madame Goldschmidt (Jenny Lind) sang, and Mr.
Otto Goldschmidt, her husband (in after years one of my dearest friends), conducted. I can still recall the fire and expression which the great singer put
into the music.
