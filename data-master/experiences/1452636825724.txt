<p>It was in the summer of that same year that,&nbsp;at a meeting of the " Allgemeine Tonk&uuml;nstler-&nbsp;Verein " (General Tone- Artists' Union), held at&nbsp;Altenburg in Saxony, I first met that wonderfully fascinating man Franz Liszt, in some of&nbsp;whose works, produced on that occasion, I&nbsp;had to sing the bass soli. Liszt was beyond&nbsp;expectation kind to me, and only too readily&nbsp;I accepted his most cordial invitation to visit&nbsp;him at his home in Weimar after the meeting... on one of those occasions, for&nbsp;instance, it was my good luck not only to see&nbsp;but also to hear in that historical music-room,&nbsp;besides the illustrious host himself, no fewer&nbsp;and no lesser stars than Anton Rubinstein,&nbsp;Carl Tausig, and Hans von B&uuml;low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here there were the four greatest pianists&nbsp;of the time together, not in a vast concert hall,&nbsp;but in a small private room, in their shirt-sleeves, so to say, enabling us privileged fellow-&nbsp;guests to compare, not from memory or&nbsp;distance, but by immediate impression, within&nbsp;the compass of an hour or so, the stupendous&nbsp;power of a Rubinstein with the polished infallibility of a Tausig, the irreproachable classicism of a B&uuml;low with the enchanting grace and&nbsp;romanticism of a Liszt. They are gone, all&nbsp;those four great ones, but the memory of that&nbsp;Sunday morning is more real, more living to&nbsp;me to - day than any reproduction of their&nbsp;playing could be by the wonderfully ingenious&nbsp;musical inventions of this electric age.</p>
