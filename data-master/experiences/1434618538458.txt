As for Debussyâ€™s Jeux, I clearly remember having seen it, but I cannot be sure whether at the dress rehearsal or on the first night. I very much like the music, which Debussy had already played to me on the piano. How well that man played! The animation and vivacity of the score merited a warmer reception than it got from the public. My mind is a complete blank with regard to its choreography.
