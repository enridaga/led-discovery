Today was chiefly remarkable for a concert, held to get some money for the Fund for British Prisoners in Germany.... The 13th Battalion Canadian Scottish pipers played in the interval - ten minutes without a break. It was a glorious noise of bagpipes and drums, and they brought with them their regimental mascot - a goat wearing a handsome silver collar. While they were making that deafening noise, it walked calmly among them, sniffing them and eating little bits of dust. The first half was the Canadian Minstrels, then after the interval ‘The Casualties’ did the rest. They were excellent - a troop consisting chiefly of orderlies got up by Captain McKenzie at No. 2 Casualty Clearing Station. At the end we sang the ‘Marseillaise’ then ‘God Save the King’. As soon as the first chord for our National Anthem was struck, every man in the place stiffened and stood to attention and we all sang it with great gusto.
