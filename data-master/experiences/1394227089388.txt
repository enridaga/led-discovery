From hence we resum'd out voyage in the treckscuyte to Leyden, where I first observ'd the predilection of the Dutch for chimes of carillons, the bells for which (independent of & in addition to those larger bells used for ringing, tolling etc.) were placed on the outside of the spires, steeples etc. in litle niches or recesses adapted to them, so that whenever they played one co'd see the hammers at work upon the bells, with which I was much amus'd.
