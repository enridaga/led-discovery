<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Dear Gustav</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">I feel I want to write &amp; put down (chiefly for my own benefit) why I felt vaguely disappointed after the Phil (so you need not read this.) Not perhaps disappointed - I felt cold admiration - but did not want to get up &amp; embrace everyone &amp; then get drunk like I did after the H of J [Hymn of Jesus]. I think it is only because it&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a new work &amp; I am more slowly moving than I used to be &amp; it's got to soak in.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">But first I want to set down the bits where I was all there, viz. the opening (a great surprize to me)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">Dorothy [Silk]'s first solo,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">the orchestral end of the scherzo,</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">the two lovely tunes in the Finale.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Then again I've come to the conclusion that the Leeds Chorus <em>CANNOT SING</em> - the Bacchus Chorus sounded like an Oratorio.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">As to the Grecian Urn it was <em>pattered</em> not sung &ndash; No phrasing &amp; no legato &ndash; If only the B.C. [Bach Choir] c<sup>d</sup> sing in tune or Morley had any tenors we c<sup>d</sup> show them how to do it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">In the scherzo they made the words sound so <em>common</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">I couldn't bear to think that I was going to drift apart from you musically speaking. (If I do, who shall I have to crib from?) &ndash; I don't believe it is so &ndash; so I shall live in faith till I have heard it again several times &amp; then I shall find out what a bloody fool I was not to see it all first time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-indent: 36.0pt;">Forgive me this rigmarole - but I wanted to get it off my chest.</p>
