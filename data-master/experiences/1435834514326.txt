<p>Then there was the sound of Lester [Young] on the old Basie records--real beautiful tenor saxophone sound, pure sound. That's it. For alto too. Pure sound. How many people he's influenced, how many lives! Because he is definitely the basis of everything that's happened. And his rhythmic approach--complex in it's simplicity. How can you analyze it? Shall we tag some words on it? Call it "polyrhythmic"?</p>
