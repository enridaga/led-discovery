<p>This singer [Velluti] is no longer young, and his voice is in decay. It seems to have had considerable compass, but has failed (which is extraordinary) in its middle tones, many of which are harsh and grating to the ear. Some of his upper notes are still exquisitely sweet, and he frequently dwells on, swells, and diminishes them with delightful effect. His lower notes too are full and mellow, and he displays considerable art in descending from the one to the other by passages ingeniously contrived to avoid those which he knows to be defective. His manner is florid without extravagance, his embellishments (many of which were new to me) tasteful and neatly executed. His general style is the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">grazioso</em>, with infinite delicacy and a great deal of expression, but never rising to the grand, simple, and dignified <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">cantabile</em> of the old school, still less to the least approach towards the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">bravura</em>. He evidently has no other, therefore there is a great want of variety in his performance, as well as a total deficiency of force and spirit.</p>
