This led to the three performances under his [Busoni] direction – in Berlin, Paris, and London- which are among my most cherished memories, and which in turn resulted in what Busoni’s first biographer, Leichtentritt, termed a resurrection of this almost forgotten work. And what concerts those were!/So it was in sometimes inadequate physical surroundings that the performances were presented. In Paris, for instance, at the now defunct Concerts Sechiari (in a suburban theatre) Busoni not only conducted his own works (the raison d’être of the concert!) but also a Mozart symphony, and Liszt’s 'Mazeppa', besides playing the piano. But what did the setting of a concert matter when the audience included d’Annunzio and Rainer Maria Rilke, musicians of such varied types as Widor and Moszkowski, painters and journalists, all of whom made a Busoni concert the unique thing it came to mean!
