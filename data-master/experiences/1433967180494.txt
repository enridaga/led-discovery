I set off early on the Sunday morning to be present at high mass in the cathedral at Antwerp...At the moment we entered not less than a hundred priests, monks and friars, with the whole population of Antwerp, were pacing round the exterior aisles of the church, many carrying large burning wax candles. The orchestra and organ were not used in this ceremony ; nothing but the voices, accompanied with a couple of serpents, chanting some gloomy strain of John de Muris. The scene was gorgeous and imposing.
