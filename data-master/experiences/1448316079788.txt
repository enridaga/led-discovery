<p>No lover of the organ should pass through Dresden without hearing the celebrated John Schneider. He is an organist of the old school, and probably no one ever lived who had a greater command of the instrument. We made up a little party, and having previously called on Herr Schneider, went by appointment to the Sophrine-Kirche, (the church of which he is the organist,) where we had the pleasure of hearing him for a little more than an hour. He played five of the fugues of John Sebastian Bach &mdash; he cares not to play other music. Bach is his musical Bible, and he has read him so much that he has ceased to take pleasure in inferior or uninspired writers. Bach is musical truth, unmixed with error; it is really interesting to see with what enthusiasm his works are spoken of, played, and heard by the German Musicians. Herr Schneider used no fancy stops, made no see-sawings with the swell, no contrasts of reeds and dulcianas, no high-diddle-diddles in his playing. His appeal is always to the intellectual musician. His great point of excellence, we suppose, is his legato touch, by which the chords are bound together, or melted into one continuous flow of harmony.</p>
