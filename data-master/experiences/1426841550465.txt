I have played at the Duchess of Sutherland's in the presence of the Queen, Prince Albert, the Prince of Prussia, Wellington and all the cream of the Garter, on the occasion of a christening (a select gathering of eighty persons). They also had that evening Lablache, Mario and Tamburini. Her Majesty spoke a few very gracious words to me. I doubt, however, whether I shall be playing at Court, as a period of Court-mourning, lasting until the 22nd or 24th, has just begun for one of Her Majesty's 
aunts [Princess Sophia].
