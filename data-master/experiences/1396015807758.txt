I write & practise (10.40-12.40) in morning. Go to College in afternoon and have a v. depressing time. Benjamin although quite pleased, says that I am not built for a solo pianist - how I am going to make my pennies Heaven only knows. Then I discover that the Easter term begins on Jan 8th (instead of as I expected Jan 22nd). Go to Kensington Town Hall to Festival at 7.0. The Carlyle singers are 1st in their lot (we didn't sing too badly, I think, because the other choirs weren't at all bad). After until 10.15 combined rehearsal under R.V. Williams.
