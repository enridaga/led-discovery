On the first evening the only work by a foreign composer admitted to our programme was given by special request–Elijah. That Mendelssohn's masterpiece still awaited a premiere anywhere in 1903, and that I should be privileged to conduct it both amazed and gratified me. Upwards of 2,000 attended that concert, and among the audience at the succeeding matinée were 1,000 school children from whom our efforts seemed to meet with approbation. Some of them nudged each other whenever Miss Ethel Wood indulged in a flight into the upper register, and become positively apoplectic with suppressed glee at the skirl of the bagpipes in The Little Minister music. Passing from gay to grave, The Death of Minnehaha was listened to by 4,000 adults on the same night. The cantata received every justice from the chorus and made a profound effect.
