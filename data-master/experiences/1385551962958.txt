The next night, about twelve of the clocke, he was taken with another fitt, and, in the midle of it, he conccved there was a noyse like ringinge of small bells, with singinge and dancinge, and sometimes both nights a noise of deepe groneing; upon which he called of his wife and asked her if she heard it not, and soe of his man, who answered they did not. He asked them againe and againe if they heard it not; at last lie, his wife, and servant, all heard it give three hevie groones ; at that instant doggs did howle and yell at the windows, as though they would have puld them in peeces.
