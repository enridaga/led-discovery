<p>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">Hamburg literally swarms with theatres and concert rooms. To some of these I repaired in the evening; but there is no music to be heard in these places without eating and drinking </span><span lang="EN-GB"><span lang="EN-GB">yet all these gastronomic proceedings were carried on with such quiet and order that one's enjoyment of the music was scarcely ever marred.</span></span></p>
<p>One of the largest of the second-class theatres (the principal ones being closed at this period of the year) is the &ldquo;Theater der central Halle.<sup>,,</sup> Here (the admission to the stalls being only 4d.) after a drama, which appeared to interest the large audience amazingly, came a concert of rather a peculiar description. Eight ladies appeared on the stage, with their stringed instruments in their hands, and, accompanied by the band, played, on violins and violoncellos, Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo; Wedding March,&rdquo; an overture, and other pieces, with a remark&shy;able taste, precision, and effect, which elicited long and loud applause, the &ldquo; Wedding March &rdquo; being redemanded. The orchestra then played several pieces, and I may here observe how I was struck not only upon this occasion, but also at other times, by the excellent way in which the wood and brass instruments were played ; the tone invariably being softer and more refined than that of similar instruments in most of our own theatrical bands.</p>
