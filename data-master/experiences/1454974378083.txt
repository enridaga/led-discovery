<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">And here I am in Novorossisk. I am deeply moved by the atmosphere on Heroes&rsquo; Square. I have often gone there to listen to the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Chimes</em>. And each time with bated breath I saw people passing over the square stop involuntarily at the Eternal Flame as the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Chimes </em><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>started playing, and listen in silence to the music, reminding them of the city&rsquo;s defenders. It was a great joy for me to see the impression it produced. </span></p>
