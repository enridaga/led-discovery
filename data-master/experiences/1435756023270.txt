<p>On the grounds that if I'm to be critical I should at least know what I'm criticising, and also from fraternal curiosity, I borrow three cassettes from B. &amp; H. Druckman's <em>Vox Humana</em>: being a choral piece, it's hard not to hear what I'd have done with such texts. But again, I'd never have used such tests (apparently in Hebrew and Latin and Sanskrit - why must Americans forever avoid their native tongue?).</p>
