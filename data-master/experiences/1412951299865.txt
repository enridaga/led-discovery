    Durward Lely made his debut in the City Hall on 16th December, 1889, at the Saturday evening concerts. The whole concert was given by the Italian Opera Company. Lely’s great score came when he substituted for his Italian aria the beautiful Scots song, “O a’ the airts the win’ can blaw.”
    The reception opened his eyes to the possibilities of Scottish melodies if sung by a good singer.
