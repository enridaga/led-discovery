<p>Most everybody has heard of Joe Oliver and Louis Armstrong but few ever heard of Mutt Carey in his prime. Mutt Carey, in his day, was equal to Joe Oliver. Mutt is the first trumpet player or cornetist that choked his horn. He used a drinking glass in the bell of his horn, and how he did swing! Mutt wasn't a high-note player; he wasn't as strong as Louis Armstrong or Joe Oliver. Muggsy reminds me a lot of Mutt. Mutt hardly ever played as high as B-Flat or high C; that was out of his range. Mutt had a very mellow tone and a terrific swing. The softer the band played, the better Mutt played. The drummer used sandpaper, there being no wire brushes at that time. You could hear every instrument. They seemed to blend better than the average band nowadays. Whenever the band became noisy, Mutt would look back and sideways and say, "Sh, sh", meaning get down softer. That didn't stop them from swinging. Some cats can't swing soft. Mutt could make many pretty runs and changes. He was strictly gutbucket or barrelhouse. Nothing technical about his playing. Just swinging all the time, pretty diminished chords. He choked his cornet and made it moan like Joe Oliver did later. I never will&nbsp;forget Mutt Carey.</p>
