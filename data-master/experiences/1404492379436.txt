     So it was with us in this nameless village; night found us wrapped in this glowing barn, family and stranger gathered round the long bare table to a smell of woodsmoke, food, and animals…
     Suddenly, one of the sons spotted my rolled-up blanket with the violin sticking out of it. ‘Mùsica! ’ he cried, and went and fetched the bundle and laid it gingerly on the table before me...
     There was nothing else for it. I sat down on the ground and tore drunkenly into an Irish reel. They listened, open-mouthed, unable to make head or tail of it; I might have been playing a Tibetan prayer-wheel.

She sang them innocently, without art, taking breath like a child, often in the middle of a word. Staring blankly before her, without movement or expression, she simply went through each one, then stopped - as though she’d really no idea what the songs were about, only that they were using her to be heard.
