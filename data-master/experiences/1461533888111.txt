<p>Here I am again &amp; glad to be back again I can tell you - I was sorry I did not see more of you - the work I had was quite too much for a man who is accustomed to quietness - The concert turned out far better than I had expected &amp; may be called an artistic success - I was sorry not to have been able to meet you after the concert &amp; gather your impressions - I was overwhelmed by receptions &amp; had to rush away from London -&nbsp;</p>
