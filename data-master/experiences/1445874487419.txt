<p>Walked to Stowey, very dirty [...] Mr Northey when I came from the Pulpit caught me by the hand and thanked me, said it was a most Excellent Sermon.&nbsp; He talked so loud and the congregation who staid for the Sacrament heard, which made me point to the door of the Vestry for it was open.&nbsp; I left him to administer the Sacrament, being obliged to hasten to my own Church which began at two. Got there and we had a good many at Church. Terrible work with the Instruments in the Singing Gallery.</p>
