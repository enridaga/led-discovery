The profound impression made upon a crowded congregation in St. Paul's Cathedral has already been mentioned. An eloquent sermon by the Bishop of London (Honorary Chaplain to the Academy) was admirably suited to the occasion and a largely-augmented choir did fullest justice to the well-chosen music, the selection and direction of which had been entrusted to Dr. Charles Macpherson. The effect of his solemn Te Deum is unforgettable. Our girls in white and scarlet–wearing specially-designed, chic black velvet caps, naval and military uniforms and academic robes–made a brave show of colour, and the unexpected burst of music by the band of the Welsh Guards after the "Amen," as the procession moved slowly down the nave, provided a dignified close to a devotional function unique of its kind.
