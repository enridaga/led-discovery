In the year 1789, I was sent into Norfolk, to collect some outstanding moneys in that county. On arriving at Cambridge, I put up at Gurfog's Hotel, opposite to St. John's-gate, and, having no business to transact there, as soon as I had seen my horse fed (that being the first duty of a traveller), I sallied forth among the colleges, and strolled about, amazed at the magnificence I beheld. As I passed St. Mary's Church, I heard music, and soon found my way into the organ-loft â€” where Dr. Randall, the professor of music, was rehearsing Handel's anthem, 'My heart is inditing in a good matter'. I was charmed, and could not leave till the music had ceased.
