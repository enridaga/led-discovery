Phipps invited me to his house for the night. We duly arrived at his house at 8.30 pm. I was introduced to the Dublin Belles as Mr Roe ‘from the country’, and the piano was set in motion at 10.30 pm, but the music did not suit Phipps’s ear, it was not sweet enough. The keys were duly baptized with the contents of four bottles of Guinness stout by the method of effusion (pity the old piano).
