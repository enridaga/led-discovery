Bobby arrives in aft. & Margorie after tea. Go to Playhouse with Beth, for rather a poor (silent) film, "The 4 feathers", little similarity to the book. I go to a marvellous Schonberg concert on the Billison's wireless. Including "Chamber-Symp." Suite op. 25 (pft.). & Pierrot Luniere [Lunaire]. I liked the last the most, & I thought it most beautiful. It was of course perfectly done.
