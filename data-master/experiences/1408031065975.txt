Up, and got ready, and eat our breakfast and then took coach: and the poor, as they did yesterday, did stand at the coach to have something given them, as they do to all great persons, and I did give them something; and the town musique did also come and play; but, Lord! what sad music they made - however, I was pleased with them, being all of us in very good humour, and so set forth and through the town, and observed at our College of Magdalen the posts new-painted, and understand that the Vice- Chancellor is there this year.
