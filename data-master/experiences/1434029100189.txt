An extract from a Contemporary Notice, 10th November, 1847 -
A passage in the ' Times ' relating to Mendelssohn does credit to the writer, whoever he be. It is to be wished the account of his funeral might be given entirely by the English papers. After a solemn service at Leipzig the body was conveyed to Berlin for interment, and by night for privacy ; but it was watched for at the railway stations in two places, and met by processions of the principal inhabitants singing hymns.
