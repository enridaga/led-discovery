<p>Feb. 14, Wigmore Hall, Busch Quartet etc It is really sufficient to say that the programme consisted of Mozart&rsquo;s Quintet in D (K.593) &amp; the Schubert Octet and that the extra viola was Karl Doktor&rsquo;s son Paul, the double-Bass, Claude Hobday and the clarinet, horn and bassoon, Reginald Kell, Aubrey Brain and Paul Draper. If there was any roughness (and I won&rsquo;t say that there was) it was of no moment compared with the life and flow of the playing. The Mozart Quartet, now hardly less familiar to me than those in C and G minor is really no less captivating. The Schubert Octet is so full of lovely music that I was sorry that the effect of an inoculation made me find it a little too long (and the balcony benches are rather hard and uncomfortable also).</p>
