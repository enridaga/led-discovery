With excitement, we witnessed what happened when an Arab musician shared a music stand with an Israeli musician, both trying to play the same note with the same dynamic, the same stroke of the bow, the same sound, the same expression. They were trying to do something together about which they were both passionate because, after all, indifference and music cannot coexist.
