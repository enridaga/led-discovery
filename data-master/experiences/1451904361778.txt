<p>One night, at the German&nbsp;Club in Mortimer Street, upon some special occasion&nbsp;when ''high jinks" had been going on all the evening,&nbsp;he [Alfred Gruenfeld] dropped in at about half-past eleven (having been&nbsp;already playing at a concert and a couple of parties), "took the piano" in obedience to an unanimous call on&nbsp;the part of the members present and their guests, and kept&nbsp;it, barring brief intervals devoted to refreshment, until&nbsp;five o'clock the following morning. During the interim&nbsp;he gave us specimens of all the leading P.F. composers'&nbsp;works, and extemporised half-a-dozen times upon themes&nbsp;suggested by one or another of his hearers. Like Rubinstein, he believed firmly in the inspiration of&nbsp;tobacco, and never played so well as when a cigar was&nbsp;smouldering in a comer of his mouth.</p>
