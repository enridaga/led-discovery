<p>I started playing the clarinet when I was thirteen. I was born in Memphis. I remember, as a matter of fact, the first time W.C. Handy played <em>Memphis Blues</em>, around 1916. The first time he played it was in the Clay Street School, back of my house. There was a little concert. I was going to the school at the time.</p>
