 We are invited to attend a performance in the lovely little Kirov Theatre. It seats a mere three or four hundred people--in comfortable armchairs! The stage, however, is full-size, and we see an act from an opera by Rachmaninoff based on one of Pushkin's poems. It is so skillfully and sensitively done that, although we don't understand the language, we can follow the story easily enough. After that there is a fine ballet performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherezade.
