<p>One day&nbsp;he [Johann Strauss] received the Empress's command to attend with his&nbsp;band at "Tsarko&euml;-Selo," and to perform before her&nbsp;Majesty in the park of that Imperial summer resort.&nbsp;Upon his arrival there he was informed by the Chamberlain on duty that he would have to rehearse the&nbsp;morceaux of his programme thrice before playing them&nbsp;to the Czarina. His amazement at so unprecedented a&nbsp;request found vent in eager inquiries as to its motive;&nbsp;but no explanation was vouchsafed to him. Such were Her Majesty's orders, and he had nothing to do but to&nbsp;comply with them. Still greater waxed his astonishment when he observed that during the three rehearsals&nbsp;an empty Court carriage was drawn by a pair of horses&nbsp;slowly backwards and forwards in front of his orchestra.&nbsp;During the final performance, however, the meaning of&nbsp;this mysterious proceeding became apparent to him.&nbsp;Owing to a sharp attack of gout, the Empress was compelled to recline in a carriage, with her foot on a cushion,&nbsp;throughout the concert; and the object of the three&nbsp;rehearsals had been to accustom the horses to the sounds&nbsp;produced by a full string-band, lest, haply, they should&nbsp;take fright and bolt with their Imperial mistress.</p>
