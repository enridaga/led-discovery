Now you didn't find no muddy Mississippi blues on the radio. That music was available only on what we called race records. But those low-down sounds were things I already knew. They were as much a part of me as my nose, my teeth, or the hair on my head. 

These other sounds [Big Band] were new, and I was pleased to pick 'em up and learn 'em. One cat in particular knocked me out. They always talked 'bout Goodman being such a great clarinetist, but to me he wasn't in the same category as my man--Artie Shaw.

When I heard Artie Shaw do "Stardust" or, sometime later, "Concerto for Clarinet," I flipped. I loved his sweet sound and I loved his pure tone. It was Artie Shaw who inspired me to take up the clarinet--something I did when I was about ten--and Artie's Gramercy Five was one of the first small combos which made me sit up and take notice.
