In what you said about playing music, it sounded as if you were talking about spontaneity or instinct?

Sort of.

But it's an educated instinct that involves lots of schooling.

Oh, yeah, I'm not talking about magic.

How about an example? I'm interested in how you re-created Bartók's "Bagatelle No. 4" on The Mad Hatter.

I had been listening to some Bartók records on an old Hungarian label. They were posthumous performances of very early orchestrations which the composer had put aside. I was also listening again to the string quartets and the Concerto for Orchestra.
