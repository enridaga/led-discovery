My duty as a Juryman rather taxed my powers of endurance, as for eight hours we sat on a high platform in the open market-place with the sun scorching us. Round about us was the band, a surging crowd, and a host of fashionables; it was a very animated scene. The Choral Unions, one after another, marched up to the front, banners unfurled, and sang. Not one could be called bad; several were really good.
