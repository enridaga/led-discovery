It is very warm. Agnes Welsh and I went to the concert for the English Catholic church of St Joseph. It was well done: girl and boy scouts sold programmes, and made a background with the flags of the Alliés, when all their national airs were sung. An Englishman with a pretty voice sang “God Save the King.” He sang two verses, then requested the public to sing the last one with him, and very well it sounded – every one singing, including some wounded soldiers, French and British, of whom there were a good many in the salle. They ended by the “Marseillaise,” very well sung by Mme. H. of the Opéra; and then, too, all the public joined in at the last verse, and the enthusiasm was frantic.
	The “Star-Spangled Banner,” under the heading of “National Airs of the Allies,” was also very well sung by Miss M. (Let us hope it is a good presage, and that the sympathies of the United States are with the Allies, en attendant something more tangible.)
