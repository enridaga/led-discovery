I never heard a sweeter toned instrument - whether, like St. Pauls, it is meliorated by the building or no, I cannot tell; but it pleased me exceedingly. The building is of a prodigious heigth... the organ too had the advantage of being extreamly well played by Signor Matucci the present organist.&nbsp;</span></p>
