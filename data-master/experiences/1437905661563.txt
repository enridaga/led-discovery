<p>Practise Petrouchka before dinner. After, listen to some early beethoven Chambermusic from Munich. The Trio for 2 Ob. &amp; Cor Anglais; &amp; Serenade in D for Vl. Vla &amp; Vlc.* Both of these are etremely attractive - &amp; ingenuously scored if not hair-raising musicly. I must hear them again. Performances quite good.&nbsp;</p>
