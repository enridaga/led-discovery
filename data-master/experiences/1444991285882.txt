The singing is noisy and vulgar, but the accompaniments were admirable, and well performed. The fiddle and calascione part was incessantly going during the song part as well as the ritornells. The modulation surprised me very much: from the key of A[natural] to that of C and F was not difficult or new &ndash; but from that of A# to E[flat] was astonishing, and this was done without offending the ear, and the return to the original key so insensibly managed as neither to shock the ear or for it to be easily discovered by what road or relations it was done.</span></p>
