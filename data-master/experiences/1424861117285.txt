<p>I asked him [Liszt] to tell me how he produced a certain effect he makes in his arrangement of the ballad in Wagner's <em>Flying Dutchman</em>. He looked very "<em>fin</em>" as the French say, but did not reply. He never gives a direct answer to a direct question. "Ah," said I, "you won't tell." He smiled, and then immediately played the passage. It was a long arpeggio, and the effect he made was, as I had supposed, a pedal effect. He kept the pedal down throughout, and played the beginning of the passage in a grand <em>rolling</em> sort of manner, and then all the rest of it with a very pianissimo touch, and so lightly, that the continuity of the arpeggios was destroyed, and the notes seemed to be just <em>strewn</em> in, as if you broke a wreath of flowers and scattered them according to your fancy. It is a most striking and beautiful effect, and I told him I didn't see how he ever thought of it. "Oh, I've invented a great many things," said he, indifferently&mdash;"<em>this</em>, for instance,"&mdash;and he began playing a double roll of octaves in chromatics in the bass of the piano. It was very grand, and made the room reverberate. "Magnificent," said I. "Did you ever hear me do a storm?" said he. "No." "Ah, you ought to hear me do a storm! Storms are my <em>forte</em>!" Then to himself between his teeth, while a weird look came into his eyes as if he could indeed rule the blast, "<em>Da</em> KRACHEN <em>die B&auml;ume</em> (Then <em>crash</em> the trees!)"</p>
