<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I am the moment on my way home from a little money-making tour: for 3 weeks I have been touring in the few countries that have remained free. I even managed to get to little Luxembourg (they have a good radio orchestra). Only the beginning of my tour really interested me- I started off in Basle with a performance of my new work (which I think I mentioned to you some time ago) for 2 pianos and 2 groups of percussion instruments; my wife played the 2<span style="font-size: xx-small;">nd</span>&nbsp;piano and held her own splendidly. The whole thing sounds quite unusual &ndash; but the Basle people liked it, anyway. What a pity we can&rsquo;t give it in Pozsony! Perhaps there isn&rsquo;t even a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Maschinenpauke</em> in Pozsony, which you simply must have for the performance. The timpanist in Basle was a real virtuoso. </span></p>
