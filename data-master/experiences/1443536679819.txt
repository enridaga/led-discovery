<p>The last time I writ to you was from Plattin, on this day sen'night. I told you we were to have a ball, and a ball we had ; nine couple of as clever dancers (though I say it that should not) as ever tripped. The knight and I were partners, we began at seven: danced thirty-six dances with only resting once, supped at twelve, every one by their partner, at a long table which was handsomely filled with all manner of cold meat, sweetmeats, creams, and jellies. Two or three of the young ladies sung. I was asked for my song, and gave them "<em>Hop she</em>;" that occasioned some mirth.</p>
