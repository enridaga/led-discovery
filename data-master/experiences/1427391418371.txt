In 1845 I made my first acquaintance with England, a very unsatisfactory one as it proved...I took part in a concert given by Sivori, and gave a concert in the Hanover Square rooms, at which Clara Novello and Balfe sang, and Sivori played, but the success of which was indifferent. So, after a sojourn of about eight weeks I returned to Paris, firmly resolved to shun England for ever!
