Once, on leave at the house of Joan's people in Windermere, I was delighted to meet the celebrated composer Dr Cecil Armstrong Gibbs. The first he invited me to do was to support him as a bass in the local church choir. He had a good voice. I have a big one, and at that time was in particularly fine sonority because of my parade-ground activities. I am also, still, completely ignorant of the correct 'pointing' of psalms; it's something it seems you must know, and I don't, I came in loudly into more empty spaces in ten minutes than I would have thought possible and as we walked out in procession he said, 'You perhaps should stick to the clarinet!'
