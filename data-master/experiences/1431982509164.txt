The night before the concert we [Beatrice and May] went to the opera and as we knew one of the directors, we were taken round afterwards to meet Schuch and the singers. The opera was The 'Mastersingers' and that is where we first met Richard Tauber who was singing the part of David. What a wonderful David he was. He was so charming to us that night and whenever we met him subsequently.
