<p>They put a gentleman with me [at Piney Woods School], a Mr. Jonas Brown. We all called him "J. B." He was there to find out what I really liked or what I didn't like about the school. He would ask from time to time how I was doing. [&hellip;] I guess I was about ten years old. [&hellip;] I heard the band rehearsing[. ...] I heard this sound that really struck my attention. I asked, "What's that?" J. B. said, "Do you like it?" I said, "Yes, indeed! I like to hear those horns." He said, "That's the band playing, getting ready for the game." I asked, "Would they say anything if I went up there? I'd like to go and listen to it." [&hellip;] So we went up there and walked in when they were getting ready to take a break.</p>
<p>There was this young student named Anna Mae Williams who blew trumpet. I never will forget, after J. B. introduced me to Mr. Charles McGilvery, the band director, I went over to her and sat down. I said, "What is that?" She told me, "A trumpet." I asked, "Can I see it?" She said, "Sure. Do you want to learn to blow this one?" I said, "I'd like to, but right now I just want to listen." She told me then, "You can't sit here and listen and not take part in it." J. B. said, "It looks like you done found a friend." They started to play a march called "The Stars and Stripes Forever," and I said, "Boy, oh boy, I wonder could I be able to do that someday?" She said, "Yes, but you'll have to practice." I did have sense enough to know that. I said, "I'm not going to bother you all; I just love to listen." Mr. McGilvery told me I could stay as long as I wanted. Between songs Anna Mae would show me her horn and let me hold it. I said, "I sure would like to be able to blow like you're blowing, one day."</p>
