<pre>Mrs. Billington had her benefit at Drury Lane, 30th April. On this occasion the<br />opera of "Algonah" was brought forward; the drama by Cobb, the music by myself. <br />The opera was successful, though, on the first representation of it, poor Mrs. 
Billington had a terrible fright; and no wonder, poor thing, for at the end of <br />the first act, who did she find sitting in her dressing-room, but her beloved <br />husband, Monsieur de Felican, whom she thought safe and snug at Venice, whence <br />she had escaped from him ; but he, good soul, was deeply in love with her English<br />guineas, and all at once vowed he could no longer bear to be separated from his <br />beloved Bettina, as he called her. </pre>
