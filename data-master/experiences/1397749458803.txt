Last Wednesday I went with Harry (who with Mr. Laurie turned up the previous day) Mrs. Wynne Finch and Mr. Pemberton and Colonel Colville to Frankfurt to hear Die Walküre the first of the Niebelungen series. Anything more splendid than the second act where Brünnhilde comes to separate the lovers, it is impossible to conceive—one is fairly carried away on waves and billows of sound: and it is extremely finely acted, and sung, specifically by Frau Lüger as Brünnhilde. . .
