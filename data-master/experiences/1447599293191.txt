<p>We reached the extreme western tip of Lake Constance one evening when darkness was settling prematurely and threateningly over the countryside as an alpine thunderstorm gathered &hellip; Under a cannonade of thunder we fled for shelter to a small inn near by. &nbsp;It was a peasants&rsquo; haunt, but clean and welcoming.</p>
<p>Nor were we the only refugees from the storm, which raged all that evening and through the night. &nbsp;A band of Hungarian gypsies came in. &nbsp;They were on their way to north Germany, to play for the summer season in a sophisticated restaurant in one of the great towns. &nbsp;But here they were <em>au naturel</em>, and they played for their supper and night&rsquo;s lodging. &nbsp;Cembalo, fiddles and deeper strings, the music challenged the storm, wrestled with it into the early hours, extemporizing on themes some of which I recognized as folk tunes rescued and civilized by Korb&aacute;y, Bart&oacute;k and Kod&aacute;ly, under the impulse of Franz Liszt.</p>
<p>We lay in the room above, the bed and the crude furniture vibrating in the conflict. &nbsp;Sleep was impossible, though we were physically exhausted after walking all day, bowed under rucksacks. &nbsp;We cursed the storm and the musicians, but listened nevertheless, spellbound by the wildness of sound and setting, under the threat of the brimming lake.</p>
<p>That night evoked the emotional impulse which led me to plan a second novel, whose purpose would be to bring this elemental contest between man and nature down into focus, within the character of a young woman seeking to escape from the ready-made shelter of parental home and then of marriage, so that she could begin her own homemaking. &nbsp;The theme hovered over me like an eagle for the rest of the tour, as we walked on day after day round the Lake to Lindau. &nbsp;I began to write the book, called <em>High Summer</em>, soon after we got home. &nbsp;</p>
