As it is within the compass of a tenor, Harrison, Knyvett, and others, having sung it, Braham might have taken it, and would have given it all its deeply pathetic expression, which was totally lost. Miss Masson having just before sung &ldquo;He shall feed his flock,&rdquo; a simple quiet air, more suited to her powers, need not have had this also allotted to her.</p>
