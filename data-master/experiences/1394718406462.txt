Having before I came to Waltham by enquiring of my brothers found there was an organ at the church I was of course impatient to hear it the first Sunday but was rather disappointed at finding it a very small one placed very high in an upper or second gallery, the front of which coincided with the front of the organ w'ch was therefore played on behind. This indeed had been a house organ belonging to a Mr Horner of that place, who gave it to the church, which being large it had but little effect, except in accompanying the singers, which then were a very good sett. It was also very indifferently played by a Mr Elton, a poor musician, who I believe turning [sic] his playing country dances at the neighbouring assemblies to as much account as his organ playing. As to his voluntaries he had but one sett (of Stanley's) proper to play before the 1st, lesson which be played in turn on Sunday afternoons & then began them again, to husband which as much as possible, he used to play an extempore adagio upon the Diapasons of a morning. The principal movements in these printed voluntaries soon became so familiar that I co'd sing them by heart, which I used to do sometimes after we were in bed, imitating the different stops of the organ with my voice.
