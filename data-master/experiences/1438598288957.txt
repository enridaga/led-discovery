True, this was the work of an Englishman; but it was composed to a French libretto and performed by French artists, and it owed its hearing exclusively to foreign influence. Its success, despite the glamour of its picturesque Roman setting, and notwithstanding the art of Heglon, Alvarez, and Renaud, must perforce be described as equivocal. The story at best is revolting; and the music combines with a few fine moments many dull quarts d'heure.</span></pre>
