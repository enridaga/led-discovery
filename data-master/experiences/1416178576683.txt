At length after much entreaty, I obtained Schröder’s consent that I should make a trial of it with another singer, who hitherto had played only in secondary characters, and practise her in the role refused by Madame Becker. In this singer, a Madame Lichtenheld, I found great willingness and natural capacity, and when I had simplified the most difficult bravura passages of the part to her powers of execution, I succeeded well with her. Thus at length the rehearsals could be commenced, and when Schröder had heard one, and had become convinced that Madame Lichtenheld would fill the part satisfactorily, the first representation was announced for the 15. November. My former musical acquaintances one and all, including Romberg and Prell, offered their services to me in the two representations in which I was to lead the orchestra. Hermstedt, also, who had come to Hamburgh to give a Concert with my support, joined them, and undertook the First Clarinet part, for which there were some telling Soli’s and a concerted accompaniment of a Soprano-air. With the aid of these distinguished artists the Orchestra was considerably strengthened, and as the Singers and the Chorus were likewise well practised, I was already greatly pleased with the precision with which my music was performed in the rehearsals, and therefore entertained the most lively hopes that the Opera would please.
