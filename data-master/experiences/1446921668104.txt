<p>A very foggy dark morning.&nbsp; I scarce ever remember before so many foggy days of this kind.&nbsp; My face very bad this morning and I have had several severe spasms [...] I scarce know what to do and how to venture to Dodington this morning yet did not chuse to give it up [...] Crept slowly home and then was obliged to hurry to Church again for I had been so long detained at Dodington [...] The Singers afterwards gave us a long Psalm so that it was very late and dark before we got out and I had not dined and felt myself empty, cold, and poorly.</p>
