Brilliant without finish, and perhaps also without elegance, the celebrated prima donna nevertheless elicited in this her only part after the "Linda," a great amount of applause, and may again be said to have achieved a success. Brilliancy and vivacity are 'telling" qualities with a miscellaneous audience. But the opportunities afforded this clever singer were few. One star shone with too powerful a light in the operatic sphere to allow any other star, however radiant, to sparkle within its legitimate lustre. It was difficult, indeed almost impossible, both for Cruvelli and Tadolini to shed their really bright rays, whilst the great planet Jenny Lind was in the ascendant. Of the two ladies, Cruvelli had the better chance of winning fame in England, since she had commenced her career earlier in the year, before the arrival of the all-absorbing "Jenny." She accordingly maintained her footing; whilst the sister "star," Tadolini, set below the horizon of the Italian stage at the end of the season, once and for ever.</span></p>
