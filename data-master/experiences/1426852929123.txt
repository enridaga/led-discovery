I was a happy kid. I loved the country with all its colours and mysteriesâ€¦ And then there was music. I heard it early, just as soon as I was talking or walking. It was always there-- all shapes, all kinds, all rhythms. Music was the only thing I was really anxious to get out of bed for. 

I was born with music inside me. That's the only explanation I know of, since none of my relatives could sing or play an instrument. Music was one of my parts. Like my ribs, my liver, my kidneys, my heart. Like my blood. It was a force already within me when I arrived on the scene. It was a necessity for me, like food or water. And from the moment I learned there were piano keys to be mashed, I started mashing 'em, trying to make sounds out of feelings.
