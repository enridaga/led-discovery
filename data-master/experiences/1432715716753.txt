<p>[...] Robert Lockwood [...] moved up to St. Louis and then went on to Chicago. Then Joe Willie Wilkins came in, and he and Sonny Boy kept the group [The King Biscuit Boys] going. Then Joe Willie moved from Helena over to Memphis, and he played around there[. ...] He was a real good guitarist, and he also worked with Willie Love. They did a lot of sessions at Miss McMurry's Trumpet studio there in Jackson. A lot of Sonny Boy's records, Willie Love was on them, then he had some sessions that he did on his own. Stuff like "Little Car Blues," "Shout Brother Shout," "Nelson Street Blues" and "74 Blues." A lot of people couldn't understand what was "74." Was it just a number? But "74" was the number of a freight train. He mentioned, "74 rolls right by my baby's door / I'm going to hobo my way to Chicago / And I won't be coming back no more." I had a lot of those records. He died at the VA hospital, Willie Love did, in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1953. [&hellip;] I never got a chance to meet Willie Love personally, but I really have enjoyed his music because he used the right musicians to make his stuff work for him. A lot of musicians today just get a lot of guys and throw something together, just because it seems it might work. A lot of music from the early days is being covered by up-and-coming people. But if you ever knew the song, it would be a hard thing to recognize it when somebody else plays it, versus going back and listening to the original.</p>
