<p>So in the&nbsp;morning of the day of the concert he went to&nbsp;the Concert Hall to practise. He had asked&nbsp;me to follow him thither a little later and to&nbsp;rehearse with him the songs&mdash; his, of course &mdash;he&nbsp;was to accompany for me in the evening. When&nbsp;I arrived at the hall I found him quite alone,&nbsp;seated at the piano and working away for all he&nbsp;was worth, on Beethoven's <em>Choral Fantasia</em> and Schumann's Concerto. He was quite red&nbsp;in the face, and, interrupting himself for a&nbsp;moment on seeing me stand beside him, said&nbsp;with that childlike, confiding expression in his&nbsp;eyes : " Really, this is too bad. Those people&nbsp;to-night expect to hear something especially&nbsp;good, and here I am likely to give them a&nbsp;hoggish mess (<em>Schweinerei</em>). I assure you, I&nbsp;could play to-day, with the. greatest ease, far&nbsp;more difficult things, with wider stretches for&nbsp;the fingers, my own concerto for example, but&nbsp;those simple diatonic runs are exasperating. I&nbsp;keep saying to myself : ' <em>But, Johannes,</em> <em>pull&nbsp;yourself together,&mdash; Do play decently</em>,' &mdash;but no&nbsp;use ; it's really horrid."&nbsp;</p>
