Taking a reserved stall, I witnessed an excellent representation of this celebrated work with no little satisfaction. The orchestra was not large, being chiefly composed of young artists, who, I was informed, played more to obtain experience than with a view to pecuniary profit. The heroine was played by a popular actress, Fraulein Hartmann. As a whole the opera was well performed ; but the singing, both solo and choral, was not particularly good. There, as in every similar place in Germany, I noticed the remarkable attention of the audience to every detail of the performance. Between each of the acts one of those polite and handy German waiters, always found in such places, offered refreshment in the shape of a <span class="Bodytext2Italic">seidel</span> of beer, a small bottle of <span class="Bodytext2Italic">Rheinwein</span>, German sausages, and Westphalia ham sandwiches.</p>
