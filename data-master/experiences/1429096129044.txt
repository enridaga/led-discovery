When one comes away from a fine performance of an opera, or the perfect execution of a symphony, one likes to recall the pleasure by going through the score on the piano. This I did after hearing you play Chopin's ' Nocturne ' and ' Barcarolle.' I had never judged these two works according to their value. I had rarely heard them, and incompletely, and I had never been tempted to read them myself, being frightened by the difficulties they present. Your truly incomparable execution entirely modified my opinion. So interpreted, one recognises their great merit, their great value ; they are worthy of Chopin.
