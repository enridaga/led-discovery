Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Palace of Bruhl: Wednesday, 13th August, 1845 -
I have just a moment to tell you that I am alive and well. We are enjoying magnificence here. The first really grand effect was the drive through Cologne ; the chief street being decorated with flags on poles, and carpets out of the windows, filled with a waving multitude ; great care had been taken to sweep and clean it as for a procession, sprinkling it with Eau de Cologne, by order of the town authorities. Within the Palace all was lighted up, the garden and its Italian colonnades and fountains and statues, all made bright and visible : the Court-yard was, in comparison, but moderately illuminated, but was soon filled with beautifully ornamented lanterns ; 485 musicians placed themselves in military array, and ' God save the Queen ' sounded forth, the roll of drums filling up the pauses. I could not have fancied this mode of performance, which is called the great Zapfenttreich, that is, the military retiring salute.
