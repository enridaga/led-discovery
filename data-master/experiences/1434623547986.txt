There was at that time in Geneva a little restaurant with a small orchestra of string instruments, including a cymbalon, on which Aladar Racz excelelled. He is a Hungarian, and has since become recognized as a virtuoso. I was captivated by the instrument which delighted me by its rich, full tone and by the playerâ€™s direct contact with the strings through the little sticks held between his fingers, and even by its trapezoid shape. I wanted to get one, and begged Racz to help me by making my wish known among his associates in Geneva, and, in fact, he did tell me of an old Hungarian who sold me one of these instruments. I carried it off to Morges in glee, and very soon learned to play it well enough to enable me to compose a part for cymbalon which I introduced into the little orchestra of Renard.
