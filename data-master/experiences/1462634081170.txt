<p>I must tell you that we have been here since January because they are presenting an opera by my husband, the libretto of which I have translated from the English. The production here has given rise to so many difficulties that we have had to adapt parts of the libretto. - My husband does not know German well enough, so it was mostly I who had to do this. The whole thing being awfully urgent we really worked day and night. But now everything is well under way; the singers and the conductor, somewhat recalcitrant at first are now growing more and more enthusiastic about it. The music of Delius is not the sort that one can like superficially - it is rather like your sculpture - one either finds it abominable, or one loves it with one's whole being.&nbsp;</p>
