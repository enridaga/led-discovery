This was by no means the case; she gave universal satisfaction [&hellip;] </span></p>

When obliged, as she injudiciously was, to attempt others of a higher description, she certainly failed, and could not give them with sufficient force.</span></p>

She has gained great favour here, by the exquisite taste and expression with which she sings national Swiss airs, than which (as I am told) nothing can be more delightful. Her skill and science enable her, however, to sing always well.</span></p>
