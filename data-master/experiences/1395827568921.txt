We arrived about 7 in the morning, found the roads and town very full of country people as at a wakes but very few gens comme il faut. Great preparations were making in the great square for the diversions of the evening. At 11 was a great musical performance but not what I expected as to performers - the heat, that of the black hole at Calcutta - such a crowd and such a hive! The music of the mass was really pretty, full of new and elegant passages - there was however but one good singer, Abate Fibietto, a tenor whose voice and taste were charming. He sung a motet with such execution, precision and taste as I never remember to have heard. At 4 began the games, which had been 3 months preparing. That of this evening (they last 3 days) was to represent the story of David and Goliah, and it was really well told by the peasants of the nighbourhood. There were 20,000 people assembled without guards and yet no accident or confusion. The 2 armies met of the Children of Israel and the Philistines - a fine giant for Goliah and a sweet little David - horse men and foot without number dressed a lâ€™antique and in uniforms - the stage dresses of the opera houses all round were borrowed for the kings and generals. Above 1500 men were employed on both sides. The sacred story was well told and David, mounted on a fine chariot received the applause of the whole company. In the evening I went to vespers and heard there the whole story sung in an oratorio set by Signor Feroce. The principal violin, Signor Modele and his son played a duet concerto very well in the morning. The Maestro di Capella whose music pleased me so much in the morning was likewise Signor Feroce from Florence - at night fine fire works and a general illumination.
