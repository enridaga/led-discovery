<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I remember sitting with Schoenberg, his wife Mathilde, and Diaghilev at a performance of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Petrushka</em>, and I have a clear memory of Schoenberg in his green room after he had conducted the fourth performance of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Pierrot Lunaire</em> in the Choralion-Saal, 4 Bellevuestrasse, Sunday, 8 December 1912, at twelve noon. I still have my cancelled ticket. Albertine Zehme, the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Sprechstimme</em> artist, wore a &lsquo;Pierrot&rsquo; costume and accompanied her epiglottal sounds with a small amount of pantomime. I remember that the audience was quite and attentive, and that I wanted Frau Zehme to be quite too, so that I could hear the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">music</em>. Diaghilev and I were greatly impressed with <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Pierrot</em>, though he classified it as <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Jugendstil</em>. </span></p>
