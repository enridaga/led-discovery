<p>Yesterday, Tuesday, we both renewed London life in the usual way, save that I had to buy stuff for dresses, as well as paper labels &amp; glue.&nbsp; Tea at the Club, where Alix, dusky and dreary, borrowed 10/- in order to give James his dinner. They were going to hear Bertie lecture; I preferred the songsters of Trafalgar Square.&nbsp; The steps of the column were built up, pyramid fashion, with elderly respectable householders grasping sheets of music, which they rendered, in time to a conductor on a chair beneath, with great precision.&nbsp; It was Life boat day, &amp; the elderly people were singing sailor's shanties &amp; Tom Bowling.&nbsp; This seemed to me a very amusing &amp; instructive spectacle &amp; being famished for music, I could not get past, but stood and felt thrilled with an absurd visionary excitement; &amp; walked over Hungerford Bridge making up stories.</p>
