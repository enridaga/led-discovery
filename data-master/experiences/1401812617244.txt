Spring 1977 Khatchaturian conducting London Symphony Orchestra . I arrived [in] the hall to find an Isreali peace demonstration- packed house- people approaching and asking to buy tickets. My new girlfriend did not arrive so I sold the ticket! 20 minutes into the performance she arrived!! managing to get into the hall. There were a couple of seats empty near to my seat so we sat in them. I sat there hoping no-one would show and she would find out I had sold the ticket. However, the real memory is the stellar performance of the London Symphony Orchestra and the wonderful melodies of the Adagio from Spartacus.
