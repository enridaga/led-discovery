Go to Ireland for good comp. lesson at 10.0. Come back via R.C.M with Lauricella. Play tennis 4–5 with Gates; play v. badly. Go to opera (Lyceum) with Miss Hurst & Barbara (B. & I take Miss H.) to see Sadko. v. well done – voices all good, save for excessive wobble. Music v. pretty, tuneful, but v. thin. Opera a mass of spectacular scenes; not really an opera. Scenery v. good. Chorus good; orchestra mod. not as good as last night (under E. Goossens both nights – v. fine). Orchestration wonderful of course. Back about 12.0.
