Bath before early dinner (6.50) & go to B.B.C. concert - 1/2 time Area & 1/2 time Circle with F.B. Adrian Boult (terrible execrable conductor) leads the show. Elgar Intro. & All nice spots but terrible - "Toselli's Serenata"! H. Samuel in Brahms 2nd Conc. - v. disappointing reading tho' excellent technically - too pompous & slow. Schumann 1st delightful symphony - indifferently played. Go home with F.B. & Brosas (Mr. & Mrs.), for lemonade, back here 11.15.
