I once went to meet Lennie and went through a lot of nonsense just to get in to see him. What did you learn from him?

I remember playing left-hand chords to "You Go to May Head," trying to get a countermelody going with the thump of my left hand. He had asked me to learn the song from Billie Holiday's recording of it. At one point my countermelody didn't work with the right-hand melody, and Lennie was quick to point out that it was wrong.
