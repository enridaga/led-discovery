I'd come over [to the UK] as a young musician from Australia with one purpose.  To see my idols, Sergio Celibdache and Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli  play with the LSO.  The Ravel G Major Concerto and Faure's Requiem were on the program.  The Festival Hall was bursting with people amazed the pianist had actually turned up, and the music was wonderful.  I've been back 500 times since!
