I eagerly awaited the recital of Heifetz. I had never heard him, but although only two years his junior, since my early childhood the name Heifetz, in Russia, was a legend. Not to miss his concert, I had to postpone mine in Hamburg. It was not easy, but well worth the effort. What supreme mastery over his instrument! It seemed that he had reached his Olympian heights – or rather, had been placed there – by forces other than human. He stood as if cut in marble, but I had to stop watching his perfect co-ordination and listen with my eyes closed to the unearthly beautiful sound of his violin.
