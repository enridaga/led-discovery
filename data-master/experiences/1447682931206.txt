<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">After the excitement of the Festival of Britain I was keen to experience a concert at the new Concert Hall.&nbsp; I had been to the Proms in Kensington where I splashed out &pound;19 for a season ticket to the Gallery.&nbsp; I managed to book for a concert on the Wednesday in the opening week of the Festival Hall and took Maggie my then girlfriend.&nbsp; Compared to the Albert Hall it all seemed so modern, spacious and luxurious.&nbsp; The only item in the programme that I remember was an Elgar symphony but the overall impression was overwhelming.</p>
