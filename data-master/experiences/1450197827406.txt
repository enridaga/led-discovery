<p class="MsoNormal">The [Jullien] orchestra played a fair share of classic music, alternating with the very popular. I remember an occasion in Boston when the andante of Beethoven&rsquo;s Second Symphony was on their programme. By accident the parts for the players were not forthcoming; but they played it nevertheless from memory. It was not a great feat, perhaps, but it is worthy of mention, to show that they were in the routine of playing some good music ; evidently that andante was at their fingers&rsquo; ends.</p>
