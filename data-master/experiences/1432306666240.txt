<p>This was an excellent occasion for the presentation of my <em>Hymne</em>, as it had been written with the Trocadero in mind. The performance was decided on and Victor Hugo was invited to come and hear it.</p>
<p>The performance was splendid-- a large orchestra, the magnificent organ, eight harps, and eight trumpets sounding their flourishes in the organ loft, and a large chorus for the peroration of such splendor that it was compared to the set pieces at the close of a display of fireworks. The reception and ovation which the crowd gave the great poet, who rarely appeared in public, was beyond description. The honeyed incense of the organ, harps and trumpets was new to him and pleased his Olympian nostrils.</p>
