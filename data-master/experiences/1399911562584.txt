[A]t the present moment my heart is filled with music. ’Tis thus: After the Scrip. Union Meeting which I took alone, and thoroughly enjoyed, I took upon myself... to teach a Carol to the ‘Sowers’ and others; which they are to sing at the Sunday School Treat to my accompaniment. There were about a dozen, from ten to fourteen years old, and some have really exceptional voices, and all seem most intelligent; so it [is] with real pleasure that I ‘doh-ray-me’ before them; harp on first piano, then organ; insist on pauses, slurs and crescendo’s, and beg the rosy mouths to ope a trifle widah!

Two choir boys came Carol singing here on Tues. and I enjoyed that, also.
