The annual Music Meeting at Windon beginning on the 7th., I went there on Thursday the 8th & attended the oratorio of L'Allegro Penseroso at St John's Room, at which I was much pleas'd by the manner of Miss Linley's singing "The prince unable to complain" (in which she was encor'd) but particularly with the song of "Sweet Bird" most delicately accompan'd by her brother on the violin, who also played a concerto between the acts.
