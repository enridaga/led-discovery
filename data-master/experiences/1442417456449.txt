<p>Nothing terribly exciting, but I do remember going up in the lift with Ralph Vaughen [Vaughan] Williams, attending a concert given by the great Kirsten Flagstad. During the concert, Mme Flagstad's belt became undone between songs, and Malcolm Sargent gallantly jumped off the podium to help her with it. I also remember Otto Klemprer being carried by two stalwart staff members to his chair on the podium to conduct a Beethoven concert. Also Maria Callas and Giuseppe di Stefano entering regally to the platform.</p>
