Among the most important events of my stay I may reckon the second dinner with Messieurs the natural scientists. On Tuesday, the day before the Congress broke up, there was a banquet accompanied by suitable songs. Everybody present sang, and those who were at table drank copiously and beat time to the music, Zelter conducting.
