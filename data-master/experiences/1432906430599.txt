Another public exhibition of barbarity, also the last of its kind at Horsham, took place on the 6th April, 1844, when John Lawrence was hanged for the murder of Mr. Solomon, superintendent of Police at Brighton. [...] Lawrence's execution was fixed for Saturday, 6th April, at 12 o'clock noon, the day of Horsham Teg Fair this year; April 5th, the usual fair day, being Good Friday. East Street, from Park Street right up past the Gaol, was thronged with people, estimated at about 3,000, including myself, all waiting to see the sight; many of them had walked in long distances and from all quarters. [...] Pedlars were walking to and fro, singing and selling printed copies of the following "Last Dying Confession": -

Good people all I pray draw near,
A dreadful story you shall hear:
Overcome with grief and fear,
I am condemned to die.
I do lament, and sore repent,
The evil deed which I have done;
My time is come, my glass is run,
I now behold my setting sun -
All in the prime of life.
Chorus -
John Lawrence is my name,
To grief and shame,
I brought myself this world may see,
Young men a warning take by me,
At Horsham, on a fatal tree,
Alas! I am doomed to die.
