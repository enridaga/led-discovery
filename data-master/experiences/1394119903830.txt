Typical, unsatisfactory school Sunday. Services at 10.30 (frightful congregational practice & 10.) & 6.30 with a good sermon by Rev. A.L. Watt on the "Inequality of the World". I completely lose my temper with Gog (luckily he wasn't present). He has now written the most abominable Benidicite which is performed in Chapel; unfortunately for everyone concerned I lost my temper on a piece of M.S. paper, & the most frightful bit of unplayable rubbish for pft. was the result.* Ord. practise in evening; a bit better than usual in spite of ourselves!
