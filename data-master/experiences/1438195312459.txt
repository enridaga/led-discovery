<p>In morning I go to the final rehearsal of a Symphony Concert to which Mum goes with me at 8.p.m. Weingartner conducting the very fine Basel orchestra (only a few instrumentalists needing revision). A. Strauss programme - Macbeth, Heldenleben &amp; 7 songs (delightfly sung by Elizabeth Schumann, that great artist - although they were badly chosen - not enough variety). W. does not like Strauss, consequently the ensemble was occasionally slack, the music was stilted, &amp; had, more often than not, no vitality. Luckily alot of it plays itself &amp; Heldenleben had some really thrilling moments The love section was stiff &amp; cold (for Strauss) - but what a work! Inspite of its egotism, I admire it now wholeheartedly. MacB. v. int. but not best S.*</p>
