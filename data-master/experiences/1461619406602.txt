<p>At the concert [at the annual "Caecilien-Fest" at M&uuml;nster&nbsp;in Westphalia]&nbsp;Brahms played his concerto&nbsp;superbly. I especially noted his emphasizing&nbsp;each of those tremendous shakes in the first&nbsp;movement by placing a short rest between the&nbsp;last note of one and the first small note before&nbsp;the next. During those short stops he would&nbsp;lift his hands up high and let them come down&nbsp;on the keys with a force like that of a lion's&nbsp;paw. It was grand.</p>
