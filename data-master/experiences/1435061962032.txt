The Savoy was a place of tremendous enthusiasm, a home of fantastic dancing. And Webb was acknowledged King of the Savoy. Any visiting band could depend on catching hell from little Chick, for he was a crazy drummer and shrewd to boot. 

The way I made it out, Chick would wait until the opposition had blown its hottest numbers and then--during a so-so set--would unexpectedly bring his band fresh to the stand and wham into a fine arrangement, like Benny Carter's "Liza", that was hard to beat. Few visiting bands could stand up to this.
