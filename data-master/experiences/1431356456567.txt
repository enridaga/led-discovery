While writing this, I hear Emily playing my 'Nursery Tale' and 'Reconciliation,' and am happy to say that she gathers my intentions from the slightest hint, and can be left to practice without fear of her adopting a fault. As to my little Serena, she has learned her scale in C as a surprise to me, and I, to try her as a timist, have accompanied her in the bass in different rhythms; as this does not put her out I augur well of her taste for music.
