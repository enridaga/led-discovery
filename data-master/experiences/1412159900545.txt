...The Gab. [Caterina Gabrielli] comes on, I think, in favour. She has changed a bad Rondeau, however, for one not much better by Giardini [3 bars music printed] &c the 3rd bar, in spite of Andte motion is hornpipish, to my ears - the 2nd part has some pretty divisions in it, however, which she executes very neatly. - Well but we had Grand Volk again on Sunday to hear little volk play Harpd duos - Son Excellence M de Guignes - Mr le Baron & Made la Maronne Dieden - Lds Sandwich - Ashburnham - Barrington - & Edgecumbe with his Lady - & Mrs Brudenel - with Rauzzini all were molti contenti - as I believe - Mr B[urney] has made a new Duo, less recherché than that of Müthel, consequently, easier to comprehend, - but Basta.
