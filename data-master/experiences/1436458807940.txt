<p>I pride myself on being the first to introduce Madame Melba to the English public. She came to me soon after her arrival from Australia in 1886, and brought me a letter of introduction from a friend in Melbourne. I asked her whether she had brought any songs for me to hear, and she said " Yes." So she sang the grand aria " Ah ! fors' e lui " from La Traviata. I was delighted. It could not have been better sung ; the vocalisation was perfect, and she warbled her runs and shakes without any effort. When I asked her to sing something else, she pleased me very much with her rendering of my song, " Sing, Sweet Bird," and she told me she had sung it a great deal in Australia and made it popular there.</p>
