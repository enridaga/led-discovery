<pre>The echoes of the [Norfolk and Norwich Musical] festival proceedings penetrated <br />even the thick walls of my school classrooms. For the worthy principal of Opie <br />House School (so named after the gifted Norwich painter, John Opie, who had <br />once occupied the red-bricked dwelling which still stands opposite St. Clement's 
Church) was a highly respected member of the festival chorus. He owned a capital <br />bass voice, and was a first-rate musician. What is more, he knew a good singer <br />when he heard one. It was his delight to describe to us how superbly Sims Reeves <br />had sung "Deeper and deeper still"; with what thrilling expression Mlle. Tietjens<br />had phrased "I know that my Redeemer liveth"; how inimitable Mme. Sainton-Dolby <br />had been in "He was despised"; and what a remarkable voice he had heard in the <br />bass solos of the "Messiah" that of the famous Weiss, who composed the music of 
"The Village Blacksmith." </pre>
