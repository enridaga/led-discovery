<p>Freddie Keppard was playin' in a spot across the street and drawin' all the crowds. I was sittin' at the piano and Joe Oliver came over to me and commanded in a nervous, harsh voice, "Get in B-Flat". He didn't even mention a tune, just said "Get in B-flat". I did, and Joe walked out on the sidewalk, lifted his horn to his lips, and blew the most beautiful stuff I have ever heard. People started pouring out of the other spots along the street to see who was blowing all that horn. Before long, our place was full, and Joe came in smiling[.]</p>
