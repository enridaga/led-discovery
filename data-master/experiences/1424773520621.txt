Besides which I have never thanked you for The Second Hurricane and for the book [What to Listen for in Music (1939)]. I now do so. And very sincerely indeed. The Hurricane in score is as satisfactory as it was in performance. It is a very beautiful work, a very rich work, touching, exciting, gay, and a real music-pleasure.
