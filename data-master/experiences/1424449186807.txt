Our rehearsals [Lionel Tertis and Solomon Cutner] over the years included hours of striving to grasp the fullness of the composer’s intentions, and we practised interminably to try to achieve perfect balance of tone. I shall live in enjoyment of those rehearsals to the end of my days. Solomon’s control of the keyboard was absolute. He never made a show of his wonderful technique, so extraordinarily consistent in its accuracy. No matter who the composer was he captured his idiom and portrayed it with the deepest sincerity.
