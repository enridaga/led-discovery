<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">As a child the Festival Hall was a second home. My father was assistant (Reg Frazer) Hall Engineer from the early 50's until his retirement in 1977. I was a great lover of the magic of the ballet and have so many happy memories of the incredible beauty of a Festival Ballet performance, to be followed by backstage visits where the magic would have disappeared and the colour and smell of the greasepaint was all exciting.</p>
