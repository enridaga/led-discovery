<p>The saddest gig was the last I was responsible for. [...] Joe played a set with the house band, a trio of musicians who, to their surprise and delight, found themselves backing a legend.&nbsp; The place was probably half-full...Joe played sweet music: a couple of bossa novas, as promised, plus a few standards.&nbsp; He played, as always, like a fallen angel.&nbsp; And he was totally ignored.&nbsp; The only people who applauded were the band and a small group of us standing at the bar. Musically speaking, it was one of the bleakest evenings of my life.</p>
