<p>I'm just not a pederast, hating especially solo boy sopranos, with the result that certain otherwise respectable, even beautiful, works become off-limits, nothing but mean shrieks to my ears: Falla's <em>El Retablo</em>, for example or Bernstein's <em>Chichester Psalms</em>. If I can take Britten's <em>Turn of the Screw</em>, it's because the little boy therein is meant to be a monster; in<em> Peter Grimes</em> he never opens his mouth.</p>
