He wrote 
and brought out several English operas, one of 
which was The Lily of Killarney, founded on 
Dion Boucicault's Colleen Bawn, which was 
produced at Covent Garden under the direction 
of the Pyne and Harrison Company in 1862, 
and had a great success, and is still " running." 
Benedict had quite caught the spirit of Irish 
music, and his opera is full of melody. Louisa 
Pyne sang the Colleen Bawn, William Harrison, 
Myles-na-Coppalean, and Santley, Danny Man. 
One of the songs in the opera, " Eily Mavour- 
neen," became a great favourite with tenors. I 
was at the first performance.
