<p>The end of that month of February found&nbsp;Brahms and me together in Coblentz on the&nbsp;Rhine, where we were the soloists at one of&nbsp;the regular Symphony Concerts conducted by&nbsp;Maszkowski, a young and enthusiastic musician,&nbsp;a Pole, who afterwards succeeded Bernhard&nbsp;Scholz as conductor of the Orchester Verein in&nbsp;my native Breslau. On the day before the&nbsp;concert there was, as usual (people seemed to&nbsp;have time then), the final full rehearsal &mdash; " Generalprobe "&nbsp;&mdash; to which in most places in&nbsp;Germany the public are admitted. Brahms&nbsp;had played Schumann's Concerto in A Minor&nbsp;and missed a good many notes.</p>
