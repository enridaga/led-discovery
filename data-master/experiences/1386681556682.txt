Remake our studies in the morning and unpack. Chapel at 10.30. Play ten¬nis with Williamson, Hinde II, & Roberts, who (the last 2 are pretty hope¬less) at 4.15-5.15.
Have a slight practise at piano, and a little gramophone (ist mov.s. of Brahm's 4th symph. & Piano quintet, & last of Mozart Jupiter). Feel pretty miserable, especially as there is no news from home.
