<p>It was about this time that Gounod had organised a series of orchestral concerts, consisting of his own new works. These concerts, which were most interesting, were given at St. James's Hall, and he had engaged a fine orchestra. Several new works were performed, such as "The Funeral March of a Marionette." Mr. Edward Lloyd made a successful first appearance as a young English singer at these concerts. I remember complimenting him on his singing after the concerts had finished, and he seemed very pleased at my praise.</p>
