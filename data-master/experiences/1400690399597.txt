I went with Thurlow to a most delightful concert at Queen’s Hall last Saturday. I enclose the programme in case you would like to see it; just throw it away if it makes you too homesick for the bygone days.There are times, I know, when in order to fight or work in this War, one must forget all the previous things apart from it that have been and may be again. But I think when one is strong enough to endure the memory it is better to remember for one’s own sake.

I liked especially the Tschaikovsky symphony.
