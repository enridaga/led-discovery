<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Going to a ballet with my parents The Nutcracker Suite.&nbsp; It was enchanting. The boxes either side have always reminded me of open dressing table drawers circa 1950s. We used to take the train from Surrey (Oxshott) to Waterloo.&nbsp; I was about 9 or 10 at the time.&nbsp;</p>
