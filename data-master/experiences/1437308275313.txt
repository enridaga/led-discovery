<pre>My management at the Opera this season was going on triumphantly. Winter produced <br />a new serious opera, entitled "L'Amore Fraterno." The music was very fine. Mrs. <br />Billington was the Heroine, and sang with all her usual fascination, ably <br />supported by the two tenor singers Viganoni and Braham. Winter also composed the 
music of the grand ballet of "Achilles," which was excellent ; as well as the <br />ballet itself, composed by D'Egville, who in this, as well as many other pieces 
of a similar nature, has proved himself a great master of his art. His powerful <br />acting, and that of the graceful and handsome Deshayes, will long be remembered.
