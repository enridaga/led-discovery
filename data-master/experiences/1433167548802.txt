<p>Here it is meet to refer to the great Canadian festival held in the Abbey in 1917, in the midst of the War. On July 22nd of that year there was celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the Confederation of Canada, and occasion was taken to include in the commemoration a solemn memorial in honour of the sons of the Dominion fallen in the War. Their Majesties The King and Queen attended, the high officers of State and numerous dignitaries at home and from our Colonial Empire were present, while the great building was thronged with a huge congregation, conspicuous being many of the stalwart men whom Canada had splendidly lavished to stand with the liberal peoples in safeguarding civilization. The proceedings were throughout infused with a noble dignity and simplicity. "O Canada," the opening hymn, was sung with great fervour, the organ being supplemented by a fine band belonging to one of the Canadian regiments. Parry's Coronation anthem, "I was glad when they said unto me" preceded the Commemoration and the ascription of Honour to the fallen, recited by the Dean. [...] So in splendour and majesty the service moved to its appointed end. An innovation which might have been startling in the old decorous days that now seem so long ago, was the singing of "The Maple Leaf" before the National Anthem. But its inclusion gave great pleasure to the Canadians present, and sung as also was the opening hymn by the great congregation, accompanied by band and organ, the effect was superb. Those who were privileged to be present brought away an imperishable memory.</p>
