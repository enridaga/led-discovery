Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: Monday, 7th August, 1848 -
I only add further that everything went off quietly yesterday, when the Clubs and the Trades had arranged a so-called German festival procession to the Kreuzberg, with German banners and songs of German unity—while 4,000 peasants from Teltow, in the country, with Prussian banners and a
cross borne before them, advanced towards the same point from the other side — but, happily, the latter were by two hours the earliest, had made their speeches, and sung their songs, and drawn off, before the first-mentioned arrived, to go through similar evolutions. All went off quietly.
