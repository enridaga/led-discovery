<p>There was a band that had few equals in those years, McKinney's Cotton Pickers. Came my first lesson in showmanship, for which Cuba Austin was responsible. Question any musician who knew that wonderful organisation and be assured that Cuba played no little part in the success of the outfit from the standpoints of commercialism and musicianship. Years later, when asked by people about the antics of jitterbugs and so-called ickies, I always tempered my replies, remembering that one night in Chicago, when I stood open-mouthed, completely awed and fascinated, and cheered more lustily, grew far more excited than any of the most obnoxious ickies that ever got in the hair or became a general nuisance to a performing band. No, indeed, I'll never forget the Cotton Pickers, or just say I'll be a long time remembering Cuba Austin.</p>
