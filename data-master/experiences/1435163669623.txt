<p>" Shakspeare's Jubilee" was revived this year, and acted five nights to crowded houses; all the performers walked in the procession, as the different characters of his plays. Mrs. Siddons personated the Tragic, and Miss Farren the Comic Muse.. I had to sing the following lines, written by the present worthy Alderman Birch, author, amongst others, of three very popular musical pieces : " The Mariners ;" "The Adopted Child ;" and The Smugglers :" they were received with unqualified approbation. AIR "The Mulberry Tree." "The cypress and yew tree for sorrow renown'd, And tear-dropping willow shall near thee be found ; All nature shall droop, and united complain, For Shakspeare in Garrick hath died o'er again." In the procession I walked, or rather danced down, as Benedick, and Miss Pope as Beatrice, in "Much Ado about Nothing;" both masqued. Moody came to me one evening, and requested I would lend my domino and masque to a friend of his, who wished to see the audience from the stage, and who would do exactly as I did, having frequently seen me and Miss Pope. On he went, but appeared instantly planet struck, and stood perfectly still ; nor did he move until pushed off; the rage and disappointment of Miss Pope, who was an excellent dancer (and I not a very bad one,) at not receiving the applause which she had always brought, was very great ; she stormed, and raged, and vowed vengeance against poor me. I wrote to her in the morning, asking her pardon, and signed myself " The Fair Penitent ," she took the letter in good part, and wrote me a friendly answer, admonishing me to be guarded against bad advisers : and to the day of her death was kindly attentive to me, but she never forgave Moody, by whose advice I had transgressed.</p>
