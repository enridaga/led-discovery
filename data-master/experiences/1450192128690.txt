<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">But as for the charge that &lsquo;never was an opera less theatrical or more undramatic&rsquo;, I can say that a few months ago in Stockholm it was one of the most dramatic theatrical experiences in my life, and as the performance I saw was the thirty-fifth sold-out one in four off-season months (in a city with one eighth the population of Los Angeles), I do not think my reaction is egocentric. </span></p>
