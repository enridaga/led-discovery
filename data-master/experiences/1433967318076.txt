On Monday morning, immediately after breakfast, we attended mass [in Ghent], which was performed by the choir, organ, and full orchestra, with not less than forty priests or monks assisting in the service, though not more than ten or twelve spectators and devotees were present. I heard a MS. mass of the organist's, written in excellent style. The voices were not good, but the wind instruments were superior to any we had met with in Flanders.
