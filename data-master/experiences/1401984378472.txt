...I stood with the others on the quay at Boulogne and watched Lord Roberts’ little coffin brought down to be put on a ship to go back to England. He had died at the age of eighty-two while visiting the Indian troops at the Front. It was a wonderful sight and a most moving one. A little coffin - a very small one because he was very short, of course... And the band played ‘The Last Post’ and then ‘The Dead March in Saul’. It was a most moving occasion. I shall never forget it. I can see it now.
