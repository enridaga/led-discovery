<p class="MsoNormal">The guys would put the wheels [of wagons with bands] together and tie them so the band that got outplayed could not run away. That made us stay right there and fight it out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We ran across Ory&rsquo;s band. Quite natural the Ory band had the best of it all. Besides Ory, my brother [clarinetist Johnny Dodds] was in that band, and Joe Oliver. Of course we didn't have a chance, but we had to stay there. When we played a number there wouldn't be much applause, but when Ory played we would hear a lot of people whistling and applauding. When we heard that, quite naturally our courage went down, and we wanted to get away. But the wheels were tied together. It lasted about an hour and a half or two hours and it was very discouraging.</p>
