When I finished playing, the audience, consisting mostly of refined diplomats, applauded wildly. Having come out for bows, I was thinking about what to play for an encore, when Roosevelt, who must not have been the greatest fan of classical music, gave a sign with his cigarette holder from his wheelchair, and the military band blasted out Sousa’s “Stars and Stripes Forever”. I was a bit taken aback, but at least I had the pleasure of hearing the band: they were terrific!
