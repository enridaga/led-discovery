Having however all a great desire to hear the celebrated organ in the Cathedral there (said to be the largest but one then in the world) we accordingly sent to the organist, who to our great disappointment was not to be found. We thought however that we might as well see the church & gratify ourselves at least with a sight of the organ, which it was well worth, as with its ornaments it almost fill'd up with whole west end of the nave or middle aisle of the church. There were also 2 other small organs in different parts of this church, which we were told were used for different purposes & common occasions, the grand organ being only used on Sundays & festivals... At length however to my great joy the organist being found came (with the bellows blower) tripping into the church, as pleas'd I suppose in the anticipation of his golden fee (which is always a Ducat with about half a Crown for the blower) as we were with that of the celestial harmony we were to hear. We now therefore ascended the organ loft with him, who shew'd us the inside of the choir or small organ in front & explain'd to us the nature of the several rows of pipes we saw therein after which he shew'd us (as it was mark'd on a stick) the diameter of the largest pipe in the great organ, thro' which we could each of us have got, except my father, whose diameter (tho' he was very large & corpulent) very little exceeded that of the pipe, which was 32 feet in length. Having shewn us these things, he went to work both hand & fot upon the Great Organ, there being a compleat sett of large keys of 2 octaves for the feet, which he seem'd to use as dextrously as his hands, the effect of which altogether was astonishly grand, & seem'd to fill the whole church. We however finding it too powerful for the organ loft (the worst place to hear an organ, to any advantage) went down & seated ourselves in some of the chairs & detach'd pews below, where we were much pleased with the effect. After having played the Full Organ a short time he used some of the fancy stops, with which we were much pleased, particularly with the Vox Humana & Dulcian. He also by way of contrast, gave us an admirable flourish of trumpets & kettledrums, with some whimsical imitation of birds, particularly the cuckow, which he introduc'd with good effect, after which he concluded with a grand piece upon the Full Organ, using the pedals as he did at first.
