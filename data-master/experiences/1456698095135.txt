<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">All the concerts, meetings and conversations at the Festival [Second Modern Music Festival] were great events for me. Much of what I have written over the last forty years was performed here in a mere ten days. I saw the whole of my career, from the First Symphony to my most recent work, the orchestrated version of the cycle <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">From Jewish Folk Poetry</em>, first performed at one of the Festival concerts. Almost fifty of my works were played &ndash; considerably more than at the recent Festival in Edinburgh. </span></p>
