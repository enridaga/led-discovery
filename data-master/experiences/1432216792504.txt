A friend contributes this incident : " Twenty years ago, when the State prison at Sing Sing, New York, had women as well as men within its walls, a lady used to visit the women's department. Every Sunday afternoon the inmates were permitted to come out and sit in the corridor to hear her talk, and to sing hymns with her. One day some of the women rebelled against an order of the matron, and a terrible scene followed. Screams, threats, ribaldry, and profanity filled the air. It was said, by those who knew, that an uprising among the women prisoners was worse and more difficult to quell than one among the men. The matron hastily sent to the men's department for help. Suddenly a voice rose clear and strong above the tumult, singing a favourite song of the prisoners.

Yield not to temptation, 
For yielding is sin ; 
Each victory will help you 
Some other to win. 
Fight manfully onward, 
Dark passions subdue ; 
Look ever to Jesus, 
He'll carry you through.

There was a lull ; then one after another joined in the sacred song ; and presently, with one accord, all formed into line and marched quietly to their
cells."
