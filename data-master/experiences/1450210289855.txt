<p class="MsoNormal">There was a Mr. Davidson, who conducted for part of a season only. He was followed by Mr. Charles C. Perkins, who filled the office of conductor and president of the society for several years. Mr. Perkins was a devoted patron of music, and indeed of all the fine arts. [&hellip;] <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>he mingled actively in the musical life of the city, and for years he had a musical evening at his house each week. Chamber music by the Mendelssohn Quintette Club and our best local or visiting pianists did good service then and there by familiarizing devotees of music with excerpts of the best kind. At Mr. Perkins&rsquo;s house was heard for the first time Schumann&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Piano Quintette</em>, with Mr. William Scharfenberg (recently deceased) at the piano. I remember the occurrence well. We young artists were so stirred up and excited by the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Quintette </em>that when we ended its last note we simply turned our parts back again to the beginning and played the whole work once more, con amore.</p>
