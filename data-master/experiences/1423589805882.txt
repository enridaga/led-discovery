I knew I was surrounded by first class musicians. Like myself, they'd been classically trained and had years of big band experience. A few of them were also great jazz players. Fred [Waring] had the new singers perform their audition material before the entire group. It was scary but they did beautifully. Naturally, they were all talented. Almost every member of the choir was a graduate of Eastman School of Music.
