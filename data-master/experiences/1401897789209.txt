This morning Muz and I walked to Piccadilly, down St James's, the Mall, past Buckingham Palace and home by Constitution Hill to see the procession. The weather was glorious, frosty and bright, and never has London looked more beautiful...
     Going past Constitution Hill, by the side of the Palace, there was a regular sea of small silk American flags, and these fluttered from the caps of various Corps of American women, and soldiers and sailors, grouped along the pavement. The women were all in uniform, Red Cross, Police, YWCA etc., and they were chanting in soft sweet voices refrains of American catch-songs, led by a man with a megaphone:

     Over there!
     Over there!
     We won’t come back 
     till it’s over, over there!

Many of the sailors and soldiers were dancing in pairs their funny bunny-hug and foxtrot steps.
