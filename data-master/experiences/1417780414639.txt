The head usher [at the Capitol Theater on Broadway] was named Mr. Brooks, a genial easy-going person, slightly bent and a true Runyanesque character. Mr. Brooks went to the races every day during the season, placed bets with his personal bookie, had a copy of the racing form handy at all times— and he loved jazz. When he found out I was a musician and liked big bands, he invited me to see a new English import, George Shearing, on the piano at the “Royal Roost Jazz Club.” Seeing this outstanding jazz pianist was a revelation to me. It was even more so for Mr. Brooks. He was in absolute ecstasy, eyes closed, moaning, moving his head like Shearing, who was blind. I was as astonished by Mr. Brooks’s performance as I was by Shearing’s playing. It was a tremendous first experience for me.
