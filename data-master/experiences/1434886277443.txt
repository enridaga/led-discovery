It was a restless winter for me, as I had to travel a good deal. My work at Pleyel’s entailed frequent visits to Paris, and I had to attend the rehearsals of ‘Mavra’ and ‘Renard’, which were just going to be produced by Diaghileff at the Paris Opera House, thanks to the generous help of Princess Edmond de Polignac. / This necessitated several visits to Monte Carlo, where the choreography of ‘Renard’ was being created by Bronislava Nijinska, sister of the famous dancer and herself and excellent dancer endowed with a profoundly artistic nature, and, in contrast to her brother, gifted with a real talent for choreographic creation. / Diaghileff and I also confided to her the direction of the artists acting in ‘Mavra ‘as regards plastic movement. She had marvellous ideas, which were unfortunately balked by the inability of the singers to subject themselves to a technique and discipline in the practice of which they were unversed.
