<p>When Dizzy [Gillespie] joined Cab Calloway's band he was always energetic and was always experimenting. [&hellip;] This was around 1941.</p>
<p>Well, Dizzy and Milt Hinton, between those two-and-a-half hour shows at the Cotton Club (and they were very strenuous shows) would retire to the roof. Dizzy would blow his new ideas in progression, and he and Hinton would experiment on different ideas and melodic patterns, and they would suggest that I come up and join them. But after that two-and-a-half hour show, sometimes I'd go up and sometimes I wouldn't. Because what they were doing called for a lot of mental concentration on harmonies. It was very interesting, but I couldn't see going up there and wasting energies on something not commercial.</p>
