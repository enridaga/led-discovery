<p>I've still something to say about Sontag. She has some entirely original ornamentation which is enormously effective, but in a different way from Pagamni. Perhaps it is because her genre is smaller. It is as though she breathes over the stalls of the theatre a scent of the freshest flowers, which caresses deliriously but rarely moves one to tears. Radziwill declared that she acts and sings Desdemona's last scene in <em>Otello</em> so movingly that no one can refrain from tears. As a matter of fact I mentioned it to her and asked whether she would not give us that scene in costume (she is said to be a perfect actress as well). She replied that it was true she had often seen tears in the spectators' eyes, but it exhausts her to act on the stage and she had vowed to appear in operatic roles as rarely as possible.</p>
