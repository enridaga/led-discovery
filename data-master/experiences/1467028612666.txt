<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">I remained unprogressively under [Miss B.&rsquo;s] musical care for some two years, during which time I had the first great pianistic experience of my life; she had persuaded my mother to let her take me over to Liverpool to hear Paderewski.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember that Saturday afternoon vividly.&nbsp; The (old) Liverpool Philharmonic Hall &ndash; since burnt down &ndash; was filled to capacity.&nbsp; It was also filled, I noticed, with a murky haze, which was not altogether pleasing to my nostrils but which was soon forgotten when Paderewski began to play.&nbsp; He was thirty-one at the time and, with his great mop of auburn hair, was at the height of his popularity.&nbsp; I cannot give an account of that recital for obvious reasons, I can only say that it clinched my resolve to become a musician &ndash; and a long-haired one at that!&nbsp; [&hellip;]</p>
