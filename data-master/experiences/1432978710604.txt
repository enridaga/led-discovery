<p>Arrear Notes at Llanrwst After supper Wm. took me to see Dr. Williams - he and his wife were said to be acq[uai]nt[e]d. with old songs - I found these were not F[olk] songs but composed - some Eng[lish] w[ith] W[elsh] words. I sang Deryn Du - the Dr's father - an old man hunched up in easy chair - smoking a short pipe - wheezed out "I used to know that when I was a boy" he proceeded to recite the words but unfortunately could not sing a note - He knew the words of half a dozen &amp; two or three ballads that were new to me.</p>
