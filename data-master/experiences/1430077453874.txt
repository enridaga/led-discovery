Rehearsal at the Concert Hall in the evening. Haydn's B Major Symphony, Overture, Ossian, Gade, the second movement of Berlioz's Symphony, 'Harold in Italy' ('Marche des Pelerins'), and a triumphal march by Best, for next week's concert. Tolerably satisfied with the orchestra, but still further convinced of the necessity of the intended reforms. Gade's overture is pretty and shows good intentions, but is wanting in strength and in breadth of idea. In the present dearth, however, its appearance must be accepted with thankfulness. Berlioz's movement carried me back to the dear old days, and therefore, perhaps, gave me exceptional pleasure. But how fresh, even at the present day, is the old master's, Haydn's, Symphony!
