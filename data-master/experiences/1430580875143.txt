<p>We played a gig at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, and then we hit Kiel Auditorium in Miles's home town of St. Louis. Kiel is a huge, drafty old barn of a hall, long used for political rallies and the like. The acoustics were terrible, but that was the least of our problems. Miles just didn't look right--he had a grayish pallor, and his energy level was low. He went on stage and played listlessly for a while, letting the band carry the show.</p>
