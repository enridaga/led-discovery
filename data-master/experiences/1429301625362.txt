Other times [in New York], Lippy and the bunch would get together, get James [P. Johnson] cornered, find a taxi, or maybe walk over to someone's house, and ring the bell. This would be 3 or 4 a.m. â€¦

"This is Lippy," the answer would be. "I got James with me."

Those doors flew open. Lights switched on. Cupboards emptied, and everybody took a little taste. Then it was me, or maybe Fats, who sat down to warm up the piano. After that, James took over. Then you got real invention --magic, sheer magic.
