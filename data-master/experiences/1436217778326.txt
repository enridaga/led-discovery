At the performance last night, a minor mishap. The concerto opens with six fortissimo blasts from the brass followed immediately by the organ's entrance, quiet and smooth. No organ! Leonard had forgotten to turn on the blowers. A quick flick of the wrist, and all was well. But twixt the blast and the flick, and eternity. I was very, very pleased with Leonard, with Hangen, and with the whole young orchestra.
