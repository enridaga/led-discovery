<p>Coincidence this morning delivered the disc <em>Classical Barbra</em>. Once I wrote that Streisand could handle certain arias if she wished, but her timbre is geared in other directions. The point now is demonstrated by this record, starting with the title. Except for the Handel, none of her 'numbers' are classical - they are what <em>l'homie moyen sensual</em> things of as classical. Streisand's error is to aim at her mass public rather than to put out an edition for just a few thousand dear friends.</p>
