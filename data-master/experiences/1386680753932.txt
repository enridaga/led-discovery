Still absent from school work. Everso much more snow, it is quite deep, allowing as well as skating, tobogganing, in the afternoon. But of course I'm not allowed to go out!
In the afternoon after a lie down I listen to the wireless, a concert, orchestra & Paul Wittenstein [Wittgenstein] (I think that's his name, the left-handed pianist). Quite good, tho' I didn't like the programme very much.
