Listen to Bartok concert broadcast 9.0-10.30. Suite no. 1 contained some charming moments, but meandered 'a la Liszt &' Strauss much. Rhapsody (with composer at piano) more striking & the "Amazing Mandarin" most original of all.* I cannot say I love this music, but it is amazingly clever & descriptive.
