Not long ago we went as far as Nebraska, to the town of Omaha, where there also are many Czechs. I went there to see Mr. Rosewater, a Czech from Bukovany, who, though a Jew, is a very nice gentleman. He is a personal friend of Harrison and Cleveland and many outstanding political men. He got rich here and his journal, the Omaha Bee, has had the greatest influence in the state. On the whole he is the most honoured and respected person here. We stayed at his home for three days. In the evening the Czechs came to play a serenade form me, and as were leaving, an American band arrived and played several pieces for me. There was even a banquet and we felt very gay and I enjoyed it a great deal.
