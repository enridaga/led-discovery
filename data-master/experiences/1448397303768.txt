<p>[W]e left London on Thursday, 29th of July, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, in the steamer for Antwerp, where we arrived at six the next morning. We stopped long enough to visit the Cathedral, and the Church of St. James, where we heard a part of a mass sung by the priests, with organ accompaniment. The effect was solemn at the early morning hour, but there was nothing in the performance peculiar, or differing from what one hears in all Roman Catholic places.</p>
