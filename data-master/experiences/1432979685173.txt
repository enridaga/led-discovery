How prettily trippingly neatly these Aber people speak Welsh! - Toiled up the dusty road to the Lib's site - dull showery - Interminable wait - Moelwyn Choir sing piano intros to everything. - Cadwaladr with his white hair & white moustache looks fierce, conducts with energy and style as if this were the chief part of the show. The choir sing with great vigour and show but with little effect. Their singing of Machynlleth was ridiculous - too quick and without proper attention to the words. The ceremony was unimpressive in the extreme and the Royal party moved out while the choir were singing Hob y Deri - words in praise of King George.
