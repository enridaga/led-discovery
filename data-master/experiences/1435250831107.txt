<p>Now there was a woman! I mean Bessie Smith was ALL woman! I remember about 1923 or 1924 [&hellip; ,] the Lyric Theatre in New Orleans [&hellip;] was her headquarters. I think she must have played there four or five times a year maybe. And man! She always did pack that house, every show, with big lines always waiting.</p>
<p>Her act was really something. She'd have a regular recording studio setup on the stage, with that big old horn they used to use and everything. Then she'd sing thing like "Gulf Coast Blues" and "Baby Won't You Please Come Home" in that big wonderful voice of hers, and, believe me, she looked like a queen up there. She was a <em>big</em>&nbsp;woman with that beautiful bronze color and stern features. Stately, just like a queen. [&hellip;]</p>
<p>Yeah, she was ALL woman-- really Queen of the Blues.</p>
