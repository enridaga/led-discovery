" While engaged in evangelistic work in western Pennsylvania," writes the Rev. A. J. Furman, " I saw the people deeply moved by singing. I had begun my preparation to preach in the evening, from the text, ' Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian,' when it occurred to me that if Mrs. B , an estimable Christian and a most excellent vocalist, would sing, ' Almost persuaded ' as a solo, great good might be done. At once I left my study and called on the lady, who consented to sing as requested. When I had finished my sermon, she sang the song with wonderful pathos and power. It moved many to tears. Among them was the principal of the high school, who could not resist the appeal through that song. He and several others found the Pearl of
Great Price before the next day. After the close of the sermon, I spoke to Mrs. B about the effect of her singing, and she told me that she had been praying earnestly all that afternoon, that she might so sing as to win sinners for her Saviour that night, and her prayers were surely answered."
