The Eldorado [Club] was in a cellar and Jimmie Noone had the orchestra there. Many musicians and visitors from many countries came to hear his little orchestra at the Eldorado. 

Jimmie Noone was the "sweetest" clarinetist who ever existed. He knew it and he often confined himself to the style to which he owed his success. But when Noone let himself go, using the high register of his instrument, his tone lost nothing of its beauty. Noone was a calm man. His voice was gentle but he wasn't any less energetic.
