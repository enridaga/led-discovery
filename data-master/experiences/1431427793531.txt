He is still young in the art, but his powers as an executant are marvellous; he has an exquisitely delicate touch, and performs astonishing 'tours de force' with his left hand; but alas! his playing is restricted to twelve pieces, which he has toiled at incessantly. He has no style, and cannot read music, as our little girl discovered. You shall hear the story: he was trying over with me some 'Scale pieces,' and played the 'Pupil's part,' but was so often at fault with the time, that Clara ran up to her mamma, calling out (luckily in English, which Dreyschock probably did not understand), 'Mamma, hasn't Mr. D. learned the scales?' You imagine my horror at the 'infant terrible.'
