The Symphony Society that met at the Pavilion, Brighton. was never very strong, but we blazed away at the principle overtures, "Der Freyschiitz," "Ma- saniello," "Figaro," "Dame Blanche," &ldquo;Cheval de Bronze&rdquo;; we shuffled through HAYDN'S symphonies, and scrambled over MOZART'S "Jupiter" and BEETHOVEN'S 8th, very much to our own satisfaction. I remember the disgust of OURY when an enterprising amateur let off a pistol behind the platform to reinforce the sudden explosion on the drum in the Surprise movement.</span></p>
