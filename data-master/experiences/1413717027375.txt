After breakfast at 9.30, I go for a long walk over the Downs with Mrs. Bridge. After that Mr. Bridge looks at my choral work (Thy K’s B. [Thy King’s Birthday]) – he is mod. pleased with my progress. Lunch with Miss Fass. Play tennis abit in afternoon with Mr. Bridge, & again after tea – he really is remarkably good. Tea at Miss Fass’ & dinner (the 3 of us) back here. Listen to a Stratton Quartet concert on wireless at Miss Fass’s. She lends me some madrigals.
