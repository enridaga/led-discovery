Whether he had been too much hurried in the study of his music, or whether he lacked capacity for his task, poor Felice completely broke down. Fever was failure more complete. The public was not even able to arrive, under the circumstances, at any judgment of the music, and "Zampa" was necessarily withdrawn after only one night's performance.</span></p>
