<p>You would hear music twenty-four hours a day in Kansas City. Practically all the little places had piano and a set of drums. I had a little group in one of them with Lester Young and George Hunt on trombone (he later took the solo on the Basie record of "One O'Clock Jump") and Ed Durham on guitar. Any drummer who wanted to could sit in because I could play piano.</p>
<p>The place was run by "The Chief". His name was Ellis Burton. He was a father to a lot of musicians [&hellip;, who] could always go to him to get a favor or food.</p>
