<p>Side by side with learning to play the piano&nbsp;I was taught the elements of singing by a&nbsp;Mr. Hirschberg, and harmony by Professor&nbsp;Schaffer, under whose conductorship I sang,&nbsp;when a little over nine years old, the soprano&nbsp;solo in Mendelssohn's <em>Hear my Prayer</em> at&nbsp;a concert of the Church Music Society. How&nbsp;I loved that beautiful air "Oh, for the wings,&nbsp;for the wings of a dove," and how I flushed&nbsp;with elation and pleasure when I received a&nbsp;bright new thaler (three shillings) into the&nbsp;bargain!&nbsp;</p>
