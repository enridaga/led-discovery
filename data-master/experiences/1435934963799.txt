<p>A performance last night on Channel 30 of Ravel's <em>Concerto in G</em> by Michelangeli, Celibidache conducting. Michelangeli has always represented what I most dislike in piano playing, especially in the playing of Ravel. In 'melodic passages' his left hand forever anticipates the right, a nineteenth-century mannerism inappropriate to the concision of harmony innate in Ravel. Celibidache meanwhile is concision personified: the music is a corpse laid out for his exquisite incisions.</p>
