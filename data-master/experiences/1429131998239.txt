I went to Liszt's reception on Thursday and was delighted (1) by his playing, so calm, clear, correct, refined–so entirely unlike the style of the so-called 'Liszt School'–(2) by his face. Directly he sat down he dismissed that very artificial smile, which he always wears, and his face assumed the most beautiful serene look with enormous power and repose in it. It was quite a wonderful sight.
