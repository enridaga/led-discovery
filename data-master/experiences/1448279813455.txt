<p>The next evening (20th February), I attended one of the cheap, eating, drinking, smoking, talking, sitting-round-the-table, wearing-hat, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., Concerts. The Orchestra numbered about thirty performers. It was really a fine Orchestra, though it appeared feeble in strings, (having only four violins on a part,) after listening to the Gewandhaus band. Beethoven&rsquo;s Sym. No. 7, was played, and also Weber&rsquo;s Overture to Oberon &mdash; with other music, including a very excellent new overture (manuscript) by W. Herfuth. The contrast was really a very excellent one, but it suffered in comparison with that of the preceding evening; and the room was too much filled with tobacco smoke and noise for comfort.</p>
