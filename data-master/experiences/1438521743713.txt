Then, at the end of July, it <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was withdrawn, and the house closed until November, when an English version of Andre Messager's successful comic opera &ldquo;La Basoche'' <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was brought out. This did fairly well, but it is <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>noteworthy to-day only from the fact that it enabled Mr. David Bispham, by his clever singing <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and acting, to make a deep impression at his first <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>appearance upon the London stage. D'Oyly <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Carte now doubtless imagined that he possessed <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the foundation of a repertory, and he revived <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Ivanhoe'' to run alternately with &ldquo;La Basoche"&mdash; Barton McGuckin filling the title-role, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>while Medora Henson was the Rowena, But the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>public quickly undeceived the too sanguine manager. It stayed severely away. The drawing power <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of Sullivan's beautiful opera had been exhausted; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and on January 16, just a fortnight short of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>twelve months after its auspicious opening, the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Royal English Opera'' was finally closed &mdash; the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>strangest commingling of success and failure ever <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!</span></p>
