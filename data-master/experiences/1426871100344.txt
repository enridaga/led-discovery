I also played the basset-horn obligato to the aria "Non piu [sic] di fiori" from "La Clemenza" at a pre-war Sunday concert at the Opera House when he [Albert Coates] was conducting and his wife (Vera de Villiers) was singing. He put the whole aria down a semi-tone which made it virtually unplayable though I did my best.
