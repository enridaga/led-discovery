Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 10 Dec. 1750 -
On Tuesday morning next, the rehearsal of the Messiah is to be for the benefit of debtorsâ€”on Thursday evening it will be performed. I hope to go to both ; our new, and therefore favourite performer Morella is to play the first fiddle, and conduct the whole. I am afraid his French taste will prevail ; I shall not be able to endure his introducing froth and nonsense in that sublime and awful piece of music. What makes me fear this will be the case, is, that in the closing of the eighth concerto of Corelli, instead of playing it clear and distinct, he filled
it up with frippery and graces which quite destroyed the effect of the sweet notes, and solemn pauses that conclude it.
