<p>Congregational chanting is very good in some of the non-conformist churches; it was really excellent in Rev. Mr. Brock's church this evening. The chant was in unison[. ...] Of course, the organist played full harmony. The fine old tune, Tallis, (Cantica Laudis, p. 307,) was sung to the 23d Psalm,&nbsp;</p>
<p>"My shepherd will supply my need."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The organ is very well played by an amateur; yet he has the habit of stopping his instrument at the end of each stanza, so as to break up all flow of melody. We hardly know a worse habit than this, which we have heard in several places where the&nbsp;organ is used in non-conformist places of worship. An introductory voluntary was played, but no afterlude, or marching the people out. The congregation is always large at this church, almost every seat being occupied; yet there are no congregations of three or five thousand people here, as we find in different parts of Germany.</p>
