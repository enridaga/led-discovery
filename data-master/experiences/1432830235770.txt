     My Father... asked [Omai] very much to favour us with a song of his own Country.... He seemed to be quite ashamed, - but we all joined, and made the request so earnestly, that he could not refuse us: but he was either so modest that he blushed for his own performance, or his Residence here had made him so conscious of the barbarity of the South Sea Islands' Music, that he could hardly prevail with himself to comply with our request. And when he did, he began two or three Times before he could acquire Voice or firmness to go on. 
     Nothing can be more curious, or less pleasing, than his singing Voice, he seems to have none, and Tune, or air, hardly seem to be aimed at; so queer, wild, strange a rumbling of sounds never did I before hear; and very contentedly can I go to the Grave if I never do again. His song is the only thing that is savage belonging to him....
     Though the singing of Omy is so barbarous, his Actions and the expression he gives to each Character, are so original and so diverting, that they did not fail to afford us very great entertainment, of the risible kind.
