<p>Perhaps the following incidents may interest my readers; they happened during the first three performances of <em>Tannhauser</em> in Paris, the first of which was on March 13th, 1861, now fifty-two years ago. The Emperor Louis Napoleon and the Empress Eugenie were present on the first night, and the opera was received in cold, significant silence. On the second night the audience, from the second act onward, made a great row, fighting among themselves and disturbing the singers. On the third night there was a terrific noise, and no member of the audience could hear a note of the music the whole evening, but the one success of the opera was the appearance of the sporting dogs, which the Emperor had specially lent from the royal kennels. One of my friends played the part of the page who had to lead the dogs on the stage towards the end of the first act, and he told me recently that the audience cheered them and called them before the curtain, shouting, "Bravo les chiens !" "Bis les chiens! on vous rappelle!" But the page would not comply with their sarcastic demands. Now all this has been changed, and whenever Wagner's operas are performed in Paris the house is crowded, and even the <em>Ring</em> has become very popular.</p>
