<p>After&nbsp;<em>Matelots&nbsp;</em>came&nbsp;<em>Les Biches</em>, which Poulenc claims to have completely revised and re-orchestrated. In fact it is just as it was before: a bit of tango, a little something filched from Beethoven, a slice of&nbsp;<em>Life for the Tsar</em>. A dilettante - that is the definition of Poulenc, and his ballet was thrown into stark relief alongside&nbsp;<em>Matelots</em>, which is the work of a master and succeeded in sinking its companion without trace. One image, only one, of&nbsp;<em>Les Biches&nbsp;</em>will remain, and that is the seductive silhouette of Nemchinova*.</p>
