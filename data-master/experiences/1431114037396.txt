About this time I was drafted into the stage band at Covent Garden, employed to play behind the scenes in the Ballo in Maschera and on the stage (in dominos) in Don Giovanni. In order to hear as much of the fine singing (of Graziani and others) I took care to be in my place as long as possible before our services were required.
