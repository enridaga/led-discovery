<p>Keppard? Well, compare him to Perez, who was the best teacher. <em>He</em>&nbsp;read very well. Keppard was just the opposite, all barrelhouse. He played two or three notes a bar and was called King Keppard. He was tops. He didn't have a lot of execution. Liquor killed Keppard finally. He used to carry a water bottle full of liquor under his arm. One time a fellow said, "We don't allow liquor on the job". Keppard picked up the bottle and got ready to go. The guy told him to stay.</p>
