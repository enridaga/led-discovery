Docs." was to have included Verdi and Grieg, but these composers were <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>unable to accept the invitation of the University. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>However, the remaining four constituted a sufficiently illustrious group, and the concert at the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Cambridge Guildhall was of memorable interest. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Saint-Saens played for the first time the brilliant <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>pianoforte fantasia &ldquo;Africa," which he had lately <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>written at Cairo; Max Bruch directed a choral <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>scene from his &ldquo;Odysseus"; and Boito conducted <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the prologue from &ldquo;Mefistofele, " Georg Henschel <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>singing the solo part. Finally, Tschaikowsky directed the first performance in England of his <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>fine symphonic poem, &ldquo;Francesca da Rimini,'' a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>work depicting with graphic power the tormenting winds wherein Dante beholds Francesca in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Second Circle" and hears her recital of her <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>sad story, as described in the fifth canto of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Inferno.'' The ovation that greeted each master in turn will be readily imagined.</span></p>
