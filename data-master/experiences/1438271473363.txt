<p>Early dinner, after which listen to two masterpieces worthily performed. From Vienna, Mahler's adorable 4th Symphony - the lovely Vien. Symph. under Zemlinsky, with Annie Michaldey, as a lovely soloist A truly sensitive show. Then from Regional - F.B's last trio well played by the Grinke - full of great stuff, with impeccable workmanship. Hats off - gentlemen, even if they have to be forcibly removed! Now for war!!</p>
