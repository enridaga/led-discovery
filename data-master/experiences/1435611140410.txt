<p>Having seen all the cathedrals in England, except Chichester and Winchester, on my way to the Isle of Wight I stopped at the latter city to view that imposing structure. I entered during the afternoon service, just as the anthem began, and heard the organ without seeing it. I was at the western end, and was riveted to the spot on viewing the splendid architecture. The eye traverses the roof in one unbroken line of five hundred and fifty feet, the organ being removed to one side of the choir that it may not interrupt this magnificent view. The movement that was performing I recognised to be the chorus ' O, Father, whose almighty power,' in Judas Maccabeus, and it well harmonised with the solemn grandeur of the place.</p>
