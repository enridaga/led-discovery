This evening the whole population are enjoying themselves out of doors, listening to a very fine band of music, serenading a general officer just arrived from Berne, to review the troops; and of which we have the full benefit, from his being in this house. A dense crowd are as quiet and seemingly attentive to the performance as any assembly at a concert. I am going to bed, listening to the fine music of Beethoven on one side of my apartment, mingling with the sound of the flowing Rhine on the other. Montaigne, I think it is, who mentions that, when a child, his father had him awoke every morning by music, to render his disposition amiable and his ideas cheerful; I wish that the sweet sounds attending my going to sleep may have their influence in improving my character.
