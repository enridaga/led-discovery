<p>I have often played to Goethe in the morning hours. He wanted to get an idea of how music has developed and wishes to hear the music of different composers in chronological order. He seemed rather wary of Beethoven; but I could not spare him this acquaintance because he had to hear &ldquo;Where sounds had turned to,&rdquo; and so I played for him the first movement of the C minor Symphony, which he liked very much. He was delighted with the overture by Johann Sebastian Bach, the one in D major with the trumpets, which I played on the piano as well as I could; &ldquo;in the beginning it sounds so distinguished and pompous, one really sees the crowd of smartly attired people walking down the steps of a broad staircase.&rdquo; And I also played the Inventions and quite a few pieces of the Well-Tempered Clavichord.</p>
