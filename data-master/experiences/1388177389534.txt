I came just now from heareing the examination of Nayler and his Proselites who haveing before the Committee upon reexamination own'd what he receivd and they what they gave him as Christ, after all being askd what he had to say made this evasion (which I pickd as well as I could out of his uncouth and unusuall expression, whose canting language with that of his disciples I made an hard shift some times to understand) That Christ being the same to day and for ever what honour was given to him at Jerusalem might be given to him where and in whomesoever he is manifested from god.

after their examination I went to the roome by the painted chamber whether the committee orderd them to retire where I found Nailer one man more and 3 or 4 women of the tribe all with white gloves and the womens heads in white baggs. their carriage was strange to me, one of the women made a continued humming noise longer then the reach of an ordinari breath without motion either of lips or breath that I who stood next her could perceive, shee ceaseing another sung holy holy holy with the addition of some other words, then the other (her song being donne) gave some of their ordinary exhortacon with their common mixture of judgment and threatning and after a little pause they went over the same round, without answering any questions which by the standers by were proposd, and those which by the committee were urgd. I observd they either not answerd or did it with a great deale of suttlety besides the cover and cunning of that language which others and I beleeve they them selves scarce understand, but I am weary of the Quakers and returne to my freinds with you, to home I desire to be remembred, not thinke when I began that this subject should have soe long kept my pen from them
