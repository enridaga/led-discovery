On the 26th. the 13th Regim't passing through Romsey & halting there for the night their band in the afternoon played the Overture in Artaxerxes & other pieces in such a style that Mr Shaw & I with many others finding them to be a capital band got leave for them to play in a large room at the Dolphin in the even'g where we with many others went to hear them & sho'd have been much pleased with our evening's entertainment had not we as well as the band been considerably annoy'd al the time with a number of people smoking their pipes. Finding that the Master of the Band was on account of the smoke frequently obliged to take the clarinet out of his mouth my patience was so exhausted that I co'd not help hinting the effect it had to Mess'rs Bigss Isdell etc. who were some of the smokers, but all I got from it was that "they knew it was ungenteel & all that, but they came to smoke their pipes & hear the music." They however played about 2 hours, & several excellent pieces in a fine style (being one of the completest bands I ever met with) for which we raised them a pretty good subscription.
