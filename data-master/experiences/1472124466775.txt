<p>So I went to work there at Tansil's, and the guy says, "I got a little kid clarinet player coming out tomorrow night to sit in with the band. He's too young to hire."</p>
<p>Well, it developed that the kid was Benny Goodman--aged fifteen at most. And I thought to myself, "This little punk play clarinet? He's too small to blow it."</p>
<p>The little punk climbed up on the stand and got his horn ready. Then he played <em>Rose of the Rio Grande</em>&nbsp;which is a hard tune--I mean the changes for those days were difficult. This little monkey played about sixteen choruses of <em>Rose</em>&nbsp;and I just sat there with my mouth open.</p>
<p>Benny blew the hell out of that clarinet, and I almost died hearing him do it. So I latched on to him immediately, and said "You gotta come to our sessions over at Austin High [School, Chicago]. He was most happy to. He said, "Glad, sure!"</p>
<p>And he came out there and sat in with the Austin Gang.</p>
