It is my painful duty to inform you of the sad death of Mr Peter Willems [the main character in Conrad's novel "An Outcast of the Islands" 1896] late of Amsterdam and Macassar  who has been murdered  on the 16th inst while the sun shone joyously and the barrel organ sang on the pavement the abominable Intermezzo of the ghastly Cavalleria.
