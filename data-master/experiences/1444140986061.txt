<p class="MsoNormal">This morning [&hellip;] to the Church of &lt; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&gt; to hear a <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">messa in musica</em>, &lfloor;or a mass in figurative counterpoint&rfloor; composed and under the direction of Signor Monza, Maestro di Capella. His brother played the violoncello with much facility of execution, but not a very pleasing tone or taste. The first violin, Signor Lucchini, who leads at the Burletta: 2 or 3 castrati sung. There was a apltry little organ erected on the occassion, though there is a large one in the church; but in a gallery too small for a band.&nbsp;The music was pretty. Long and ingenious introductory sinfonias to each <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">concento</em> or verse. The whole was in good taste and spirited; but the organ, hautbois and some of the fiddles being bad, destroyed the effect of several things that were well designed. As yet I have heard no great singer since my arrival in Italy. Signor Lucchini is about the same speed as a first violin with M. Lahanssay: there is no want of hand, but of high finishing.&nbsp;The 1<sup>st</sup> soprano was what we should call in England, a pretty good singer, with a pretty good voice; his taste neither original nor superior. The contr&rsquo;alto, who was the second singer was likewise <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">pretty</em> well. His voice pleasing and he never gave offence by the injudicious management of it.</p>
