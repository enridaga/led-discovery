<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">At the concert on May 7th I really did play some pieces from the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Mikrokosmos</em>. However, at this particular concert they were not so important as the children&rsquo;s choruses. It was a great experience for me when &ndash; at the rehearsal &ndash; I heard for the first time my little choruses coming from the lips of these children. I shall never forget this impression of the freshness and gaiety of the little one&rsquo;s voices. There is something in the natural way these children from the suburban schools produce their voices, that reminds one of the unspoilt sound of peasant singing. </span></p>
