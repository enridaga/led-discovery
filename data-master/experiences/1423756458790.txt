My first recollection of th[e] lovely old carol ['On Christmas Morning'], is that of hearing my great aunt Nel, Daniel Williams’ daughter, sing it whilst washing her floor, and persuading the dear old lady to teach it to me. I found mother knew the second and third verses as well as the first which auntie taught me, having had the words written out when her grandfather taught it to her, with the proviso that she must not show or sing the third verse at any price as it was Catholic, and Protestants believed ‘Our Intercessor with God is Jesus Christ the Righteous’, and that Christ had never taught us to pray to his mother, but ‘Our Father, Who art in heaven'.
