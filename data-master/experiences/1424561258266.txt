I became acquainted with Moór’s music under the dramatic circumstances. I met him at one of my concerts in Lausanne Switzerland, where he was living at the time. A Russian cellist named Brandukoff introduced him to me as an “amateurs composer,” but I sensed something remarkable about him – you could see the man’s intensity in his face. I told him I would like to hear some of his work, and I invited him to visit me in Paris. He came shortly afterwards to see me at the Villa Molitor. He brought with him a veritable mountain of scores. Almost the moment he sat down at the piano and began to play, I realized he was an artist of immense talent. His music was overwhelming. He played several of his works, one after the other; and the more he played, the more convinced I became that he was a composer of the highest order. When he stopped, I said simply, “You are a genius.” He looked at me for a moment in silence, his features working terribly, and suddenly he burst into tears.
