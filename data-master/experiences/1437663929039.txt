<p>After an early dinner go to Studio no. 10 at Waterloo with F.B. where he conducts a concert with B.B.C. orch. at 8.15. Strauss' superb Don Juan is very well played. Astra Desmond sings Saint Saens' 'Fianc&eacute;e du Timbalier' - very moving. 2 Bits from H&auml;nsel &amp; Gretel; F.B.'s two lovely Tagore songs, &amp; Chasseur Maudit of Franck to end with.</p>
