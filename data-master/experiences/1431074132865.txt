<p>John Hammond played a very important role in that respect. He took me to hear Toscanini. He played records of the Budapest String Quartet for me. That's when I started collecting piano and violin records on my own. I got an offer to perform the Grieg Piano Concerto with the National Symphony in Washington, D.C., if I had it under my fingers. But I didn't feel equipped. I think I got interested in that too late.</p>
