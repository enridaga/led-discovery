 Promoter George Wein had booked us into Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center for what was being billed as the jazz event of the year… The whole city was buzzing over this concert… With this energy swirling around us, we went back into rehearsals. Miles had some new tunes to work out--including one song in particular that would turn out to be a special favorite with the New York audience…

The high point of both shows was the introduction of Miles's version of Cyndi Lauper's hit song, "Time After Time." As Mike Stern played the intro, the audience seemed to lean forward in recognition, knowing yet not quite knowing the tune. Then Miles came in, his muted trumpet playing the simple, poignant melody. For a few bars there was a silence, and then the whole house realized what the song was. They broke into applause, partially at themselves for recognizing the song, and partially for Miles, for picking the perfect tune to match his style. As one review said later, you realized that he'd made the song his forever.

Once again, Miles's love of simple, effective pop melodies had served him well.
