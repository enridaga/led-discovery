<p>Tonight we dine at Charleston &amp; so home tomorrow to the pump, to the dance music; to Braithewaite, Goldie, Ottoline, Sprott &amp; so on - to be 'seen' and to 'see'. A little music though - the opera - that I shall like.&nbsp; And now I must answer letters &amp; so start London free from that anyhow.</p>
