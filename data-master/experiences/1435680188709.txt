I was generously given four rehearsals with the admirable orchestra of the Opera. They were arduous, because at each of them I had to contend with the dreadful system of deputizing – so fatal to the music when at each rehearsal musicians, without any warning, send others to take their place. One has only to recall the amusing story so often repeated, which is attributed to various conductors. Exasperated by seeing new faces at the instrumentalists’ music stands at every rehearsal, he draws their attention to it, and suggests that they should follow the example of the soloist who regularly attends every rehearsal. At that moment the soloist rises, thanks the conductor, and informs him that on the day of the concert he will, to his great regret, have to send a deputy.
