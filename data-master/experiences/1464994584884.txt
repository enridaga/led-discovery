<p>Boston reminded me of England, and the thawing snow of St Petersburg. Ptashka went to bed and I went to the rehearsal. Koussya welcomed me very tenderly. Natalya Konstantinovna [Koussevitzky] also came to the rehearsal and was extremely friendly, although during the summer our relations had become rather cool. The orchestra, needless to say, read through the Concerto well, and I was also complimented on my playing. It is true that I had no nerves or anxiety whatsoever, and in consequence achieved greater accuracy and more opportunities to give rein to my imagination during the performance.&nbsp;</p>
