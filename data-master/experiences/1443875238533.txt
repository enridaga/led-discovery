<p>And I listened to Brigg Fair.</p>
<p>But, having been filled with pure emotion, an essential, I waned and went early to bed.</p>
<p><em>[...] I listened to Brigg Fair: the first hearing since, another cuckoo.&nbsp; It did not need to come back, it is as fresh as ever, that morning when I came back from walking on the drove, &amp; stood at the gate of Miss Green hearing her playing it, sharing her listening unbeknown, and realising the intensity of what she was to me.&nbsp; It was as fresh as ever, fresher than my sense of loss.&nbsp; My emotion was so pure that it was like a pure alcohol: not a trance for it did not remove me; not a heightening for there was no acceptance on my part; I was inside acceptance.</em></p>
<p><em>'There I stood, leaning against you, listening -</em></p>
<p><em>I have never been away' is the nearest I can come to it. It still encloses me.</em></p>
