Just before starting out  [from Fast's hotel, Jerusalem] I went into the drawing room and found a young Captain in shorts, with a cigarette dangling from his lips, playng the most difficult Chopin and Liszt with consummate technical skill. Amidst the hotel music  a book of “Selections”  of which No 9, “Hurrah! Es kommt der Kaiser. Automobilmarsch by von Translatene”[sic], was a characteristic item.
