I [Isaak Glikman] dined today with Shostakovich in room 106 of the Yevropeyaskaya Hotel. We discussed Boris Tishchenko's ballet 'Yaroslavna', which had recently been produced at the Maly Theatre. Shostakovich said: 'I saw the production several times. The music is generally good, but I did not like the choreography at all.'
