The chief exponent of a different school of pianism was Clara Schumann, whose warm tone and dignified interpretations of her husband's compositions I had the opportunity of admiring on two occasions. The privilege of hearing and meeting her (in Edinburgh, probably in 1879) enables me to record the same sense of restraint–almost reticence–which a performance of Kinderscenen left upon me. And I recall how the sad-faced lady unexpectedly announced the title of the final number, "Der Dichter spricht," before playing it. She said little more during the whole evening. Of the beauty of touch and tone, which accorded so well with the poverty of the whole composition, there could be no doubt. But she seemed to be a tired and melancholy woman.
