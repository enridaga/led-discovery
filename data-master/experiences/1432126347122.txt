<p>Mr. Doane came into a room in New York, once, where Fanny Crosby was talking with Mr. Bradbury, the father of Sunday-school music, and said to her : " Fanny, I have written a tune and I want you to write words for it." " Let me hear how the tune goes," she replied. After Mr. Doane had played it over for her on a small organ, she at once exclaimed : " Why, that tune says,' Safe in the arms of Jesus,' and I will see what I can do about it."</p>
