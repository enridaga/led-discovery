There are none of his works which I would not like to hear again and again. Both in my early years and later, his work has been a powerful influence on me. Many of my compositions came about under the direct influence of his genius. And he is still with me today. For me his work will always be linked with the great ideals of freedom and the struggle for man's happiness.&nbsp;</span></span><span class="EOP SCX23939878" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; -webkit-user-select: text; -webkit-user-drag: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; font-size: 11pt; line-height: 20px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
