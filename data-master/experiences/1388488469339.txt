Halil arrived this morning.  What a moving piece.  As an x-flutist (I used to play well at 15) I enjoy the flute writing, and I love the Alto Flute’s role.  The end reminds me of the 1st version of the Age of Anxiety with that reentry for one chord, here it is reentry for 2 notes.  It works though and if I can’t get Rampal or Galway to play it with me, I’ll have 1st flute in Milwaukee learn it (she is wonderful).
