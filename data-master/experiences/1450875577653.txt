<p>A few days later I set Sully Prudhomme&rsquo;s beautiful words, &ldquo;Ne jamais la voir ni l&rsquo;entendre.&rdquo; This time I was far more excited; it was a very much better song [than author&rsquo;s setting of Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo; Farewell, if ever fondest prayer.&rdquo;], and I gave it to one of my cousins to try over. She had a soprano voice and sang with a good deal of dramatic feeling. The melody I had composed was broad and flowing, and there was something in the song that made it possible for a singer to &ldquo;let himself go&rdquo; in it. I was almost beside myself with joy when I heard her sing it for the first time. She threw herself into the spirit of the words and sang the music with real passion, as she has sung many a song of mine since then.</p>
