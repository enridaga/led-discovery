<p>Meaning in music- that must sound very strange for most people. Particularly in the West. It&rsquo;s here in Russia that the question is usually posed: What was the composer trying to say, after all, with this musical work? What was he trying to make clear? The questions are na&iuml;ve, of course, but despite their naivet&eacute; and crudity, they definitely merit being asked. And I would add to them, for instance, Can music attack evil? Can it make man stop and think? Can it cry out, and thereby draw man&rsquo;s attention to various vile acts to which he has grown accustomed? To the things he passes without any interest? / All this questions began for me with Mussorgsky. And after his I must add the name of the little-known (despite all the reverence accorded him) Alexander Dargomyzhsky and his satiric songs, 'The Worm' and 'Titular Counsellor', and his dramatic 'Old Corporal'. Personally, I consider Dargomyzhsky&rsquo;s 'Stone Guest' the best musical embodiment of the Don Juan legend. But Dargomyzhsky doesn&rsquo;t have Mussorgsky&rsquo;s scope. Both men brought bent backs and trampled lives into music, and that&rsquo;s why they are dearer to me than so many other brilliant composers.</p>
