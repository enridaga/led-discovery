My father, Frederick Halle...was organist of the principal church, and ' musik director,' which means that he conducted the concerts, for, although the 
town was so small, there were concert societies there of no little importance....His activity was not restricted to Hagen alone, for when concerts were given in neighbouring towns, such as Iserlohn, Limburg, Dortmund, Schwelm, and others, he was generally invited to conduct them; and was known far and wide as a remarkable wit, many of his clever sayings being quoted for years.
