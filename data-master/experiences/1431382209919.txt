On several occasions during my stay in Kubïshev, Shostakovich played me excerpts from Verdi’s Otello: lago’s ‘Credo’, the Willow Song, Desdemona’s Prayer, Otello’s final scene and much else besides. Before the war in Leningrad, at the end of the 1930s, I remember Shostakovich telling me of his lasting and unshakeable love for 'Otello'; it was one of the operas he loved best in the world. Around that time, the Kirov Theatre was mounting a new production of Otello and Shostakovich invited me to accompany him to one of the performances. The production had been directed by Nikolai Pechkovsky, who also sang the title role. Shostakovich liked the singer, but was upset by the conductor’s interpretation. It annoyed him so much that he immediately fired off a review to the Sovetskoye 'Iskusstvo' newspaper, in which he sharply criticized the conductor in question, Sergey Yeltsin. Shostakovich showed me a rough copy of his notice before it was printed and I was taken aback by its uncompromising tone. Shostakovich respected Yeltsin as a musician, but on this occasion the truth as he saw it overrode any feelings of friendship.
