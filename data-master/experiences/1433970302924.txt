<p>Of this description of singers was Pacchiarotti, whom I heard in the Abbey, in 1791. Though greatly superior to Sempieri, I could not fall into the rapture that many did upon hearing him. Dr. Burney describes his voice as so interesting, sweet, and pathetic, that, when he had a long note to sustain, he never wished him to change it, or to do anything but swell, diminish, or prolong it, in whatever way he pleased. Besides having a fine shake, exquisite taste, and great fancy, he had a divine expression of pathetic songs, and such were the touching effects of his voice that the performers in the orchestra, who accompanied him, were often brought to tears.</p>
