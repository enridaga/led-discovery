<p>The eighteenth day of October was buried Judge Hynde in St. Dunstan's parish in the West with a standard, coat &hellip; helmet, sword, and pennon, target, and a herald and judges, two and two together. And then sergeant of the coif, two and two together. And the clerks singing.&nbsp;And my Lady Hynde did make another standard &hellip; and a coat of arms and a pennon and a helmet and target and sword to be had at the month's mind in the country for him. And a great dole of money and of meat and drink and gowns to the poor. There was much ado there for him.</p>
