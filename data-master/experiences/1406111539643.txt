I was pleased to hear words from Pinchas Zukerman addressed to me during the performance. Pinky, as his friends call him, spoke beautifully, almost like a poet. He is a charming and social man. I’ve known Pinky for many years and often attended his performances. I have high regard for his great mastery of the violin, as I do for that of his friend, Itzhak Perlman.

Pinky introduced Thérèse and me to his beautiful wife, the actress Tuesday Weld. A surprise for me was Mozart’s duet for violin and viola played by Zukerman and one of his pupils, the wunderkind Midori. Midori is an amazing talent who could grow into a real artist.
