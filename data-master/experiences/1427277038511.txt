Ryder, who then had Crow Street Theatre, had entered into a fresh engagement with Michael Arne for three nights, to revive Cymon. Mrs. Arne (his second wife,) was a sweet singer, and being also a very pretty, petite figure, was very popular in Silvia. They thought that I might be an additional attraction, and proposed to my father that I should play Cymon the three nights, and choose any character I pleased for the fourth, which should be given to me free of all expense, as a remuneration...I played Cymon three nights, and on the fourth, Lionel, (or, properly speaking, Master Lionel,) for my own benefit. The house was crowded in every part. I was successful in my songs, and acted the part decently, recollecting well all the points Webster had given in it.
