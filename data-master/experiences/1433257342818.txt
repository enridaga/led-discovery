<p>There was a lady that Robert Lockwood, Jr., used to run with. He just up and gave her to Elmore [James] after he decided he didn't want her no more. Lockwood was working at Silvio's as the house bandleader. Different musicians would come by on different nights to play in a jam. They held them a lot different back then than the way they do now. Like you see across Texas, they do a lot of open mic stuff, but back then these jams would be professional people displaying what they know, doing it together. If you played on a guy's bandstand at a real jam session, your instrument had to be tuned and you played what you knew. It wasn't no guesswork. So one night, we were all sitting around like musicians do, people like Lockwood, Odie Payne, Fred Below, myself, and just a bunch of guys shooting the breeze. Everything that Elmore played, if he didn't play in the key of E, when he wasn't using a slide he used a capo. We used to call it a clamp. He got up to make a telephone call, and when he came back, Lockwood had stole his capo and hid it from him. Elmore said, "Man, I got the perfect song but I've got to have my clamp. Damn, where is it?" All the other guys hollered, "I don't know! I haven't seen it!" He said, "Well, whoever it was that took my clamp was having sex with his mama." That's when Lockwood spoke and said, "Hey, you didn't ask me about your damn clamp. But I'll tell you this much: I'm the one that got it and I'm not gonna give it back to you. And you must have had sex with your mama, but I didn't have none with mine. But I'll do one more thing for you that nobody else has done. I gave you a woman the other day, and now I'm gonna show you how to play without that damn clamp. Then, when you face the world, you'll know how to play something." And after Lockwood showed Elmore the technique of how to play without a capo, he never used one again.</p>
