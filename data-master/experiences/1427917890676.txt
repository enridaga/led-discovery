Sofronitsky was like Yudina in that you never knew what to expect from him. In 1921 they were graduating from the Conservatoire and both were playing Liszt’s B minor sonata. Their graduating recitals were a sensation, all of Petrograd was there. Suddenly Nikolayev came out on stage and said, ‘Student Sofronitsky is ill and begs your indulgence.’ I was rather surprised. Sofronitsky played brilliantly, as was expected, but after the examination I went up to Nikolayev and asked what that was all about. If you’re ill, don’t play. And if you do play, then why announce that you’re ill? For sympathy? Nikolayev told me, I remember, that Sofronitsky went on with a high temperature. To tell the truth, I don’t set much store by that.
