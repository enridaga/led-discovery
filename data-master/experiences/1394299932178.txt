The parts were two small bandoraes for tenor [given as violas in the original Portuguese text], a great one for counter-tenor, a harpsichord that followed the rest [elsewhere da Crux mentions ‘a certain manner of harpsichord that hath many wire strings, upon which  they play with their finger-nails for which purpose they let them grow long’] and sometimes a rebec [rabecas] and sometimes a dulcimer [doçianas] for treble...they used a good policy in not playing more than two strains, so that we might remain desirous for more.
