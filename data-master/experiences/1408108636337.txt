Pop, Mum, & Beth go to Gloucester by car from Lowestoft, to stay. Go to Covent Garden after breakfast in an unsuccessful attempt to get campstools to put in a queue. Have my hair cut a Whiteleys, before practising (11.0–12.0) & v. good pft. lesson 12.40. Practise in aft. & then meet Barbara & Miss Hurst, have dinner at Eustace Miles, & then go & sit in queue for Cov. Garden op. Lohengrin at 7.30. Op. very well done; orch moderate. Elsa v. good actress only distressing wobble (E. Teschemacher). Loh. (Willi Wörle) excellent; best of all Olkzewska as Ortrud. What a voice! The opera is (except for one or two banal bits) exceedingly beautiful – no wonder it’s so popular.
