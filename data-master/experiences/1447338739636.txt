<p>With a now deceased friend I saw and heard HEIFEZ!&nbsp; In late 90's I travelled to London and met Sarah Chang backstage.&nbsp; In 2000 I was photographed with Sarah backstage and a beautiful picture hangs on my music room wall now.&nbsp; I have attended most of Sarah's appearances at the Royal Festival Hall and IF I survive (I am now 96) my friends will get me somehow to London in 2007 (July) - I have my name on a choir seat.</p>
