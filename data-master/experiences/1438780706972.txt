Each shining nightly in popular favour, they composed a charming constellation in this gay little opera. Madame Sontag was received on her rentree as only Jenny Lind had been received of late years. The London audience not only acknowledged its own gratification for the past in this reception, but its sense also of the triumph in the French capital. She appeared as fresh, young, and girlish in her buoyancy as ever. The magic effects of the "fontaine de jouvence," that enviable marvel, seemed still upon her. In brilliancy of execution, in delicacy and taste, she even appeared to have gained somewhat by her fresh experiences.</span></p>
