Krasner's performance of Berg's Concerto with Stock in Chicago in 1940 had overwhelmed me... those German mysteries were new, and I took the program notes (white virgin, etc.) to heart. Yet Berg has never influenced me, nor do I think of him when he's not there, while Stravinsky has been just across the room every day of my life.
