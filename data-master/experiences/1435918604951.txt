<p>The word bop was coined by none other than our old friend, Fats Waller. It came about when Fats was playing with a small group at Minton's. Late one night some of the younger generation of musicians would bring along their instruments in the hope of jamming with the band. Waller would signal for one of them to take a chorus. The musician would start in to play, then rest for eight or twelve bars in order to get in condition for one of his crazy bop runs. Fats would shout at them, "Stop that crazy boppin' and a-stoppin' and play that jive like the rest of us guys."</p>
