At the end of February I went to Berlin for the first performance of my 'Oedipus', which was being produced at the Staatsoper under Klemperer. It was what the Germans call an ‘Urauffuehrung’, that is to say, “world-first performance,” for it was then, in Berlin, that it was given for the first time as an opera. The execution of Oedipus, which was followed by 'Petroushka' and 'Mavra', was of the highest order.
