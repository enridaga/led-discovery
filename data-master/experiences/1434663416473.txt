Nannette Hill (daughter of Sir Leonard) comes to dinner, & we both go (tickets given by Lady Hill) to the Ballet (Camargo etc.) at Savoy Theatre. Not particularly impressed by FÃªte Galante of Glinka. Tchaikovsky's Lac des Cygnes was effective & Anton Dolin danced v. well in this & Lord of Burleigh (Mendelssohn - arr. E. Evans)* which was very amusing.
