<p>Garcia delighted in the music at the Abbey, and would come frequently to hear me play. On one occasion, when he was little short of a hundred years of age, he came to one of our Carol Services, afterwards writing me the following letter: Mon Abri, Cricklewood. DEAR SIR FREDERICK, We have to thank you for a most delightful afternoon. The Carol Service was perfect. What beautiful voices the boys have who sang the solos round, clear, steady, and true! Heard in the semi-darkness of the Abbey, those voices had an exquisite effect, and they are all as well trained as they are beautiful. Please give my kind regards to Lady Bridge and thank her for her hospitality. With best wishes to you both, Believe me, Yours very sincerely, MANUEL GARCIA. I value very highly this testimony to my method of training the boys in the Abbey choir.</p>
