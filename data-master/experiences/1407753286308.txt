And the King came in [to  Westminster Hall] with his Crowne on and his sceptre in his hand - under a Canopy borne up by six silver staves, carried by Barons of the Cinqueports - and little bells at every end. And after a long time he got up to the farther end, and all set themselves down at their several tables - and that was also a rare sight.... I took a great deal of pleasure to go up and down and look upon the ladies - and to hear the Musique of all sorts; but above all, the 24 viollins.
