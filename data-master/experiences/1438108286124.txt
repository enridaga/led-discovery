<p>Also, after a short walk, listen to Toni Brosa &amp; Phillipowsky give a rather stiff perf. of Elgar's Violin Sonata.* Brosa played, of course, as he always does, but P. was somewhat lacking. How I wish I could like this music. Of course it's beautifully done but says nothing that Franck &amp; Brahms haven't said before - not that I even want the latter.&nbsp;</p>
