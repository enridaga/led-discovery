I write until 10.45 & then go & practise till 12.45. I practise 2.30-4.30 in afternoon. Write a little after tea. I go after dinner to a concert at the R.C.M. (1st Orchestra). Cockaigne (Elgar) J. Ireland pft. concerto (which I like better each time - Helen Perkin played it beautifully) [Beethoven] 5th Symphony (ensemble bad) & suite - Boutique Fantastique (I cannot think why Vienna went mad over Rossini). Back at 10.15
