The high appreciation by Bunsen of the merits and abilities of Baini, the Pope's Maestro di Capella, and respect for the last representative of the long line of
illustrious composers in the style of sacred music peculiar to Rome, induced him to make persevering efforts for a length of time to raise money for the pub-
lication of the collected works of Palestrina. This collection existed only in manuscript ; it was, however, most complete, in Baini's own hand. Bunsen hoped thus to obtain for his friend, the venerable witness of the past, the satisfaction of adding another monument to the memory of his admired model, Palestrina, besides his biography, which had been a labour of love,
only lately (in 1820) published by him in two volumes.
For this purpose a series of three concerts was arranged by Bunsen and Kestner, in which a selection of pieces by Palestriria was performed by the singers of the Sixtine Chapel, to a considerable number of the strangers
who were staying that winter in Rome, in a large hall, then empty, on the ground-floor of Palazzo Caffarelli, afterwards arranged, and still in use, as the chapel of the Prussian Legation. But in this as in many other cases, the past was destined to remain the past; the amount received for the tickets was all that the two zealous friends could procure towards the hoped for and desired
publication by Baini, to which few, however, were disposed to subscribe.
