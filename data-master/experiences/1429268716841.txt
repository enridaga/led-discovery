I was in trouble again for sending a postcard to Walton suggesting he might to look in on Albert Coates' rehearsal of his First Symphony in case things were not to his liking; he duly arrived and made a few mild comments but I received a dressing-down from Russell for "disloyalty". I could not see this - it seemed only right to me that a composer should have the opportunity of attending a rehearsal of his own work.
