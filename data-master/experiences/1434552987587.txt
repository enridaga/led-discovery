Letter from Mrs. Delany to Bernard Granville, Esq., Park Street, Grosvenor Square. Delville, Dec. 18, 1750 -
I heard him play at the Bishop of Derry's a solo of Geminiani's which he had never seen ; he played it cleverly, as his execution is extraordinary, but his taste in the adagio part was ill suited to the music. He is young, modest, and well-behaved, as I am told, and were he to play under Mr. Handel's direction two or three years, would make a surprizing player. We are so fond of him here, that were it known I gave this hint, I should be expelled all musical society, as they so much fear he should be tempted to leave us.
