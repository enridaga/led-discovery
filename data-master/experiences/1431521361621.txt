<p>Lord Shaftesbury, speaking at a meeting in Exeter Hall, London, in the interest of evangelical work in Ireland, said : " Therefore go on circulating the Scriptures. I should have been glad to have had also the circulation of some well-known hymns, because I have seen the effect produced by those of Moody and Sankey. If they would only return to this country they would be astonished at seeing the influence exerted by those hymns which they sang. A week ago, when in Paris, I went to Belleville, the very nest of the communists, and even in that quarter I heard their hymns being sung. If we could get something like that in Ireland a mighty influence would be exerted."</p>
