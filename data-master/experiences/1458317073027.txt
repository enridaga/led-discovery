<p><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">I have just returned from a trip to Novosibirsk, whose Symphony Orchestra &ndash; one of the best in Siberia, with its conductor Arnold Kats &ndash; is ten years old. I made use of the trip to get to know new works by local composers and to prepare for a festival of Byelorussian art. </span></span></p>
