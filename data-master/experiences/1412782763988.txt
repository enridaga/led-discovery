    Another “turn” which was very popular in the ’fifties and ’sixties was a concert party called Dr. Mark’s Little Men. They used to perform in Glasgow fairly often, and I remember going to hear them on several occasions.
    Dr. Mark was a Manchester man, and the little men were young boys of Scots, English, Welsh, and Irish nationality whom he had gathered round him. Sometimes he had charge of no fewer than 400 lads, all trained painstakingly by himself in solo and choir singing, and this phalanx used to tour the country, giving concerts here, there and everywhere.
    They were a wonderfully talented party, and a remarkable number of stars, both singers and instrumentalists, came out of the combination during its career.
    It was Dr. Mark’s Little Men that created one of the most long-lived patriotic songs on record—“Three Cheers for the Red, White, and Blue.” They sang it for the first time at a concert on the first of December, 1860, and the number soon became a great craze. All who remember the Boer War will remember how popular it was during that exciting period.
