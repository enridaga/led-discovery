<p>Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Palace of Sans Souci, Potsdam: Whit Sunday, 1844, twelve o'clock - Here, as at Berlin, all is in the greatest excitement&mdash;the courier announcing the Emperor's arrival having come but two minutes before him. The Emperor had accomplished the 250 German miles in 106 hours, including the four hours that he passed before the gate of Berlin (in order not to rouse the Meyendorfs out of their sleep), changed his dress, drove to the Greek Russian Church, which was decorated with fresh flowers and branches for the festival, and all present on their knees, the Mass having begun. The Emperor by a sign commanded stillness, and knelt close to the entrance, remaining thus (in his tight uniform) for half an hour, and then proceeded to his proper seat, before the singing of the 'Te Deum ;' after that, to the railway, and on to Sans Souci. He is going by Holland to England, where he will remain eight or ten days, and so you will see him. A grand presence ! The journey hither, and to England, may become matter of universal history. All is in the hands of God, and this is the festival of the greatest of miracles !</p>
