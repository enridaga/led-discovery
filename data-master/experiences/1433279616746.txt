I recollect Tremazzani, Naldi, and Ambro- getti. They were fine actors, but not so preeminent in song. The greatest now on the stage is Lablache. Considered merely as a singer, however, he could not be placed in the front rank ; but the peculiar force of his voice, and his gigantic figure, combined with a remarkable neatness of enunciation and lightness of step, render his performance unique and grand. The volume of sound which he pours out upon the notes C, D, and E above the lines, makes him the Stentor of the stage.
