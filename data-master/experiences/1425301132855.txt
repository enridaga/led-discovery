<p>Spent this evening in the weird but appealing, and as yet half-unfurnished, flat of Michael Tilson Thomas and Joshua Robison on East Tenth Stree. We supped <em>&agrave; trois</em> on mocha cake, which I bought from chez Dumas, then listened to a tape of <em>Sunday Morning</em>, which Michael was non-commital about. I'm not comfortable with him.</p>
