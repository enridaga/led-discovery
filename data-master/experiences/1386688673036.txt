My dear Leslie, My servant told you of my being at the Coronation.… I sat so that I commanded a view of all the peers placed in raised ranks in the south transept. The moment the King’s crown was on, they all crowned themselves. At the same instant the shouts of ‘God save the King’, the trumpets, the band, the drums of the soldiers in the nave, and last, though not least, the artillery, which could be distinguished amid all this din, and the jar even felt, made it eminently imposing. The white ermine of the peers looked lovely in the sun; I shall sketch some of the effects; the tone of the walls was sublime, heightened, no doubt, by the trappings, like an old picture in a newly gilt frame.
