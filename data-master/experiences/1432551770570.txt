To-day is a good day for practice, and I must say that the contact with a new public has done us much good, and has put fresh musical life into us. Playing so constantly in England as we do, it becomes a matter of routine, and loses its interest ; here we are quite astonished to find that we take a real interest in every concert, in every article in the papers, and we certainly do our very best. It is a great satisfaction to witness the breathless attention with which these large crowds listen to us ; there is not the least exaggeration in saying that you might hear a pin drop; and never a soul 
stirs before the last note is played.
