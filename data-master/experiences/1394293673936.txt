...Not finding the [Falkland] islands, we bore away for the Sandwich Islands.   The first land we made was Owhyee, the island where Captain Cook was killed....the natives came on board in crowds and were happy to see us...

...They are the worst people to pronounce the English of any I ever was among.  Captain Portlock that called Potipoti.  The nearest approach they could make to my name was Nittie, yet they would make the greatest efforts, and look so angry at themselves and vexed at their vain efforts.  

We had a merry facetious fellow on board called Dickson.  He sung pretty well.  He squinted and the natives mimicked him.  Abenoue, King of Atooi, could cock his eye like Dickson better than any of his subjects.  Abenoue called him Billicany, from his often singing ‘Rule Britannia’.  Abenoue learned the air and the words as near as he could pronounce them.  It was an amusing thing to hear the King and Dickson sing. Abenoue loved him better than any man in the ship, and always embraced him every time they met on shore or in the ship, and began to sing, ‘Tule Billicany, Billicany Tule,’ etc....
