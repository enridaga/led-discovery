<p>I was living in Stamford Street, SE1, when the Hall was being built. I therefore saw it rise literally from a hole in the ground to completion. I went to the Hall many times in those early years (it was, after all, on my doorstep!) and have many memories of outstanding concerts. I have continued to attend regularly and look forward with pleasure and optimism to the re-opening.</p>
