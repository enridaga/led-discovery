Listen to B.B.C. concert on wireless after dinner. Rather a shaky performance by Nat Chorus of Jesu, Joy & Treasure Motet. They certainly made a loud if not a joyful noise in the 9th Symphon (Beethoven). Boult conducts an uninspired performance (turn back) [because entry is concluded on previous page, under 3 May] Some instrument parts played v. well; but on whole v. ragged considering amt. of rehearsal. Boult is beginning to fool abt. with things - he has dropped his so-called "letting the music speak for itself".*
