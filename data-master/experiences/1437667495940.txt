<p>Go to Queen's Hall for B.B.C. Concert. Beethoven's supreme Mass in D. I feel at the moment that it is impossible to conceive music greater than this. Boult even couldn't ruin it. Chorus not bad. Orch ditto though intonation poor, &amp; Catteral [solo violin] was too hard in the Benedictus. The soloists - Adleheid Armhold (disappointing in a way, but very lovely in spots), Mary Balfour (not too good); Parry Jones (better); Keith Falker (too insignificant) - weren't a good quartet. But even all this couldn't spoil this God of a work.</p>
