Although I feel it my duty to make this statement concerning his scanty interest in the daily services, yet all musicians and for the matter of that, all churchmen owe Dean Stanley a deep debt of gratitude for having authorised the first
performance of Bach's " Passion " music in an English Cathedral or Abbey Church. This event took place at the Abbey before I came, the musical direction being in the hands of Joseph Barnby, whose brother was a member of the choir. Barnby, along with his brother, lived for a time in a part of the house which I now occupy. Not only did Dean Stanley authorise the performance of Bach's "Passion," but he paid the expenses of the band out of his own pocket. He did this also for some other oratorio performances which I
directed in the early years of my appointment.
