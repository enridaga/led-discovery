Another musician I came to know in those days was that amazing violinist Pablo Sarasate. He was then in his fifties and for some time he had been the most famous virtuoso in Spain. Actually, we had met before. I first heard him play when I was a boy studying in Barcelona. Señor Tost, the proprietor of the café where I played, took me to one of Sarasate’s performances, and I was overwhelmed by the brilliance of his playing – I had never heard anything like it. (…) Sarasate played the violin with fantastic facility. His performances were dazzling, spectacular- like fireworks!
