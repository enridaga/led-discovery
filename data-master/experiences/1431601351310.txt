There was a very excellent company of German singers at the Canatore Theatre; it was more spacious than the Imperial Court Theatre. The first female singer was Madame Lange, wife to the excellent comedian of that name, and sister to Madame Mozart. She was a wonderful favourite, and deservedly so ; she had a greater extent of high notes than any other singer I ever heard. The songs which Mozart composed for her in " L'Enlevement du Serail," shew what a compass of voice she had; her execution was most brilliant. Stephen Storace told me it was far beyond that of Bastardini, who was engaged to sing at the Pantheon in London, and who, for each night of her 
performance of two songs, received one hundred guineas, an enormous sum at that time ; and (comparatively speaking) more than two hundred at the 
present day.
