<p>An extract from Contemporary Letters--</p>
<p>Proceeding along the corridor as soon as dressed, we soon met Lord Delaware and the Duchess of Buccleuch, and were directed where to go, that is, to walk to the end of the corridor (a fairy scene, lights, pictures, busts, and moving figures of courtiers unknown), and then through one splendid room after another, till we reached the magnificent ballroom, where guests were assembled to await the Queen's appearance. Among these guests stood the King himself, punctual to half-past seven. Soon after came Prince Albert, to whom Lord Delaware named me : he said, ' You were long in Rome. I have been in your house at Rome.' We had not stood long, when two gentlemen, walking in, and then turning, with profound bows towards the open door, showed that the Queen was approaching. She came near at once where I stood; the Duchess of Buccleuch named me, and she said with a gracious, beaming smile, ' I am pleased to see you ; ' then, after a few moments' speaking to the King, she took his arm and moved on, 'God save the Queen' having begun to sound at the same moment from the Waterloo Gallery, where the Royal dinner has always taken place since the King has been here.</p>
