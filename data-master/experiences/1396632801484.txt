It's All Saints' Day and it's been pouring all day without ceasing. There was a service held in the Soldiers' Cemetery this afternoon for all our Tommies who were lying there.... We sang two hymns - 'For All the Saints Who from Their Labours Rest' and 'Oh God, Our Help in Ages Past' - then some prayers and a splendid short address from the chaplain.... After the sermon we sang 'Through the Night of Doubt and Sorrow', then after the blessing 'God Save the King'. It was a simple little service, but I don't think one could forget it. The whole crowd of us stood singing in the pouring rain and thick mud, with the guns booming away to the east of us and these pathetic graves, each marked by a simple wooden cross.
