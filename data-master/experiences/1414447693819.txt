The third part of this Concerto [Spohrâ€™s violin concerto op. 28, in G minor] is a Spanish Rondo, the melodies of which are not mine but genuine Spanish. I heard them from a Spanish solider who was quartered in my house, and who sang it to the guitar. I noted down what pleased me, and wove it into my Rondo. In order to give this a more Spanish character, I copied the guitar accompaniments as I had heard them from the Spaniard, into the orchestral part.
