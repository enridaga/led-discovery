<p>Go to dinner with Bridge's at 6.20. &amp; to concert afterwards with them (Mr. Bridge coming at half time). Ansermet (Queen's Hall) conducting B.B.C. Eroica, badly played under not inspired conducting. Stravinsky Capriccio for Pft (Strav. himself) &amp; Orch. Amusing but not much more. Marvellous Symphony of Psalms (Strav.) tho'. Bits of it laboured I thought but the end was truly inspired. Chorus, not too bad (National) &amp; orch. better in 2nd half of programme. The performance left much to be desired tho' Ansermet was good. Back at 11.15.</p>
