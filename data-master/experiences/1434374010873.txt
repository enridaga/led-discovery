Continuation of Journal of Bunsen's, broken off on Friday 25th. -
The Emperor (Nicholas) is arrived, and stays till Tuesday. To-morrow and the day after, the six-days' manoeuvre, compressed into two, is to take place. The whole day the splendid regiments are in motion with bands before the Palace ; the first company breaks off from the rest, to fetch colours and the Eagle, with which in quickest march it bursts out of the Palace-gate, saluted by the remainder of the regiment. A grand spectacle ! which begins at half-past six in the morning, and fails not to call me out of bed ; a row of acacias hides me, but I can see everything. (The acacias, limes and chestnut trees are blossoming for the second time ; they are selling cherries of the second crop.)
