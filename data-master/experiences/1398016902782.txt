Dined quietly last night at home with Marie Laure, and afterwards we went to Gaveau to hear Cuenod and De Menasce. Later (Marie Laure having returned alone to meet Oscar) I went to discuss the concert with Poulenc, Sauguet, Jacques du Pont and Henri Hell at the Criterion near the Gare St. Lazare, where Huysman's characters used to evoke London.
