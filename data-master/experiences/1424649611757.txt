<p>Now what does Papa think we played immediately after the symphony? Why, the Concerto for three claviers [K. 242.]. Herr Demmler played the first, I the second, and Herr Stein the third. Then I gave a solo, my last Sonata in D [K. 284], written for Baron Durnitz, and after that my Concerto in B flat [K. 238]. I then played another solo, quite in the style of the organ, a Fugue in C minor, and then all of a sudden a magnificent Sonata in C major, out of my head, and a rondo to finish up with. There was a regular din of applause. Herr Stein was so amazed that he could only make faces and grimaces. As for Herr Demmler, he couldn&rsquo;t stop laughing. He is a quaint fellow, for when he likes anything very much, all he does is to burst into fits of laughter. In my case he even started to curse.</p>
