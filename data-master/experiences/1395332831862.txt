For two or three days we stayed here, in the remarkable line of shelters on the embankment of that drowsy canal [the Yser Canal], and working parties and wanderings were all that happened. Machine-guns did homage to Night, and that was almost the only unrest. A spy was reported to be lurking about some bricks called Wilson Farm, but nobody could catch him; and from company headquarters and cook-houses one heard such cheerful singings and improvisations as seemed to hail the Salient as the garden of Adonis.
