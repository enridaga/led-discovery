I had not expected this <em>&lsquo;Romantiker&rsquo;</em> from another era to be able to count my scrambled meters, or, knowing his habit of slowing down for the second subject of a symphony, expected him to keep my metronomic <em>tempi</em>. Yet he followed me as nimbly as anyone with whom I ever played the piece.</span></p>
