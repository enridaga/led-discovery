<p>About the month of July the King and Queen usually went to Posilipo, and in fine weather had concerts in the open air. To one of those I was taken by Sir William Hamilton, who did me the honour to introduce me to their Majesties as a lad from Ireland, come to study music in Naples. The first question the King asked, was, "Ne; siete Cristiano?" "I say, are you a Christian ?" " I hope I am, Sire," was my reply. Shortly afterwards he commanded me to sing an English song, and I put forth my strength in " By him we love offended," from the Duenna. Her Majesty then ordered an Italian air, and I sung u Ho sparse tante lagrime ;" they seemed pleased, and her Majesty, after asking me with great affability, how I liked Naples, where I lived, who was my instructor, &amp;c. invited me to take some ice and a glass of Maraschino.</p>
