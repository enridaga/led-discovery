My time passed delightfully while I remained in Leghorn. The Russian fleet were at anchor in the Bay, commanded by Admiral O'Dwyer, a distinguished seaman, and an Irishman by birth. The Storaces and myself often went on board his ship, and were delighted by hearing the Russians chaunt their evening hymn. The melody is beauti-fully simple, and was always sung completely in tune, by this immense body of men. There was at the same time, in the harbour, a privateer from Dublin, called the Fame, Captain Moore : he and his first officer, Campbell, were Irishmen, and had a fine set of Irish lads under them. When Storace's benefit took place, the officers and crew, who could be spared from their duty, to a man (and a famous sight it was), marched to the theatre, and almost filled the parterre. At the end of the opera, Storace sung the Irish ballad, "Molly Ahstore," on the conclusion of which, the boatswain of the Fame gave a loud whistle, and the crew, en masse, rose and gave three cheers. The dismay of the Italian part of the audience was ludicrous in the extreme. The sailors then sang " God save the King" in full 
chorus, and when done, applauded themselves to the very skies : nothing could be more unanimous or louder than their self-approbation.
