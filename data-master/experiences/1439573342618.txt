<p>Last Saturday we were invited to the Primate's to hear music. &nbsp;D. D., Donnellan, and I went a little before 7; it was the Duke of Dorset's birthday, and the entertainment given in honour of it....Our music was chiefly Italian - the&nbsp;<em>Stabat Mater</em>, sung by Guadagni (whom you heard sing in Mr. Handel's oratorios) and Mrs. Oldmixon; Dubourg the principal violin: it was well performed and some of the duet parts are very pretty. &nbsp;They had more music after we left them, but we staid till&nbsp;<em>nearly</em> ten, which was a late hour for us.</p>
