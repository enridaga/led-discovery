On the 20th of November, Cobb produced his opera of " The Cherokee ;" the music by Storace. The Cherokee chorus was one of the grandest ever 
composed : the effect was sublime. Mrs. Crouch acted very finely in it. Tom Welsh had a part which he played very impressively : the scenery and 
decorations were of the most splendid description. I performed the character of an English officer in it; and had some good situations, and good songs. That 
delightful warbler, Mrs. Bland, in the character of a Welsh peasant, sang that ballad, afterwards so universally popular, "A little bird sang on a spray," with great simplicity and truth ; indeed, what did ghe not sing well ? As far as her powers went, she was perfect as an English ballad-singer. I remember 
dining one day with those two great musicians, Haydn and Pleyel, and requesting them to go to Drury Lane, and hear a female singer ; saying, that in my opinion no real judge of the art could find a single blemish in her style or taste. They went to hear Mrs. Bland, and told me, that my praise was not 
at all exaggerated. I have, at different times, composed a number of songs for her, and may safely say, that she never introduced a grace unseasonably, or one that was not full of taste and meaning.
