Seguin, who was of course but little heard in a concerted piece of so many voices. This was really beautiful, and perfectly well sung; as was a quartetto of Himmel, led by Tamburini, or rather, a song by him, the other voices being quite subordinate. It has been already mentioned that this excellent singer was the most successful of the Italians; and it may be added that the last two pieces were the most successful that they sung.</p>
