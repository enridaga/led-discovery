The funeral [of VAD nurse Arnold] was held at 2 p.m. and passed off very quietly and very reverently....

When the prayers had been said and the service was finished, the buglers blew the Last Post over the grave and the call that Arnold had heard every night for the last nine months, summoning the camp to rest, now came to summon her rest with no more toil and weariness to wake up to when morning came again.
