Lords day. Got up betimes and walked [towards] St. James's. The Queene coming by in her coach, going to her chapel at St. James's (the first time it hath been ready for her), I crowded after her and got up to the room where her closet is and there stood and saw - the fine Alter, ornaments, and the fryers in their habits and the priests come in with their fine Copes. And many other very fine things. I heard their Musique too; which may be good, but it did not appear so to me, neither as to their manner of singing nor was it good Concord to my eares, whatever the matter was.
