<p class="MsoNormal">The singer next room to ours is I find the castrate Luini [&hellip;] He is a native of Brescia &ndash; was welcomed home by a band of music at the inn, the night of his arrival, and by another the night before his and our departure, consisting of 2 violins, a mandolin, French horn, trumpet and violoncello &ndash; and tho&rsquo; in the dark and by memory they played long concertos with solo parts for mandolin. I was surprised at the memory of these performers &ndash; in that it was excellent <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">street</em> music and such as we are not accustomed to: but ours is not a climate for serenades.</p>
