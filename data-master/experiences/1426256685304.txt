I was also involved in my own home music scene with two friends, Gerald Cluer who became a school teacher and Alan Ward, a very gifted violinist... so he became conductor of the D'Oyley [sic] Carte Opera for many years and I last met him conducting "Oklahoma" in the fifties.

We called ourselves the Little Orchestra and gave Saturday concerts to our friends...
