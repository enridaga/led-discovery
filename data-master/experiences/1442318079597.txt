<p>&hellip;.I saw another very good French film on Friday.&nbsp; There was a very good singer &ldquo;Tino Rossi&rdquo; in it.&nbsp; He is a sort of cross between a tenor and a crooner, far superior to a crooner.&nbsp; He makes a sort of noise you could go on liking for days on end without being irritated by it&hellip;.</p>
