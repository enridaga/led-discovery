<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have another new work: a sonata for violin alone, written in Asheville for Menuhin. He played it in his New York recital on Nov. 26., it was a wonderful performance. It has 4 movements, and lasts ca. 20 minutes. I was afraid it was too long; imagine: listen[ing] to a single violin during 20 minutes. But it was quite all right, at least for me. </span></p>
