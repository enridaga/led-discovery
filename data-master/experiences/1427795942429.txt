Another unrehearsed effect enlivened one of the performances of 'Robin Hood.' Mme. Sherrington was Maid Marian, and Mr. Sims Reeves Robin Hood. In the last scene Maid Marian brings the reprieve to Robin Hood, condemned to death, and 
waving it rushes at him from the farthest end of the stage. On this occasion Mme. Sherrington came down with such impetuosity upon Mr. Sims Reeves that he, unprepared for the onslaught, was toppled over, his head coming close to the footlights, and Maid Marian on his back. Unable to shake her off at once, he raised his head and blew with all his might into the footlights which were nearly singeing him, thereby causing an hilarity amongst the audience sufficient to play havoc with the concluding scene of the opera.
