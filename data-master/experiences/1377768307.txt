We have two "bomb happy" cases now (shell shock). They cant bear the news and retire under blankets until the Major or one of the now numerous inspections takes place. But the rest of the ward likes the radio on all the time, no matter what its spewing forth, whether they listen or not! So we get Church services, advice to farmers, dance music, lectures, and even the News in Welsh. I was about to turn this off one day, as we have no Welsh in ward 7, but they said "Oh leave it on nurse its company"... and "We dont listen anyway". But they do listen to ITMA and Music Hall and anything which raises a laugh.
