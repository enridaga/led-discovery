Felix, when in London, had played me the whole of the music of 'Athalie,' trumpeting - 'tuting,' as he called it - every wind-instrument, especially in the 'March of the Priests,' so that I well remembered the most startling modulations. Even then the work pleased me; now, after attending the performance and rehearsals, I glory in it. In certain passages I was deeply affected, what must he have felt when he wrote it?
