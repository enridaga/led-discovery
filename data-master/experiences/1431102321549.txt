In the winter of '61 I was present at an admirable performance of Tannhäuser (an opera which reached Covent Garden in an Italian version fifteen years later) and of Faust. As the latter had seen the footlights only three years previously, this was quick work for a small Fürstenthum, and emphasizes the interest and activity in these musical regions.
