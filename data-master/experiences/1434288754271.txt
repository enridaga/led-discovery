Pop, Mum, Beth & I go to St. Lukes dance for Nurses in evening at 8.0. I come away and go to Phillips at 9.35 to listen on wireless to concert F. Bridge is conducting - marvellous - Rimsky-Korsakov. Scheherazade - brilliant. Sachs' Monologues & extracts from Act III Meistersinger.* What a conductor that man is - what tone he gets from his strings. After that the dance seemed deadly dull. But don't leave till 12.30
