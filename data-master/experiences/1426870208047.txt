In August 1828, my father took me to Cassel, a drive of about four hours, in order to pay his respects to Spohr, who was then ' Kapellmeister ' there, and at the same time to get his opinion as to my musical abilities...He received us most kindly, and when I had quite recovered my breath he made me play to him, the result of which was that he insisted upon my giving a concert in Cassel.
