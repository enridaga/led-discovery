Of the high quality of the choir of St. George's during Dr. Elvey's period there is no question. A well-known musician relates how he once sat up with him in the organ-loft during service. The Psalms were started with organ as usual, and no sooner had this been done than he exclaimed, " I have forgotten my keys ; I must go and fetch them." He started off, the choir singing on. In due time he returned to the organ, and tried, with a soft stop, to see if his singers had dropped in pitch. They were dead in tune, and the accompaniment was taken up. A better proof of training could hardly be given.
