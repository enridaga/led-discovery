I look forward to playing duets with you as one of my future pleasures, and if I am able to go on working, I hope we shall afford to have a fine grand piano. I have none of Mozart's Symphonies, so that you can be guided in your choice of them entirely by your own tastes. I know Beethoven's Sonata in E flat well. It is a very charming one, and I shall like to hear you play it. That is one of my luxuries -- to sit still and hear some one playing my favourite music; so that you may be sure you will find willing ears to listen to the fruits of your industrious practising. 

There are ladies in the world, not a few, who play the violin, and I wish I were one of them, for then we could play together sonatas for the piano and violin which make a charming combination. The violin gives that keen edge of tone which the piano wants.
