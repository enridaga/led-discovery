A few special words must be given to this occasion. Already Fornasari had ceased to hold the supreme position which had been hastily and generally granted him during the previous season, and though he was still enthusiastically received by the general public, a few "carpings and cavillings" began to be heard. Doubts timorously indeed were whispered here and there, and it became gradually evident that Fornasari was not exactly the "conquering hero" which previous trumpetings had so loudly proclaimed him. In spite of his efforts on this occasion, backed by the advantage of Lablache's name and the singing of Persiani, in spite of the catching melodies, the vigorous chorusses and the dramatic style of Herold, "Zampa" failed in establishing itself upon the Anglo-Italian boards. After a very few nights, on which it was lustily applauded, it wholly disappeared from the bills. However, in behalf of the fame of Herold, it should be mentioned that a considerable portion of the frequenters of Her Majesty's Theatre only admitted at this period, as acceptable on its boards, the Italian school, pur et simple, and looked with coldness and mistrust on any names, how's ever accredited, which revealed a French, a German, or, still worse, an English origin. Thus Herold can in fact scarcely be said to have had "fair play" at Her Majesty's Theatre.</span></p>
