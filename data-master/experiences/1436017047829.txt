<p>The best men in the dance band were fakers, playing ragtime.</p>
<p>Their tunes came from a million sources. Many of them were stolen from old marches ("High Society", for instance) and were the leader's interpretation of the old marches. Because he couldn't read, the band played it differently from the original. Other band leaders stole it in turn, and, because they couldn't read either, the tune was played with many variations. After the leader had shown the trumpet man the melody, (or what he <em>thought</em>&nbsp;was the melody), the trumpeter would play it for the band, and the men would come in, making a complete arrangement.</p>
