During the winter of 1849-50 I proposed to Ernst that we should give a similar concert in Liverpool. He readily assented, and, relying upon his great reputation and my rising one, we promised ourselves great success, engaged a good violoncellist, made an excellent programme and gave the concert. The audience consisted of eleven people, four of whom were reporters! Such was the beginning of my acquaintance with that nourishing town, with the musical life of which I have since become so intimately associated.
