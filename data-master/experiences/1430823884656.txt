Today he was quite a different Chopin from the Chopin last week. I visited him by appointment with Charlotte and Emily, who are his enthusiastic admirers: they were profoundly impressed with the Prelude in A flat major in 6-8 time, with the perpetually recurring A flat resembling the pedal bass of an organ. Chopin's excellent pupil Gutmann played his manuscript Scherzo in C sharp minor, Chopin himself his manuscript Sonata in B flat minor, with the Funeral March.
