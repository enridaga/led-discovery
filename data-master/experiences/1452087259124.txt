<p>In a shady nook of the Kalemeydan the band of whatever&nbsp;regiment may happen for the time being to be garrisoning the citadel performs, throughout the summer&nbsp;months, during the afternoons of Sundays and saints'&nbsp;days. As the Greek Orthodox Calendar may confidently be reckoned upon for a supply of saints averaging&nbsp;at least three per diem for the three hundred and sixty-&nbsp;five days of the year, one is seldom disappointed in the&nbsp;matter of hearing the band, however casually one may&nbsp;stroll up to the Kalemeydan between five and seven P.M.&nbsp;from the first of May to the thirtieth of September. It&nbsp;would be somewhat difficult, from a musical point of view,&nbsp;to define the exact class of noise most closely resembling&nbsp;the sounds resulting from a Servian military band's&nbsp;executive feats. To native ears these remarkable&nbsp;achievements teem with melody, tender or inspiriting,&nbsp;and with harmonies of the most enchanting character.&nbsp;But foreigners, trained to the oral apprehension of&nbsp;"Western melodic forms and harmonic sequences", are apt&nbsp;to be hopelessly gravelled by the Servian compositions,&nbsp;as well as by the local manner of their interpretation.&nbsp;The national airs, if airs they be, are difficult to grasp,&nbsp;chiefly from the circumstance that they lack coherency,&nbsp;and consist, so to speak, of a number of random notes&nbsp;strung together anyhow and making up a perplexing&nbsp;total that can scarcely be said to exhibit an intelligible&nbsp;beginning, middle, or end.</p>
