Dear A
	Just a few words a propos of the Lincoln Portrait performance... I suppose everyone has written you all about it.  How Will Geer completely disregarded your forward in the score, and drawled away in a pseuso-Lincolnesque performance that was truly embarrassing.  (He made up to look a little like Abe, and sat on this chair like the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.  I’m told the whole thing was Koussie’s idea, which is certainly plausible.)
 	Kouss didn’t do as well by it as I had expected.  The opening was too agitated because he divided his beats – there was no feeling of tranquillity and space.  He missed a few cues (or passed them up), like disenthrall ourselves”; and usually simply waited for the end of a speech, & then played music.  But the sum total was good – the impression was very exciting, & the audience was charmed.  Why must you be in Hollywood?  Although after the parade of bowing composers (Billy and Barber) it was very distinguished of you not to be present – sort of specialness, you know.
	It’s a fine piece, my love, despite all the repetition, and Vernon Duke’s verdict that it’s “Just 20th Century Fox”.  He’s insufferable anyway.
