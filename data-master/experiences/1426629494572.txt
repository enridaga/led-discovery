Two days ago we were at an evening party at George Sand's. Karl and Pauline Viardot were the performers. The latter is the sister of the great Malibran, but she is herself one of the first singers in the world for musical talent and intelligence; this surpasses even what she does as a pianist. Chopin was in excellent spirits, beaming with joy at the success of his little pupil, who was kissed by Sand, Viardot and everyone.
