<p>I went to town at the anniversary of the Abbey music: the King gave me tickets, and Miss Port tickets. Though I suspected my own ability of being able to make use of them, I could not deprive Miss Port of the opportunity of going, but she was (I may say, happily) prevented, by falling ill of the measles, which, I thank God, she has now passed through as well as can be wished. I enjoyed one performance of the music, and we returned to Windsor on the 16th of June.</p>
