But on this occasion I felt a little excited, as if I were being put through my paces, for I realised that I must do my very best to live up to the musical reputation on which dear Mary Wakefield had almost risked her own. Her kind eyes shone with satisfaction as I played the last bars (the bars that sounded like a wink !) for she saw Mr. Lyttelton making his way up to the piano, evidently with the intention, to judge by the expression on his face, of making friends. And so he did. He beamed on me with that nice smile of his, and said something that put me very much at my ease.</p>
