<p>Recordings keep any listener abreast of the times by keeping him at home. Not having been to a piano recital in years, I found myself at two within a week, standard fare by friends: Jerry Lowenthal playing Liszt and Bartok, Zaidee Parkinson playing Schumann and Debussy. Zaidee's audience was amateur in the real sense (creative and well off but not very musical), while Jerry's was professional (or, as they say in Rent Control, semiprofessional - students with scores in their laps). The performers' performances resembled their audiences.</p>
