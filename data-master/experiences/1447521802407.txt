<p>The collection was taken up and I again ascended the pulpit and preached to the negroes on 1 Tim. 1:15. Called on old father Hare to lead in the last prayer and he gave it in the Methodist singing style. He sang a hymn in it and suddenly changing his voice, he added, by way of postscript "This Lord, is the humble prayer of your respectful servant. Amen."</p>
