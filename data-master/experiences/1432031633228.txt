" ' Please, sir, I went to the Mission School ; and they told me there of God, and of heaven, and of Jesus; and they taught me 'Thou shalt not steal' â€” and I'll never steal again, if my father kills me for it. But, please, don't tell him ! ' 

" ' My boy, you mustn't stay here. You'll die. Now you wait patiently here for a little time. I'm going away to see a lady. We will get a better place for you than this.' 

" ' Thank you, sir ; but, please, sir, would you like to hear me sing a little hymn ? ' 

" Bruised, battered, forlorn, friendless, motherless, hiding away from an infuriated father, he had a little hymn to sing. 

" ' Yes, I will hear you sing your little hymn.' He raised himself on his elbow, and then sang :

Gentle Jesus, meek and mild, 
Look upon a little child, 
Pity my simplicity, 
Suffer me to come to Thee.

Fain I would to Thee be brought, 
Gracious Lord, forbid it not:
In the kingdom of Thy grace, 
Give a little child a place.

" ' That's the little hymn, sir. Good-bye.'
