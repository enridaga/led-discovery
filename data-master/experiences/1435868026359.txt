On the 2nd of July, a new musical piece was produced, entitled, "The glorious First of June !" written by Mr. Cobb, for the benefit of the widows of the brave men who fell on that day. It was well suited to the purpose, and was a sequel to "No Song, no Supper ;" it was all got up in three days. Mr. Joseph Richardson wrote an elegant prologue on the occasion, which was spoken, with great feeling, by John Kemble ; the piece concluded with a grand sea-fight, and a sumptuous fete, in honour of our glorious victory. Storace and myself gave it some new songs ; but the music was chiefly old. I had to represent the character of Frederick ; and as I was so much employed in writing the music, I begged Mr. Sheridan (who wrote a good many speeches for it), to make as short a part for me, and with as little speaking in it as possible. He assured me he would. In the scene in which I came on, to sing a song (written by Cobb), "When in war on the ocean we meet the proud foe!" there was a cottage in the distance, at which (the stage direction said) I was 
to look earnestly, for a moment or two ; and the line which I then had to speak was this : "There stands my Louisa's cottage, she must be either in it, or out of it." The song began immediately, and not another word was there in the whole part. This sublime and solitary speech produced a loud laugh from the 
audience. When the piece was over, Mr. Sheridan came into the green-room, and complimented me on my quickness, and being so perfect in the part which 
he had taken so much pains to write for me ; which, he said, considering the short time I had to study it, was truly astonishing. He certainly had the laugh against me, and he did not spare me.
