<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">True, I heard a Giovanni Gabrieli- Giovanni Croce concert there last year, but almost nothing of the sense of their music remained. The tempi were wrong, the ornamentation didn&rsquo;t exist or was wrong when it did, the style and sentiment were ahead of the period by the three-and-a-half centuries, and the orchestra was &lsquo;modern&rsquo;. When will musicians learn that the performance point of Gabrieli&rsquo;s music is rhythmic, not harmonic? When will they stop trying to make mass choral effects out of simple harmonic changes and bring out, articulate those marvellous rhythmic inventions? Gabrieli is rhythmic polyphony. </span></p>
