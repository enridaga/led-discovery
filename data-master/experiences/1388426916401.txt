Dear Louis
I have finally listened to the recordings of ancient pianists & composers that you so kindly sent me.  It has been a ball!  Grieg performing his Papillon like a young lady just out of conservatory, Busoni stuttering his octaves, Ravel heavy and rhythmically obscure, [Teresa] Carreño running out of gas in the Liszt Rhapsody, [Vladimir] de Pachmann setting an all-time record for ritards at the end of Chopin’s C# minor waltz, et al, et al -  and all marvelously authentic, surprising, other-planetary, incredible.  It is a thrill to hear these records: we not only extend our knowledge of past pianistic styles, but we gain a fresh view of our own age.  And not only pianistically; this glimpse into the past, to the thoughtful observer, becomes nothing less than a revelation of the present! I thank you for sending it to me.
