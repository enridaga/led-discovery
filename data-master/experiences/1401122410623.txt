"Family of Man" photographic display in the Foyer opened my eyes to the power of black and white images. I still have the book which accompanied the exhibition. Attending the marvellous Robert Meyer Concerts on Saturday mornings which opened my ears and mind to listening to music. Even now, when I hear Rossini's Semiramade overture or Kodaly's Hary Janos suite I am taken back to those thrilling occasions. After years living away from London, I am now within reach of South Bank again. The annual to Royal Festival Hall for Bach Choir's St Matthew Passion has been a highlight.
