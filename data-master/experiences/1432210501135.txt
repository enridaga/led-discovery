Mr. Sankey took the paper, with the ink scarcely dry on it, and sang it through with the chorusâ€”the new air and the words exactly fitting, without alteration or amendment. ' I think the Lord gave you the words as truly as He gave me the tune,' was Mr. Sankey's first remark. And then we commended the little piece and its music to the great Master, praying that the unction of the Holy One might rest upon it. Mr. Sankey sang the hymn for the first time in public that evening, after I had given my address on The Smitten Rock."
