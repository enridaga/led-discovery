London, 30 May, 1843. – …. I went to the consecration of a beautiful church by the Bishop of London – fine sermon, fine service, fine organ, fine chanting, and, lastly, had a walk home through the park with my dear George. I have passed an uncommon morning, with thoughts and feeling and senses occupied by anything but common London objects: and now I come home and find Ernest practising singing accompanied by an Italian.
