Music after breakfast till about one; bathing (quant a moi) & dressing till dinner (3 o’clock); sleeping after dinner till tea time; then music (at home or abroad) till supper, &c. We are such a musical party as I have, I think I may say, never enjoyed before in my life...
The party consists of Mr. Tindal, Mr. Hague from Cambridge (a delightful violinist) & Mr. Wm. Hey, a nephew of the Doctor’s, son to Mr. Hey of Leeds, a very good surgeon himself, & one of the most pleasant & interesting young men I ever met with, strikingly like Richard Hey. We have been twice at Wicken Park: one morning visit, one evening: Glees, Quartetts, Anthems, &c. — all the Sharps there... They stayed [until] supper, and we were singing glees till 12 o'clock. So much to give you some idea how my time passes here.
