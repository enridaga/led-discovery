Dear Sir [Sir Charles Halle], Having had the pleasure of attending your first concert this season, I beg to tender you my best wishes for your future success; and not having had the pleasure of hearing such a display of talent before, I felt most delighted, and beg you will please accept the small token I forward you. 

Respectfully yours, 

AN OPERATIVE.
