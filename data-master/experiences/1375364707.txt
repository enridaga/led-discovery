Last night we went to Lady [--]'s concert, and heard some fine finished singing; but there was nothing of pathos or of sentiment in the difficult and scientific pieces which were performed. The music, however, was good enough for all the attention that was paid to it by the company, who only meet (with few exceptions) to see and be seen, talk and be talked to, and care little in fact for the merits of the music they nominally assemble to listen to.
