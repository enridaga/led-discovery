<p>At a little past five o&rsquo;clock, when the house was filled with an anxious and deeply-interested audience, and the singers, somewhat over sixteen hundred in number, all men, filled the stage, leaving room only for the performing society in the centre and in front, and in view of all the people, the brilliant prizes, vases and cups, were tastefully arranged &mdash; the performance began. A flourish of trumpets and drums came first, then an overture, and then a grand vocal and instrumental chorus of welcome greeting by the united Dusseldorf Societies. A most charming choral performance of power and grandeur it was indeed, such as to call forth loud applause from the visiting societies and from the large company of spectators. This was the only performance of the Dusseldorf Societies, since, as a matter of etiquette, none of them engaged in the singing for prizes.</p>
