<p>Dear Mummy and Daddy</p>
<p>I have decided that it is not really worth getting a violin case yet, and in any case I would much prefer something else&hellip;I think the only thing that will be of any use to me is a fountain pen, but a cheap one.</p>
<p>We have just been listening to the records of the Broadcast; the silly part about them is that every time we had sung loud the B.B.C. had turned us down a good bit and it would rather spoil the effect.&nbsp; The anthem is the best one.&nbsp; Are you going to buy any of the records when they are ready to be sold?</p>
