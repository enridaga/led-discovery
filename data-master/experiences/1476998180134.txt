<p>The reverse had happened to me during the first of my ill-fated lessons with Sir Ivor Atkins at Worcester.&nbsp;Hoping to be given a Beethoven sonata to study &ndash; I had &lsquo;learnt&rsquo; the <em>Appassionata</em> on a neighbour&rsquo;s pianola &ndash; my face must have fallen when he offered me Bach&rsquo;s Two-part Inventions.&nbsp;He noticed this, turned me off the piano, played, sang, gesticulated, dissected and explained.</p><p>I succumbed quickly as the seemingly dry notes leapt into life, for although this most modest sample of Bach might be dismissed as a mere exercise it contained the essence: the intense intellectual pleasure in the economy of its construction &ndash; the imitations and inversions of its opening figure, in itself so simple that a child could have hit upon it &ndash; and this enhanced, rather than precluded, one&rsquo;s emotional delight in its flow.</p>
