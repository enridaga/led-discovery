<p>[... At] the Louisiana Club, where Andy Kirk was working, [&hellip;] was a fellow with Kirk called [Theodore] Fats Navarro. "Take a listen to him, man," said Dizzy [Gillespie]. "He's wonderful!"</p>
<p>So I went to the club, and the only thing Fats had to blow (because Howard McGhee was the featured trumpet player) was behind a chorus number. But he was <em>wailing</em>&nbsp;behind this number, and I said to myself, "This is good enough; this'll fit."</p>
<p>[... A]bout two weeks after that he took Dizzy's chair, and take it from me, he came <em>right</em>&nbsp;in. Fats came in the band, and great as Dizzy is--and I'll never say other than that he is one of the finest things that ever happened to a brass instrument--Fats played his book and and you would hardly know that Diz had left the band. "Fat Girl" played Dizzy's solos, not note-for-note, but his ideas on Dizzy's parts and the feeling was the same and there was just as much swing.</p>
<p>Fats stayed with me , I imagine, for about a year and a half.</p>
