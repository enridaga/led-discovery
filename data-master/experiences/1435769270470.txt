<p>Mrs. Crouch, Madame Mara, and Mr. Harrison, were engaged with me in the August of this year, for the second summer assize week at York cathedral: we arrived there the 8th of August, and went to the theatre, to see Mrs. Jordan in the " Trip to Scarborough," and " The Devil to Pay ;" and, the devil to pay there was with poor Wilkinson : Mrs. Jordan and he could not agree ; she thought herself slighted by the audience; and, <em>sans c&eacute;r&eacute;monie</em>, before she had gone through half her nights, quitted York, leaving Tate's fair side all unguarded.</p>
