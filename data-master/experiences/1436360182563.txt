<p>I have rejoiced in every moment of sunshine which gave you an opportunity of hearing more agreeable concerts in your enchanting wood and walks than the three quires have produced to us ...The account of the music I leave to Mrs. Viney: the collection was a hundred and thirty seven pounds &mdash; there was a crowd and no company. The performance in the church much the best. Your sweet notes upon the clavichord have so refined my ears, that I must confess the music I have heard here sounds very harsh and the raking does not agree with me, for I have got the tooth-ach, but some of your black wool, which I have in my ear, will cure me.</p>
