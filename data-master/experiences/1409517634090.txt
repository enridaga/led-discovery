My diary mentions the following with regard to Herr Eck’s public concert in the Logensaal on the Brehbahn on the eighteenth of May:

“Herr Eck had great reason to be satisfied with the orchestra, for his concerti were admirably accompanied; not so the arias of Fräulien Grund, which were somewhat difficult for the wind instruments. At the head of this well drilled orchestra, is Massoneau, well known by his charming compositions. The appearance of this man by not means indicates his great talent; for his manner of playing and his bow-ings are so bad, that one might take him for the greatest bungler – and yet he does not direct at all badly.”
