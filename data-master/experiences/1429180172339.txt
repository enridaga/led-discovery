 I have to deal with a committee that makes many mistakes in the management, and none of us derive any pleasure from the concerts. Just imagine that the performance of 'Elijah' was announced to commence at half-past eight o'clock certainly an unreasonably late hour but the doors could not be opened to the public before a quarter past nine, because the hall was not ready! You can fancy the row that was going on. We began the performance at 9.30, whilst the people were streaming in, and, of course, for a long time not a note could be heard, much to our dis- gust. We had not finished until past midnight, in spite of having made no interval.
