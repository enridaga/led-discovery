During my stay, I had the pleasure of hearing two of the first performers on the violin, perhaps in the world; both gave concerts, and their performance was truly exquisite, although in different styles. The first was Giornovick, who was on his way from Russia to Paris, and had been many years first concerto player at the court of Petersburg. He was a man of a certain age, but in full vigour of talent; his tone was very powerful, his execution most rapid, and his taste above all alluring. No performer, in my remembrance, played such pleasing music. He generally closed his concerts with a rondo, the subject of which was some popular Russian air, to which he composed variations with enchanting taste; his performance reminded me strongly of the celebrated La Motte, whom I have often heard at the Rotunda in Dublin.

Janewitz, the other, was a very young man, in the service of the King of Poland; he also touched the instrument with thrilling effect, and was an excellent leader of an orchestra. His concertos always finished with some pretty Polonaise air; his variations also were truly beautiful.
