It was during these early activities of mine that I began to hear glowing accounts of the violinist Fritz Kreisler who was just appearing on the horizon. For me the experience of hearing him was like falling in love. His glowing tone, his vibrato, unique and inexpressively beautiful, his phrasing which in everything he played was so wonderful and so peculiarly his own, his extraordinarily fine bowing and left-hand technique, his attitude at once highly strung and assured, the passionate sincerity of his interpretations â€“ all this made me follow him around like a dog wherever he played in this country.
