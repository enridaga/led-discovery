<p>I played for Lady Day [Billie Holiday] for about two and a half years [1946-1949] and I guess you'd call it quite an experience. [...] I'll always remember the concert at Carnegie Hall when she got out [of prison]. It was one of the greatest thrills of my life.</p>
<p>One thing about Lady, she was the easiest singer I every played [piano] for. [&hellip;] She had the greatest conception of beat I ever heard. It just didn't matter what kind of song she was singin'. She could sing the fastest tune in the world or else something that was like a dirge, but you could take a metronome and she'd be right there. Hell! With Lady you could relax while you were playin' for her. You could damn near forget the tune.</p>
<p>Man, but gettin' her to work was another thing.</p>
