On going with a party to play at quoits, in a close of Mr. Heyrick's, I asked Mr. Greatorex his opinion of the Creation. He, unhesitatingly, answered that it never would be performed in England, as the style was too theatrical for the taste of the people ; indeed, it was so unlike everything he had seen that he confessed he could not play it. In the evening I laid the book before his sister to play the trio, ' On Thee each living soul awaits,' which, in the bass solo, resolves into the chord of E b b major. Shutting the book, she declared it was so strange that she did not know where to put her fingers.
