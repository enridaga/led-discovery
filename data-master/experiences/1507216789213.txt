Before, there went they of Paul's sang <em>Te Deum laudamus</em>, and after that, down they went a procession into Cheap round about the cross singing <em>Salve festa dies</em>. And my lord mayor and aldermen in scarlet round about Paul's without. And after, to Paul's Cross to sermon. And there preached the archdeacon of London, Doctor Harpsfield, and made a goodly sermon. The which day was the day of the Assumption of Our Blessed Lady the Virgin. And in his sermon he declared how many were taken and what noble men they were [at the Battle of St-Quentin, news of which had reached London the previous day].</span></p>
