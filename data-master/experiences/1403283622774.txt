... over-glad and over-tired, we lurch into the final concert, which sadly is the only one not sold out, because we clash with several other important concerts. This concert contains half a programme of Scherzi, which we do not manage quite slickly enough, although the raw material seems to be fine. After the interval, the Faur√© Quartet passes for me in a kind of dream. Everyone assures me it was fine, but suddenly disorientation grips me and I do not know how to judge any longer the effect of dome, music, people, anything. This is an unpleasant feeling because I associate it with 'normal' concerts where I sometimes feel that a bell-jar has descended over me, cutting me off from the audience. I don't want to feel like that in the dome, but I think the stress and anxiety of the last days have shut down my reactions.
