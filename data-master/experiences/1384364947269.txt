It is very strange indeed; a man twanging a guitar and a dozen women beating time with their hands; then all at once one of them begins to give utterance to certain notes, the chromatic scale all topsy-turvy: it is impossible to describe. In fact it’s thoroughly Arabian; after an hour you have had quite enough of it.
