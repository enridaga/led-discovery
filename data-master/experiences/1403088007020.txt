My object while in Paris, was to see all the theatres, and I therefore visited one or other of them every evening. I went, first, to the grand opera, and was delighted with the magnificence of the scenery, decorations and dresses, and, above all, with their chorusses; in that department they decidedly bear away the palm from every other country: the orchestra was most minutely attended to and more numerous than even that of Saint Carlos at Naples; but the principal singers (God save them) made a shriek louder than I thought any human beings capable of producing. The opera was Gluck's Iphigenia, which we had performed in Vienna; but for decorations and effect, Paris beat us out of the field. The chorus and the procession, where Pylades and Orestes in chains, were dragged on by Gardel, Vestris and a host of first-rate dancers, were beyond anything I could have conceived.
