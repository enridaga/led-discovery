Work in morning (Mass - copying out) & evening (Bridge transcription). Walk, with Mummy before lunch. Pictures (Grand) 3.0-5.0 with Beth - Disraeli - Most interesting & awfully good. Go to B.B.C. Symph. Concert at St Luke's Hospital - Dr. Colvin's Wireless. Why they gave this Mass in D to Scherchen - Heaven only knows. Of course there were beautiful bits - Sanctus & Benedictus & Kyrie - but the end of the Credo was incredibly scrambled. Chorus good - seemed to me that all their work was wasted. Soloists - tenor [Parry Jones] - not too bad: - Soprano [May Busby] - dreadful. Orchestra respectable - what I could hear of it - it didn't come through too well - I thought
