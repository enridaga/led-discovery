On all sorts of other occasions I have sung other songs, and there is not a village Inn for miles around Horsham where I have not sung one or more at a time. Wherever I went and sang I invariably got asked to come again; my songs never got stale to me nor, I believe, to my listeners, and I never got tired of singing them. On my 63rd birthday I walked to Rusper, counting the steps all the way, 10,611 in all, helped ring a peal of 5088 changes of treble bob major, sang twelve songs at the "Star Inn," and afterwards walked home. Some few times I have sung the list of 420 songs right through, every song from beginning to end; the last time I did so I sang them to my wife, commencing on the 4th April, 1906, the 78th anniversary of her birthday. I sang about ten on 41 consecutive evenings, and as we sat, evening after evening, one on either side of the fire, as happy as a king and queen, I singing my best, she listening and occasionally herself singing one of the fifty songs I had taught her, the old songs seemed as fresh and as pretty as they did when I first sang them fifty, sixty, perhaps seventy years or more ago.
