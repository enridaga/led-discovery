4 March, 1841.... All my children and my husband had presents for me [on my birthday]. Neukomm gave me a composition of his own to some pretty lines expressive of what my feelings might be on this day, and it was sung by Frances and Emilia [her daughters], accompanied by him in the organ.
5 March. - I have much more to tell of the remainder of my birthday, in which I heard some charming music, due to a party of singers conjured together, and another composition of Neukomm's, of which I had known nothing. Afterwards he and the Countess Mortier, the French Ambassadress, played a duet, he on the organ and she on the pianoforte - a quintett of Mozart's, arranged by him for the two instruments, in which the parts originally intended for wind-instruments fall to the share of the orgue expressif: and the effect was delightful.
