<p>Anton Rubinstein I first met at Hellmesberger's "mansion near the sky" in the Tuchlauben, where the&nbsp;quartet rehearsals of Vienna's "prime violino assoluto "&nbsp;used to come off on Wednesday and Friday afternoons.&nbsp;Having been jocularly recommended to him by our host&nbsp;as " ein geschickter Umblaetterer," I was permitted to "turn over" for him whilst he played the P.F. part of his&nbsp;B flat trio &mdash; perhaps the most strikingly Mendelssohnian&nbsp;of all his instrumental works &mdash; and more than once&nbsp;nearly got into trouble because I could not keep my eyes&nbsp;from wandering to his wonder-working hands from the&nbsp;pages upon which my attention should have been riveted.&nbsp;</p>
