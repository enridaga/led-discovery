The night before I left for San Francisco, Steinberg conducted Design in the Tabernacle. I will defend my children. I will betray and mock them and acquiesce to their opponents. (These words were written not by me but by another Ned.) I hate to attend even glamorous performances of yesterday's works when I should be home orchestrating tomorrow's.
