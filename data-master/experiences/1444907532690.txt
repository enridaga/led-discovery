[Duke of Dorset] took a band of music with him to Mr. Leighton&rsquo;s at Albano whose guests we were, and we had music all the evening, with delightful singing by Bachelli, commonly called the Mignatrice. She has a very sweet voice with infinite taste &ndash; has a good shake, great flexibility, and is more free from affectation of any sort than ever I saw in an Italian singer; but though she sings so admirably, &lsquo;tis not her profession, which is that of painting. However, she is much stronger in the former than the latter. She seems a perfect mistress (has learnt 5 years) and embellishes and changes passages better and more at her ease than any female I ever met with. Upon the whole, her singing is not so much in the great style of an Opera Queen as in that which I should wish a lady of fashion or private gentlewoman to be possessed of.</span></p>
