During the continuance of Storace's illness, three operas were produced, in which Signora Cortellini, Madame Bernasconi, and Signora Laschi performed. The last of these operas was composed by Signor Rigini, and written by the poet of the theatre, the Abbe da Ponte, by birth a Venetian- It was said, that originally he was a Jew, turned Christian, dubbed him self an Abbe, and became a great dramatic writer. In his opera, there was a character of an amorous eccentric poet, which was allotted to me ; at the time, I was esteemed a good mimic, and particularly happy in imitating the walk, countenance, and attitudes of those whom I wished to resemble. My friend, the poet, had a remarkably awkward gait, a habit of throwing himself (as he thought) into a graceful attitude, by putting his stick behind his back, and leaning on it ; he had also a very peculiar, rather dandyish, way of dressing; for, in sooth, the Abbe stood mighty well with himself, and had the character of a consummate coxcomb; he had also a strong lisp and broad Venetian dialect. 
The first night of the performance, he was seated in the boxes, more conspicuously than was absolutely necessary, considering he was the author of the piece to be performed. As usual, on the first night of a new opera, the Emperor was present, and a numerous auditory. When I made my entree as the amorous poet, dressed exactly like the Abbe in the boxes, imitating his walk, leaning on my stick, and aping his gestures and his lisp, there was a universal roar of laughter and applause ; and after a buzz round the house, the eyes of the whole audience were turned to the place where he was seated. The Emperor enjoyed the joke, laughed heartily, and applauded frequently during the performance ; the Abbe was not at all affronted, but took my imitation of him in good part, and ever after we were on the best terms. The opera was successful, had a run of many nights, and I established the reputation of a good mimic.
