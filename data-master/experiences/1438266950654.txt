<p>Listen to wireless after dinner. An amusing concert from Basel - Bekker cond. the v. good Symphony orchestra in J. Strauss &amp; Offenbach (the difficult Polka v. good). Then F.B. conducting Section C (or E) &amp; a Serenade Conct. The orchestra isn't good enough, but even then he gave a very brilliant show of Bizet's Adorable Jeux d'enfants &amp; the Prince Igor Dances; and a very lively Seraglio Ov. The Orch. wasn't up to the Midsummer N.D. Scherzo though. (The Dirge in the 1st work was rather lovely).*</p>
