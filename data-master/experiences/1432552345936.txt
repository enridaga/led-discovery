In Gounod I hail a real composer. I have heard his 'Faust' both at Leipzig and Dresden, and am charmed with that refined piquant music. Critics may rave if they like, against the mutilation of Goethe's masterpiece, the Opera is sure to attract, for it is a fresh, interesting work, with a copious flow of melody and lovely instrumentation.
