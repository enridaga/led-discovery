Walk with Beth after tea. Go to R.C.M. with her at 8.15 for part of Chamber concert. Stravinskys 3 pieces for Str. Quartet* (marvelous works) are creditably (not more) played by a quartet including Richards, Then a dismal, disgraceful in technique & musicianship, performance of "La Folia" by R.C. Onley.** A dull cantata ("Non sa che sia dolore" - but it might have been in Sanskrit) by Bach followed.*** After that we fled.
