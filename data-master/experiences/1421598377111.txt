<p>At the Venetian premiere in 1951 I had found it stale but was afraid to admit it. Everyone was saying, "Why do people call it a pastiche when it's pure Stravinsky? It is pastiche, and quite impure. A few very inspired tunes, but the libretto's overrefined with In-jokes and the prosody's burlesque. I left before the last act. (The babble of that international Venetian cast! Schwarzkopf's German accent, Tourel's Jewish accent, Roundsville's Broadway accent, Cu&eacute;nod's nonaccent from Switzerland, and the Englisheries of dear Nell Tangeman's two or three hardworked lines.)</p>
