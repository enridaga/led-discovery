There was a strange scene the other evening, when the 'Messiah' was given. Those excellent artists, Clara Novello and Mrs. Shaw, stirred the audience to great enthusiasm; it literally rained encores. Mrs. Shaw seemed willing to comply with the wishes of the audience. Miss Novello the reverse; she withstood all the shouts, clapping of hands, and other noisy demonstrations, and Phillips' song, 'Why do the heathen rage?' seemed well suited to the occasion, and was only half listened to by an audience shouting ' Miss Novello!' 'encore!' It was no good, she declined to repeat her song, and left the orchestra. At last the music was allowed to proceed without interruption, and when it came to the heavenly air 'I know that my Redeemer liveth,' Miss Novello stepped forward again, this time accompanied by a member of the committee, who was about to speak, but some one shouted out 'bad temper,' and the Witch's Sabbath began afresh, so that the poor lady sang the greater part of her sublime song amid the alternate hisses, applause, and screams of the audience. At last, however, her fine singing prevailed, and the turmoil was at an end.
