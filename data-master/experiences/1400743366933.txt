It is very cold where we are on the top of a hill which you may know, as you know where we are from the papers, and everything freezes up... we have a tiny hovel - the mess and kitchen are one and the floor is of earth. 3 of us sleep in one sort of attic above and the other 3 were sleeping in another one last night but nearly got blown out by the draft. However there is a fire and the gramophone still plays....
