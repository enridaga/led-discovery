This morning Frau and Fräulein W. went with me to engage a piano, and they took me also to the conservatory. Tausig is off for six weeks. giving concerts. As I went up the stairs I heard most beautiful playing. Ehlert, Tausig’s partner, who has charge of the conservatory, and teaches his pupils in his [Tausig's] absence, examined me. After that long voyage [from New York] I did not dare attempt anything difficult, so I just played one of Bach’s Gavottes. He said some encouraging words, and for the present has taken me into his class.
