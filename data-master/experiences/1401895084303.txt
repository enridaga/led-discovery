Today I had my Union Jack flying for the first time to celebrate this Cambrai victory. This is the dear Peace Flag I made months ago. For the first time too, since the war began, the bells of St Paul's and some other big churches rang a joyful carillon at midday, in honour of this first victory. The steps of St Paul's were thronged with hundreds of people who sang the National Anthem at midday.
