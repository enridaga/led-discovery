I used to hear Bird [Charlie Parker]  on Fifty-second Street [The Street]  in 1942â€¦

There was a place that later turned out to be the Spotlite Club, next to the Famous Door. And Bird came in one night and sat in with Don Byas. He blew "Cherokee", and everybody just flipped. That was probably about his first time on The Street. 

When Bird and Diz [Dizzy Gillespie] hit The Street regularly a couple of years later, everybody was astounded and nobody could get near their way of playing music. Finally, Bird and Diz made records, and then guys could imitate it and go on from there.
