Wonderful concert last Thursday. The Brahms and Schoenberg were
exhilarating (sic), but the Beethoven!!! The seventh is not just my favourite piece of music, but I think the finest artefact made by a man. I've been listening to it for over sixty years, first in albums when albums were albums- i.e. files of 78 discs- probably conducted by Toscanini. This was the best performance I have ever heard. In the fourth movement, I felt like I was listening to lightning there was so much power. Thank you very much.
