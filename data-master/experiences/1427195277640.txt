The last time I saw him [Chopin] was in England ; he had come to London a few weeks after my arrival there in 1848, and I had the privilege and the happiness to hear him several times at Mrs. Sartoris's and Henry F. Chorley's houses. The admiration which he elicited knew no bounds ; there we heard for the first time the beautiful valses, Op. 62, recently composed and published, which since have 
become the most popular of his smaller pieces.
