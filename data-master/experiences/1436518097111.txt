<p>To conclude my impression of Madame Tetrazzini, I should like to add how wonderfully she finished the Cabaletta in Lucia, commencing a shake on B flat and finishing her cadenza on the high E flat in Alt. Soon after this I made the acquaintance of the gifted artiste and found her most charming and unassuming. One day when I called on her she asked me to try over some English songs with her, which she has since sung at concerts. When I gave my Diamond Jubilee Con- cert in 1908 she insisted on buying tickets for it, as she was very anxious to hear Madame Patti, whom she had never heard sing. She was, of course, enchanted with the great Diva, and spoke most enthusiastically of Patti' s singing, and was full of veneration for her.</p>
