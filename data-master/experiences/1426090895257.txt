My chief interest in Warsaw has been Angela. I went to the performance. Gladkowska leaves little to be desired she is better on the stage than in the concert-hall. I need say nothing of her acting in tragedy which is first-class; and as for her singing, if it were not occasionally for those high F sharps and Gs, we need look for nothing better in her class. You would be enchanted with her phrasing, and her nuances are splendid; and although her voice trembled at the beginning when she came on, she later sang with great confidence. The opera was cut: perhaps that is why I did not notice its defect of boring longueurs. Soliva's aria in the second act is very effective: I knew it might be so but I did not expect the effect to be quite so great. Last time she sang very charmingly the Romance which she has to sing with her harp in the second act. (Ernemann accompanied on the piano off-stage without destroying the illusion.) I was very satisfied. At the end Angela was 
recalled and greeted with enthusiastic applause.
