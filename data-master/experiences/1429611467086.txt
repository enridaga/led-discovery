Jimmy Grissom sang with the band in the early '50s, and was a hit in the blues segments of 'My People', the show we presented in Chicago in 1963, where he sang with all the believable nuances expected of a blues singer. He always looked very young, yet when he sang the blues you had to believe that he had suffered every incident in the heartbreaking lyrics. In addition to that, he had a street-scene, jive quality that demanded his recognition as a worldly man who had given his heart in vain.
