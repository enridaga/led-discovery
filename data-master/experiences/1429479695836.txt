<p>I never was in any place so over-run with mendicants as at Padua ; they allow you no peace, but torture you in the name of their patron saint, Saint Anthony. We went to see his church, a very large, old building : the inhabitants call it, II Santo (the Saint), The interior is superb, crowded with fine paintings and sculpture. There are four fine organs, and a large choir, consisting of celebrated professors, vocal and instrumental. I heard a mass there, composed by II Padre Vallotti, and both the composition and performance were delightful.</p>
