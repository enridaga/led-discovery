<p>I have so many wonderful memories of the RFH. So many, so many. And will always cherish a small sample of the green carpet which I found. I will always remember Leonard Bernstein holding the score of Bruckner 3 over his head to acknowledge the endless applause. And Karajan's powerful Bolero. And queuing down the street all morning for Karajan. And the little bookshop with the sugared almonds.</p>
