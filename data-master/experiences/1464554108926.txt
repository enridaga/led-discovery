<p>General rehearsal of the&nbsp;<em>Oranges</em> Suite at the Conservatoire, conducted by Gaubert. Called for Suvchinsky, as he had said he would like to come. It was an open rehearsal; both the playing and the acoustic were mediocre. I am under no illusions, this is of course not one of my more important pieces, but even so it did not sound good today. I could not help thinking: did I simply write rubbish? Suvchinsky evidently did not like it much either; he said nothing.</p>
