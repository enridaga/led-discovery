<p>On May 20th I repeated Liszt's Dante Symphony, when I think it was better understood by the public. Previous to this concert I had seen in the Times that a new Russian pianist, M. Vladimir de Pachmann, had made a great sensation at a concert in Paris at the Salle Erard. I wrote at once to Messrs. Erard to offer him an engagement at this concert, which he accepted, and made his first English appearance under my direction, He played Chopin's Concerto in F minor splendidly, and some solos, and at once established his reputation as a Chopin player par excellence.</p>
