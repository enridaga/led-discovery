<p>Mary was most happy yesterday, dined with Mrs. Donnellan, and went between six and seven to Lady Cowper's concert...</p>
<p>The oratorio was charming last night and very full, notwithstanding a ball at Norfolk House given for the Duke of Cumberland's entertainment, an assembly at Lady Townsends's, and a concert at Lady Cowper's.&nbsp; We are to have but three oratorios more; I hope to go to them all; I have only missed one, and that I gave up to spend the afternoon with Mrs Donnellan.</p>
