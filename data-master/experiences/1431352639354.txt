Long before the first performance, Shostakovich showed the new work [Sixth Symphony] to Ivan Sollertinsky and to me. He played through the Finale twice and, contrary to his usual practice, praised it. ‘For the first time I think I’ve written a successful Finale. I don’t think even the severest critics will find anything to carp at in it.’ He said nothing about the first and second movements, but we were both captivated not only by the ravishing Finale, which was indeed irresistible, but also by the majestic Largo and the dazzling Scherzo, and we said so. Utterly bowled over and not caring if I embarrassed the modest composer, I launched into a panegyric over the Finale along the lines of: ‘If Mozart and Rossini had been alive in the twentieth century and if they had been planning a finale to a symphony, they would have come up with something like what we have just heard.’
