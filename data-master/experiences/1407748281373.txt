In the evening, the first time that we have had any sport among the seamen; and indeed, there was extraordinary good sport, after my Lord had done playing, at ninepins. After that, W. Howe and I went to play two Trebles in the great Cabbin below; which my Lord hearing, after supper he called for our instruments and played a set of Lock's, two trebles and a bass. And that being done, he fell to singing of a song made upon the Rump, with which he pleased himself well - to the tune of The Blacksmith. After all that done, then to bed.
