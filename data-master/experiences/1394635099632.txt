This evening there is a ball at the French Embassy. Madame L'Ambassadeur receives the guests at the top of the staircase....

In the ballroom, beneath the Georgian plasterwork, jazz music is raging. From the wall Louis XIV, the irreplaceable King of France, within the ermine and azure of his cloak, is careful not to smile.
