On the 10th. I went with my friend Mr Blake to the annual concert for the Musicians Fund led by Cramer, at the Opera House (the 1st. I had ever been at) where I heard solo concertos on the violin violoncello clarinet hautboy & bassoon & heard Signore Davis & Millico sing. The music at this concert was all perform'd in the common orchestra, except those that played solo concertos, who mounted the stage just above by themselves. As this was much the grandest concert I had ever then been at I still retain a perfect general idea of it...
