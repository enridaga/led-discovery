The Mass was sung by divers of the Queen's Chapel and children. And after Mass done, every clerk went in their procession two and two together, each having a surplice and a rich cope and a garland. After them, eighty standards, streamers, and banners. And everyone that bore them had an alb or else a surplice, and two and two together. Then came the waits playing. And then between thirty clerks and a choir singing <em>Salve festa dies</em>, so there were four choirs. Then came a canopy borne by four of the masters of the clerks over the sacrament, with a twelve staff torches burning, up St. Lawrence Lane. And so to the farther end of Cheap and back again, up Cornhill and so to Leadenhall and so down to Bishopsgate Street unto St. Ethelburga's Church. And there they did put off their copes. And so to dinner every man. And there everyone that bore a streamer had money as they were of substance there.</span></p>
