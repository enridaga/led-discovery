<p>Let me tell you how fine I thought your "Sur les Cimes" yesterday. It is splendid music, very highly pushed - and I would be very much surprised if you don't attain "Les Cimes" of glory - for you have great science coupled to great art, &amp; it is such a hard {?} alliance that something great must be born of it - When you have written any more, send it to me, for I shall have it given here, where you have a good orchestra. De Lara was very pleased also &amp; thought you very far gone in art.&nbsp;</p>
