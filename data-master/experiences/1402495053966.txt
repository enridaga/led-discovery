A batch of wounded Australians has arrived here from Gallipoli via Malta. They are a wild, devil-may-care lot and have upset the discipline of the whole hospital... They turn on the gramophone at midnight. When Sister 'Two Badges' dashes into the ward and orders them to turn it off, they ask her 'What's wrong, Old Dear? Don't you like that tune? Well what one do you like?' They do not understand discipline as it is applied to us.
