<p class="MsoNormal">The twentieth day of September was buried my Lady Cicely Mansfield at Clerkenwell with a herald of arms. And brought unto the Blackfriars in Smithfield, the which was St. Bartholomew, with four banners of saints and a two dozen torches and two great white branches and four gilt candlesticks and arms on them, and many clerks&nbsp;singing and many mourners. &hellip; And the friars sang dirge after their song and buried her after their fashion&mdash;without clerks or priests. And after, to the place to drink. And the morrow, three masses sung Mass, and after two prick-song masses, Mass, and after, to Clerkenwell to dinner to her place.&nbsp;</p>
