We got to New York on Friday and by Sunday we'd lined up a job for that afternoon. Duke Ellington was playing the Audubon Theatre in the Bronx, but he couldn't make the first showâ€¦ So our band played it. 

The pit band looked pretty surprised when the curtain went up and there we were on stage. But then Louis [Armstrong] played the "St. Louis Blues" and I saw something I'll never forget as long as I live. When he finished, even the band in the pit stood up and applauded for him. It was a wonderful, wonderful reception.
