<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">This attack [of ill health] coincided with the world-wide outbreak of influenza which swept &hellip; over Europe early in 1919.&nbsp; The local doctor suggested that I should be inoculated, and accordingly I accepted this new treatment.&nbsp; The result was that I went to bed for three months.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately we had previously invited a young Excise officer and his new wife to stay for a few weeks while they looked for a cottage &hellip; They arrived during the first week that I was in bed &hellip; The bride had brought down a Pleyel upright piano with her, a sympathetic instrument, not confused in tone although overstrung, and she played and sang with amateur charm, specialising in the songs of Schumann and Hugo Wolff [<em>sic</em>].&nbsp; Every morning &hellip; she opened my bedroom door and the door downstairs, and gave me an hour&rsquo;s delight.</p>
