But certainly in the long run I had the best of this bargain [collaboration with composers]. I like to think of that summer day in idyllic Donaueschingen with George Antheil, playing and singing to his audience of one is manuscript symphony in the empty dining-room of the old hotel. It was during the second or third Donaueschingen Festival in the early nineteen-twenties, long before his 'Ballet MÃ©canique' days.
