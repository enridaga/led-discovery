<p class="MsoNormal">While on the subject of musical conventions and New England singers, I wish to interject a remark,&mdash;not as a compliment on the one&rsquo; hand, nor as a defamation on the other,&mdash; namely: in the conventions it was often the case that Rossini&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Stabat Mater</em> was performed, and I can aver that the most perfect singing of the two quartettes (concerted) in that work was often done by Mrs. H. M. Smith, soprano; Miss Annie Louise Cary, alto; Mr. James Whitney, tenor; Mr. Myron Whitney, bass. The intonation of those singers was as positively perfect as any musician could desire to hear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In contradistinction, I think no musician can speak favorably of the performance of the same works by any combination of so-called great or distinguished artists that he has since heard.</p>
