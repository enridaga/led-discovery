I passed the examination, my Exercise being performed in the Sheldonian Theatre, the Rev. Stephen Hawtrey sending up a good part of our choir to sing in it. Some weeks afterwards we performed it at St. Mark's School, the tenor solo being taken by Arthur D. Coleridge, in after years my very dear friend, and the bass by the Rev. W. H. Bliss, then Minor Canon at Windsor. This was in 1868, and I made the acquaintance of Arthur Sullivan about this time. He was staying near Windsor, and attended one of the concerts given at St. Mark's,
at which a setting of mine of some words from Tennyson's "In Memoriam" ("The time draws near the Birth of Christ ") was sung. Sullivan was very
kind and complimentary, at the same time pointing out an awkward passage of modulation, which, he said, "will always give you trouble," and so it has to
this day.
