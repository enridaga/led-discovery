<p>My financee and I went to 24 concerts in the opening season (8 at Wigmore) and well remember the excitement we felt at the great optimism and panache the whole first year. The fountains, the Skylon, the restaurants and of course the Concert Hall after the grim war years we felt a huge sense of new life and uplift from the whole ambiance. Great days!</p>
