What other repertoire do you depend on?

Show tunes. I have to play tunes I like if I want to express myself, and I do like show tunes: Broadway shows; musicals; themes from the movies. I used to listen to the radio all day long to get to know the show tunes. Right now I'm starting to listen to records again, mostly Bud Powell and Charlie Parker.
