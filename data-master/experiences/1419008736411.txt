<p>Feb. 17, Wigmore Hall, Busch Quartet</p>
<p>I have a special affection for Beethoven&rsquo;s F minor (op.95); tho&rsquo; it isn&rsquo;t quite in the category of &ldquo;late quartets&rdquo;, it has a freedom and lightness of its own. It is difficult to see why anyone should regard Haydn&rsquo;s op 54, 2 in C as lacking in interest. The first movement is undoubtedly very fine, the slow movement beautiful enough and the minuet, if a little pedestrian, has an unusual &amp; effective trio. While the last movement is extraordinary &amp; extraordinarily effective &ndash; in effect a most moving &amp; solemn adagio broken suddenly for a short while by a sort of rapid chattering match. I certainly agree with Cecil Gray that the quartet looks forward to Beethoven and beyond.</p>
<p>Mozart&rsquo;s E flat Quintet is still very unfamiliar and I am not prepared to do more than write a general appreciation of its beauties. It seems to me rather different from those in C, D and G min. &amp; the first movement might almost have been written by Haydn. All 3 works received a splendidly vigorous and musical performance</p>
