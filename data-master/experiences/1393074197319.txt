I first  re-encountered Conrad some months after that voyage [on the fast passenger clipper 'Torrens' from Port Adelaide to London in 1893, on which Conrad served as first mate], when we paid a visit together to 'Carmen' at Covent Garden Opera. 'Carmen' was a vice with us both.  It was already his fourteenth time of seeing that really dramatic opera. The blare of Wagner left him as cold as it leaves me; but he shared with my own father a curious fancy for Meyerbeer.
