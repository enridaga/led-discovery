<pre>The other representation [of Theresa Tietjens's "Lucrezia Borgia"] (Her Majesty's <br />Theatre, May 19, 1877) is fraught with sad memories and undying admiration for a <br />courageous woman and a true artist. It had been known for some time that Theresa <br />Tietjens was suffering from cancer; and, after much hesitation, the doctors <br />decided to perform an operation before the end of May. "Lucrezia" was announced <br />for the 19th, and among the prima donna's friends it was pretty well understood <br />that this would be her last appearance before the operation was performed. 

When the day arrived Tietjens was far too ill to be really fit to sing. It was <br />distinctly against her medical advisers' wish that she insisted upon keeping <br />faith with her manager and the public a practice that she had persistently <br />adhered to throughout her career. How she contrived to get through the opera I <br />shall never understand. It can only be compared to some splendid example of <br />martyrdom. She fainted after each of the acts, but immediately on recovering <br />consciousness decided to proceed with the performance. Never so much as a look <br />or gesture betrayed to her audience the mortal anguish she was suffering. Only <br />the initiated knew how much of reality there was in the terrible scream of agony <br />uttered by Lucrezia in the final scene when she perceives that her son is dead. <br />As it rang through the house the audience shuddered. Yet the brave artist would <br />not shirk her fall at the end. What it cost her could be guessed, however, from <br />the fact that after the curtain had been twice raised in response to rapturous 
plaudits, she still lay motionless upon the ground. She had once more become <br />insensible. 

In the following week the operation was performed, but the case was hopeless, <br />and on October 3, 1877, Theresa Tietjens breathed her last.</pre>
