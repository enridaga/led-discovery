Last Saturday we were invited to the Primate's to hear music…it was the Duke of Dorset's birthday, and the entertainment given in honour of it. A fine dinner was given to a number of the principal men….  Our music was chiefly Italian -- the Stabat Mater, sung by Guadagni (whom you heard sing in Mr. Handel's oratorios) and Mrs. Oldmixon; Dubourg the principal violin: it was well performed, and some of the duet parts are very pretty. They had more music after we left them, but we staid till nearly ten, which was a late hour for us.
