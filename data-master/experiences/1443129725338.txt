<p>My last evening at home was a break in the strict <em>regimen</em>; for I did not go to bed at six o&rsquo;clock, I set off with Father and Jack &hellip; for the Shakespeare Theatre on Lavender Hill, Clapham, to assist at a performance of Gounod&rsquo;s <em>Faust</em>.</p>
<p>Jack had proved himself again unerring in psychological insight. &nbsp;My private fears and my physical discomfort were swallowed up in a vaster cataclysm of emotion. &nbsp;The music (I had never before heard an orchestra) rolled over me like a Pacific surge, lifting me up and sucking me down, a raw-nerved piece of flotsam; while the scenery, the characters, the plot, and the pervading sense of moral conflict, with Faust&rsquo;s horrible sin, poisoning the air in the over-heated gallery of the theatre, all combined to drive me into a frenzy of feeling that froze solid, turning me to stone. &nbsp;I remember still the cold fury of compassion with which I witnessed the end of Marguerite in prison; and the guilty terror that made me apply to myself Faust&rsquo;s last moments, when he descended through the trap-door into Hell, supported by Mephistopheles and a nimbus of coloured fire.</p>
<p>Nor had Jack remained unaffected. &nbsp;His Spanish complexion was touched with an unusual flush, and his great brown eyes shone with that upward-looking fire which El Greco carried into the features of his saints and martyrs.</p>
<p>We walked home from the theatre, down Pig Hill into the Battersea marshes, Father discoursing to us and neither of us listening, each being still under the spell. &nbsp;I shivered in the night air, after the fever and the ecstasy, and my teeth chattered in rivalry to Father&rsquo;s happy monologue.</p>
<p>Sleep vanished that night. &nbsp;Jack and I lay whispering in the darkness, a darkness still lurid with hellfire, and sonorous with the first orchestral music we had ever heard. &nbsp;What had given Jack the premonition of this wonderful thing, that he had suggested the visit to the opera? &nbsp;How had he heard of the touring company, and on what sources did he draw for his prescience of what we should hear?</p>
