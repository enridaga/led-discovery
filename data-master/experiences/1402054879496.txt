Every Sunday we used to try and have a service on board and we sang hymns which were heard by the soldiers on shore. They told us how much it meant to them so whenever we scrubbed the decks we sang out as loud as we could all the old hymns to inspire them: ‘Onward, Christian Soldiers’, ‘Fight the Good Fight’, anything that was rousing. It cheered us up, too.
