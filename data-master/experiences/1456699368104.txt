<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Or take Fiorenza Cossotto. When she sang Santuzza&rsquo;s aria in Mascagni&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Cavalleria Rusticana </em>(an opera, by the way, which I have never liked), everything became clear: she told of Santuzza&rsquo;s sufferings only through her singing, standing almost motionless in a simple dress on the stage of the Grand Hall of the Conservatoire. /I hope I will not be suspected of underestimating the work of the producer, the artist, and, of course, the conductor. We are all aware of the difficulties of their work &ndash; difficulties that are all the greater, the more prominence is given to the element of singing. </span></p>
