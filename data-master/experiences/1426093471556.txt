<p>Gladkowska was rather nervous on her first appearance and did not sing her first cavatina as well as she did the second time. She is admirable when she sings. She does not clip it short like Mme Mayer, but gives the notes their full value i.e. not rapid gruppetti, but every one of the eight notes fully sung. In the last act they added, or rather substituted, after the funeral march, the prayer from Rossini's Mahomet which suits her voice, in place of the aria in the Magpie which lies too high for her. So much for the opera.</p>
