<p>Madame Kirkby Lunn, the great English con- tralto, first came out as Norah in Stanford's Shamus O'Brien in 1896, then joined the Carl Rosa Opera Company at Manchester, and then sang with great success at Covent Garden, where she created the part of Dalila in Saint-Saen's opera. How can we ever forget her delivery of the beautiful aria " Mon Coeur s'ouvre a ta voix," or " Printemps qui commence " ? She is also great as Amneris in A'ida, and as a concert singer she is simply perfection. I have heard her sing at most of her recitals and her voice reminds me very much of Alboni's. I cannot pay her a greater compliment than this.</p>
