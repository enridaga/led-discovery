The band of the Seaforth Highlanders played the funeral march, ‘The Flowers of the Forest’. As these plaintive strains ceased, the roll of muffled drums was heard, the bands of the Foot Guards began Chopin’s ‘Marche Funèbre,’ and the procession moved slowly towards the Castle.
              Behind the bands of the Grenadier, Coldstream, and Scots Guards rode a part of the escort, and then the gun-carriage bearing the remains of His Royal Highness.
