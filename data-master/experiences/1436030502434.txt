When Lous [Armstrong] was fixin' to make his next trip to New York (the first one on his own), Lil Armstrong loaned everybody in the band twenty dollars and off we went--without a job set or anything. I'll never forget that trip across the country in Louis' Hupmobileâ€¦ And every big town we'd come to, we'd hear Louis' records being played on loudspeakers and stuff. Louis was surprised--he didn't know he was so popular. If we'd known that, we could have had an agent line us up one-nighters all the way to New York.
