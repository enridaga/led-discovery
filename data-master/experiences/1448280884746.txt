<p>There is, in connection with this church [St Thomas' Church, Leipzig], a school where boys are fitted for the University. This school is large, and employs about fifteen teachers. Provision is made for the gratuitous education, and I believe support, of sixty pupils; and these charity pupils are the musical boys whence the choir is sustained. They are regularly taught music, and are required to sing on the Sabbath, on Saturday at o&rsquo;clock, and at funerals. On Saturday regularly at the hour mentioned, there is a short service, and the choir commence it by singing one or two motettes, without accompaniment. The same choir, with orchestra, alternate between the St. Thomas and the St. Nicholas Church; and the same motette is sung in one church which was sung in the other the previous Sabbath.</p>
