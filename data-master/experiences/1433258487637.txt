<p>Back somewhere in the eighties, we'd go down to Austin and do these benefits for Clifford Antone, whose club was always in dire straits. This was back when the place was on Guadalupe Street in South Austin. They had all the usual Austin people there, plus the Kentucky Headhunters. It was just me and Sam who went, and we sat in with the house band. I think it was George Raines on drums and Kim Wilson on harp and singing; that's all I can remember. I think there's still a tape of it somewhere. Now, some of these nights at Antone's could go on forever. They'd shut the doors and play 'til six in the morning if they wanted to. The Kentucky Headhunters were the headliners that night, and they closed the regular show. Later on, after the audience and most of the employees were gone, they started in jamming, and Sam wanted to get up with them. When there's music to be played, he's always ready to be a part of it&hellip; Anyway, he was up there playing, with Clifford Antone on bass, Derek O'Brien on guitar, Kim was on harp, and Sam was singing. There was a guy who played guitar for the Kentucky Headhunters who at this time was playing piano. I think his name is Richard Young. This guy had real long hair, was kind of heavyset and wore glasses. Sam kind of half-way introduced the people that were up there, and when he got to the guy who was playing piano, he said, "You know, I'm not sure what the young lady's name is who's playing piano ...," and everybody just died laughing. Derek went up to him and told him it was a guy who was playing piano, and Sam just said, "Oops! Slippers! Sorry about that!" and just went on like nothing had happened.</p>
