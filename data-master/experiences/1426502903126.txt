<p>On Thursday evening Fuchs gave a party at which Limmer, one of the best Viennese artists, produced his compositions for four 'cellos. Merk, as usual, makes them sound more attractive than they really are. We were there till twelve, as Merk felt like playing his <em>Variations</em> with me. Merk tells me he enjoys playing with me, just as I do with him, so we must produce a good impression when together. He is the first cellist whom I have admired on close acquaintance.</p>
