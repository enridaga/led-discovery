Several members of the audiences commented that they much preferred the pure sound quality when we were playing at the far end of the dome and eventually we did most things there, compromising between the flat performing position in the centre and the raised platform position at the far end of the dome by having a flat stage at the Golden Section of the dome. The piano, a Lechleiter upright which we hired in Cheltenham, was a disappointment, and its feebleness spoiled both performances of the Ravel Trio for me who had to play it. But it looked solid and dignified, as befitting the new drawing-room atmosphere of the dome with its carpet and standard lamp.
