<p>&nbsp;One of the nicest memories I had at the Royal Festival Hall was tpo hear french singer called Mireille Mathieu. What a strong voice!and a magic evening had by all, as every seat was taken. At the end of the concert she had so many encores and ovations, i'm sure she thought she would never leave.ha!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; p.s. I hope Mireille Mathieu will get to sing again at the Royal Festival Hall?</p>
