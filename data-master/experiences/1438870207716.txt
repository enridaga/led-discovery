<pre>In later years Mme. Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt used to be a conspicuous figure at <br />the concerts of the London Bach Choir, whereof her husband, Mr. Otto Goldschmidt, <br />was the first conductor. She would modestly take her place in the front row of 
the sopranos, with the most musical of the Queen's daughters, the Princess <br />Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, for her near companion. Moreover, she took an <br />active part in the training of the female voices, and to her skilful instruction <br />was in a large measure due the facility and brilliancy with which they executed <br />the difficult passages in Bach's B minor Mass (performed for the first time in <br />England April 26, 1876). The great singer died at Malvern, November 2, 1887, <br />and seven years later I was present at the unveiling of the tablet, with <br />medallion portrait, which now does honor to her memory in the south transept of <br />Westminster Abbey. She is so far the only musical artist, other than a composer, <br />whose lineaments have been exposed upon the walls of that ancient fane. </pre>
