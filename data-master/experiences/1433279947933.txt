Doctor Pring introduced me to the precentor, [at Bangor Cathedral] Dr. Cotton, brother to Lord Combermere, who invited me to a sacred concert in the Minster the following evening. A moveable orchestra was placed in the aisle opposite to the reading desk, where the precenter directed the performance, and a most unexpected treat it was, to hear such excellent music among the mountains.
