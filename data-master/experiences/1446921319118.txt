<p>Very few at Church, I never remember so few. The Singers except a few were gone to Lydiard to Sing and have a dinner given to them and I fear carried many of the Congregation with them. Our Singers are become famous in the Country, which makes them vain and fond of Exhibiting themselves and I think they think more of their own Praise than the Praise of God. As we of our own Parish subscribed for the Instruments I observed that they should not forsake us in the time of our own Service, for we did not buy the Instruments for the Amusement of other Churches. This time however they apologised and hoped I would excuse as they were strongly pressed to go and promised a dinner which was not to be resisted. However we had tolerable singing notwithstanding.&nbsp; After Church and dinner I rode to Dodington and there we had a full Congregation. </p>
