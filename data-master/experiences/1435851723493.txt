[In the summer of 1942 Benny Green and then Dizzy Gillespie joined a band in Chicago that included Earl Hines, Billy Eckstine, Budd Johnson, Charlie Parker and Shadow Wilson]. 

I used to listen to Diz a lot. He sat right behind me. Quite a few of the men in the band couldn't understand what he was doing, though they admired his control and execution. I didn't understand too much of it either, but I liked it. 

Dizzy would take me to his house and show me on piano the alternate chords and other things he was doing. It was like going to school. I remember starting to ad lib around an eight-bar thing he'd written up. It opened up a new era for me. Then I started practicing things he'd tell me, and before I knew it, I was ad libbing more and more.
