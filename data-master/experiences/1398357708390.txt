In the afternoon we have a Mozart rehearsal, which is attended by a large crowd of sunbathers and strollers, and outside the Dome there are concentric rings of people happy to read their books or play with their children in the vicinity of nice music. David Roth stays for the rehearsal and makes many useful comments about the string playing, including analyses of how it sounds from the back of the Dome, which we rarely have a chance to know about. It's strange to be playing a Mozart concerto on an upright Japanese piano; I can't seem to find the right angle for the piano so that the audience can see me, but I can also see my colleagues.
