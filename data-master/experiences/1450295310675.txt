<p><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Renard </span></em><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was inspired by the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">guzla</em>, the extraordinary instrument carried by the goat in the last part of the play, and imitated in the orchestra with good but less than perfect success by the cimbalom. The <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">guzla</em>, a museum piece now, was rare even in my childhood in St Petersburg. A kind of metal-stringed balalaika, it is strapped over the player&rsquo;s head like the tray of a cigarette girl in a night-club. The sound produced is deliciously live and bright, but it is preciously tiny, too, and who now played the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">guzla</em>? <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&lsquo;Guzli</em>&rsquo; means &lsquo;string music played by human touch&rsquo;. Part of the fun in <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Renard</em> is that this extremely nimble-fingered instrument should be played by the cloven-hoofed goat. Incidentally, the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">guzla </em>music- &lsquo;plink, plink&hellip;&rsquo; &ndash; was the first part of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Renard </em>composed. </span></p>
