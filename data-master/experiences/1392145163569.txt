As a preparation for a School of Music, my first mixed musical parties gave but dubious results. On Thursday I gave a musical party  to 30 of the élite civil and miltary, male and female. Two pianists, expressly brought up by car from Jaffa, played classical duets, and the evening between the items was clearly a success, the buffet being applauded and even encored. [...] For the Jerusalem School of Music I had to collect the Committee, explain the object, discover the talent, negotiate for a house, bargain for instruments (as you know there’s a piano famine in both Egypt and Palestine), borrow the celebrated violinist Tchaikov from the Front (as inaugurating Professor and (b) as fund earner by going to Egypt to give concerts [...] in Cairo and Alexandria.
