<p>Visit from Sharon Robinson and pianist Margo Garrett, who play lustrously (with the embarrassingly out-of-tune Baldwin) the <em>Dances for Cello</em>. I never get used to performers who interpret my music, with their imperceptible pressures, their added strokes of "meaning", their classically studied hesitations. For me to assume that my expression rests on the page is not to deny their legitimacy, and in fact I'm flattered they care. It's just that I never get used to it.</p>
