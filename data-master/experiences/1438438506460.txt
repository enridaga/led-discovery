Mayer, with a complete Milanese troupe&mdash; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>principals, chorus, orchestra, and even mise en scene&mdash; expressly brought over from La Scala, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>where the opera was first produced in February, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>1887. Tamagno and Maurel sustained their original parts, and for the former it was his London <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>debut. The performance, exceedingly fine on the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>whole, was admirably directed by Faccio, the famous chef-d'orchestre of La Scala, who died a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>year or two later. </span></p>
