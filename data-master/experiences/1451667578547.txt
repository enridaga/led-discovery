<p>I have heard him [Anton Rubinstein] transpose one of the most heart-breaking fugues (heart-breaking, of course, only from&nbsp;a mechanical point of view) of the "forty-eight" from a&nbsp;flat key into a sharp key, the latter not even being one&nbsp;of his own selection, but chosen by a fellow-pianist whom&nbsp;I shrewdly suspected at the time to be guilty of intending to set Rubinstein an impossible task. He played&nbsp;the fugue in question&mdash; which I had only too good&nbsp;reason to know by heart &mdash; without missing a note or&nbsp;omitting an emphasis. When it was over, I noticed that&nbsp;the perspiration was standing out in great beads upon&nbsp;his massive forehead, from which unwonted symptom of&nbsp;fatigue I drew the inference that he had put a heavy&nbsp;strain upon his powers. But that he had performed this astonishing feat at unforseen request and without&nbsp;a minutes hesitation.&nbsp;</p>
