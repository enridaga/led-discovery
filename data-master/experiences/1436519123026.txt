<p>My readers who have in years past had the advantage of hearing Signor Graziani, the greatest foreign baritone of his time, will remember his luscious voice and the wonderful delivery of his Italian method. He has now a worthy successor in Signor Sammarco, the most admired baritone at Covent Garden. I shall never forget the first time I heard Sammarco's splendid singing of the prologue in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, as his voice reminded me so much of Graziani' s, and I do not wonder he has become such a great favourite in England and America.</p>
