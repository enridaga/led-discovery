This time my dreams of a great&nbsp;operatic career seemed to be getting nearer&nbsp;to realisation than before ; but when, after&nbsp;evidently having satisfied both these gentlemen, I was given to understand that at first I&nbsp;should not be allowed to sing any but small&nbsp;parts, like the Herald in <em>Lohengrin</em>, I gratefully&nbsp;declined the offer.</p>
