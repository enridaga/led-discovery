I was rewarded with some of the most lasting impressions of my many years of museum and theatre experience. The Shtchugin Gallery of Modern Art; the Leningrad Eremitage, which I had first visited in December 1913; Nemirovitch-Dantchnko’s Carmencita with Bizet’s music, remarkably conducted by Vladimir Bakaleinikov(…)these are but a few of my outstanding memories.
