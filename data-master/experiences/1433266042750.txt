 In some musically overbred setups, on the other hand, in places where they pride themselves on waiting lists and where season tickets are inherited and season-ticket holders constitute a kind of aristocracy, I have “heard” silence at the close of a joyous clarion ending to an allegro first movement of a Mozart concerto – a frozen void after an allegro that is as divinely 'allègre' as only Mozart could make it. / At one playing of a Mozart concerto, Richard Strauss conducting, the Master and I exchanged happy glances at the conclusion of the serenely joyous first movement. Naturally we expected a similarly happy reaction from our audience and when we met with polite and stony silence instead, Strauss turned to me and muttered, in his thick Bavarian dialect: “The so-and-so newspaper scribblers and commentators” This is their work-making people skeered to clap when I know they feel like doing it.”
