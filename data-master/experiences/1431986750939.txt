When we got home to Berlin I went to hear Eugen d’Albert play at the Philharmonic Hall with Nikisch conducting. I had heard records of d’Albert and very much wanted to hear him play. He was at his zenith that night; both he and Nikisch seemed inspired. He played the Emperor Concerto, and though such a small being he seemed to have the same inner strength as the great Busoni, who was fortunate in having long fingers. I had just heard Busoni play at the house of a friend, where he would improvise by the hour. I went round to the artistes’ room afterwards and d’Albert expressed the wish we might meet again some day.
