<p>Herschel Evans was a natural. He had a sound on the tenor [saxophone] that perhaps you will never hear on a horn again. As for the so-called friction between him and Lester [Young], there was no real friction. What there was was almost like an incident [&hellip;] between two brothers. No matter what, there was always a mutual feeling there. Even in Lester's playing today, somewhere he'll always play two to four measures of Herschel because they were so close in what they felt about music.</p>
