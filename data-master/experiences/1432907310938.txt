Isaac Aldridge was about the only ringer here who possessed any intelligent idea of change ringing, but he was by no means a really good ringer, as I afterwards understood; most of the time in the belfry was spent in aimlessly ringing or chiming the old Queen's Changes - 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8, - &c., an occupation that by no means satisfied the ambitions I had engendered and was now nursing; for I had heard of the success of the old Horsham ringers, as set forth above, and of the doings of other ringers round about. 

My first knowledge of good ringing was got from the Warnham ringers. On Christmas Eve, 1846, I was standing with a brother ringer, Wm. Norket, at the bottom of the Bishopric; 'twas a clear, frosty evening, with the wind in the north, and as we stood we heard the six Warnham bells ringing beautifully. I proposed going over there, and we started at once. When we arrived we found old Ike Aldridge ringing treble, and the others in the following order: Frank Osborne, 2; Michael Turner, 3; John Hogsflesh, 4; Ned Turner, 5; Michael Charman, 6. They were ringing scientifically; everything seemed to be so nice and lively, and as regular as clockwork. I had now been ringing some time, and I felt ashamed of the Horsham ringers.
