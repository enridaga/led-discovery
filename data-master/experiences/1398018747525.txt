Leontyne Price, beautiful in a gown of blue sequins, sopranoing by heart and tonally (after hours of villainous bearded dodecaphonists), sang Sam Barber's Hermit Songs perfectly but with a trace of Southern accent, Lou Harrison's Rapunzel aria gorgeously but with a suggestion of Southern drawl, Sauguet's La Voyante in elegant French but with a shadow of Southern croon. Her success was so great that she was permitted an encore, and performed an unaccompanied spiritual with no accent at all!
