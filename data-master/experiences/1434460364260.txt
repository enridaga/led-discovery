Such contacts got me into the habit of being on the alert for manifestations of the folk-spirit wherever my tours happened to take me. Whether it was the fife-and-drum-accompanied dancing on Pamplona’s Plaza del Castillo, or Dinicu’s or Boulanger’s Rumanian Gypsy bands in Bucharest, or the Teatro Pavon in Madrid, or a session with the erudite Dr. Kunst and his unique ethnographical record collection in the Dutch East Indies, I was always an interested listener and observer.
