Went for a lovely walk yesterday morning through the fields towards Neuve Ã‰glise. In the far distance somebody's guns were booming, but nearer, a regimental drum and fife band was practising.... I enjoyed it until I was so sleepy  that I had to march in time to the music to get myself moving to come back.
