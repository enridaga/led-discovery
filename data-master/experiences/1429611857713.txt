We were playing a joint in Seattle in 1962, and everything was going smoothly until our bassist, Aaron Bell, decided to tell me that he would have to leave the band in a day or two. I'm in Seattle and really stuck for a bass player, so I had to act quickly. I got on the phone and called Pat Willard in Los Angeles, asked whom she knew who might be available and free to leave immediately. She gave me a few names… The last name on the list was Ernie Shepard…

Well, Shep arrived on time, and the minute he played the first number I knew I had hit the jackpot. Such sensitivity, such taste, even in numbers where there was no bass part. He reminded me of Blanton with an added bop flair…

We still have a recording I love to listen to now and then when I have the time--and a machine. It's just Shep singing and accompanying himself on the bass.
