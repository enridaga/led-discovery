<p class="MsoNormal">We arrived in San Francisco from Australia in the summer of '82, we received a cable message from Mr. Henry E. Abbey, then in London, offering us an engagement to travel the coming season with Madame Christine Nilsson. It was joyfully accepted, and the season was one of the pleasantest we ever passed. We performed on the average three or four times each week, visiting only large cities East and West, and New Orleans and California. The company comprised : Madame Nilsson, soprano; Miss Hope Glen, alto (an American singer who has lived most of her time in London); Mr. Theodore Biorksten, tenor; Signor Del Puente, the well- known baritone; Mr. Charles Pratt, accompanist ; and the Mendelssohn Quintette Club.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Madame Nilsson was in the prime of her vocal powers, and her renditions of the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Ah Perfido</em>, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Angels ever Bright and Fair</em>, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">and Connate tu le pays</em>, were examples of great singing. Her <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">chevalde battaille</em>, however, was the &ldquo;Jewel Song &rdquo; from Faust, by Gounod. She used to &ldquo; go through all the motions,&rdquo; just the same as she would in opera. Her ballad singing was a revelation of the fine, tender heart she possessed. It was a rare occasion when she was not forced by popular desire to sing the Suwanee River. She doubtless will be remembered by the great mass of music-lovers as the lady who sang so touchingly about the &ldquo;old folks at home.</p>
