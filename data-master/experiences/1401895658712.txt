Quite good lesson with Ireland in Chelsea at 10.0. Practise afternoon, tea with Barbara & Mummy at Selfridges at 4.45. Go with Mummy (with tickets from Mrs. Brosa via. Mrs Bridge) to topping recital by Antonio Brosa. He is simply superb. Incredible technique, with beautiful interpretation. His Bach Chaconne was great. Prokofiev op. 16 Vln. Concerto didnâ€™t contain much music, but was rather like a compendium of School for Virtuosity vln exercises. He played it toppingly. A great violinist.
