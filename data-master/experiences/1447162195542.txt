<p>I went out on a circus. It was a Wild West show; I call it a circus. The Young Buffalo Bill Wild West. I just went out for the summer months. And I would always go back home to school during the winter months. But, that's how I really got started, professionally. They had a regular brass band on a side show, and a minstrel, and the band ... Every town we visited the band would play on a wagon, a special wagon.</p>
