<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Brian Wilson doing 'Pet Sounds' was good. But, Patti Smith doing 'Horses' at Meltdown was amazing! At one point she jumped into the crowd, ran up the aisle and stood on a chair - right in front of me! It was also one of the last concerts before the RFH shut, so on the way out, I took photos of the carpet. I love that carpet!!</p>
