At night I went to the Police Band Concert with Father and Mother, I enjoyed the concert very much indeed. But of course it rained as I went out with Father, and it was so miserable to sit in our damp clothes all night. Miss Roberts, Miss Woodhatch, Mr Dalzeth and Dr Johnson sang, and the band played at intervals.
