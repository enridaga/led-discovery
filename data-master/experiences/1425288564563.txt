     Almost fifteen years ago I happened  to attend  a concert  at the well-known Salle Erard in the rue du Mail. The greater part of the audience consisted of cultivated people, many of them practical musicians. First a Beethoven trio was played, then one by Pixis. On the printed  programs  the composers'  names  had been inadvertently interchanged, the Beethoven trio appearing as by Pixis, and vice versa.
     What happened? - Beethoven, taken for Pixis, was heard in quiet indifference; Pixis, taken for Beethoven, was noisily applauded.
