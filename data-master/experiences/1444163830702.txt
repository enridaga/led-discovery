<p>So single-minded was he,[Herbeck] that he never&nbsp;suspected the traps that were laid for him on these&nbsp;occasions. Had he done so, nothing would have been&nbsp;easier for him than to turn the tables on his guileful&nbsp;friends by improvising ad libitum in the style of the&nbsp;school to which the composer belonged whose work they&nbsp;had asked him to play; for his marvellous familiarity&nbsp;with all the successive phases of tonality enabled him to&nbsp;perform the most remarkable imitative feats. I remember, on one occasion, when an old musical crony carried&nbsp;the joke so far as to invent the name of a composer and&nbsp;beg Herbeck to play a few bars of a specified work by&nbsp;this creature of imagination, the Kapellmeister turned&nbsp;upon him quite indignantly, exclaiming, "Du mochtest&nbsp;mich zum Besten haben ; es gibt keinen Componisten dieses Namens!" (You are trying to take a rise out of&nbsp;me; there is no composer of that name!)</p>
