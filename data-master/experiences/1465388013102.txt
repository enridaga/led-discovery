<p>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">On the following morning, Sunday, I paid an eagerly anticipated visit to Professor Haupt, who has the reputation of being the greatest organist in Germany. On entering the parish church, where he presides at the organ, I found that the service had just commenced, and the congregation were singing to the accompaniment of a fine organ, the favourite chorale, "Nun danket alle Gott".&nbsp; Our fastest organists in England, who drive their hymns at a railroad express pace, would have been astonished at the slow and dignified time in which this grand old tune was sung. </span></p>
