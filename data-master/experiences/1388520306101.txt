It really was a wonderful concert tonight.  I’d never heard you really play anything but Fancy [Free] and [Wonderful] Town - & the Bach was quite an exciting experience.  Then the Stravinsky was new to me - & God!  What an experience.  3 Bravo’s (sic) for that alone.  I rode along on the Don Juan nicely anticipating the Variations - & then I sat & chuckled & gurgled & beamed & nodded & emphasized & had a wonderful time.  They sounded marvelously - & the only complaint was a little something on the encore of Harold’s dance, trying to picture him keeping up with it.  But it sounded wonderfully unsaddled by dancers.
So thank you for a very special evening of music.  Good luck & continuous success.
