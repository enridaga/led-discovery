<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Everyone knows that the first performance of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Rite of Spring</em> was attended by a scandal but, strange as it may seem, I had no intimation of it. The musicians who heard the orchestra rehearsals seemed intrigued by the work, and the stage spectacle did not appear likely to provoke a riot. Debussy, in spite of his later, ambivalent attitude (&lsquo;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">C&rsquo;est une musique n&eacute;gre&rsquo;</em>), was enthusiastic at the rehearsals. Indeed, he might well have been pleased, for <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Rite of Spring</em> owes more to him than to any other composer, the best music (the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Prelude)</em> as well as the weakest (the music of Part Two between the first entrance of the muted-trumpet duos and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Celebration of the Chosen One</em>). After rehearsing for months, the dancers knew what they were doing, even though this often had nothing to do with the music. &lsquo;I will count to forty while you play,&rsquo; Nijinsky would say to me, &lsquo;and we will see where we come out.&rsquo; He could not understand that though we might at some point come out together, this did not mean that we had been together on the way. The dancers followed Nijinsky&rsquo;s beat, rather than the musical beat. Nijinsky counted in Russian, of course, and since Russian numbers above ten are polysyllabic &ndash;eighteen, for example, is <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">vosemn&aacute;dsat</em> &ndash; in fast tempos neither he nor they could keep pace with the music. / At the performance mild protests could be heard from the very beginning. When the curtain opened on the group of knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas jumping up and down, the storm broke. Cries of &lsquo;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Ta gueule&rsquo;</em> came from behind me. I heard Florent Schmitt shout, &lsquo;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Taisez-vous grues du seizi&eacute;me</em>&rsquo;, the &lsquo;<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">grues</em>&rsquo; of the sixteenth <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">arrondissement </em>being the most elegant ladies in Paris. But the uproar continued, and I left the hall in a fury; I was sitting on the right near the orchestra, and I remember slamming the door. I have never again been that angry. The music was so familiar to me, I loved it, and I could not understand why people who had not yet heard it wanted to protest in advance. Backstage I saw Diaghilev flickering the house lights in an effort to quiet the hall, and for the rest of the performance I stood in the wings behind Nijinsky holding the tails of his<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> frac</em>, while he stood on a chair shouting numbers to the dancers, like a coxswain. </span></p>
