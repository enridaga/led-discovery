3 Feb., 1842. – On Monday we dined at Stafford House, where we were received with great kindness….  I was presented to the Duchess of Gloucester, who called me ‘the daughter of her old friend, Mrs Waddington.’ Being taken in to dinner by Lord John Russell, I found him a most agreeable neighbour…. The house is beautiful, the staircase especially, and a fine band played the whole evening, concluding with a composition of Prince Radziwill, never before heard in England, which was an attention to the King.
