The Mass was kept at St. Peter in Cornhill and crosses borne and a hundred priests in copes and clerks singing <em>Salve festa dies</em>. And then came the parish with white rods and then the craft of fishmongers, and after, my lord mayor and the aldermen and all the officers with white rods in their hands. And so to Paul's. And there offered at the high altar. And after, to dinner&mdash;to the Fishmongers' Hall to dinner.</span></p>
