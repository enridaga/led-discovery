<p>There was one time I was driving out in the country and stopped at a place, a shed-like affair [&hellip;] called the Half-Way House. [...] The band that played there had five musicians, and I don't believe that any one of them could read a note of music. Well, I sat there and listened and listened and listened. They didn't seem to know much of anything, but finally I asked them to play a favourite of mine, a waltz called "Let Me Call You Sweetheart." They knew that one all right. They knew it just well enough to tear it apart. A few weeks later I recorded that band playing "Let Me Call You Sweetheart", and believe me, it wasn't in three-quarter time either! This was the band that became the nucleus of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings.</p>
