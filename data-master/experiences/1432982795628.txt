<p>In 1910 came the sad calamity of the death of King Edward VII., a National memorial service being held in the Abbey on May 20th. It was attended by an enormous congregation, and was indeed a very solemn and impressive occasion. I selected the music to be performed, and think it will be conceded that it furnisheda programme of deep significance. We played five funeral marches, viz., Schubert's "Marche Solennelle," Purcell's March composed for the funeral of Queen Mary in 1694, and Marches by Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Mendelssohn, the last named the E minor, from "Songs without Words." The Tchaikovsky number, in C minor, was accompanied by organ only; but in the other items the organ was supplemented by brass and drums. The service commenced with the penitential verses of Psalm 51, as set by Sir John Stainer. These were sung in procession, by priest and choir alternately. An instrumental interlude followed, viz., Beethoven's " Trois equals" for four trombones, which, played in the Triforium, had a magnificent effect. Handel's fine anthem, "The ways of Zion do mourn," and Goss's "The souls of the righteous," which I had specially arranged for this service, were sung. The hymn, " O God, our help in ages past," sung very slowly by choir and congregation (except verses five and six, which were sung very softly by choir alone), provided an inspiring moment. Gibbons' Amen the same that had been rendered at King Edward's Coronation completed the service, and I played the Dead March in "Saul," accompanied by brass and drums. Chopin's "Marche Funebre," played by Dr. Alcock, also accompanied by brass and drums, formed an exalted close.</p>
