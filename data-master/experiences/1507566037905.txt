And there was a great pinnace docked with two tops and streams and &hellip; guns and drums and trumpets rowing to Westminster, up and down. And when they came home, they landed at Paul's wharf, and there met the mayor, sixty in russet gowns and with targets and javelins and blue hats. And then a goodly pageant: a griffon with a child lying in harness, and St. John the Baptist with a lion, and two woods and a devil, with squibs burning and trumpets blowing, and drum and flute. And then the bachelors with crimson damask hoods, and then trumpets and the&nbsp;waits&nbsp;of the City. And so to Guildhall to dinner, for there dined my lord chancellor and all the nobles and the Spaniards and the judges and learned men.</span></p>
