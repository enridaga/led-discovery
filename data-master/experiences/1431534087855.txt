For the finale of the concert [concert celebrating the centenary of Meyerhold's birth], at my suggestion, Yury Temirkanov conducted the orchestra in the third movement (Largo) of Shostakovichâ€™s Fifth Symphony. The emotional charge of the magnificent lament sounded as a requiem to Meyerhold and spoke directly to everyone present of his tragic end.
