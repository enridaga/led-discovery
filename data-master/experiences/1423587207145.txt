     There was a swinging Negro jazz group on the bill with us. When I think about it now, I’m amazed that they had mixed races working together, but at the time it didn’t occur to any of us. It would never have happened in Northern Florida, which was part of the deep South. The combo had a fine tenor player, who became a good friend while we were there. When I came off the stand after I played my usual Latin tunes on the flute, he asked, “Hey man, do you mind if I borrow your flute during the next set?”
     “Go ahead, I’m anxious to hear you.”
     He was a monster. His playing was more flexible than other jazz flute stars I’d heard, and for the first time, realized what a great jazz instrument the flute was. I was curious how a guy who played so fantastic didn't own a flute?
