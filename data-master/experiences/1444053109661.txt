<p>I think the Hall (Coliseum) last night <em>was</em> worth while - in spite of draw backs.&nbsp; What I like in Halls are 'turns' - comic singers, or men imitating Prima Donna's or Jugglers....there was a man who sang like a Prima Donna; &amp; a patriotic Revue - people clapped Grey more than anyone.</p>
