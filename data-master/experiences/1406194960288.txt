<p>I remember well how in 1930 Toscanini brought the New York Philharmonic to Berlin. It was their European tour, which was incredibly successful. I was an observer of the audience&rsquo;s electric expectations. There sat Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, and Erich Kleiber. Piatigorsky, Horowitz, and I were together in a loge box. Toscanini was conducting a Beethoven symphony when Furtw&auml;ngler, who was in the next box, suddenly jumped up and ran over to see us, exclaiming, &lsquo;&rdquo;horrible acoustics, don&rsquo;t you think so? Monstrous!&rdquo; It was all too obvious what he meant by &ldquo;acoustics&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s another typical story, on the other side of the rivalry. Furtw&auml;ngler often appeared in Paris with his orchestra, or to conduct at the Grand Op&eacute;ra. Horowitz and I went to hear him do Wagner&rsquo;s Die Meistersinger. The overture sounded, and I saw Maestro Toscanini enter the hall with his wife, Carla, daughter Wally, other relatives, and Mme. De Vecchi, a large woman who always accompanied the Toscanini family. As soon as the overture was over, Toscanini jumped up from his seat. &lsquo;Dilettante, canaille!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how upset he was by Furtw&auml;ngler&rsquo;s conducting! And then the maestro walked out!</p>
