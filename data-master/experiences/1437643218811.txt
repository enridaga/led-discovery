It is arranged a quatre mains by MENDELSSOHN himself. Every evening it was my unspeakable delight to listen to it. The world at large was not then much excited about MENDELSSOHN no one spoke of him out of certain musical cliques, and I was not in the cliques but my curiosity was intensely excited; every scrap of news about him I fell upon eagerly.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><br /></span></span></p>
