<p>Blowing out notes [in the 1960&rsquo;s] in whichever way, whenever you please, paying no mind to the chord changes--well, that doesn't hold me, doesn't make me want to listen. Far as I'm concerned, music should be beautiful, and the most beautiful aspect of music is its simplicity&hellip; [N]o fad's ever going to replace the basics: the beauty of a tenor saxophone, the sound of a plain piano, the naturalness of the human voice. I continued to listen to the things which have always sounded good to me: country music by George Jones; jazz by Stan Getz, Lockjaw Davis, or Johnny Griffin; spirituals by the Swan Silvertones or Clara Ward.</p>
