<p>Joe [Smith] liked to roam about. So he left [the Fletcher Henderson band]&hellip; to go with a show called CHOCOLATE DANDIES, where he played with the pit band and did his trumpet specialty on the stage, with his plunger. I have never seen anyone get the tone and sweetness out of a trumpet with the plunger the way Joe could. He could play hot, sweet, and also swing.</p>
<p>[&hellip; H]e made many records with the the Smiths, which is our late Bessie Smith, Clara Smith, and Mamie Smith. Bessie always wanted Joe and Big Green for her record dates. Joe also made some fine records for Ethel Waters, such as "I'm Coming, Virginia", in which he used the plunger and played sweet behind Ethel's voice. That was one of his masterpieces[.]</p>
