<p>The family moved from Jarrow to Hull in 1938 and in that immediate pre-war period we would go to the Palace, a number one variety theatre.&nbsp; One of the acts we saw was Harry Roy and his band, at a time when band-leaders were the rock stars of the day.&nbsp; I can't remember anything they played but if I close my eyes I can see them in their glitzy finery with their dapper leader out front, looking like a cross between Cab Calloway and Max Miller.</p>
