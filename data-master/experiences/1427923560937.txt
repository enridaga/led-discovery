<p>But all these stories didn&rsquo;t keep us from feeling the greatest respect for Glazunov. Even adulation. It&rsquo;s only now that his compositions seem dull, but then they were heard in all our classes, at every student recital, and particularly at the examinations, which Glazunov invariably attended. And I don&rsquo;t think it was to suck up to Glazunov, either. You didn&rsquo;t have to tell Glazunov he was a marvellous conductor. They played his works because they were convenient and effective, for instance, the Piano Variations in D, the Sonata in B minor, and the Concerto in F minor. The singers adored Glazunov&rsquo;s romances, and Nina&rsquo;s romance from Lermontov&rsquo;s Masquerade was something of a warhorse. It&rsquo;s popular today, we often hear it. I&rsquo;m not very fond of it.</p>
