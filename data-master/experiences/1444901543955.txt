He treated me with 2 long and learned cadences. He says the English love only a few notes in gracing, but they must be good - that they have been of great use to him - but this is rather civil than true, I believe, for he was a very chaste singer when he arrived in England. The Italians all say now that he is the 1st in Italy and I can venture to say so with truth, as far as I have yet heard. Mansoli's voice is much dropped and his is better than ever it was in England.
