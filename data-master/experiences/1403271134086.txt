From thence I went to St Marc's [sic], and heard a mass in music, which was sung by the priests, accompanied by organ only, much in the manner of our full anthems. At St Luke's church I likewise heard part of a mass with instruments; some of the tenor voices here were good, and the airs written and sung with taste; the music was composed by a priest. There was an excellent fugue in the last chorus, well worked and well performed.
