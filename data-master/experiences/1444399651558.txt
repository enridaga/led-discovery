<p>To the Bach choir last night; but one of our failures.&nbsp; Is it the weather? I'd made out on waking, such a perfect day; &amp; one by one my events missed fire. Such a good morning's writing I'd planned, &amp; wasted the cream of my brain on the telephone.&nbsp; Then the weather; great bouncing gusts all set about with rain soaking one; buses crowded; left typewriting paper in the bus; a long time waiting at the Club - then Bach unaccompanied isn't easy - though at last (after L. had gone home) I was swept up to the heights by a song. Anna Magdalena's song. I walked a few steps beyond Herbert Fisher coming out; followed him across the empty lamplit purlieus of Westminster, saw him step so distinguished, yet to my eye, so empty into Palace Yard, &amp; so to take part in ruling the Empire.</p>
