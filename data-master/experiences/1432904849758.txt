<p>A very similar celebration took place in 1822, my father told me, upon the coming-of-age of Robert Aldridge, Esq., of St. Leonard's Forest. Everybody who chose to go was most generously entertained. These festivities lasted a week, beginning on Monday, the 1st July. The Church bells were rung every day. Tuesday was the great day, when 7,000 people were present. [...] Dr. Rickword, of the Carfax, presided and the "Sussex Band of Music" played the "Roast Beef of Old England" and other tunes.</p>
