We had a nice musical evening last night, almost the old times. The Wolffs and Mr B. dined and we played all evening. I was delighted to accompany Wolff again, though I was rather nervous as I never touch a piano now except to make the boys sing the “Chant du depart” and the “Marseillaise.” Wolff played divinely. It was a real pleasure, almost made me forget the war and the haunting terror always in my heart of what may come to us.
