<p>[On Sunday...] night, we'd go to the Savoy to hear Chick Webb. That was a band that really swung. Then, after the Savoy, we'd go to Puss Johnson's, an after-hours spot at 130th and St. Nicholas, I think. Everybody would come in there. All the guys from the bands downtown. I remember one particular session, Ben Webster and Pres [Lester Young] were there and everybody knew about it.</p>
<p>[&hellip; E]ach had his individual rhythm section to play for him. A drummer and I played for Ben. Walter Page and Jo Jones played for Pres. The room was filled with smoke and loaded with musicians. Not only that night but many nights guys were so eager to play that bass players would actually line up behind the bass to take turns playing.</p>
