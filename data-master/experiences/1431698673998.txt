The doxology was a great solace to the starving " boys in blue " in Libby prison. Day after day they saw some of their comrades passing away,
while fresh, living recruits for the grave arrived. Late one night they heard through the stillness and the darkness the tramp of new arrivals, who were
stopped outside the prison door until arrangement could be made for them within. In the company was a young Baptist minister, whose heart almost fainted as he looked on those cold walls and thought of the suffering inside. Tired and weary, he sat down, put his face in his hands and wept. Just then a lone voice of deep, sweet pathos, sang from an upper window

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow ;

a dozen more voices joined in the second line ; and so on till the prison was all alive and seemed to quiver with the sacred song. As the song died away in the stillness of the night, the young man arose and said :

Prisons would palaces prove, If Jesus would dwell with me there.
