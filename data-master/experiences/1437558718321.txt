<pre>The road from Auber to Conway Ferry is beautiful. The view of the sea, on one <br />side, and a highly-cultivated country on the other, with the lofty mountain of <br />Penman Maur, towering to the skies, form indeed a splendid prospect; and to add <br />to the earthly beauties round me, the morning was serene, with a true Neapolitan <br />sky. 

I crossed the ferry in the carriage; and when passing Conway Castle, the place <br />where (in the "Castle Spectre,") it was supposed, "Megin ho, Megin he," was sung, <br />it gave me great delight to recal the melody, nor could I resist singing it 
all through ; while the boatmen and passengers, who of course did not participate <br />in the feelings by which I was actuated, seemed much astonished, and, by their <br />silence, not ill pleased at the animated manner in which I was singing. </pre>
