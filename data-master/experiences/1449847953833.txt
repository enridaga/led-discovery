<p>I have taken a season ticket for the Philharmonic Concerts- end row in the gallery. I sit immediately behind Laci Toldy and his mother- or rather, that's where I should be sitting; but Toldy's mother is so very kind that she makes me take her seat for most of the programme (that is, in the first row, where you can see as well as hear). I don't like this, for what right have I do take a lady's seat when I don't know her?</p>
