Another song associated with this period, which for some three decades lay dormant in my memory only to emerge suddenly for no reason at all that I can tell, is 'Snow', by the Norwegian composer Sigurd Lie. It also found its way unto my series of transcriptions. This delightfully atmospheric song, which never leaves the ground bass of “D,” remains linked in my memory with Blanche Marchesi, with whom I also toured the English provinces at about this time.
