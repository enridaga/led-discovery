Here with Donald Gramm for our American recital last evening at the university. This morning Donald did his customary master class, then flew back. At his session Donald hears a song straight through, then talks about the interpretation from every possible angle, then asks the quivering aspirant to repeat the song, after which he always exclaims, "See, it's a hundred times better," but confides to me later that it's never better and usually worse. How can a student absorb all that information, and then apply it so suddenly?
