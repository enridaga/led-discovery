On July 21st, a choral festival in aid of the Choir Benevolent Fund was held in St. George's. The Chapel was crowded with lovers of Cathedral music, and universal satisfaction reigned at the completeness of the performance. Dr. Elvey's time had been thus fully occupied, but during these summer months he yet found leisure to add another to his already long list of compositions. This was an anthem, "Sing, O Heavens!" written for the Festival of the Three Choirs, which this year was held at Worcester. It was a somewhat lengthy work, as the performance of it occupied fully twenty-five minutes. It consists of six movements, and is scored for a full orchestra.
The anthem seemed to give great satisfaction, for it was much admired, and pronounced by good judges to be one of his ablest compositions.
