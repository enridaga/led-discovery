His figure was good, and he was far from ill-looking; his voice sweet, and his style easy and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">grazioso</em> [&hellip;] With him came Danzi as first woman. Though her name was Italian, she was a German, and had never been in Italy. She was young, well-looking, had a voice of uncommon clearness and compass, capable of the most astonishing execution, and was an excellent musician. Yet her performance was unsatisfactory, being too much <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">alla Tedescha</em>, and more like that of an instrument than of a human voice. She soon after married Monsieur Lebrun, an eminent player on the hautbois, which confirmed her in the bravura style, as she was in the habit of singing songs with an obligato accompaniment for that instrument, in which the difficulties performed by both were quite astonishing, each seeming to vie with the other which could go highest, and execute the most rapid divisions.</span></p>
