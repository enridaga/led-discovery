<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">The International Prague Music Festival, which took place in the splendid concert hall of the Rudolfinum Palace and in the Smetana Hall, was attended by composers, performers and critics from the USSR, America, France, Poland, Britain, Bulgaria, China, Palestine, India&hellip;/ The programme of the festival, which lasted about three weeks and excellently organised, included many interesting classical and contemporary works, played by outstanding performers. / The programme was so extensive, indeed, that it proved difficult to attend every performance. There were concerts every day, often twice a day. Chamber concerts began at five o&rsquo;clock, followed at eight &ndash; almost without an interval &ndash; by symphonic concerts.

This composer, who died recently at a venerable age, is rightly considered a classic of Czech music. We heard his great opera <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Katya Kabanova</em> (based on Ostrovsky&rsquo;s play <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Storm</em>) brilliantly performed by the orchestra and soloists of the Czech National Theatre, conducted by V&aacute;vlav Talich. Although it does not entirely convey the depth of Ostrovsky&rsquo;s play, the opera is marked by enormous realistic power and artistic persuasiveness, reminiscent of the operatic traditions of Mussorgsky. </span></p>
