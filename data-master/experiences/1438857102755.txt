<pre>I cannot here refrain from mentioning a circumstance which occurred to me on <br />the 1st of January, 1822; and I sincerely trust there will not appear any <br />impropriety in my doing so, since it records a trait of gracious goodness and <br />consideration in His Majesty, which, although but one of hundreds, is but <br />little known, and richly deserves to be universally so. 

On that evening, the King gave a splendid party at the Pavilion; and His <br />Majesty was graciously pleased to command my attendance to hear a concert <br />performed by his own fine band. His Majesty did me the honour to seat himself <br />beside me, and ask me how I liked the music which I had that day heard in the <br />chapel, amongst which, to my surprise, had been introduced the Chacoone of <br />Jomelli, performed in the "Castle Spectre," but which since has been called <br />the Sanctus of Jomelli, and is now used in all the cathedrals and churches in <br />England and the Continent, under that title. His Majesty was all kindness and <br />condescension in his manner towards me; but his kindness and condescension did <br />not stop there. 

I had taken with me to Brighton that year a god-daughter of mine, Julia Walters,<br />whom I have adopted, and whose mother has been, for years, my housekeeper and <br />watchful attendant during my many severe illnesses. This little girl, at five <br />years old, performed the part of the Child in the opera of "L' Agnese," under <br />the name of Signora Julia. Ambrogetti was so struck with my little protegee, <br />that he begged I would let her play the character, which she did with grace and intel- 
ligence far beyond her years. This child asked me to procure her a sight of the <br />King, and fixed upon the evening in question to press her request, when she <br />might behold him in the midst of his Court, surrounded by all that was brilliant <br />in the land, and in a palace whose splendour, when illuminated, rivalled the <br />magnificence described in the "Arabian Nights." 

I told my worthy friend Cramer, the excellent master and leader of His Majesty's <br />private band, the earnest desire of little Julia, and prevailed upon him to <br />admit her behind the organ, with a strict injunction not to let herself be seen; <br />but female curiosity, even in one so young, prevailed; and after the first act <br />of the concert, when the performers retired to take some refreshment, Signora <br />Julia crept from her hiding-place behind the organ, and seated herself between <br />the kettle drums. The King was sitting on a sofa, between the Princess Esterhazy <br />and the Countess Lieven; and though the orchestra was at a distance, His <br />Majesty's quick eye in a moment caught a glimpse of the little intruder. 

"Who is that beautiful little child?" said the King; "Who brought her here?" <br />and immediately walked to poor Julia, and asked her who she was. "I belong to K," <br />said Julia. "And who the deuce is K?" said His Majesty. I was seated quite at <br />the farther end of the room, conversing with Sir William Keppell; and the <br />moment I saw what was going on, I requested Sir William to go to the King, and <br />say that the child belonged to me, which he with great good-nature did. 

His Majesty kissed poor little Julia; and taking her into his arms, threw her <br />over his shoulder, and carried her across the room to me, and placed her in 
a chair by my side, saying, with the greatest condescension, "Why did you leave <br />the child in the cold? Why not bring her into the room? If she be fond of music, <br />bring her here whenever you like."

This act of kindness, consideration, and goodness, was duly appreciated by all <br />who witnessed it, and by me will be ever remembered with the most respectful <br />gratitude. On the following evening, when I again had the honour of a command <br />to the palace, His Majesty was pleased to inquire after my pretty little girl. </pre>
