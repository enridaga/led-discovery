<p>It was, however, when avowedly improvising, that&nbsp;Liszt " let himself go," giving full rein to his fancy or&nbsp;humour of the moment, and indulging, to the top of his&nbsp;bent, in the exaggeration of technical difficulty. At&nbsp;such times, stimulated by strong excitement, he would&nbsp;put forth to their utmost executive limits the exceptional physical forces with which nature had gifted him,&nbsp;and would achieve what, to any other pianist, had been&nbsp;impossible. Practice and will had so disciplined his&nbsp;fingers and accustomed them to fulfil infallibly the&nbsp;orders transmitted to them from his brain, that, in all&nbsp;probability, the word "difficulty" (in connection with&nbsp;technique) had ceased to possess any exact significance,&nbsp;as far as Liszt the executant was concerned. Nobody&nbsp;who has heard him improvise can doubt that, absolutely&nbsp;free from any kind of pre-occupation as to the ability of&nbsp;his hands to execute whatever he may call upon them to&nbsp;do, he gives play to the creative and constructive faculties of his intellect without troubling himself in the&nbsp;least about the mere mechanical instruments attached to&nbsp;his wrists.</p>
