<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">Ravel was never the least stand-offish or reluctant to discuss his compositions with fellow-composers whom he happened to like.&nbsp; Although I was four years his junior, he was always ready to play to me his latest works, and as he expected me to &lsquo;return the compliment&rsquo;, we became for a time a sort of &lsquo;mutual encouragement society&rsquo;.&nbsp; He was not even above asking my advice, and after playing some daring passage would ask: &lsquo;Do you think I have gone too far?&nbsp; Ought I to tone it down a bit?&rsquo;</p>
