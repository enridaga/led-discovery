<p>As the evening [during the Fools Festival] advanced, organised pageants flowed&nbsp;into the already crowded room, and were received with&nbsp;frantic outbursts of applause. The first was a naval&nbsp;display. Preceded by a full band of marines, in which,&nbsp;however, the drum element was painfully prominent, the&nbsp;Ship of Folly rolled in, a banner with a strange device floating at its mainmast head. It was guarded by a&nbsp;complete ship's company, officers and men, over a hundred strong, fully armed; and made a gallant show.&nbsp;Having completed the circuit of the Saal, amidst universal acclamation, the ship was brought to an anchor&nbsp;under the cross gallery, and the crew dismissed to&nbsp;"skylark." Fiddles, bagpipes, clarinets, and banjoes&nbsp;heralded the next procession: Bohemian emigrants,&nbsp;chiefly handicraftsmen, headed by life-like impersonations of the great Panslavists, Kieger and Palacky,&nbsp;and bearing high on a velvet cushion the holy crown&nbsp;of Wenceslaus followed by the double-tailed Bohemian&nbsp;lion, tenderly led by a brace of Czech bakers.</p>
