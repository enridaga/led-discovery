Rubinstein’s reading of the classics, in fact of any composer, is the most satisfying and thrilling experience for the listener – something to be wondered at. He is also unapproachable in his playing of Spanish music. The bounding, joyous lilt he gives to such music fills one with exhilaration. His equality of touch on all ten fingers is remarkable, and he is the one pianist in the world for me who can perform the miracle of making the piano sing in melodic phrases. Indeed, more than once this god of the piano has brought tears to my eyes by the marvellous way in which his fingers caress the keys of this percussive instrument. His balance of tone between the right hand and the left hand is that however softly he touches the keys one never misses hearing the note. As for his incredible technical ability – he plays ‘second fiddle’ to one on this earth.
