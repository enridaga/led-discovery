Then we went into the trenches round about Thiepval Wood, which not long before had been so horrible and mad; but now they had assumed a tenderer aspect, were voted "a rest-cure sector," and we were envied for them....

In spite of the sylvan intricacies of Thiepval Wood, and a bedroom in the corridored chalk bank, and the tunes of the "Bing Boys" endlessly revolved, one was not yet quite clear of Stuff Trench [where the battalion had recently endured heavy shelling]; my own unwelcome but persistent retrospect was the shell-hole there used by us as a latrine, with those two flattened German bodies in it,...and others had much worse to remember.
