Easter Day... I to Whitehall chapel; and there coming late, could hear nothing of the Bishop of London’s sermon; so walked into the park to the Queen’s chapel and there heard a good deal of their mass and some of their Musique, which is not so contemptible, I think, as our people would make it, it pleasing me very well - and, indeed, better than the Anthemne I heard afterwards at Whitehall at my coming back.
