<p>Letter from Mr. Dewes to Mrs. Dewes, Clement's Inn, 10 March, 1742 - Madam Pen came to town yesterday to see or rather hear the oratorio, and sent me word she should be at home about one, so I went to see her, and we sat and talked or looked at our accounts for about half an hour, and then I came away. She had the headache, I the toothache, so that we were but ill qualified to entertain each other.</p>
