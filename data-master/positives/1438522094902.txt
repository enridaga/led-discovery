There was about it an<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>element of fantastic bizarrerie that was singularly attractive, and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>which at once drew attention to the unique personality of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>artist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>From that time forward, in whatever branch of his art<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>he has elected to labor, David Bispham has consistently earned <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>distinction and applause; and his success has been equally emphatic on both sides of the Atlantic. His gift of versatility is <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>extraordinary. Alike in serious and comic characters, in Wagnerian music-drama and light French opera, in oratorio and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Lieder, in declamation both spoken and sung, he has proved himself a thoroughly intellectual, accomplished, and original artist. </span></p>
