<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My most precious RFH memory is a concert I saw as a schoolboy. Rubinstein, over seventy at the time, played BOTH Brahms Piano concertos in one evening. I'll never forget how, after the interval, having played the 50 minute first concerto, Rubinstein bounded up the steps and strode up to the piano, stretched an arm out to the audience, and then blounced onto the piano stool, fresh and youthful as ever. That's immortality!&nbsp;</p>
