It was as one instrument. [&hellip;] The chorusses too were performed with equal excellence, under the direction of the most able musical professors. The first singer on all these occasions, was Madame Mara, who had come to England to sing at the Pantheon concerts. All the best Italian as well as English singers were engaged. The music was confined to that of Handel, the burst of one of whose chorusses caused a general thrill, and was sublime beyond imagination. Yet from the vastness of that venerable pile, never was the fullest piece of music in the least degree too loud even to those who were near the orchestra, while its construction was so favourable to sound, that Mara&rsquo;s single voice, or Cramer&rsquo;s single fiddle, were heard most distinctly in every part. It was remarkable that even the tuning of this immense band, generally so discordant, accompanied as it was by the full chords of a noble organ, produced a fine and harmonious effect.</span></p>
