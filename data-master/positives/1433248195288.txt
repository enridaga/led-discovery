The programme included " Lift up thine eyes !" by Sir John Goss. The veteran composer was by the side of Sir George in the organ-loft, and, as the last strains of his anthem died away, he turned, and with tears in his eyes, and in a voice broken by deep feeling, exclaimed,"Ah ! I never hear my anthems done as they are here."
