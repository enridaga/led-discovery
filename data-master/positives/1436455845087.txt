<p>Mick Jagger last night, in a documentary on the Sixties, being interviewed by Londonian higher-ups after his arrest for drugs. What a beautiful face, what a sensible quietude in his replies. And what a difference - in a flash - in my viewpoint toward him. How nice to know that I can still change viewpoint.</p>
