<p>I had had for some time a great desire to go and publish the love of God our Saviour, if it were but for one day, in the Isles of Scilly; and I had occasionally mentioned it to several. This evening three of our brethren came and offered to carry me thither if I could procure the mayor&rsquo;s boat, which, they said, was the best sailer of any in the town. I sent, and he lent it me immediately. So the next morning, Tuesday, 13, John Nelson, Mr. Shepherd, and I, with three men and a pilot, sailed from St. Ives. It seemed strange to me to attempt going in a fisher-boat, fifteen leagues upon the main ocean, especially when the waves began to swell and hang over our heads. But I called to my companions, and we joined together in singing lustily and with a good courage:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When passing through the watery deep,</p>
<p>I ask in faith His promised aid;</p>
<p>The waves an awful distance keep,</p>
<p>And shrink from my devoted head;</p>
<p>Fearless their violence I dare:</p>
<p>They cannot harm&mdash;for God is there.</p>
