<p>Delius died the same year, and his wish was gratified and he was buried at Limpsfield, quite near my dear parents. On the day of the re-internment in the month of May, the flowers had never been more glorious, just as on the last day he had been at Foyle Riding. On that day Beecham came with a portion of his orchestra and played amongst other works <em>On hearing the first cuckoo in spring</em>, as only he can conduct it. As the work finished, a cuckoo from a nearby bough took up the refrain, which gave an eerie feeling. Poor Jelka Delius, who was really dying, came over for the ceremony but was too ill to attend. She passed away a few days afterwards and is buried next to Delius, in that peaceful and beautiful churchyard of Limpsfield.</p>
