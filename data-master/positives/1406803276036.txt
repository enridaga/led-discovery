<p>Dear R . . . The enclosed [programme of a concert of British music in Constantinople] was quite a success. . . . Demobilisation was in full swing, and between it and flu and malaria I had a different orchestra every two days and sometimes almost every two hours. [...] The Wednesday before, we gave the concert, barring the choral items, at the Church Hall Summerhill. It was packed with a jolly, keen, rowdy audience who hardly breathed during the music [...] and then bellowed and stamped by way of applause. It was so good that I feared that the big concert would fall flat - which it didn't.</p>
