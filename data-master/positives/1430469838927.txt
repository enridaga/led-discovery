In 1935 I was co-starred with Beatrice Lillie in a Shubert show, At Home Abroad. That revue was Vincente Minnelli's first directing job, and he also designed the sets and costumes. The book and music were written by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz "with a bow to Rosamond Knight." The first-rate supporting cast given Lady Peel and the former shining star of Edmond's Cellar included Eleanor Powell, the tap dancer; Reginald Gardiner, the Englishman who imitates everything from steamboat whistles to drunken goldfish; Eddie Foy, Jr., Paul Haakon, Vera Allen, Sue Hastings' Marionettes, and many, many others, as the bill posters say. 

We opened at the Winter Garden in September, and once more I got the big hello and nod of approval from the alert critics. Mr. Brooks Atkinson of the stately New York Times wrote, and I quote: "... Ethel Waters, the gleaming tower of regality, who knows how to make a song stand on tiptoe ... Her ‘Hottentot Potentate’ runs a high temperature ... she has an enormous lurking vitality, but also knows how to wear clothes...."
