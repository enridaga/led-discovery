Do a good deal of Counterp't in the morning, & walk with Beth afterwards. I go down to the church in the afternoon, practically all the time, to go through the "Prayer". & to arrange the chairs etc. Walk with Pop after tea. The concert goes quite well; my things are quite well done (the 2nd better than rehearsal) the Prayer also not too badly done - it's an absolute marvel. Rest of programme - carols & very good organ solos by Mr. Coleman.
