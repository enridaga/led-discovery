<p>Here at last is my news, and good news. The premi&egrave;re of&nbsp;<em>Les Biches</em> was, if I may venture to say so, a triumph. There were eight curtain-calls which is&nbsp;<em>rarissime</em> for Monte Carlo. One has to admit that Nijinska's choreography is of such beauty that even your roulette-addicted English lady cannot resist it. It is the very essence of dance. And the&nbsp;<em>mise au point&nbsp;</em>is impeccable. Can you imagine, there were no less than 72 rehearsals - about 250 hours of work. That is the way to get results. The sets, the curtain, the costumes, are a total success. I am really longing for you to see it. As for the music, although it is not exactly modest to say so, I won't hide the fact that I am very pleased with my orchestration. It has a brilliance and, I believe, a very personal range of colour. Even Auric, difficult as he is, approves wholeheartedly.&nbsp;</p>
