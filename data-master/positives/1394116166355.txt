I really am getting alarmed at the lack of a letter from Mummy. Especially, as I dreamed about death 2ce [sic] last night, & both times tho' not she, it was connected with her. I don't like to write in case our letters cross, but I shall certainly write soon, in a long day of work (stay up, to extra prep), the only cheering thing is the hearing of Part of Brahms 2bl concerto on gramophone, & pt. of it on a new one in the music rooms (it is not in use yet, & it was only being tried).
