Molique arrived towards four o'clock and accompanied me in the evening to the Concert Hall. His presence fired the violinists, and altogether the performance was not unsatisfactory. The effect of the whole was marred by the laughable figure and manners of the singer, which were not redeemed by any artistic qualities. A clarinet concerto in A by Mozart was capitally played by our excellent clarinetist, Grosse. The composition, although by Mozart, is such a grandfatherly production and so lengthy that the finale had to be left out, not to try the patience of the public beyond endurance.
