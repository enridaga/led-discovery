<p>Was at Kokh&aacute;nski's, and we took a good look at Opus 35,* transcribing it for violin. I have been meaning for some time now to write a work for violin and piano, especially after the success of the Violin Concerto, and had indeed decided to get on with it this August. But Cecilia [Hansen] somehow got hold of the second of the&nbsp;<em>Songs Without Words</em> and we found it went beautifully for violin. It was at that point that I decided to make a version of the whole opus, but to collaborate not with the naive Cecilia but with Kokh&aacute;nski, whose skills in this respect are fabulous. Kokh&aacute;nski was delighted to fall in with the plan, and it so happened that he had recently been working with Stravinsky on a version of&nbsp;<em>Pulcinella</em>. Accordingly today I set for Kokh&aacute;nski's, armed with preliminary sketches, particularly of No. 5 where I planned substantial modifications to the middle section. We worked for two hours and recast practically the whole opus. Kokh&aacute;nski is marvellously gifted and imaginative, qualities in him that are indeed universally recognised. The final version of the transcriptions will be left until his return from London. He was very taken with the songs, I believe (and hope) genuinely.</p>
