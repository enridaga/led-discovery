<p>Two years ago was the Centenary (of Dryburgh?). I went to the meeting. There was a service - most interesting.&nbsp; All the Ministers. Five on the platform. Possibly the Moderator. At any rate it was very nice and it was a beautiful day, and the place was very full.&nbsp; The birds joined in the music.</p>
