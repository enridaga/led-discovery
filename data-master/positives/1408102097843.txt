After leaving the 21st Officer Cadet Battalion at the end of April 1918, I received rather a shock. Instead of getting my orders for France, which I was expecting, I was ordered to join my Reserve Battalion, the 3rd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, who were stationed at Charles Fort, Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland.
    ...From a Company Commander’s point of view, I had nothing to do except take the Company Orderly Room and attend the Commanding Officer’s Orderly Room, if I had a prisoner.
    ... I must not forget the Friday route march - one of the best things in the week - which everyone was supposed to attend. On this occasion one heard the brass band, an exceptionally good band and the pipe band also assisted.
