<p>... but when we went to Sheffield Festival Henry Wood was in charge and rescored it all for a sort of Straussian orchestra, which was bad enough, but he also cut out the oboe d'amore and had it all played on the oboe so Leon did not get his extra fee. This is the kind of thing that is never popular. Sir Henry was in a bad mood generally; we were in Beecham's orchestra so he did not want us in the first place and also Paul Beard had just left us to go to the BBC; Sir Henry seemed to feel he should not have done so just when we were contracted to play for him at Sheffield, so he showed his displeasure by being very cool towards our new leader, David McCallum, who could hardly be said to be to blame for anything.</p>
