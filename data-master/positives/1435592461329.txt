<p>Piney Brown ran the Sunset where I first ran into Joe Turner. I remember we used to play behind Joe Turner there. There was a place close by (across the street in fact) called the Lone Star. Joe Turner would start to sing the blues at the Sunset, and then he'd go across the street and sing the blues at the Lone Star, and we were still playing all this&nbsp;time. Joe would socialize there for a while and stop in the front and have breakfast and then he'd come back in to the Sunset, go up to the microphone, and sing some more blues and we'd have been playing all the time. Often we'd play for an hour and a half straight like that.</p>
