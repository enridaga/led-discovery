Yesterday was a day I'll remember! That young fellow must be in league with the devil. I've never heard anybody play like that! I gave him a theme to improvise on, and I assure you I've never even heard Mozart improvise so admirably. Then he played some of his own compositions, which are marvellous - really wonderful - and he manages difficulties and effects at the keyboard that we never even dreamed of.
