Last night we were asked to the Queen Dowagerâ€™s, who had invited a small party, at which the Queen was present and the Duchess of Gloucester. The object was to give a German named Lowe, who had come with prodigious recommendations from Coburg, opportunity of showing his musical talent, and it turned out that he had none to show.
