Went straight into Boulogne and our first directed steps were to St Nicholas Church in market place where a service was going on. Too crowded to get in by the main door but found a way up into the gallery by a side entrance and after a minute or two the service ended and the entire congregation streamed out. We stayed on for a few minutes listening to a splendid voluntary on the organ, one of the finest I had heard for long time. It really was a treat to listen to such music pouring out so splendid and grand.
