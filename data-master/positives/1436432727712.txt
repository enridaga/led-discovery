<p>In January 1857 I was engaged to go down for the night to play at Deene Park, the Northamptonshire seat of Lord Cardigan, the hero of Balaclava. In the fine oak-panelled hall with rich carvings I saw the diplomas presented to him on his return from the Crimea, and a large oil-painting of the famous charge. There was music in the evening in the hall. Verdi's new operas were much en vogue, and Lord Cardigan asked me to play something from Rigoletto. A handsome, tall man, he wore court dress with black silk stockings, and I noticed he had on his orders and stars. He spoke to me in French, and was particularly affable.</p>
