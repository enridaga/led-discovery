<p>At&nbsp;the end of the performance an exalted dignitary of the Russian Court bade Strauss follow him to his apartments&nbsp;in the chateau, where he sat the Kapellmeister down to&nbsp;a splendid grand piano, saying: "Now, be good enough&nbsp;to play me all the newest Vienna dance-music." Though&nbsp;extremely fatigued by his three rehearsals and "State"&nbsp;performance, Strauss deemed it expedient to comply;&nbsp;but after he had played continuously for over an hour,&nbsp;he came to a stop, observing, "I presume that will be&nbsp;sufficient." "I am not at all tired," coolly rejoined his&nbsp;Excellency. "But I am!" replied Strauss, and rose&nbsp;from the instrument. It is said that he came very near&nbsp;being sent to Siberia for "disrespectful behaviour, unprecedented in a person of his condition."&nbsp;</p>
