Virgil asked for my new song disk, invited me, Doda Conrad and Maurice Grosser to dine. After supper we arranged ourselves neatly to hear the record's thirty-two tunes. By song number five Maurice was asleep and snoring on the purple sofa. By song number seven Virgil too was snoring in the his corner. I shot a smile of complicity to Doda, bowed to the sleepers and left, hurt, but not very, and anyway I had a date.
