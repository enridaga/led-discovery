Sir George was delighted with the performance, and said to Mr. Rootham, " I do not expect to hear it again, but the last time is the best."
 Mr. Rootham says : " I never remember the whole of the members of the society being more pleased than they were on this occasion. To feel that we all had been the means of giving our dear old friend a musical treat, was a source of un
feigned gratification to every member of the society, boys as well as men, and I shall never forget the kind way in which he spoke of the whole performance."
