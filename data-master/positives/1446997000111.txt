<p>This day sourish.&nbsp; I found a few in the Sunday School in the morning, most of the children have got Scarlet Fever and it runs through the Parish and through Stowey yet few die here.&nbsp; We had a Serenade from the Young Singers this day but I did not think they performed well, hardly perfect.</p>
