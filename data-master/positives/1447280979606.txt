<p>Gianul is to the Roumanian Legends what Robin Hood&nbsp;is to our own ballad lore. He robbed the rich to give&nbsp;to the poor, exhibiting extraordinary daring and ingenuity in the execution of his predatory feats. I have no&nbsp;idea how many verses there are in the celebrated song&nbsp;that bears his name and professes to chronicle his principal achievements. All I can say about it is that I have&nbsp;never succeeded in hearing the end of it, though I have&nbsp;listened to it, more than once, for an hour at a stretch.&nbsp;Probably the leading <em>laotari</em>, who are ready enough at&nbsp;improvisation, extemporise additional verses to this&nbsp;favourite ballad whenever they find their audience&nbsp;deeply attentive to their lays. Were any drawing-room&nbsp;vocalist to attempt the singing of the adventures of Robin Hood n a hundred and thirty-five verses or so at&nbsp;a London evening party he would of a certainty be voted&nbsp;the most intolerable bore that ever disgraced humanity.</p>
