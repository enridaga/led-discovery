Tunes from the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Mikado</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Pinafore</em> were thought perfectly suitable, and one repented of one&rsquo;s shortcomings to the gay strains of polkas and galops. One day when I was feeling absolutely indignant at the horrible discrepancy between the sacred words that had been said at the altar and the cats&rsquo;-concert that had accompanied them, and just as I was about to give my opinion on the subject very plainly indeed, I was reduced to silence by a poor woman - one of the servants, I believe - who said with a happy little sigh : &ldquo;Ay, que linda esta musica !
