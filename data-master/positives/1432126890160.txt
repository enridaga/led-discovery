Once when labouring in London I went to Basle, Switzerland, for a few days' rest. The evening I got there I heard under my window the most beautiful volume of song. I looked out and saw about fifty people, who were singing,

Safe in the arms of Jesus, 
Safe on His gentle breast,

in their own language, but I recognized the tune. I spoke to them through an interpreter. The next evening I held a song service in an old French church in that city. The church was packed with people, and many stood outside in the street.
