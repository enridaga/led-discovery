<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I must not omit one historic fact, namely, &mdash;theatres in Boston were not allowed to give dramatic or operatic performances on Saturdays (too near Sunday !), and that gave us musicians our freedom; hence the custom of devoting Saturdays to society concerts. I recall another fact: several churches did not have organs, so they called in the assistance of the &ldquo; devil&rsquo;s instruments &rdquo;&mdash;fiddles and cornets&mdash;to help the singers.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I played the clarinet for two years in Father Streeter&rsquo;s church on Hanover Street We had a little orchestra composed of a violin (Mr. William Warren), clarinet (T. Ryan), contrabass (Mr. Burdett), and ophicleide (Mr. Cutting).</p>
