Fanny Crosby wrote the words of this hymn in 1869, and it was set to music by W. H. Doane two years later. I sang it for the first time in the home of Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Cornell at Long Branch. The servants gathered from all parts of the house while I was singing, and looked into the parlour where I was seated. When I had finished, one of them said : " That is the finest hymn I have heard for a long time ; won't you please sing it over again? "
