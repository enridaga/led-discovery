<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I still remember a concert form the 1950s. The work I especially remember, is a performance of William Walton's Fa&ccedil;ade. From behind a screen&nbsp; appeared a woman dressed in incredible clothes - long flowing robes with many items of&nbsp; jewellery. Her voice was like a chant - very unusual. She was the narrator, and she was Dame Edith Sitwell.&nbsp;</p>
