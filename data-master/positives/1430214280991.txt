This able conductor [Sir George Smart], succeeded at this first rehearsal in carrying the band through the whole of the work correctly, although of course without that delicacy, light, and shade requisite for so intricate a work, the Andante of which, with its 3-8 and 9-16 time, constituted in itself a considerable difficulty. I followed the performance with the score, and was delighted with the solidity of the entire work, as well as the beauty of its details; still, the too great predominance of Spohrish color and form to some extent quenched my enthusiasm. Nothing but genius and wealth of invention can kindle me
into rapture.
