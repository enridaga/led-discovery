<p>I want now to refer to a unique concert which took place in June 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Jubilee. Saint-Saens asked me to arrange an orchestral concert for him at St. James's Hall, and on that occasion he played his four concertos, one after another, which was a wonderful feat. He played them all by heart, and when he had finished seemed as fresh as if he had done nothing at all. I had engaged a first-rate orchestra, which I conducted. Unfortunately, the hall was not very full, and Saint-Saens lost heavily, but he apparently did not mind in the least. The concert was given on a Saturday afternoon and at that period Saturday was not popular as it is today for concerts and matinees. It was also an unfortunate time to give a concert, as people were full of the Queen's Jubilee and had no time for concerts.</p>
