<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">The first half of the concert was not to be televised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It was a performance of Stravinsky&rsquo;s most recent work &ndash; <em>Eight Instrumental Miniatures</em> &ndash; and was going to be conducted by the composer&rsquo;s amanuensis, Robert Craft [&hellip;]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lights dimmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Craft, a tall, elegant and grave figure, entered to appropriate applause and silence fell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The <em>Instrumental Miniatures</em> proved to be a work of extreme austerity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A few isolated notes from the piccolo; a tap on a triangle; a dissonant chord from three fiddle players.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Those of us in the audience concentrated hard to follow the line of musical thought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly a stentorian bass voice from backstage bellowed &lsquo;Turn &lsquo;em on, Fred&rsquo; and the entire auditorium was flooded with light blazing from banks of huge lamps that had been specially installed for the television relay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Craft continued to conduct in the dazzling brightness as though nothing had happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The audience whispered to one another and shifted uneasily in their seats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I broke out in a cascade of sweat and wished I could hide under mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After a few seconds and equally suddenly, the lights turned off &ndash; only to turn on again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Craft and <em>Instrumental Miniatures</em> battled on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At last the lights cut and the stage returned to the reverential half-light appropriate to the occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But the intellectual grip of the <em>Instrumental Miniatures</em> on the audience, if they had any, was gone.</p>
