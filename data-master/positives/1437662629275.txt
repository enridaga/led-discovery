<p>At 31 Tite St. I go to a concert of modern chamber music (arr by D. Ponsonby) - Mangeot etc. &amp; Goossens. They do - not well - my Oboe quartet. I turn over for Yvonne Arnaud playing Ravel Trio &amp; Poulenc for Ob. &amp; Fg. (G. &amp; Newton).* Excellent performances. Meet Many people - on to Waterhouses for supper after.&nbsp;</p>
