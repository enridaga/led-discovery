So home by water to dinner, where comes Pelling and young Michell and his wife, whom I have not seen a great while, poor girl. And then comes Mr. How, and all dined with me very merry; and spent all the afternoon, Pelling, How, I and my boy, sing[ing] of Lockeâ€™s Response to the Ten Commandments, which he hath set very finely, and was a good while since sung before the King and spoilt in the performance - which occasioned his printing them for his vindication, and are excellent good.
