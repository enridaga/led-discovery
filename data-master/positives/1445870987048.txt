She played a great deal and I found she had not acquired her reputation in music without meriting it. She plays with great ease, taste and feeling &ndash; is an excellent sightswoman, of which I was convinced by her executing some of my own music. She likewise composes and she was so obliging as to play several of her own pieces both on the harpsichord and piano forte accompanied with the violin by M. <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Pagin</em> who is reckoned in France the best scholar of Tartini ever made. He accompanied very judiciously, and with great expression, the compositions of Madame Brillon, which I suppose he had often seen before; but I did not find him so correct in my own &ndash; especially a slow movement in my second sonata in the time of which though he played it twice over with me and twice with Madame B. he was constantly mistaken. However upon the whole he is a good player. His manner is easy, his coup d&rsquo;archet admirable and his execution great; but whether he did not exert himself as the room was not large, or from whatever cause it proceeded I know not, his tone was not powerful, not so much so as that of Traversa and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">his</em> was many many degrees short of Giardini&rsquo;s. I could not persuade Madame B. to play the piano forte with the stops on &ndash; <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">c&rsquo;est sec</em>, she said &ndash; but with them off unless in arpeggios, nothing is distinct &ndash; &lsquo;tis like the sound of bells, continual and confluent.</span></p>
