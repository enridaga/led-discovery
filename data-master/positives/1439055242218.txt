<p style="text-align: justify;">When Mr. Mapleson started at Her Majesty's toward the end of April [1779] it was with one of the strongest companies that he had ever brought together. Christine Nilsson now at the finest period of her career led off a group of sopranos that included Minnie Hauk, Etelka Gerster, Clara Louise Kellogg, Marie Roze, and, last but not least, Marie Vanzandt, a youthful debutante whose delightful singing as Zerlina and Amina took the London world completely by surprise. Trebelli, unapproachable as ever in her way, stood at the head of the contraltos; Campanini and Fancelli were the best tenors; and among the barytones and basses were Del Puente, Galassi, Eota, Behrens, and Foli. Some of the artists here named also took part in the autumn season which Mr. Mapleson gave at the same opera-house in the Haymarket now, by the way, the site of Mr. Beerbohm Tree's theatre and the Carlton Hotel.</p>
