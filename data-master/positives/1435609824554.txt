<p>The Rev. Mr. Cleaver, precentor of St. Asaph, wished to consult me upon erecting a new organ in that cathedral. On my way thither, I passed through Chester, and had a few moments to spare for viewing the venerable minster. The service was performing, and I was much pleased by the reception I had from Mr. &mdash;, the organist, who was the conductor. My stay was too short to judge of the singing, but from the low stipends of the choir-men, I fear their ability in singing at sight has not much improved since the time of Handel. How different the conduct of the precentor of St. Asaph, who, out of his own purse, spares no expense to have her service well performed!</p>
