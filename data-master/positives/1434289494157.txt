Extract from a letter from a Son of Bunsen in London to another Son in the Country, 8th May, 1854 -
The letter of the Prince of Prussia was followed by one from the Princess —equally warm, and, in fact, affectionate. Prince Albert has been most warm in his expressions, in his own name and that of Queen Victoria. You will be delighted to read these letters, with those of many a real friend. Lord John Russell's is a fine document. Lord Aberdeen kept my father two hours, and parted from him with tears in his eyes. ' I was instrumental in fixing you here, thirteen years ago, and indeed I do not regret it—I cannot take leave of you.'
Lord Palmerston speaks as quite indignant at this break up, and shows all the kindness he can.
We felt it a great blessing to drive to church yesterday, for my father, as it were, to take leave. He was very happy, in a solemn temper. You would have been glad to have been present, when during the last part of the hymn, he bowed down his fine head, leaning it on both his hands, and prayed silently, an abundant flow of tears rushing from his eyes. Nothing could be more mild and heavenly than his spirit all the day—open, bright, and generous to all whom
he met.
