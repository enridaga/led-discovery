<p>Mike Judge was another guy that was in the band. [&hellip;] He was a bass player, and I thought there was something up with his talent as far as him being in the band. He was a beautiful musician, a great bass player, but he was always coming up with these different sounds. Like somebody would say something to him, and he'd make a sound like a siren, like the cops was after him, or he'd remember what somebody had told him and he would be imitating them. That's how his career took off, and he's been going ever since. I think a lot of guys envy him, but if you got talent and can display it in a way where it could be beneficial to you, hey, you should glory in your spunk, you know.</p>
