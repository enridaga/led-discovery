I beg of your Grace to make my compliments to Mrs. Pendarvis, and return my sincere thanks for saying so much in my favour as could introduce me to so agreeable an acquaintance as her friend, Mrs. Donnellan, who made me very happy to-night by spending the evening with me; I assure you what she says gives pleasure, and what she sings delight. If my ears were always as well entertained with sense and music, I should think hearing the best of my senses, and better than all put together.
