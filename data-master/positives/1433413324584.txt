Beautiful recital this afternoon by JH at St Matthew's and St. Timothy's of organ music by Bach and Thomson. (JH, a true performer in all but one crucial sense: he takes no pleasure in showing off.) At the first jarring notes of Bach's G-minor Fantasia, Virgil, wrenched from his nap, yelled "What's that!"
