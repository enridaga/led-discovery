The history of my Cambridge expedition is this: I was once in company with a lady who was asked to "favour us with a song". The word song had scarcely got clear of the lips of the asker when the lady answered by beginning to sing, "Water parted from the sea" [from Arneâ€™s Artaxerxes]. It made us all jump, like a gun that should go off if one only touched the trigger.
