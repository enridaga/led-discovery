<p>To a musical student,&nbsp;who spoke to him [Richard Wagner] of Mendelssohn's and Schumann's&nbsp;works rather contemptuously, he presented such of their&nbsp;compositions as he happened to possess, with the recommendation to ' thoroughly study the works of those composers and of others spiritually akin to them, before&nbsp;finding fault with them.' .... He never would allow&nbsp;himself to be measured against or compared with Mozart&nbsp;and Beethoven. "I should be the greatest fool alive,"&nbsp;he used to say, "if I attempted to equal those Masters,&nbsp;or to produce anything like what they have produced.&nbsp;I can only hold my own, after and anywhere near them,&nbsp;by proving my intention to do otherwise than they did."</p>
