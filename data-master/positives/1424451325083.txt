In my chamber music classes I had two outstandingly competent students â€“ a Norwegian violinist and an excellent English pianist. I particularly wanted to coach a piano trio, a difficult medium to which I have always been rather partial. Eisenberg solved the problem for me by suggesting Miss Warmington as the cellist whom I found to be very musical and who drew from her cello a lovely expressive tone quality.
