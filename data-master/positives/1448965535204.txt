<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was fortunate in getting tickets for the RFH during the Festival of Britain. Friday, 25th May 1951 Sir John Barbirolli and the Halle. Saturday 5th June 1951 Leopold Stokowski and BBC Symphony Orchestra. Sunday 20th May 1951 Sir Malcolm Sargent and London Symphony Orchestra. I still have the programmes which cost 1 shilling each but do not remember the details of the concerts except that I was very thrilled to be present on such auspicious occasions.&nbsp;</p>
