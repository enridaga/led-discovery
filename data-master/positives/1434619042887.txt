I could, therefore, dispose of the opera ['Le Rossignol'] as I liked, and Diaghileff, who had been chagrined to see me working for another theatre, jumped at the chance, and decided to put it on is his next season at the Paris Opera House. It was all the more easy for him because he was to produce Rimsky-Korsakov’s Le Coq d’Or, and therefore already had the necessary singers. Benois created sumptuous scenery and costumes, and, conducted by Monteux, the opera was performed the utmost perfection.
