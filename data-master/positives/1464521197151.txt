<p>The young conductor D&eacute;sormi&egrave;re came to see me go through the Third Piano Concerto, after which we went together to rehearse at Princesse Polignac's with a reduced orchestra of thirty-two players. What this actually meant was that the strings were cut down, but the Princesse proudly proclaimed that for her I had especially arranged the Concerto for a small ensemble. She has a gigantic mansion - a palace, of which I should not like to be the owner. The huge corps of footmen was own its own enough to make one feel queasy. D&eacute;sormi&egrave;re had made great efforts to get to grips with the orchestration of the Concerto. Listening to the rehearsal in a corner of the hall was a group of rather ordinarily dressed ladies, whose presence irritated me. Later the hostess appeared and presented me to them. Every single one of them was a duchess.</p>
