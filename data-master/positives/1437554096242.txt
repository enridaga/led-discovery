<p>Paul Monette, whom I had never met before reaching across the intervening seats in Row L to shake his hand after the premiere of&nbsp;<em>Love Alone</em>, I liked on the spot. Not staing for the rest of the concert, I invited him, his friend Steve, Larry Mass, and Morris Golde back to 70th Street for vanilla-&amp;-raspberry ice cream, which they refused in favor of vodka.&nbsp;</p>
