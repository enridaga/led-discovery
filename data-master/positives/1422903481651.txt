Go to Liverpool St. to see them & Barbara off to Lowestoft by 3.10. Tea here. Walk after. Go to Prom. after early dinner (6.30). Volga Boatman’s Song (blatently arranged). Song of Flea (Moussorgsky) – Harold Williams excellently sung. – very amusing. Rachmaninov’s terrible – vulgar, old-fashioned 2nd Pft. Concerto (Solomon). Mossolov’s Factory – amusing – nothing more. Tchaikovsky’s 4th Symphony – which makes one long for Chamber music & Mozart, & makes one deplore the discovery of “Fate”. Rather ragged orchestral playing. I prom, only till ½ time.
