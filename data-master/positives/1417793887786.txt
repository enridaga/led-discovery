     The end of my first year at Juilliard was coming to a close, and my six months of residency was long past, so I decided to go to the musician’s union to apply for my American Federation of Musician’s card.
     A bunch of old union guys with Italian accents led me into a musty hall for my trombone audition. The first song I decided to play was, “Torno Sorrento,” an Italian folk song I was positive they knew. As I played they literally melted before my eyes with smiles, heads nodding, and after the song they acted like I was one of the “Sons of Italy.” It came as no surprise when my union card arrived in the mail a few days later.
