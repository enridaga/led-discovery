Today, we often go to Jean Houel's Rasputin restaurant, where we enjoy the Russian atmosphere and continuous--and I do mean continuous --Russian entertainment as we eat the greatest caviar and blinis. Imagine the setting there: in front of your table is a group of anywhere from eight to ten musicians and singers. No sooner is their selection finished than another number begins, and right where the original group was performing is a completely different one with different selections, different instruments, and different costumes. It is like magic.
