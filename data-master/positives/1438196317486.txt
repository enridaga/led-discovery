<p>Mum has a very nasty fall in her room while washing. She comes down to breakfast, but goes to bed soon after for the rest of the day. So I have to go to the Philharmonic Orch. concert alone - this at 11.30 - conducted Mengelberg. Little can be said abt. the orchestra - I've never heard the like. M. doesn't impress me so much. He rescores Beethoven's lovely Pastoral Symphony in places almost out of recognition - &amp; even Mahler's 4th Symphony (M. of all people knew to the nth degree what he wanted). But I enjoyed this work enormously - I know it's long - but not too long (except perhaps the 3rd movm.) for me. Elizabeth Schumann sings the lovely solo incomparably.</p>
