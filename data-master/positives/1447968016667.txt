<p>[In Vienna] &nbsp;I became an assiduous frequenter&nbsp;of public and private musical entertainments, and was&nbsp;most generously admitted to the penetralia of the chief&nbsp;Viennese musical organisations by the great artists who&nbsp;directed them. One of my early experiences of " virtuosity '' on the piano, illustrating an aggravated phase&nbsp;of its novel departure, was gained at a matin&eacute;e given in&nbsp;a concert-room attached to the Imperial Palace by the&nbsp;Chevalier Antoine de Kontski, surnamed by his admiring&nbsp;countrymen "The Lion of Poland"... &nbsp;Blows from a playful leonine paw could scarcely,&nbsp;I should think, strike a larger number of notes simultaneously or with greater force of impact than did the&nbsp;vigorous hands of the Sarmatian Lion to whom I listened&nbsp;twenty years ago, for the first time, in a daze of mingled&nbsp;wonder and consternation. One of the pieces he played&nbsp;on the occasion referred to, I remember, had been intituled in such sort as to explain its special function and&nbsp;aim with laudable directness. It was called "Le R&eacute;veil&nbsp;de la Pologne," and was eminently qualified, as rendered&nbsp;by M. de Kontski, to awaken the dead, let alone slothful&nbsp;patriots of the Polish or any other persuasion. An&nbsp;eminent Viennese critic wrote a panic-stricken notice of&nbsp;the matinee alluded to, on the morrow of the performance, concluding his remarks with the following impressive&nbsp;words : "From battle, murder, and from sudden death,&nbsp;and from the Lion of Poland's pianoforte-playing, good&nbsp;Lord, deliver us!"</p>
