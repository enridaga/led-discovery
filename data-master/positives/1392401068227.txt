On Thursday I took Miss Marshall to our concert, where she treated the connoisseurs with a lesson played in perfection. But in the midst of Mad: Souché’s Harp concerto a string broke, & it took up so much time to mend it that the concert was not over till near 11, & then we went home, eat hot minced pies for supper, & were not in bed till 1. Nor till 12 the night before. But it is all one to me. I passed a very pleasant week. Miss Marshall is a very sensible woman, quiet, perfectly unassuming, with all her merit as a player, & with a great deal of fun about her which she never lets out improperly. Of Music, you may be sure, we had plenty & I enjoyed it very much. So much for my musical week: we had as much laughter as Music.
