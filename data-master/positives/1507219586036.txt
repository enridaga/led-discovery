All the streets unto the Tower of London was new graveled. Her Grace rode through Barbican and Cripplegate, and by London Wall unto Bishopsgate, and up to Leadenhall and through Gracechurch Street and Fenchurch Street. And before rode gentlemen and many knights and lords. And after came all the trumpets blowing. And then came all the heralds in array. And my Lord of Pembroke bore the Queen's swords. Then came Her Grace on horseback, appareled in purple velvet with a scarf about her neck, and the sergeants of arms about Her Grace. And next after rode Sir Robert Dudley, the master of her horse, and so the guard with halberds. And there was such shooting of guns as never was heard before. So to the Tower with all the nobles. And so Her Grace lay in the Tower unto the fifth day of December&mdash;that was St. Nicholas's eve. And there was in certain places children who made speeches, and other places&nbsp;singing&nbsp;and playing with regols.</span></p>
