Amongst the distinguished persons to whom General Dalton's friendship introduced me, was the Governor of Gratz, a most highly-gifted nobleman, whose wife laboured under the extra-ordinary misfortune of not having seen her own face for many years...[S]he was an amiable, accomplished woman, though proud; and, what was more to my purpose, a good musician. When General Dal ton introduced me to her, I had the pleasure of hearing her play very finely on the piano-forte.
