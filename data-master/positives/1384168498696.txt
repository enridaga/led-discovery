Never did Patti sing with more spirit than she did yesterday; her voice had such fulness, such freshness, and such brilliancy! The bolero from Vepres Siciliennes was encored.... Patti does not move you, but she can make you weep with astonishment; it is really like fireworks. Yesterday, I was positively startled when she poured forth a flood of notes, they were so pure, so high, and so delicate!
