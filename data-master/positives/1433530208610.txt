<p>Joe [Oliver] and I were the first ones to introduce these things [cups, glasses, buckets, mutes]. We were both freak trumpet men [sounds made through artificial devices rather than the valves]. Some writers claim I was the first one to use mutes and buckets, but it wasn't so. I got to give Joe credit for using them. Joe could make his horn sound like a holy-roller meeting; God what that man could do with his horn! Joe's band followed me to San Francisco, and it didn't go over because I had come there first with cups and buckets, and the people thought Joe was imitating me. Joe and I used to get a kick out of that whenever we talked about it. He sure got some laughs from it.</p>
