<pre>On the 30th May, 1808, I witnessed the retirement of my friend, Madame Storace, <br />from the stage, in her favourite part of Margaretta, in "No Song, no Supper." <br />Colman wrote a farewell address for her, which she sang in character ; and <br />quitted public life, esteemed and regretted by all those who were acquainted with <br />her. I continued in intimate friendship with her to the day of her death.
