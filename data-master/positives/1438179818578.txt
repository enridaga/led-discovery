The other day, genuinely overwhelmed by her incomparable rendering of "<em>Voi che sapete</em>" on the gramophone, it was bitter to reflect I had once heard the real woman and cannot recall the ghost of a thrill. Was it my childish contempt for florid music - she sang something by Donizetti, I think - combined with insane dislike of affectation even as innocent and ritualistic as hers, or does some spiteful god amuse himself by turning us deaf and stupid for a while?</span></p>
