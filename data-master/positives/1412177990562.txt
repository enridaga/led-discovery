As your curiosity seemed much excited by the extraordinary Accounts of the Norwich Musical Child, & as you expressed some desire to know in what particulars his performance was wonderful, & disposition to Music superior to that of other Children of the same age; after making all the enquiries my leisure & opportunities would allow, & repeatedly hearing & studying him, I have drawn up the following account, which if it does not appear too trivial, I should be glad if you would do me the honour of presenting to the Royal Society, as a mark of my respect & veneration for that learned Body, who, as their enquiries extend to all parts of Nature, will perhaps not disdain to receive a narrative of the uncommon exertions of the human faculties at a more early period of Life than they usually develope.
