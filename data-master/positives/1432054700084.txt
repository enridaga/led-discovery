There were oratorios performing at Drury Lane, under the united management of Mr. Linley, Doctor Arnold, and Madame Mara, who were joint proprietors. One evening, after the first act of the oratorio, I went into the green-room, where, amongst other ladies, was Madame Mara, to whom I had never spoken. Doctor Arnold said, " Pray, Mr. Kelly, tell us what sort of a singer is Signora Storace ?" I replied that, in my opinion she was the best singer in Europe. I meant, of course, in her line ; but, as it proved afterwards, Madame 
Mara was highly offended at the praise which I had given to my friend, and said to a lady, when I quitted the green-room, that I was an impertinent coxcomb. I then knew nothing of Madame Mara, nor at that time valued her 
good opinion ; however, she carried her resentment so far against me, that she afterwards declared she would not sing where I did, if she could avoid it.
