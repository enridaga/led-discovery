<p>After dinner go to Prom. with Mrs. Bridge. Hear 3 prize-winning works of D. Telegraph ov. comp. - [Arnold] Cooke (3rd). [Frank] Tapp (2nd) [Cyril] Scott (3rd). Pretty bad but Cooke's was exhilarating &amp; certainly up to date.* Tony Brosa plays Prokofiev Vln concerto simply incredibly - never heard such technique. A skew-wiff show of the lovely 2nd Borodine Symphony to end with.**</p>
