<p>My 1st concert was to see a show in the 50s called Ballads and Blues with Ewan McColl. I am now 86 and have so many pleasant memories of concerts over the years. I love the Festival of Youth week and see the development of our youth in music. I come nearly every year to the Strauss concert and have introduced many friends to the Festival Hall. I have been to many Sunday morning shows.</p>
