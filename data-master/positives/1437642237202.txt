<p>The Tucker concert last night, with RR &amp; JH.</p>
<p>The pectavel last night - a chorus of 220 onstage and an orchestra of 100, plus a dozen second-string soloists, mostly American, who sang operatic blockbusters in every language except English - had nothing of song, everything of selling.</p>
<p>When Paul Groves and Craig Rutenberg emerged to present my 4-minutes setting of Auden's "Their Lonely Betters" (not an aris, not a pop tune - a song), over there in the corner on a near-hidden piano, the audience didn't know what to do, and neither did I when I took a bow.&nbsp;</p>
