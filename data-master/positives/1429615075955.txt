In 1965, I was invited by Dean C. J. Bartlett and the Reverend John S. Yaryan to present a concert of sacred music in Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, as part of a year-long series celebrating the completion and consecration of that great Episcopal cathedral atop Nob Hill. I recognized this as an exceptional opportunityâ€¦

All the members of the band played in character. Cootie Williams growled, Cat Anderson sent notes flying around the roof, Louis Bellson made an elegant percussion declaration, Harry Carney stated the theme with power and dignity, Johnny Hodges "sang" "Come Sunday" as only he could, Paul Gonsalves swung, and Tony Watkins wound it up with his a cappella delivery of "The Lord's Prayer." Choirs and three featured singers--Jon Hendricks, Esther Merrill, and Jimmy McPhail--gave it impact, but I think what registered most with many people was the dancing of Bunny Briggs, who was out front in the climactic spot for "David Danced Before the Lord with All His Might." 

When we did it in New York, we had Brock Peters in Jon Hendricks' place, and he did a very impressive job on "In the Beginning God." This was the occasion, too, when Lena Home sang "A Christmas Surprise" with Billy Strayhorn at the piano. The lyrics were by Dean Bartlett.
