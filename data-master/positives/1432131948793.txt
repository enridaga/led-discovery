Shostakovich said: 'A few days ago, on 10 May, we heard Nesterenko's concert in Moscow. He sang my 'Four Verses of Captain Lebyadkin' and the songs from 'Krokodil'. I thought he sang extremely well. The 'Krokodil' songs were encored. It may immodest of me, but I much enjoyed hearing my little things from 'Krokodil.' So saying, Shostakovich smiled that glorious smile of his.
