This is a memorial of the mass celebrated in this church by Clement VIII. on the conversion of Henry IV. king of France, to the Romish religion. It is no wonder that the popes lay a great stress on this transaction, as it serves them for an undeniable record of their supremacy over crowned heads, At the absolution, whilst the <em>miserere mei</em> was singing, at every verse the pope, with a staff which he held in his hand, struck the king's representatives, the cardinals du Perron and d'Ossat, on the shoulders, who were kneeling at his feet. </span></p>
