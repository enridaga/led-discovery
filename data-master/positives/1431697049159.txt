We had a miscellaneous selection; the chief feature consisting of pieces from Beethoven and Spohr. The orchestral parts of a short recitative, the words of which had been printed in the books for the audience, were not forthcoming; we were all in a difficulty, but Mendelssohn came to the rescue. He quietly betook himself to an adjoining room, and there, while the preceding pieces of the programme were being played, he composed the recitative, scored it, and copied the parts, and these were admirably played, with the ink scarcely dry, at first sight, by the band the public knew nothing of what had happened the way a Mendelssohn manages.
