<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I was brought to see my first ballet here - it was magical. I think I saw 'La Fille Mal Garde [La Fille mal Gardee] - it didn't matter which ballet it was. I just thought it the most wonderful thing to experience. I wish I had seen Frank Sinatra when I was older.</p>
