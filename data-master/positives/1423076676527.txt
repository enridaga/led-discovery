The 1963 season was quite phenomenal, a fitting climax to all the happy summers the Brymers had spent there, with magnificent productions of Debussy's Pelléas, Beethoven's Fidelio, Stravinsky's Rake's Progress and Mozart's Zauberflöte and Figaro. We revelled in it, as ever, even though the orchestral meetings which punctuated the season had a sense of doom hanging over them.
