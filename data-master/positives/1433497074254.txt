I joined John Robichaux in 1904. There were seven men in the band (no piano): guitar, violin, Jim Williams on trumpet (he used to use a mute), cornet, Battice Dellile on trombone, Dee Dee Chandler on drums and the greatest bass player I ever heard in my life--Henry Kimball. They played for the elite and had the town sewed up. In about 1908, Robichaux had a contest with Bolden in Lincoln Park and Robichaux won. For the contest, Robichaux added Manuel Perez. Bolden got hot-headed that night, as Robichaux really had his gang out. On other occasions, when Robichaux was playing in Lincoln Park and Bolden in Johnson Park, about a block away, Bolden would strip Lincoln Park of all the people by slipping his horn through the knothole in the fence calling the children home.
