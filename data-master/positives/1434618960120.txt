Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 22 Dec., 1750 -
I spent two comfortable hours with Mrs. Hamilton, who is quite happy in the recovery of her little girl : she is now come down stairs, and is as lively as ever, though a little skeleton. I thought it hardly possible she should recover, but I thank God she has ! her death would have been a fatal stroke to her excellent mother, whose nerves are ill able to support such a shock. Her eldest daughter is a good creature, and has shown such a regard to her mother and sister on
this occasion, such attention, and been so useful, that it has raised her greatly in my esteem. She is to spend this day with me ; if I could transport yourself, (I mean my dear sister-self) here, you should be here today to partake of our musical entertainment. Signor Morella, our present famous performer, and his friend (whose name I know not) that accompanies him, and a Mr. Smith, who plays well on the harpsichord (not the Counsellor), an organist, are to be here before 12, and to spend the day here.
