This historical incident was related by Major Whittle at a Sunday-school meeting in Rockford, Illinois, in May 1870. Mr. Bliss was present, and the song, " Hold the Fort " was at once born in his mind. The next day Whittle and Bliss held a meeting in the Young Glen's Christian Association rooms in Chicago. Bliss went on the platform and wrote the chorus of this hymn on the blackboard. He there sang the verses for the first time in public, and the audience joined in the chorus. Soon after he had it published in sheet form.
