<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">In 1951 I visited the South Bank with my parents. I was a little girl with "pigtails" aged 7 and was overwhelmed by the wonderful spectacle of the Festival Hall and all the other buildings and I remember fountains but these memories have a strange dream like quality now. In the 2000 decade my favourite concerts were the Jack Gibbons Gershwin Concerts, in the Queen Elizabeth Hall in July - he is fantastic!</p>
