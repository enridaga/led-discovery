Karl played the Thirteenth Nocturne [C minor, Op. 48] and Chopin came up to me 
and whispered, "No one in the world will ever play it like him . . . except myself'" Karl was asked: "Why don't you play the Nocturne in the same way as Chopin or your brother?" He replied, "I cannot play with someone else's feelings." Even Chopin was stupefied by this bold and original answer which pleased him greatly, like nearly everything else the boy does.
