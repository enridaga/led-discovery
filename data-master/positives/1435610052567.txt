My last stage was at Copenhagen, where I was to conduct a concert at the invitation of the great daily, ‘Dagens Nyheder’. As the Royal Opera in Copenhagen had just staged ‘Petroushka’, with the choreography reconstructed by Michel Fokine himself, the theatrical management, availing themselves of my presence, asked me to conduct one of the performances. I did so with great pleasure, leaving next day for Paris.
