The Mann Auditorium was packed, with standing room only. Jackie played Saint-Saëns’s youthful concerto with all the exuberance of a young woman in love. Even before the final bars, the audience was on its feet, clapping and cheering: another one of Jackie’s ‘standing ovulations’, I thought. Everyone was surging forward to the stage, and the clapping changed to a slow beat. It hit me that this was a completely different appreciation of classical music: to the Israelis, Jackie and Danny were pop stars.
