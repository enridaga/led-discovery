<p>We go to Opera at 7.30 - R. Strauss - Arabella - a sad work for him. Beginning was terribly slow &amp; meandering, &amp; he simply couldn't clinche matters at all - of course it was well done &amp; scored in his own way - but there was little music in even the best bits - the animated 2nd act, with its warm &amp; luscious love music. Orch. good under Krauss, &amp; singers quite good Arabella (Fr. Ursuleac), being fine.&nbsp;</p>
