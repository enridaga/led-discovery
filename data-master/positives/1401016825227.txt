Listening to the Dvořák Quintet in today's lunchtime concert, I'm aware of various things which could be worked upon in the group's approach. One is conscious of the players trying to match each other point by point along the phrases, at every place they know they have a chord together, at every point where they know that their part combines significantly with other parts. Thus the momentum of the performance is no more than the sum of five players trying to do-ordinate their phrases with one another, and the élan is a kind of orchestral élan, with no individual player taking the responsibility for the direction of the music.
