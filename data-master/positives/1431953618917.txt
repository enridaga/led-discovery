This work revealed new beauties to me, and this I owe to certain effects and 'nuances' which with all my hearty exertions I could not succeed in bringing out with a London orchestra. The work itself stands relatively to other Symphonies like the Cathedral of Cologne to other churches. Rietz conducted in true musicianly style.
