<p>I THINK I ought to mention our golden wedding day, which took place on August 3rd, 1909. My wife and I had no end of handsome presents and telegrams from relations and friends, as well as bouquets of flowers and gilded laurel wreaths. In the afternoon we had a garden party in the grounds opposite our house, and snapshots were taken of us and our children as well as photographic groups. In the evening we had a family dinner-party and some music afterwards, during which Madame Blanche Marchesi and Madame Zelie de Lussan charmed us and our friends with their singing. We spent a most delightful evening (though as host I ought not to say so !) ; and it was twelve o'clock when the festivities of this glorious day finished.</p>
