At midday, Anthony Marwood gives a solo recital of entrancing virtuosity; including the Six Caprices by the Italian contemporary composer Salvatore Sciarrino. As Anthony says, these are like the 'air from another planet' which Schoenberg referred to in the sung text that accompanies his Second String Quartet. Almost entirely played in harmonics, and executed at top speed, with flying glissades of icy feathers, they're like passing through a musical hailstorm in the stratosphere. Alas, despite their technical wizardry, these are pieces that have more visual than emotional appeal.
