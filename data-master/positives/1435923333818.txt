<p>There used to be a joint in New York, a late spot up on 138th, called Clark Monroe's Uptown House, where the guys all jammed. I had learned trumpet--fooling around with it, you know--and used to go out and jam at Monroe's. Bird [Charlie Parker] used to go down there and blow every night while he was with McShann at the Savoy and he just played gorgeous.</p>
