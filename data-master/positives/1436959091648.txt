<p>Around 1923 the delegate of Local 44 got a one-night job over at Beartown, Illinois, for a little pickup band... This one big tough guy with a long mustache came carrying a crock jug over his shoulder. He was unshaven, dirty, and chewed tobacco and sat in a chair he&rsquo;d pulled up right in front of the bandstand. He laid a big pistol in his lap and told us to play nothin' but <em>Yes! We Have No Bananas</em>. We started playing it and the guy that put on the dance came up and told us to do what the guy wanted or he'd break the dance up. All night long we played <em>Yes! We Have No Bananas</em> and the people there danced to it... After all the people left he asked us if we had a good time. We all said, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; I never will forget that guy and fifty years later I still can&rsquo;t play <em>Yes! We Got No Bananas</em> without nearly getting sick.</p>
