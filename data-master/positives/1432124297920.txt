Bishop Marvin, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, was travelling during the Civil War in the wilds of Arkansas. He was feeling much depressed, for the Union troops had driven him from his home. As he approached a dilapidated old log cabin, he heard someone singing, " Nearer, my God, to Thee." He alighted and entered the house. There he found a poor woman, widowed and old, who was singing in the midst of such poverty as he had never seen before. His despondency vanished, and he went on his way happy and trustful, because of the faith which he had seen and the hymn which he had heard.
