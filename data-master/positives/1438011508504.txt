Said Mr Stoll to me a while ago: "I awaited the arrival of my star in terror; but he came not. I went round to his lodgings, and, in a sordid room, found him, huddled up in an arm-chair, half comatose. I shook him, and cried: 'Come, Mr Leyboume! All your friends are waiting for you.' I shall never forget the bitterness of his outburst. 'My friends!' he cried. 'I have no friends! Curse the men who called themselves my friends! 'I got him to the hall, and there, again, he just collapsed into an arm-chair. I thought it all hopeless. But when the band played his opening music, he sprang to his feet, a new man, full of life and charm. He sang five songs, and was applauded to the echo. George Leyboume was, to me, the exposition of the word' personality.' I had seen nothing like it before. I have seen nothing like it since. I suppose I never shall. It was wonderful. To me, in our brief intercourse, he had been disagreeable. But he took his audience in both hands; took it to his heart, charmed and helpless."</span></p>
