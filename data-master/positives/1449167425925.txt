<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I went to grammer school in Westcliffe, Essex in 1949 and left in 1955 so my first visit to the Festival Hall must have been soon after it opened. I remember we were taken by coach one Saturday morning to attend a Robert Mayer Children's Concert which was my first experience of classical music. I believe the concerts had previously been held elsewhere but had transferred to the new Festival Hall.</p>
