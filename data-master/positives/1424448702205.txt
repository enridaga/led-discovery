Fenby [Eric Fenby] played the piano part of the sonata splendidly and at the end of it Delius was quite happy about the arrangement I had made, said he had much enjoyed it and gave his consent to the publication of the work in this form. We played one or two other compositions for viola and piano which included the arrangement I had made for my instrument of his beautiful Serenade from Hassan, in which I repeated one of the lovely phrases an octave lower. He was so delighted with the idea that he burst out with: ‘Why didn’t I think of that – it is a great improvement!’ To be with him was a most unforgettable experience for me.
