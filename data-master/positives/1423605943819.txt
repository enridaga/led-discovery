<p>"The Festival Hall was the first place I heard live classical music, when I came up to University in London in 1971. The very first concert is still imprinted on my mind - Haitink and the LPO doing Mahler 3 - not a bad start! I have a clear memory of the contralto - Norma Proctor - whose voice in the ""O Mensch"" movement effortlessly filled the hall. I had never heard anything like it. And never looked back - Mahler became something of an obsession. "</p>
