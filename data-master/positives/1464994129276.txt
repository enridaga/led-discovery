<p>The concert was in a club, a very good one, membership of which costs $1,000. The building has twenty-two floors and the hall is on the twenty-second, but lacks an artists' room. To begin with we were accommodated on the fourth floor, but then we were taken higher up and found space not far from the piano, behind a screen. The lady president delivered a speech about me and Ptashka (the hall seated about four hundred) but mainly about the ambitions of the Society. It is a new one, less than a year in existence. Before the first concert they had no more thn 160, after the first concert it went up to 175, then 190, and now it stands at 240. This is impressive, especially taking into consideration that the aim of the society is to extend knowledge of new music. I played well. Ptashka sang not badly, better than in Denver and in any case much better than I was expecting from her morning exercises.</p>
