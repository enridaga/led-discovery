And then the sudden disappearance of the ghostly revellers whose graves once more close silently over them, the sudden shaft of light that pierces the darkness as the cock crows ! One awakes almost with a start from the musical nightmare, &mdash;one of the cleverest and most realistic pieces of music ever written.</span></span></p>
