<p>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">I have just returned from Kazan, where I got to know the splendid company of the Musa Dhalil Theatre of Opera and Ballet. I consider their production of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Katerina Izmailova</em> one of the most successful&hellip;/ I have seen various productions of the opera and can say without qualification that this was one of the most interesting. Much credit is due to the conductor, I. Sherman, a fine musician. From the musical point of view the performance was marvelous: the orchestra played excellently. / Producer Kushakov and artist Gelms also did a good job, especially in the finale of the opera, scene nine, where one felt that they had a clear picture in their minds of old Russia&hellip; Scene five (Katerina and Sergei, and the murder of Zinovy) could do, I feel, with a little more thought, since as it stands certain parts evoke the wrong reaction from the audience. I also think that the end of this scene should not have been cut. Occasionally the tempi were rather sluggish. It is very important that many of the singers should work on their diction. The old convict should, I think, be more willful and stern in character. Perhaps the character of the main heroine could also be brought out more strongly&hellip;</span></span></p>
