Side by side with forgotten works, Diaghileff had wanted to present in that season the music of composers belonging to the young French school, by giving ballets which he had commissioned from them. These included Georges Auric’s 'Les Fâcheux', the music of which is full of verve and pungency, with the unforgettable scenery and costumes by Georges Braque; Francis Poulenc’s youthful and tender 'Biches', in the delicate framework designed by Marie Laurencin; and finally, 'Le Train Bleu' by Darius Milhaud, with its lively sporting pace. The admirably successful choreography of these three ballets came from Bronislava Nikinska’s inexhaustible talent. The performance was brilliant, and it gives me great pleasure to mention here such admirable executants as Vera Nemtchinova, Leon Woizikovsky, and Anton Dolin.
