Another most amusing adventure was also connected with the break-down of a train. On this occasion my father had a band of some fifty members of his orchestra with him, and after a long and tedious delay it occurred to one of them to express his feelings of strong dissatisfaction at things in general by an improvised solo on his instrument, which happened to be a bassoon. This encouraged others in different parts of the train to join their lamentations to his, each man on his own instrument, and soon night was made hideous by the most lamentable sounds ever suggested by the goddess of despair. Presently there came a move on the part of the train of a few yards, when flutes and clarinets set up the liveliest airs of rejoicing ; but again there was a stop, and fresh wails of anguish smote the astonished air.
