I recall with pleasure my performance in the première of "Les Noces" in Leningrad, extraordinarily well-performed by the Leningrad Choir under the direction of the outstanding choirmaster Klimov. One of the four piano parts – the second piano – was entrusted to me. The numerous rehearsals turned out to be both pleasant and beneficial for me. The work amazed everyone by its originality, sonority, and lyricism.
