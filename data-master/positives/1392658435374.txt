...I reached a building...which I had no doubt was the chapel from the half-groaning, half-singing noise which proceeded from it.... Beneath a kind of altar, a few yards from the door, stood three men - the middlemost was praying in Welsh in a singular kind of chant, with his arms stretched out. I could distinguish the words, "Jesus, descend among us! sweet Jesus, descend among us - quickly." He spoke very slowly, and towards the end of every sentence dropped his voice, so that what he said was anything but distinct.... When the man had concluded his prayer the whole of the congregation began singing a hymn, many of the voices were gruff and discordant, two or three, however, were of great power, and some of the female ones of surprising sweetness - at the conclusion of the hymn another of the three men by the altar began to pray, just in the same manner as his comrade had done, and seemingly using much the same words. When he had done there was another hymn, after which, seeing that the congregation was about to break up, I bowed my head towards the interior of the building, and departed.
