<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I expect to be in Riga until the October Revolution celebrations. I think I shall enjoy working with the opera company, which is rehearsing my opera <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Katerina Izmailova</em>. Even the very first rehearsal left a good impression on me: both the orchestra and the soloists have achieved a high level. I hope to be able to help the company as much as possible during my stay. / From Riga I shall be leaving for London, where the Covent Garden Theatre has also started work on <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Katerina Izmailova</em>. But I shall definitely be back for the Riga premi&egrave;re at the end of November. While I am in Riga, I hope to get to know some new works by Latvian composers, and I am also interested in the shows at the opera house &ndash; the posters are very promising. </span></p>
