<p>I cannot omit mentioning the many pleasant days I spent with Signor Natali Corri, his wife, and sister. Signor Corri was the first singing-master in Edinburgh ; his wife and sister sang at the Subscription Concerts, which he carried on there with great eclat. They were natives of Strasburg and Alsace, and sang duets most pleasingly. Signor Corri had also a large magazine, for the sale of music and musical instruments ; he was in partnership with his brother, a very worthy man, married to a beautiful woman, a native of Rome. At these concerts, I heard a Signer Urbani, a good professor, and, like his countryman, David Rizzio, very partial to Scotch melodies, some of which he sang very pleasingly, though in a falsetto voice. There was also a young Italian, of the name of Stabilini, a first-rate violin; and a Signor Cecchi, a good violoncello performer. I used to meet them at the house of the great Scotch physician, Dr. Cullum, who was devoted to music, and gave the professors of it the greatest encouragement. His hospitable mansion was always open to them, and his much-esteemed professional advice always gratuitously at their service.</p>
