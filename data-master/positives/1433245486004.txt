"The choir was augmented by some of the choristers of Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal, St. James's. Sir George presided at the organ, and he had, in addition, a full string band in the organ-loft, composed of members of Her Majesty's private band, and the band of the 2nd Life Guards, led by Mr. Gunness. The anthem was,"Sing unto God ; " and after the service the Russian national hymn was performed, followed by the " Festal March," and concluding with the English national anthem. Magnificently was the music performed ; splendid, indeed, was Sir George's playing on the lovely old organ, the tones of which can never be forgotten by those who heard them, so rich, so full, so sweet, shown off to the greatest advantage by the grand, full style in which he used to play.
