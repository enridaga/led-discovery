Music is what is made, not what the performer makes it. I can get great amusement out of hearing one of my fifteen-year-old records. It is a trio by Mendelssohn for clarinet, basset horn and piano, and a delightful work. I wish I could have heard its first performance... My own record sounds quite good, but there is just something about the matched styles of the clarinet and basset horn which is unsatisfactory. The two players do not sound like father and son; they sound like the same person, as they are - Brymer in both cases, and allowed to do this by the genius of one Bob Auger, a superb engineer. It is, as I said, an amusing record - and even musically attractive and worthy. It was also done without anything added or taken away from the sound, and no computerized tempo adjustment; but of course it's phoney, because two players always should, and always will, sound like two, unless someone makes sure they don't.
