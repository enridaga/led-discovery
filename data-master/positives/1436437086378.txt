One evening I heard a performance, of course 
well given, of the Cavalleria at the Teatro dal 
Verme, and I also went to see the celebrated 
Opera-house, La Scala ; but, as it was holiday- 
time, there were unfortunately no performances 
there. However, I went on the stage, which is 
enormous, the house being much larger than 
Covent Garden, and there are reception-rooms 
at the back of each box.
