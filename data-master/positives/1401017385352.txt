At an advanced level, as with the Orlando Quartet, they clearly knew the piece so well that they all agreed on its momentum and played practically without reference to each other, the charge being distributed evenly amongst the four players, as far as I could see. They did not make a point of matching each other at large and small milestones in the music, as we do, and the result was a kind of seamless phrasing which erased all traces of rehearsal procedure. This is probably largely a question of knowing the music, and each other's playing very, very well, which we have hardly had a chance to do.
