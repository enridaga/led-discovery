Music making in Prades with Casals, playing the Fourth Brandeburg Concerto with Serkin, recording the Bach D minor Concerto reconstructed by Ingolf Dahl and myself from other versions of the same work and published by Boosey & Hawkes, and recording the Brahms C major Trio with Casals and Myra Hess are further treasured memories of these years.
