<p>Who was the greatest trumpet player in jazz? Louis Armstrong-- there's no question there! Louis played from his heart and soul, and he did that for everything. You see, he tried to make a picture out of every number he was playing to show just what it meant. He had ideas, enough technique to bring out what he wanted to say, and a terrific lip. You know, when the ideas struck him, he had the technique to bring them out right there on the horn. When I left New Orleans, Louis was just a beginner. He had just gotten out of the Waif's Home, and he was a coming trumpet man then.</p>
