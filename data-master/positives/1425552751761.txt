When not playing myself, I attended the concerts of others. I went even to choral concerts and lieder recitals, performances at which it would be a rarity to see another virtuoso. If Moussorgsky had heard such German singers as Karl Erb or Maria Ivog√ºn, to name just two, he would not have said that all German singers sing like roosters.
