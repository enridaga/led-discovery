Jackie and I waited in the Green Room. Mum gave us both a kiss and went to join the audience. Jackie was called for the unaccompanied Bach Suite in G. 

‘Good luck, Jack. I shall be listening from here. Who are you going to play to?’

‘You, Hil. It’s all for you.’

She did play for me and I knew it and treasured it. Every person in the audience knew that she was playing just for them. That was her strength: she gave it to every individual, and how we all loved and absorbed it.
