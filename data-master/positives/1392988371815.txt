We feel more and more at home and delighted to be at home, in Charlottenberg. How we did enjoy our quiet, luxurious Sunday yesterday! We breakfasted a little before eight, had a delightful and easy walk to the Heiligen Geist Kirche, heard a very satisfactory sermon from the Stadt-Pfarrer Plitt, in explanation of the Gospel of the day, and were much pleased with the hymns and singing, and the prayers - in short, rejoiced to find a parish church to go to regularly,
