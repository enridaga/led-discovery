No one sung while I was there but Madame Crispi, who has facility of execution and some taste by dint of practice &ndash; but her voice is false and coarse. After the company was gone she and her husband sung some of the Marchese&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Duettini</em>, and Crispi with a young professor played on 2 harpsichord some sonatas written by the former for one harpsichord accompanied by 2 violins and base &ndash; it was caw me, caw thee, between the two authors.</span></p>
