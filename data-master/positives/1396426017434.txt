I have an appointment with the Director at College at 11.0. I go there & find he's out. Before that, I copy out "Sport". Return and have an hour's practice. Lesson with Benjamin at 2.40 I go through 2nd & 3rd movs. of his new Vln. Concerto, which I like very much. It is ext. fine & original. I have an appointment (made this morning) with the Director at 3.30. Wait from 3.0-3.40 unsuccessfully, & return to "52".*
