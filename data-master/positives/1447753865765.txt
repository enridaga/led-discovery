<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I first visited the RFH during the Festival of Britain and subsequently came to the Ernest Read concerts on Saturdays.&nbsp; Later in the early sixties I heard Jacqueline du Pre play the Elgar cello concerto: a brilliant evening made all the more poignant with hindsight. &nbsp; Other memorable highlights include one of Daniel Barenboim's first concerts at the RFH and watching (?) Otto Klemperer conduct.&nbsp; Very much looking forward to visiting the refurbished hall next year.</p>
