<p>At Lord Saltoun's I heard parts of the new operas cleverly arranged for his lordship's parties by Mr. Ella. Lady Conyngham was at the piano-forte, Captain Montague, violoncello; the Duke of Leinster, double bass; Mr. Ella, violin; and Lord Saltoun, the guitar. This is an agreeable way of becoming acquainted with the elaborate productions performed in the Opera House, especially to these noblemen who support the theatre.</p>
