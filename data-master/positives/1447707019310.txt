<p>The late Sir George Smart,&nbsp;who delighted in contriving musical treats for me during&nbsp;my green velvet period, once took me to call upon&nbsp;Sterndale Bennett, promising me that "the great man''should play expressly for my delectation. This promise&nbsp;having been explained to Bennett with due representation of my precocious passion for music, he smilingly&nbsp;turned to me, saying, "Well; what shall I play for&nbsp;you? " For the moment I could think of none of the&nbsp;names of my favourite <em>chevaux-de-bataille</em> and nervously blurted out, "Would you mind playing through&nbsp;the full scales with both hands?" He replied, "Not at&nbsp;all ; nor is it half a bad test of pianoforte-playing. In&nbsp;fact, I consider it a high compliment to be asked to play&nbsp;my scales;" with which he sat down to the piano and&nbsp;played them so incomparably as to afford me a delightful&nbsp;revelation with respect to the effects that may be elicited&nbsp;from the piano by the simplest forms of execution,&nbsp;expounded by fingers of paramount skilfulness.</p>
