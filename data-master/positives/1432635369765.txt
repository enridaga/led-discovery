<p>A lot of guys who play acoustic cannot work with a band, because they're used to being solo. That goes with the feeling of what they know to do. Robert Lockwood, Jr., can go both ways. He can do more with a twelve-string guitar than a lot of guys can with six, 'cause he carries his rhythm, his chords, and his lead notes all the same. He could take his guitar and do whatever he wants. A lot of guys play guitar and got big names, but they can only do so much. I feel like if a man presents himself as a guitar player, he should be able to do more than just one thing. He's gotta have enough weight about himself. If he knows his instrument, he should be able to get out there, and if something goes wrong with the band, he can do something to keep them afloat. If a guy takes his guitar and can't play with nobody but just the band, he's just somebody living off a pole that somebody else has notched.</p>
