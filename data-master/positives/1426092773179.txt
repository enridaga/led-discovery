Last Wednesday I rehearsed my concerto with the quartet. I was satisfied, but not excessively people say that my latest Finale is most attractive (that's because it is easiest to understand). I will write and tell you how it goes with orchestra when we 
have rehearsed it next Wednesday. I want to try it once more tomorrow with the quartet.
