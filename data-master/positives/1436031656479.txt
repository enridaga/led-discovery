<p>I first met Tommy (Ladnier) in 1921, when I was playing in back rooms along North Clark Street in Chicago. Tommy was playing in some hole-in-the-wall out on Thirty-ninth and State. Whenever I wasn't working a night I was always out listening to Tommy, and, on his nights off, I generally got him to come to whatever joint I was playing at. I was in seventh heaven when he sat down to play beside me!</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with his work, get hold of Noble Sissle's old Burnswick records like "Basement Blues" (Tommy's chorus is right after Sidney Bechet's) or the Rosetta Crawford records on Decca, or those old New Orleans Feetwarmers sides.</p>
<p>Take it from me, when old Gabe blows that horn one of these days, he'll probably use the fingering that Tommy Ladnier taught him.</p>
