In the case of The Nameless Lassie, its composer is now as nameless as his lassie. I have often heart it played and sung in the streets, and once, when leaving a concert on a snowy winter's night in Glasgow, I stood listening, tearfully, to the touching melody played on the a clarinet in a side street. No instrumentalist can be so harrowingly depressing as a street clarinet!
