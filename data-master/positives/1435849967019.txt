<p>Cab had some wonderful arrangements in his book. Sometimes after the show and just before intermission we'd play them for dancing. Dizzy would take his solos and Hinton would follow his patterns harmonically, would follow the changes that Dizzy was making. Often, what Dizzy was playing would be contrary to the arrangement. But Hinton would look at me and I'd bend the chord so it would fit in. It sounded interesting and beautiful to me, but it annoyed Cab and three or four of the guys in the band.</p>
