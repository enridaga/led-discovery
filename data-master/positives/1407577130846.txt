Lords day. In the morn to our own church, where Mr. Mills did begin to nibble at the Common Prayer by saying "Glory be to the Father," &c after he had read the two psalms. But the people have beene so little used to it that they could not tell what to answer. After dinner to Westminster, where I went to my Lord; and having spoke with him, I went to the abby, where the first time that ever I heard the organs in a Cathedrall.
