<p>On May 11, 1970, I was thinking about how I could persuade [Johnny Hodges] to get his soprano saxophone out once more to play on "A Portrait of Sidney Bechet" in <em>The New Orleans Suite</em>. The telephone rang and I was told that he had just died at his dentist's office&hellip;</p>
<p>[He had] a tone so beautiful it sometimes brought tears to the eyes--this was Johnny Hodges. This <em>is</em> Johnny Hodges&hellip;</p>
<p>Johnny Hodges sometimes sounded beautiful, sometimes romantic, and sometimes people spoke of his tone as being sensuous. I've heard women say his tone was so compelling.</p>
<p>He played numbers like "Jeep's Blues," "Things Ain't What They Used to Be," "I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart," "All of Me," "On the Sunny Side of the Street," Billy Strayhorn's "Passion Flower" and "Day Dream," and many more.</p>
<p>With the exception of a year or so, almost his entire career was with us. Many came and left, sometimes to return. So far as our wonderful listening audience was concerned, there was a great feeling of expectancy when they looked up and saw Johnny Hodges sitting in the middle of the sax section, in the front row.</p>
