<p>In 1885, Sir George and Lady Elvey had a very pleasant little visit to Mr. Slocock, when Sir George went to Newbury to conduct a concert for his friend and former pupil, Mr. Liddle, on the occasion of the bi-centenary of the birth of Handel and Bach. He was received with immense enthusiasm by the largest audience which has ever been gathered together at a concert there. The programme included Handel's " Ode on St. Cecilia's Day," with a miscellaneous second part. Miss Annie Marriott was the soprano, and Mr. T. Harpur the solo trumpet. Everything went exceedingly well. Sir George at the rehearsal stopped to make the drummer tune more accurately, his naturally sensitive ear for pitch being unable to put up with a mere approximation.</p>
