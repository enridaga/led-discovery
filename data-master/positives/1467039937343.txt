<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">I recall that during my second stay in Vienna, that amazing pianist Walter Gieseking gave a recital there and included my <em>Deuxieme Suite</em>, which like the <em>Piano Sonata</em> ends with a very difficult fugue.&nbsp; Incidentally, when I used to play this to Herr Uzielli&rsquo;s first wife, she said that it was so exciting that it gave her palpitations! and even the very critical Delius called it &lsquo;fine, strong stuff&rsquo;.&nbsp; I merely mention this, however, because many of my critics were wont to dismiss me as &lsquo;precious&rsquo;, and incapable of writing anything forceful.</span></p>
