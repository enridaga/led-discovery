For our take-off eight of our most attractively stacked girls came out dressed like Tondeleyo, and I came out in the same half-concealing, have-revealing outfit. 

The chorus girls shook in competition and showed me all kinds of wriggles. But I had plenty of wriggles left that they didn't know about, and I was Tondeleyo. 

For the late show I sang colored songs like "Go Back Where You Stayed Last Night." Such crowds came that Sam Salvin stopped wondering if he could keep open all summer.
