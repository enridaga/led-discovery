The "Adelia" of Donizetti had been selected for the reappearance of Persiani and the debut of Conti. "Adelia" had never been accounted one of the most esteemed operas of the prolific composer, even in Italy. With the anti-Donizetti feeling strong in England (the bigoted lovers of the old school having just then no one else to abuse, in default of the Verdi, who was yet to come), the choice; was, as all must admit, hazardous. The opera, in a musical point of view, was not a success; although the remarkable execution of Persiani, who was enabled to show all her grace and flexibility in a rondo at the conclusion, "brought down the curtain" with applause; Conti was received as a steady, zealous, and even energetic tenor, but failed to excite any marked enthusiasm, or to realise the high expectations of the public.</span></p>
