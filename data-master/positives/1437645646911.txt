<p><em>Citizen Kane&nbsp;</em>(or snippets therefrom - like everyone else, I flip channels in my superficial haste and short attention span) remains as fresh, novel, and freezing cold as it was 53 years ago. The only moment to shed a tear is, of course, at the very end, but Bernard Hermann's awful music precludes that. The remarkable and moving revelation of Rosebud, never to be retrieved from the flames, is ruined by the overstated score.&nbsp;</p>
