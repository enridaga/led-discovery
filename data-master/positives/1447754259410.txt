<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">The Festival Hall was like a second home to me in the fifties and sixties. My father, William Monro, was a founder member of the Philharmonia Orchestra and my mother took me to many of their concerts. Through my father, who was in the violin section, I grew to know many of the members of the orchestra, and to see and meet some of the great conductors, including Karajan, Cantelli, Klemperer and Giulini. The Festival Hall has a very special place in my heart. I wish I had kept a record of all the concerts I attended!&nbsp;</p>
