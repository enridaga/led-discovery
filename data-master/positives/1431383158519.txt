I have been sent a recording of Benjamin Britten’s 'War Requiem'. I am playing it and am thrilled with the greatness of this work, which I place on a level with Mahler’s 'Das Lied von der Erde' and other great works of the human spirit. Hearing the War Requiem somehow cheers me up, makes me even more full of the joys of life.
