Unfortunately, Signor Ronconi (as rumour said, and for once, it may be affirmed, with singular correctness) was not allowed, by "Caudle" treaty, to play this great character with any other prima donna than his sposa. </span></p>

I was compelled to yield the point, in return for concessions made on the side of Ronconi. Noble intervention was employed, nay, a dinner was given for the purpose of settling the mighty difference. The gratification of the lady's desire, however, produced the very reverse of the anticipated result. Madame Ronconi not only failed herself, but rendered her husband, who was thinking more of her than his own effects, so nervous, that he was unable to obtain, in his favourite part, that success which he might otherwise have achieved. </span></p>

Other circumstances connected with the "cast," apart from the fatal drawback of this lady's exigencies, contributed to deprive the opera of every chance of becoming a favorite on the London boards.</span></p>
