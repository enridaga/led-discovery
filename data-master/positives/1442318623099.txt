<p>&hellip;It&rsquo;s just 1 o&rsquo;clock now and we&rsquo;re just listening to the commentary on the Wedding (of Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh).&nbsp; We get the B.B.C. European service very well here at all times of the day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also dinner time now so I shall stop now, and perhaps write more after dinner&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;The time is now just after 2 o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The Wedding Service is just finishing &ndash; the singing was very good.&nbsp; They are just playing God Save the King again for about the 6th time.&nbsp; The choir are now singing &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;.&nbsp; I suppose we&rsquo;ll see it all at the cinema in a few day&rsquo;s time&hellip;</p>
