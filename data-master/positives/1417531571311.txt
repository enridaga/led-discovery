<p>Jan.11, Queens Hall: B.B.C. Bruno Walter</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>I think that my only previous experience of Bruno Walter as a conductor was in June 1937 when he came with the Vienna Philharmonic &amp; Elizabeth Schumann. Now his Vienna is no more &amp; he has become a Frenchman. It is, apparently, a number of years since he conducted the BBC orchestra &amp; whether for that or other reasons he was welcomed to-night with a particularly vociferous ovation by an audience which the eye &amp; ear revealed as containing a number of Jews and Germans. We began with Mozart&rsquo;s G minor (K.550) which had as good a performance as any I have heard. He took it rather more slowly &amp; rather more quietly than some conductors do. It didn&rsquo;t lose by that &amp; tho&rsquo; he is a very undemonstrative conductor (easy going one might say if one didn&rsquo;t hear the results) there was quite enough incisiveness &amp; force, and a nice blending of tones. Beecham might have made it more exciting and more delicate in fantasy but could hardly make it unfold more naturally nor with so exquisite a pianissimo. There followed the Requiem which I have not heard now for a number of years. Indeed the time when I heard the Dies Irae each Christmas in Magdalen Chapel under Varley Roberts is now no more than a dim tho&rsquo; cherished memory. The soloists were Noel Eadie who sang as beautifully and as purely as one would expect from a one-time Queen of Night, Astra Desmond who did well the little she has to do, Heddle Nash (who sounded a trifle operatic but then the music is in its way as dramatic as Verdi&rsquo;s) and Keith Falkner. The latter is always a sound and an intelligent singer but it didn&rsquo;t seem to me that his voice was big enough (or should I say rich &amp; fruity enough) for the &ldquo;Tuba mirum&rdquo;. I found that parts of the Requiem had become quite unfamiliar &ndash; though two fugal passages &ldquo;Quam olim Arabae&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hosanna&rdquo; seemed to be old friends.</p>
<p>The BBC choir sang very well indeed &amp; responded to all Walter&rsquo;s demands whether for a great burst of sound or for an expressive quietness. He adopted the useful habit (which I don&rsquo;t remember from previous conductors) of making the choir sit down for half a minute between one section &amp; the next even when both were choral. The result was that they came fresh to each section. There was some good playing from the orchestra tho&rsquo; it was not so noteworthy as the choir&rsquo;s singing.</p>
