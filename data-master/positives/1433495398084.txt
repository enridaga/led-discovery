<p>I was crazy to play blues. [Buddy] Bolden was playing blues of all kinds, so when I got with Bolden, we helped to make more blues. "Make Me a Pallet on the Floor", that was played in 1894 by King Bolden. And quadrilles, I was crazy to play quadrilles. This quadrille, the first eight bars of what the bands are usin' today, "Tiger Rag", that's King Bolden's first eight bars we would play to get your partner ready for quadrille. And, in later years, 'twas taken and turned into "Tiger Rag" by musicians that could read. Had Bolden knew music, probably Bolden would have made "Tiger Rag". So we played "Tiger Rag" before we had any Dixieland Jazz Band. The Dixieland Jazz Band is the one that taken "Tiger Rag", the first eight bars, and turned it into the dance number what we dancin' today we call "Tiger Rag".</p>
