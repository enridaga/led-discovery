<p>On Friday, January 20, 1837, my father (as his custom was) took up his violoncello soon after breakfast, and in his 94th year played that beautiful air of Shields's, '<em>See the rosy morn appearing</em>,' with a firmness and truth of tone, not common to persons of his age. A few days after he was attacked by that direful complaint, the <em>Influenza</em>, and on the following Friday expired.&nbsp;</p>
