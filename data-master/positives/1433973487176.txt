Another young clarinetist, affable and very ambitious, named Stewart Newbold, has been after me to write him a quintet, and this evening he invited a bunch of people to hear him chez none other than Lee Radziwill. her apartment turned out to be huge and red, with fifty gold straight-backed chairs; the bunch of people turned out to be rich know-nothings (except for Sam Barber, at his most ill-mannered, perhaps as put off by my presence as I by his).
