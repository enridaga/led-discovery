Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Saturday 2nd February - 
A few words to give you my diary of social engagements, which I might else forget. Monday (29th) dinner at the Crown Prince's, with the Duke of Lucca ; then invited to the opera of ' Nourmahal,' a tale from ' Lalla Rookh ;' never had I seen
such magic effect of decoration.
