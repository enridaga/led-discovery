Although I could relate memories from most of the above decades the one that is foremost in my mind is that of a wonderful accompanying performance to the 1926 film 'Ben Hur' by the Philharmonic conducted by Carl Davis, using his purposely-written score. What a magical experience that evening was! The applause after the chariot race was such that they thought they might have to stop the film! Excellent! I hope there will be more such evenings upon the re-opening?
