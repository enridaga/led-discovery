<p>Listen to Brosa quartet after dinner; they play what appears to be a very dull &amp; gloomy quartet of Kodaly, but the atmospherics ruin this &amp; the Hindemith no. 3, which they play very finely. I enjoy this (having score) &amp; think most of it really fine &amp; beautiful. I was sick that owing to bad timing the Final Rondo had to be omitted*</p>
