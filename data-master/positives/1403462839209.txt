<p>Later I listen to a rehearsal of Schoenberg's <em>Pierrot Lunaire</em> in which a great deal of trouble and delay is caused by the fact that most of the players are reading from individual parts. Only the conductor, the singer and the pianist have scores, and all three keep trying to indicate helpful things to their colleagues when they come adrift. To an observer this seems like a simple matter of information imbalance, easily rectified. Yet, as I said earlier, there are many players who don't want to play from a score even when offered one.</p>
