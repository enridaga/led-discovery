Our first resting place was at Br√ºnn, where we gave a concert. How it succeeded, I no longer remember, but I well recollect, that I was very dissatisfied with the orchestral-accompaniment. In respect to that, of course my excellent orchestra in Vienna had accustomed me to a very different style of performance.
