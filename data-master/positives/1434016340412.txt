Letter from Bunsen to his wife, Berlin: 6th June, 1844 -
I am busied with a plan for the formation of a Conservatorio for sacred music, to which the King will gladly lend a hand. Meanwhile, once or twice a week, I hear the performance of psalms and similar compositions by eight singers
in Usedom's room ; on Friday evenings I hear at Winterfold's by degrees all the pieces that he gives as specimens in his book. Imagine that we have more than twenty great composers in the style of Palestrina, all Protestant, mostly Prussians—one and all, hitherto, buried in oblivion— in whose works are choruses giving the ancient German choral melodies in four, five, and six parts, like the Inni of Palestrina.
