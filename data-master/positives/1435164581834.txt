At King's he [Malcolm White] was a voluntary member of the choir for several years. Till Shrewsbury won the first place in his heart, Cambridge was to him the home of all that made life best worth living. He left it with a knowledge
of men, and a mind awake to innumerable interests. Not least of its gifts to him was the power to take part in a string quartet, often at first sight, with confidence and skill. He had a great memory for tunes, and could remember without hesitation a passage which he had only once heard, and that some years before. Many will remember his solo from the Meistersinger sung at a school concert, followed soon afterwards by a difficult sonata of Beethoven for the violin.
