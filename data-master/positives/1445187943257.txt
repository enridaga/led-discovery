<p>I well&nbsp;remember, at a concert I attended shortly after the conclusion of the Nikolsburg Peace Treaty &mdash; it was given&nbsp;by the pianist Joseffy, then a juvenile phenomenon, who&nbsp;subsequently developed into one of the most accomplished&nbsp;executants in Europe &mdash; a select audience of Berlin dilettanti enthusiastically recalled a good-looking songstress&nbsp;for performing a lengthy and elaborate cavatina by&nbsp;Kossini exactly an eighth of a tone below the key in&nbsp;which it was accompanied by the concert-giver. As far&nbsp;as amateurs were concerned, a German Fraeulein "of&nbsp;society" who habitually sang in tune was as remarkable&nbsp;a rarity.</p>
