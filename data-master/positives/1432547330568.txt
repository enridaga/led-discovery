This feeling [that a new quality had been added to violin-playing ever since his first visit to Berlin] was intensified when during this same winter I heard Joachim’s disciple Carl Halíř, the second violinist in his quartet, give a singularly heavy-handed performance of the Mendelssohn Concerto at one of the Nikisch concerts. This coming right upon the revelation brought by my first hearing of Eugene Ysaÿe, Mischa Elman, and soon after, of Fritz Kreisler (in Viotti’s A Minor Concerto under Nikisch) must also have had its share in our not deciding on the obvious course of studying under Joachim.
