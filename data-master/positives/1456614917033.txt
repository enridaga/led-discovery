<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%;">I really have, I think, been doing too much flying during the last few days. In the middle of November I came to London to work with the Covent Garden company during their rehearsals for the premi&egrave;re of <em>Katerina Izmailova</em>. We had just got into the swing of things when it was time to leave for Riga. The premi&egrave;re in Riga was on 23 November. This was my first experience of working together with the talented, indeed quite magnificent, company of the Latvian Opera House: it must be one of the best opera companies in the country. I would not like to start analysing the performance (the composer is probably the last person who should do that), but it seemed to me that the Riga premi&egrave;re came off well.</p>
