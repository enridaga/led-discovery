<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Roslavetz and Rebikov were &lsquo;Moscow composers&rsquo;, but Gnesin was a St Petersburg pupil of Rimsky. I knew him well. I do not think his composer&rsquo;s gifts were strong or original &ndash; at least, everything of his that I heard sounded anonymous &ndash; but he was the liveliest and most open-minded spirit of the Rimsky group, except when I consider that the others were Steinberg, Glazunov, Grechaninov and Alexander Tcherepnin, the compliment sounds less generous than I intend it to be. Gnesin&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Sprechgesang</em> was only a passing interest because, unlike Schoenberg&rsquo;s, it did not grow out of a musical necessity. </span></p>
