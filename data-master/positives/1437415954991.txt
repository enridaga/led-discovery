<pre>My first production at Drury Lane this year was the music to "Venoni," a play <br />by M. G. Lewis, Esq. It was produced on the 1st December, but was withdrawn <br />after five nights, not meeting with success at first. The last act of this <br />piece, as originally constructed, proved offensive to the feelings of the <br />audience; and although the previous acts excited the deepest interest, and <br />received sufficient applause, nevertheless the unlucky catastrophe was as <br />constantly hissed. The author finding the public determined on this point, <br />conceived the whimsical (and, I believe, unexampled) idea of withdrawing 
the play for a time, and reproducing it with an entirely new last act, <br />constructed out of the most opposite materials from those of the original one. 
Strange as this scheme may appear, it succeeded. "Venoni" re-appeared with a <br />bran-new catastrophe, and proved a favourite with the town through the 
remainder of the season. </pre>
