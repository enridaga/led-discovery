<p>&nbsp;In the course of an afternoon's musical&nbsp;chit-chat, with P.F. <em>obbligato</em> I have heard him [Herbeck] play&nbsp;through madrigals by Battishill and Wilbye, songs by&nbsp;Purcell and Ame, gigues and passepieds by Rameau and&nbsp;Couperin, fugues by Albrechtsberger, Scarlatti and the&nbsp;younger Bachs, selections from Verdi's least-known&nbsp;operas. Credos and Glorias by provincial Austrian, German, and Italian organists who might have been nameless&nbsp;for all the musical world knows of their productions &mdash;all these, besides bits and scraps of many others, as it&nbsp;were en passant, merely to illustrate some topic or suggestion of the causerie going on round his huge sonorous&nbsp;Boesendorfer.</p>
