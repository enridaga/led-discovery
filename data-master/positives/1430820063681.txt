Bobby [Irving, keyboard player]  kept hitting this like major 7th chord and Miles [Davis] had asked him, he said, "Don't play that major 7th." And Bobby played the major 7th chord a few other times. And Miles came over to, I believe it was Don Kirk was mixing monitors or something, and I was near. He came over and said, "I'm gonna kill him." And then he played the chord again and I could see his face, you know, wrench up, and he came back over and said, "Give me a hat pin 'cause I want to kill him for a looong time." (Laughter)
