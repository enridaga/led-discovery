Our show on Xmas Day went off very successfully judging from the very complimentary remarks we had showered on us, and the congratulations of friends. Felt very nervous about it at first and had cold, sinking feelings before it began.... [W]e got through the first half of the programme. We managed pretty well and without any breakdown and some of the songs sounded very well indeed. Finished the first half by ‘10 Little VADs’ poem - given to us by Sister Barrow, made up by someone at Mauritien - they disappeared one by one till only Franklin Smith was left to sing the last verse and then she disappeared too, amid much applause. We made a bad start at the next act but pulled ourselves together all right once we got going. ‘Mechanical’ Jane came on next acted by Fletcher, who was most excellent and Bayley and Bownes were both splendid as ‘Jane’. I was able to see this sitting down in the front with all the other bacilli, waiting till our next turn came. The concert lasted till 8 and we had to cut out the Plantation songs at the end. Got through the last chorus successfully and with great aplomb, getting our kit bags more or less in time but cheerfully anyway, to the tune of 'Pack up your Troubles in your old Kitbag'.
