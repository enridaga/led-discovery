<p>Above one-half of the students constitute a choir, and meet regularly once a week for a two-hours&rsquo; exercise, under the vigilant watch and care of Director Hauser. They practice the very best music, from Lasso and Palestrina all the way down to Mendelssohn; and on the afternoon when we were permitted to be present, the Oratorio of Elijah was performed, with Piano Forte accompaniment. The recitatives, songs, and concerted pieces were all given by pupils, and both these and the choruses were highly creditable to the institution. It was not a public performance, and was without rehearsal. Mr. Hauser was so kind as to allow us to choose what Oratorio should be sung, mentioning Elijah, St. Paul, the Creation, Seasons, and others; we chose Elijah, and it was put down before the choir accordingly, and, by them, quite satisfactorily rendered. It was a drilling, or training exercise, and the Director did not hesitate to stop the song whenever anything appeared to him to require it. Solo singers were in several instances stopped and corrected. The Director has full authority, and fears not to use it. After the performance was over, we spoke to him of the great advantage he had over an American Conductor in this respect; for surely no choir with which we are acquainted, would bear such close bringing up to the mark of perfection; and we said to him, that were he in America, and thus corrected faults, especially in a solo singer, the vocalist would very probably take his hat, bid him &ldquo;good evening,&rdquo; and be off. Mr. H. smiled, and said: &ldquo;I am a tyrant here.&rdquo;</p>
