"Est deus in nobis," wrote the papers rather profanely. The "little Hercules," the "young giant," the boy "virtuoso from the clouds&rdquo;, were amongst the epithets coined to celebrate his marvellous rendering of HUMMEL&rsquo;S "Concerto in A" and a free "Fantasia" of his own. The Vienna Concert Hall was crowded to hear him; and the other illustrious artists then, as indeed they have been ever since forced to do wherever LISZT appeared effaced themselves with as good a grace as they could.</span></p>
