<p>In the sixties I arranged a series of amateur vocal Reunions at my house, at which cantatas, oratorios, and scenas were performed, one of which was Benedict's St. Cecilia. I had practised it with my choir for some time, and when I considered it to be perfect, and ready for production, I gave an evening performance of it. I invited Benedict to conduct, and asked a number of friends to come and listen, and I played the piano accompaniments. The performance went off exceedingly well, and everybody was charmed with this beautiful and melodious work. Benedict, who conducted, was very pleased, and when it was over he made a little speech, thanking me and the choir and the soloists, to which I made a suitable reply.</p>
