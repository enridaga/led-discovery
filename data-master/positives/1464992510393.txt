<p>Afterwards we went to Damrosch's concert, but were late and caught only a snatch of Gershwin's Concerto, performed by the composer. Gershwin has made a big name for himself in jazz and is now branching out into serious, or to be precise 'half-breed', music, composing jazz concertos. America has jumped at this, and indeed I do believe that this may be the way forward to a national American music. I must admit that there is much that is attractive in the Concerto; it is inventive and full of energy as far as rhythm is concerned, but the material is thin and that is, after all, the main thing. I was left with the impression that here was not a real composer but a precursor of another, later, composer who using these means would compose real music.</p>
