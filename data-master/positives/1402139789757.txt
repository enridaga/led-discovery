Felix and Dickie open the concert with seven Bartok Duos which go down very well, and are entertaining to watch, with Dickie's face expressing all the grand and serious emotions, and Felix's all the mischievous and extrovert. Then Ruth, Michael and Robin play the Beethoven Serenade, this time standing up to play it. They play it very well, but the piece is about double the length it needs to be, and after the fourth movement, even the other players begin to fidget. Felix and I agree that it's not a good idea to play music which has a built-in fidget ingredient to an audience which is not sure if it can sit through a classical concert or not.... We're glad that we changed the programme from the Dvořák Quintet (insufficiently rehearsed) to the Faure piano quartet... and it turns out to be our most spontaneous performance of the three.
