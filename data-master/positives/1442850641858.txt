<p>I attended the inauguration of the organ played by Ralph Downes. Fantastic occasion. My first date with my husband was a concert at the RFH and the piece of carpet I purchased brings back happy memories of the many times we visited the RFH throughout our married life. One concert stands out Herbert von Karajan conducting. Reduced me to tears, the atmosphere, the music and surroundings. As I started in the 1950s, I returned for the celebrations of 50 years for the majestic organ.</p>
