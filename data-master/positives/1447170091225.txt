<p>In 1950 the company I worked for "Clark Signs" had some signwriting to do at the Festival. One evening the contractor said "Wait here. The Royal Family are coming to open the Festival Hall and we watched the Royal Family arrive. Working there for some weeks I watched the building being built. It was said it was years ahead of its time. Many memories come to us: the RAF concerts; the nurses and doctors from the London hospitals filling the stage with their uniforms; the concert conducted by Charles Farncombe. To get tickets for that concert we had to go early in November to get the tickets I wanted. Our 2 granddaughters aged 8 and six came with us to the Nutcracker ballet and are now with their own family. We spent a day at the South Bank with our 2 sons and friends and saw a concert in the Hall at mid-day.&nbsp; We still enjoy various concerts etc. as we have over the years.</p>
