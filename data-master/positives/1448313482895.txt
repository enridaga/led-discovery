<p>The &ldquo;Tod Jesu&rdquo; was performed on Wednesday by a choir and orchestra under the direction of Julius Schneider, in the Garnisonkirche; and on the Friday following by the &ldquo;Sing Academie&rdquo; of Berlin, in their beautiful Hall. It was well done on both occasions, but was much the most effective in the &ldquo;Sing Academie.&rdquo;</p>
