<p>I remember hearing Casals in Brussels in a &rsquo;cello concerto by the Dutch composer Julius R&ouml;ntgen, lavishing upon it the witchery of what is probably the greatest art among all string players. For &ndash; though Casals did give to the world &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; performances of the Bach solo sonatas and of most of the &rsquo;cello classics (as &ldquo;definitive&rdquo; as anything can be in recreated music) &ndash; it did not prevent him from devoting himself to the R&ouml;ntgens and the Emmanuel Moors. He often played Moor&rsquo;s &rsquo;Cello Concerto, as well as the Violin and &rsquo;Cello Double Concerto, with no less a fellow propagandist of Moor&rsquo;s than Eug&egrave;ne Ysa&yuml;e!</p>
