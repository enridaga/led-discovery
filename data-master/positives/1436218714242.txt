<p>Am listening to Schubert's A-minor Piano Sonata. So perfect, so boring. If analysed on the strictly objective terms of tune and chord, <em>West Side Story</em> and Bart&oacute;k's <em>Contrasts</em> would produce much the same result, not works being structured on the tritone. (The devil lurks in an augmented fourth. Title for a novel.)</p>
