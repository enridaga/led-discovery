Spend to-day out of school again. My throat is better, but still rather painful. I write & write - it is glorious to get some time to think, & to put ones thoughts down! I finish my quartet piece; but I have everso much altering yet to do. I listen to the most frightful bit of music, about 4.45 to 5.15. A string ensemble with Pft (&harmonium?) (?). A violinist scrambles thro' 2 last movs. of Mendlesohn Concerto. Leaves the rest of the people behind, except poor pianist!!
