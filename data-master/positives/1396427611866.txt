I finish copy of To the Willow-tree, & write a short, unsatisfactory song "Autumn". This I copy out in spare moments, after lunch & tea. Go to College at 2.40 for Pft. lesson. Benjamin seems more pleased, although I play even more abominably than usual. Listen all the evening to St[r]avinsky concert. Remarkable, puzzling. I quite enjoyed the pft. concerto. Sacre, - bewildering & terrifying. I didn't really enjoy it, but I think it's incredibly marvellous & arresting.
