Recital in the evening. Bach's Air on G string, Gavotte in E and Handel sonata in E (Miss Chapman) very good. Mr Greatorex, Mr. Taylor (piano) and Miss Chapman, Mr. Taylor was given a great Reception, tho' he didn't deserve it. It looked as if he was a bad sight reader, and as if he had never seen the music before; the way he stopped when he came to a hard passage and looked at it.
