<p>For a while opera meant Italian music only; then, with <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Martha </em>and<em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"> Stradella</em>, came a sprinkling of the lighter class of German operas. The mixture was healthy and prepared our people for the greater things yet to come. Finally the red-letter day dawned which brought me a degree of happiness that I shall never forget Max Maretzek had an opera troupe in the Federal Street Theatre. He brought out Mozart&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Don Giovanni</em>, with the fine singer Bosio as &ldquo;Zerlini.&rdquo; Perhaps my pleasure was heightened by the fact that the director used my score. The copy is one of the earliest published, with the German title-page, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Don Juan</em>; or, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Stone Ghost; a Comic Opera in Two Acts</em>. Some few years later; <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Fidelio</em>, by Beethoven, was performed in the Boston Theatre, and at last we heard the finest music-dramas; and probably no greater enjoyment will ever be derived from any future performance of them than we got from that first one. Of that I am satisfied.</p>
