At length - - we have heard Agujari- We wished for you!  - I cannot tell you how much we wished for you!  the great singers of former years, whom I have heard you so emphatically describe seem to have all their Talents revived in this wonderful singer.  I could compare her to nothing I ever heard but only to what you have heard - Your Carestino - Farinelli - Senesino - alone are worthy to be ranked with the Bastardini.  Such a powerful voice!  - so astonishing a Compass - reaching from C in the middle of the Harpsichord, to 2 notes above the Harpsichord! Every tone so clear, so full - so charming! then her shake - so plump - so true, so open! - it is as strong and distinct as Mr Burney's upon the Harpsichord.- 
  Besides its great power, her voice is all sweetness,- and when she pleases, all softness and delicacy.  She sings in the highest style of Taste, and with an expression so pathetic, it is impossible to hear it unmoved.  She executes the greatest difficulties that are possible to be given to her with all the ease and facility that I could say 'my dear Daddy!'
  She came before 7 - and stayed till 12, and was singing almost all the Time!  She permitted us to encore almost every song.  She sung in 20 different  styles.  The greatest was son Regina e sono amante from Didone.  Good Heaven! what a song! and how sung! Then she gave us 2 or 3 Cantabiles, sung divinely, then she chaunted some Church music, in a style so nobly simple and unadorned that it stole into one's very soul!  Then she gave us a Bravura, with difficulties which seemed only possible for an Instrument in the Hands of a great master - then she spoke some Recitative - so nobly - 
  In short - whether she most astonished, or most delighted us, I cannot say - but she really is a sublime singer.  
  We had not a soul here but our own Family, which was her particular desire.  . . .
