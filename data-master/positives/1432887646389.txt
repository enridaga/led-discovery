<p>" I knew Sir George Elvey well ; I remember him as a boy at Canterbury. We used to sing in the choir together. George was a <em>nice</em> lad, not fond of noise and bluster as some boys are, but very quiet and gentle in his manner. "He was always fond of music, and glad to get home to his practice. He had a beautiful voice, sang all the solos, and took the chief part in the services. Ah ! and he could <em>shake</em>, you know when the music said 'shake,' he could do it-- we could not. It's many years ago now, and things have faded into a kind of dream, but I can distinctly remember his beautiful singing, nor shall I ever forget it."</p>
