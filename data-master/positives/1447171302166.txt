<p>My visits to RFH started 1952 with the Saturday morning Robert Meyer School Concerts.&nbsp; For the sum of 2/- (10 pence) we listened to Sir Adrian Boult / Sir Malcolm Sargent conducting many great artists. Malcolm Sargent with his sense of humour doing a master class with his audience re Carnival of the Animals remains a vivid memory. These early musical experiences shaped to today my appreciation of great musicians and a wonderful venue.</p>
