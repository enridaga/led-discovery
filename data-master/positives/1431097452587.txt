<p>Then Fats Waller played a solo concert at the Lincoln. I'd never heard anything like that. It just wiped me out. The sign outside said "Thomas Waller, piano." Thomas Waller? Piano&mdash;okay, I figured I'd check it out. It never occurred to me that this was Fats. Then I heard that first note and yeah! I spent the whole day there, listening to him, and it was one of the great experiences of my life.</p>
