Q: You are said to have been influenced by the English composer Delius. Have you ever listened to his music?

A: [Duke Ellington] In 1933, in England. When I got there people were saying some of our music sounded like Delius, and when I told them I had never heard Delius, they brought me presents of Delius records by the London Philharmonic, Sir Thomas Beecham conducting. I was hooked on listening, but could not copy a bit of it.
