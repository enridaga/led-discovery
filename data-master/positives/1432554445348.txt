Both the last concerts in Sydney, on Friday and Saturday, were crowded, the one on Saturday particularly so, and will long be remembered by us. Lord and Lady Carrington, who had only returned the same afternoon, were there, and sat on the platform close to the piano. Wilma got bouquets after every one of her pieces ; but after the last, when we thought the flowery tribute exhausted, there came such a shower of them from all sides that the whole air seemed filled with roses and other splendid flowers that were thrown from the galleries, right and left, as well as from the reserved seats, many of which struck Lord Carrington as well as me. The hole platform was in a short time covered with them, Lord Carrington and I being very busy in picking them up ; but to gather them all was impossible, and Wilma on leaving the platform had literally to walk over roses.
