<p>...[A] sad honour awaits us: our concert in the&nbsp;huge Melbourne Concert Hall is ot be the last in the long-running Sunday afternoon series.... Nevertheless, and despite the gloomy warnings of the promoters, I thoroughly enjoy the concert. Ant is very cheerful after the Beethoven, and says that he only now feels that he understands it, after months of performing it. I feel happier today, because the piano is excellent, and because I seem to be able to fill the hall with sound without straining, even though the hall is so enormous.</p>
