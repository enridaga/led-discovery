<p>&nbsp;At the period I&nbsp;refer to there were a good many of these dingy Oriental&nbsp;soloists about town [London], to me quite indistinguishable from&nbsp;one another. They all looked exactly alike, and did&nbsp;exactly the same things; things, I am bound to say,&nbsp;almost unbearable to a child afflicted with a musical ear.&nbsp;Their melodies were composed of random notes, alternately howled and moaned to dismal monosyllables, all&nbsp;vowels and liquids, something after this manner:" La-la-lo-na-ma-na-lo-la," and so on ad infinitum, with&nbsp;the dub, dub, dub, dub of the rolly-polly drum&nbsp;obbligato all the while, as intolerably iterative as the&nbsp;thumping of the pistons in the innermost parts of an&nbsp;ocean steamer struggling along at high pressure against&nbsp;a head wind and a heavy sea &mdash; thumps which generate&nbsp;responsive throbs in the temple and qualms in the midriff of the unseaworthy passenger.</p>
