<p>Our first concert is in a new and impressive 500-seat concert hall in Musashino, a suburb of Tokyo. This is the first time we've played all three Schumann trios in one programme. Surprisingly, the Japanese audience follows in total silence. Are they gripped, or are they just well-behaved? At the end of the first half we realise that they are gripped. Several people behave in an un-Japanese way, clapping with their hands above their heads, shouting 'Bravo' - and this is only the interval! It's good to play pieces we know so well. There is no distracting mental effort of the wrong kind. We don't have to expend energy on 'getting inside' the music, or remembering previous instructions once we get there. Instead, I think we all feel free to be struck by new ideas, safe in the knowledge that the others will be open to them, not preoccupied with surface thoughts.</p>
