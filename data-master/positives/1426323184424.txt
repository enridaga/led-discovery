There were concerts in many cities, but I believe it was in Bristol that while playing a suite by Bach I heard frightening noises that completely disrupted my concentration to such a degree that I was forced to walk off-stage. “I have hallucinations- I am cracking up,” I thought in near panic. / “What has happened?” I saw the worried faces of Harold and Ivor. / What I had heard on the stage was so improbable and fantastic that I was afraid to be thought insane, but after a hesitation I said, “I heard, quite near me – I don’t know where it came from- well, what would you say if I told you that I heard tigers, elephants, and lions?” / Harold burst into laughter.”  I forgot to tell you. There will be an animal show here tomorrow. They put the animals under the stage tonight.” Happy that there was nothing wrong with me, I continued the concert and was hardly disturbed any more by the roaring beasts.
