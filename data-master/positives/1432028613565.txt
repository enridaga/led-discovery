<p>I was much interested in seeing Beaumarchais' 'Marriage de Figaro' - the original of the subject which inspired Mozart with his immortal music. The performance was, as formerly, slightly dashed with some interpolated music; instead of the beautiful romance of the Page there was a sentimental vaudeville song, at the wedding a trivial march, anything but Spanish, but as entracte we had the genuine Mozart Romance. Roger had reappeared in the 'Favorita'; he is an admirable singer, with a full-toned voice, but he and all his colleagues here adopt that dreadful 'tremolo,' which they in professional language call 'vibrando'; in addition to that we often hear regular bawling, and the louder it is the louder they are applauded. The last duet was repeated three times, the bawling increased each time, and with it the applause.</p>
