<p>Meanwhile, an evening devoted to Shostakovich&rsquo;s music in the Great Hall of the Philharmonia was approaching. I had arranged a small exhibition about the composer to go with the concert and was on tenterhooks of anticipation and excitement. The concert took place on 17 January 1933, with a programme including the Organ Passacaglia from 'Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk', which had not yet been staged at the Maly Opera or anywhere else. This wonderful work drew warm applause from the audience, but the two ballet suites from 'The Golden Age' and 'Bolt', several numbers from which had to be encored, were even more thunderously received. I was very happy.</p>
