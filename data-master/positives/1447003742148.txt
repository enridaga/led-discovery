<p>This morn[ing] my Wife &amp; I &amp; my Son sat in East Gallery, as did Miss Cayley Mrs &amp; Miss Metcalfe, best seat, &amp; heard the Oratorio of Messiah. The Church was very full indeed &amp; the singing &amp; instrumental music exceeded far that of yesterday. The Songs by Harrison, Mrs Billington, &amp; Miss Cantelo, were delightfully fine indeed, but Sale &amp; Pearson I thought but very indifferent. I liked my Seat the best of any I had had. Mr Ashley told Mr Sykes they had never performed to so numerous &amp; genteal an audience except at the abbey &amp; at Worcester.&nbsp;</p>
