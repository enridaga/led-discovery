Beginning with the July 1960 issue, [the jazz magazine] Metronome featured a series of concerts that took place in the outdoor garden at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)… We saw the relationship between modern jazz and modern painting…

The first group to play was George Wein and his All Stars. George was the founder/producer of the Newport Jazz Festival. George is also a pianist… The Playboy Jazz Festival and so many others are the product of George Wein's vision.

I can remember him starting off the concert, he nodded toward a sculpture of a full-bodied woman by Gaston La Chaise, and he said, "We're going to start the concert with a tune that reflects the sculpture. It's called ‘That's a plenty.’" And they started to play. It was great. That entire summer, every week, a different group played at the Museum of Modern Art, including Coleman Hawkins, Roy Eldridge, Art Farmer and his group, Jimmy Giuffre and his group. It went on for ten weeks like that.
