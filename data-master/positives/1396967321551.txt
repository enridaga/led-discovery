Finish copying out Carol & do a considerable amount of 4 part florid Cp't, 9.15-11.0 & after dinner. Practise & piano lesson as usual. I listen to half of a B.B.C. concert in evening. Egmont overture (marvellous work) & Brahms 1st Pft Concerto with Dohnanyi. Horrible scramble it sounded; anyway the strength of the first movement was there; but oh! the third movement! The wireless gradually faded in the first movement & so I missed the recap. & 1st half of movement 2. When I got a new accumulator, I listen to 1 min of Elgar Symphony 2, but can stand no more.
