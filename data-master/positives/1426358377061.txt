<p>Of course the first person I visited here was Mlle Pechwell. She played at the music club on Friday and introduced me there. That very same evening the theatre was giving <em>La Muette</em> and it was difficult for me to choose, but since it was important to support the lady I went to the soiree. Another important reason which induced me to go was that the best local singer, Mme Palazzesi, of Italian extraction, would be singing... First they played the <em>Fra Diavolo</em> overture, then the Italian sang not at all badly.</p>
