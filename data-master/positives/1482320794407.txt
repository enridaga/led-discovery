<p>Last night I went to the Ravel Festival, given by the SMI [Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Musicale Independante], to hear&nbsp;<em>Tzigane</em> which is quite the most artifical thing Ravel has ever put his name to. It is poor - very unexciting indeed. The principles that motivate those pages are so out-of-date that I am astonished anyone can still believe in them. Wildly successful, of course, with the lorgnetted ladies and the portly gents. As a whole, the works that were played last night seemed very antiquated to me. Especially the Quartet. I understand more and more why Ravel has no time for the music of today. It must appeal to him about as much as his music appeals to us at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
