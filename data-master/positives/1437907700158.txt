<p>After dinner Mrs. B &amp; I go off to Queen's Hall for B.B.C. concert. Boult conducts a dull &amp; ignorant perf. of Oberon overture &amp; then Schnabel is rather disappointing in Brahms D min concerto - tho' the slow mov. was mostly beautiful. Job of Vaughan Williams seemed interminable.* There are some nice things in it if you aren't tired of folk song modalism - but most of it is heavy, dull, imitative &amp; amateurish.&nbsp;</p>
