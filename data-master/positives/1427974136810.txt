"I like it myself," [Ray Charles] says when he's pleased with his own singing. He smiles and nods and does his dance as he listens to how he has fouled up--in his own sweet way --Gershwin's "How Long Has This Been Going On?" His vocal belches and farts break him up. After hearing a particularly nasty lick, he will say, "That's me" or "That's stupid" or ask me rhetorically,  "Does that stink enough for you?"â€¦

[Ray Charles] is a confident and self-centered man, all right, but listening to him listening to himself, his reaction reminds me of my own: He is simply a fan in love with the voice of Ray Charles.
