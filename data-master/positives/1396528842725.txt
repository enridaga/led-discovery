[M]y father dined at Gumley Hall with Mr. Cradock, where he met Lord Sandwich and the London party. On the cloth being drawn, his Lordship, addressing himself to Mr. Warren, secretary to the Noblemen’s Catch Club, said, “Tom, have you got the catch-books here?” “Yes, my Lord,” said Warren. “Then hand them to me.” On their being placed at the head of the table, his Lordship said, “ I shall choose first, and then each one in his turn. We will begin with Lord Mornington’s catch:
"'Twas you, sir,
’Twas you, sir, that kiss'd the pretty girl;
'Twas you, sir, you.”
Several of a similar cast followed. When it came to my father’s turn, he proposed  'Adieu to the village delights,’ as being a little more consonant with the day. On the ladies retiring (probably being driven away by the unrestrained conversation of my lord), Mrs. Cradock, as she passed my father's chair, whispered to him—“ I admired your choice, sir; it had my entire approbation.”
