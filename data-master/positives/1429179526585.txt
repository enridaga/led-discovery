The Huddersfield Festival was really a great success, and the people most enthusiastic. 'Faust' never went so well yet. Lloyd certainly sang better than ever, 
and so did Miss Davies ; Santley was splendid too, although a little fatigued at first. . . . I cannot help thinking now often of the evening when I asked you if you could not help me by translating 'Faust,' and now people have actually come from Ireland to Huddersfield merely to hear it. I have seen them with my own eyes. They had been ruefully sea-sick, and said they would not mind being so again the next day if they could hear 'Faust' once more.
