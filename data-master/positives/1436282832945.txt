<p>A brilliant reception was also given in his honour, arranged by his pupil and friend, the late Mr. Walter Bache, at the Grosvenor Galleries in Bond Street, where I had the good fortune to hear Liszt play. He was then seventy-five years old, having been born on October 22nd, 1811, so one could hardly expect that his playing would have been so astonishing. He still had wonderful fire and technique, and one could easily imagine his former greatness, as the first pianist of his day. He may be said to have created a new school of pianoforte playing, and now his works are constantly being performed at all the recitals given by modern pianists, and his orchestral works, such as his symphonies and symphonic tone-poems, are in the programmes of most of the orchestral concerts in London and the provinces.</p>
