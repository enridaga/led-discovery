Of his perfect command over the orchestra, Berlioz gave an extraordinary proof on the occasionof a grand concert given by him a few years later in the ' Cirque Franconi.' There had been a very long rehearsal in the morning, at which I was present, as I had to play Beethoven's G major concerto, then very seldom performed. After some hours' hard work Berlioz dismissed the orchestra ; I remained with him, and hardly had the last member of the band vanished when Berlioz struck his forehead, exclaiming : ' I have forgotten the overture ! ' He stood speechless for a few minutes, then said with determination :  'It shall go nevertheless.' Now this overture was the one to 'Le Carneval Eomain,' to be 
performed that evening for the first time, and never rehearsed. Musicians who know the work, with its complicated rhythm and all its intricacies, will easily 
understand how bold the venture was, and will wonder that it could be successful. But to see Berlioz during that performance was a sight never to 
be forgotten. He watched over every single member of the huge band ; his beat was so decisive, his indication of all the nuances so clear and so unmistakable, that the overture went smoothly, and no uninitiated person could guess at the absence of a rehearsal.
