I have mentioned the Imperial hornband, each member of which had only one note to play. On the twelvth of January, the Russian Newyear, upon which day the Emperor, as usual, gave a grand masquerade in the Winterpalace, for which twelve thousand tickets were issued, I found the said band joined with the usual Ball – orchestra, and I heard a music such as till then I had no idea of. [quoted from Spohr's diary:] “The accompaniment of this hornband gave a fullness and harmony to the orchestra such as I have never heard. Several Horn-Soli, produced a most enchanting effect. It was long before I could tear myself away from this place.”
