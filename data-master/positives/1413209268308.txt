At six I waited upon my new friend, Sir Thomas M'Kenney, and met a party of fourteen.... In the evening we had music, in which every one occasionally joined. I was called upon to sing, or tell a story, and after much entreaty I sat down to the piano-forte, and touched a few notes of a love song. Surrounded as I was with beauty, I sang it with feeling, and had the applause of the ladies.
