But then it was only a pierrot troupe, and one of its members was Mr. Arthur Wimperis, who wrote the lyrics for "The Arcadians." Now this entertainment is our only London caricature, the true embodiment of everything that travesty ought to be. The male members are the most voiceless collection of vocalists I ever heard, but goodness me, all their quartettes and concert pieces are better sung than the attempts of some real operatic artistes. Gwennie Mars told me I would not listen to her for the chorus at Drury Lane, but her thumbnail sketches of Harry Lauder and Wilkie Bard were genius studies, and yet where does it all come from, this realization of the real thing out of the supposed nothing ? Why, Pelissier himself. When the "Follies" first came under my notice it was at Bexhill. I gave them &pound;35 for four performances. I noticed their talent; the extreme individuality of their new and original versions of worn-out "trucs"; I saw their originality, and I was sure that of all the "pierotteers" they were beginning where all the others left off.</span></p>
