Looking back at the sixties, when I was growing up, I do remember that most television programmes had people speaking with very clear, what we would now call ‘posh’, accents and the background music was likely to be a string quartet or chamber orchestra. Some time during the seventies that all began to change and you would hear guitar music and modern stuff. It was as though the television producers made a conscious decision sometime around 1975 that they wanted their programmes not to sound so old-fashioned and that a good way of emphasising this was to have popular music instead of classical or baroque. It was all to do with sounding younger and more modern.
