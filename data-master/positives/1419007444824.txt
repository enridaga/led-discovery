<p>Feb. 11, Savoy Theatre, An Elephant in Arcady</p>
<p>I could not resist the temptation to be present at the last performance of this charming work which I found to be as fresh and delightful as ever. Geoffrey Dunn had returned to the part of Hortensio; the rest of the cast was, I think, the same as in January. A run of 17 &frac12; weeks &ndash; 13 &frac12; weeks at the tiny Kingsway Theatre which seats less than 600 people and another 4 weeks at the Savoy which holds twice as many &ndash; and a total (if I have reckoned correctly) of 141 performances is quite creditable for these days but I could have wished that a piece which added wit and good taste to its musical charms had been able to continue longer. For this last night there were very few vacant seats &amp; the supply of programmes ran out. Ranalow made a graceful and urbane valedictory address.</p>
