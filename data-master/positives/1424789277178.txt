<p>Dear Tertis, I send you my warmest thanks for the great treat you gave me and thousands of others on Sunday night. Your playing was perfect. I&rsquo;m sorry I can&rsquo;t say the same about the piece itself. There is one bad bit of overscoring which makes me ask myself when am I going to learn the elements of my job. This shall be put right before the next performance. / If you have any critical suggestions I&rsquo;d be glad to know them. (The bad bit is, of course, the &lsquo;squiggles&rsquo; in four sharps.)</p>
