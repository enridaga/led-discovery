<p>I have now heard Kalkbrenner several times...Last Sunday I heard him at a concert at the Hotel de Ville ; he played twice, first the Rondo, 'Gage d'Amitie' (which Mrs. Hennecke made me a present of), and then variations on a theme of Bellini's. I was very glad to hear him play a piece I knew, and to be able to discover in how much I am still wanting. He began the allegro of the Rondo at a speed that made my hair stand on end ; he carried it on at the same pace, which he even increased towards the close, with such a bell-like clearness, and such great expression, that I cannot understand how any one could do it better; and still, Chopin and Liszt stand higher than Kalkbrenner.</p>
