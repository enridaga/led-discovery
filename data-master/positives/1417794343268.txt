     When the saxophones switched to clarinet for ballads, they used an object Iâ€™d never seen before or since. They put their clarinets in cheerleader-type megaphones, then inserted their hands through openings on the side, and when they played, got a haunting subtone quality. It was about this time that most saxophone sections in big bands stopped using both clarinet and sax and just used saxophones.
