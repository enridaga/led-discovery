<p style="margin: 0px;">After tea I went towards St. Paul&rsquo;s - service at 7 - place crowded - what a solemn place &amp; how large the Dome is. - The Organ very tastefully played - something inexpressibly sweet in those harmonics swelling and sinking - then throbbing away into silence as if hiding in the farthest corners of the vast old building. I like the intoning immensely - but am as immensely dissatisfied with the bad time &amp; the indecision of the words. I can understand every word of the sermon but not a single word of the service.&nbsp;</p>
