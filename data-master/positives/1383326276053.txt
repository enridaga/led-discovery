Our Christmas arrangements turned out all very well and I think were much enjoyed: about 25 children had their tea, while Mary, Ernest, Charles and George, with the help of Mr. Lear, gave last finishings and lighted up. The Virgin and Child from Raphael formed the centre of a bower of green and light, with a tree right and left and a festoon and star above. The organ was in a corner, unseen, and Frances played the Pastorale as the troop entered in procession. After all distributions and noise were over, Ernest sung ‘Comfort ye, my people.’
