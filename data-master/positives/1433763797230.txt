<p>Letter from Bunsen to Lucke, Rome: 1st July 1818 - Now I maintain that the English Liturgy was constructed from a grand point of view, and adapted, with much wisdom, to the wants and to the people of that time, and that it represents Christian worship far more thoroughly than anything that I have seen in Germany, Holland, or Denmark. Singing is not excluded, on the contrary, in addition to that of the congregation, the ancient style of choral song has been retained, Tractus, Graduale, &amp;c., used in the Church of Rome,&mdash;the simple grandeur of which mode of composition, from Palestrina to Marcello, exceeds all else that I know.</p>
