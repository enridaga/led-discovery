Do not be astonished if I say nothing about Spanish folk music. I do not dispute its distinctive character, but for me there was no revelation in it. That, however, did not prevent me from frequenting taverns to spend whole evenings in listening to the endless preliminary chords of guitar playing and to a deep-voiced singer with unending breath trolling forth her long Arab ballad with a wealth of 'fioriture'.
