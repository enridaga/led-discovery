<p>&hellip; Basie's piano certainly contributes to making the rhythm smooth. He contributes the missing things. I feel very comfortable working with him because he always seems to know the right thing to play for rhythm. Count is also just about the best piano player I know for pushing a band and for comping soloists. I mean the way he makes different preparations for each soloist and the way, at the end of one of <em>his</em>&nbsp;solos, he prepares an entrance for the next man. He leaves the way open.</p>
