My narrow, purely vocational interest in the great violin performances of these years- Ysaÿe’s, Kreisler’s, Elman’s, Thibaud’s- led me often to Queen’s Hall and, fortunately for me, they brought me many rewards as a by-product of these expeditions in quest, primarily, of violinistic thrills and experiences; they brought me, for instance, familiarity with symphonic literature conducted by Henry Wood, Artur Nikisch, and Hans Richter.
