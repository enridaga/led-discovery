On my return to [school in] Streatham I was to take up my education with rather more diligence. Needlework, both useful and ornamental, except muslin work, I was tolerably fair in, indeed, in all that I learnt, throwing a veil over French. In music and singing I took a start, for the quartett party, who took up their quarters at the King's Arms Inn, practised at our house, to which Bach had sent a small pianoforte for that purpose. To this my brother and I used to sit and listen for hours, and no doubt our ear for music was insensibly formed from this advantageous opportunity.
