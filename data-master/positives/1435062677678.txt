The Dunbar Palace in New York's Harlem--appearing in person, the most luminous of all drum stars, the little giant of the big noise, Chick Webb! For those who have never heard the Chick, I feel no small amount of compassion. Of course, records are made like "Liza", for instance, but somehow, this genius never could get himself on wax. Chick gassed me, but good, on one occasion at the Savoy, in a battle with Benny's band, and I remember now what I said then, I was never cut by a better man.
