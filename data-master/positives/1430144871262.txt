The distribution of the vocalists forming the grand chorus greatly prejudiced the effect of the music with numbers who were packed closely in the side aisles and niches of the Abbey; in fact, the choral music to a part of the audience sounded as though it were smothered by the orchestra; in other parts of the Abbey the effect was reversed, and the performance as a whole could only be enjoyed in a small part of the vast building.
