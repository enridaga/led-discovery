I do not always get within his meaning. I know both Sestets. I heard his last quartet - I think in B major. I like it very much, and I liked the (so-called) "Scherzo" best. It is no more a Scherzo than it is an Irish Jig, but it is a superb movement. The critics considered it unintelligible! I heard Madame Schumann &amp; Co. play her husband's pianoforte quartet just as you say they did.</span></p>
