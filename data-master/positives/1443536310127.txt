<p>This has been a week of great mirth and jollity; on Monday Phill and I went to the ridotto with Mrs. Wesley, where we met with no disturbance; it began with a concert of music, the Duke, Duchess, and Lady Caroline were there; they went away when the music was over, and after some hideous minuets, we went to country dances. Mr. Wesley was my partner, there were twenty couple, four dances were as much as my spirits would bear.</p>
