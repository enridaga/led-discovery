<p>Rehearsal of Sun at Philharmonic Hall. At intermission Paul Jacobs asks if his piano is "ugly enough" for me, while Seymour Lipkin (the assistant conductor who knows the score better than I) asks if the cellos should be playing A-flat instead of A-natural there on page eighty. When the music sounds again, George Plimpton arrives with an entourage, in preparation for his next public venture into orchestral conducting. He speaks to me with bonhomie, oblivious to the fact that I'm listening to my own music... Karel Ancerl is sympathetic, musical and intelligent, if not especially energetic, and the orchestra plays like a gossamer copper, which is how Jane Marsh looks. But somehow, I feel that only an English-speaking conductor should conduct a work on words in English, no matter his sensibilities, or the international hardships of his past.</p>
