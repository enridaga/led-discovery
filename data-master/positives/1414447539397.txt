In the winter of 1808 – 1809, I arranged some Subscription Concerts in the town for the benefit of the Court-Orchestra. […] At one of these Concerts, Herr Hermstedt, Director of the “Harmonic-music” to Prince Sonderhausen, appeared as Clarinet player, and attracted much attention by his performance. He had come to Gotha to request me to write a Clarinet-concerto for him, for which the Prince upon the condition that Hermstedt should be put in possession of the manuscript, offered to pay a handsome gratuity. To this proposal I gladly assented, as from the immense execution, together with the brilliancy of tone, and purity of intonation possessed by Hermstedt, I felt at full liberty to give the reins to my fancy.
