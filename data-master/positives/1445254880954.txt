[Hamilton] has a very neat finger and plays the harpsichord with great delicacy, expression and taste. Mr. H. is likewise a pretty good performer on the violin; but are both so tired of the Neapolitans as to be glad to return to that of Corelli, &lfloor;Geminiani&rfloor;, Handel, Vivaldi etc for the sake of harmony and variety &ndash; indeed the general run of Neapolitan music is noisy and monotonous, but while such composers as Jomelli, Piccini, Merula, Mann&lsaquo;a&rsaquo;<a>, Paesiello etc are in it one would think no complaint need be made of a scarcity of good music.</a></span></p>
