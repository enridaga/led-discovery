On the... 18th. I accomp'd Mr Daman to see "The Wonder" at Mr Fox's at Winterslow... The music however between the acts made me some amends, there being a good band from Salisbury who play'd some of Bach's opera overtures w'ch I had not then heard, & w'ch therefore gave me new some musical ideas in respect of style, of which I avail'd myself in my next composition of that kind & particularly in the horn parts, which instrument I had before only met with at Portsmouth Concert where I was too much occupied with my own part to attend to their particular effect.
