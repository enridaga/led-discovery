Can't tell about all the happenings of the evening but the whole thing was an uproarious excitement. The men seemed quite to enjoy it.... Capt. Cowper and Mr O’Neil brought their jolly boys in to give entertainment to the tune of the gramophone and performed a clog dance with great skill, after which Mr O’Neil obliged with a step dance, which was really very well done though he seemed to feel it....

In the evening we had a delightful supper awaiting us when work over and done. Trifles and cold chicken and salad and desserts.... Then we cleared the floor in the anteroom and danced to the gramophone, Matron being one of the keenest. Some of the Sisters looked rather scandalized but Matron went on gaily to the very end and finished up with suggesting a set of Lancers, joining in with great gusto, even discarding her slippers and dancing in stockings. She was altogether most frisky. I can well sympathize with her. Delightful to frolic after rigid army restrictions enduring for so long.
