<p><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;">I am very pleased with production here, and with the reception it was given. The performance went well, and the soloists and conductor deserved the success they enjoyed. I would draw particular attention to the splendid orchestra, who played brilliantly under their conductor Jaroslav Krombholc, of the Prague National Opera. The opera was produced by the Czech Karel Jernek. Although the Vienna production is different from the Moscow one, I was pleased to see that it did still maintain the opera&rsquo;s national character. / The producers were greatly aided by their visit to Moscow to hear <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Katerina Izmailova</em> at the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich- Danchenko Musical Theatre. The whole company rehearsed with great enthusiasm. </span></span></p>
