The following testimony was given by a lady who was visiting a seaside resort on the coast of Essex : — 
" I came down from London a great sinner, with no thought of eternity. I had been living'—as so many do—utterly indifferent to the claims of the Gospel, and ignoring the appeals of God's servants, from whom I have often heard the story of Jesus' love. But the Lord met with me as I was walking along the sea front one evening. I heard the sweet strains of children's voices, and I stood and listened to their song. Nothing I had ever heard charmed me so much. Clearly and distinctly came the words upon my ear, and to my heart :

Jesus is waiting ; oh, come to Him now — 
Waiting to-day, waiting to-day !
