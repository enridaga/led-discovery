<p>My memory, as a ten year old, was seeing Kayung-Wa (sic) Chung perform Beethoven's violin concerto, as a young violinist. I was inspired to go further with my violin playing and also as a result I set myself further aspirations musically as a result of this concert. I have been coming to concerts since age 4 and now at 16, I am really looking forward to the reopening! Also...Carmina Burana by Orff...peformed by BBC singers and the London Philharmonic...Classic times!</p>
