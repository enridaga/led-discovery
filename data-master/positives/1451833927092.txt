<p>[Beatty-Kingston quoting Richard Wagner]</p>
<p>"At Weimar once, during the very&nbsp;day upon which I became certain that my personal&nbsp;safety was endangered " (he was compelled to quit Germany, being under prosecution for political offences),&nbsp;"I saw Liszt conducting a rehearsal of my opera <em>Tannh&auml;user</em>&nbsp;and was wonder-stricken in recognising in him&nbsp;my second self. What I had felt in composing that&nbsp;music, he felt in performing it; what I wanted to&nbsp;express when I wrote it down, he actually expressed in&nbsp;giving it sound."</p>
