<p>My late father, Reginald Hamilton, was cellist (1st or 2nd) in the very first concert given by the RPO, and subsequent concerts. We were so proud of this, I sometimes attended with my mother and sister. I remember he said the artists changing rooms were minute, really cramped! This was later put right. It was such a marvel to see this very new interior, the intriging way the boxes seemed to stick out from the panelled walls. I remember taking note of the carpet design throughout&nbsp; - and I am fortunate to now possess a small piece, a treasure that brings back those early memories.</p>
