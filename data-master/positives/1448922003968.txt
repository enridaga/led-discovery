<p>Great preparations were made for the Festival this year, and it is believed that a better band and chorus were brought together than on any previous occasion.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>In all, one hundred and forty instruments; to which must be added the great organ, one of the most powerful in the world. The vocal chorus consisted of eighty to ninety voices on each part, as soprano, alto, tenor, and bass; in all, about three hundred and thirty or forty voices. It must be understood that these were all real (not merely nominal) singers, capable of sustaining their respective parts. The parts were well balanced, and the chorus blending was admirable, no individual voices being heard. The alto consisted of both female and male voices; yet the men&rsquo;s voices were kept in good subjection, and only once or twice during the four days&rsquo; performance, did they appear severe or hard. The solo singers were the best that could be obtained in Europe[.]</p>
