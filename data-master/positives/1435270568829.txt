Go to see Bridges after tea. After supper I go with them (Tickets from B.B.C. - front row dress circle - dinner jacket - top hat!) to Queen's Hall, B.B.C. Concert. Euryanthe ov. - disgraceful perf. under A. Boult. - wrong in tempi & mood from start to finish (although, notes pretty well played), as was the Eroica at the end - of which I can only stand 3 move. Elina Gerhart sings 4 Strauss Songs, v. well, although her voice is ob. past it. Intonation v. bad in Wiegenlied. Sch√∂nberg conducts his op. 31. variations.* What I could make of it, owing to a skin-of-its-teeth performance, was rather dull, but some good things in it. Meet Sch. in interval. Beth comes back by 11.0.
