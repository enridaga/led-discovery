The reason I'm writing is to say a million thanks to the orchestra for two outstanding performances of the first two Mahler Symphonies.  As a complete Mahler fanatic I go to all Mahler concerts in London.  I am on the Committee of the Gustav Mahler Society UK, and have visited his composing huts.
Last night's performance of the Resurrection Symphony no 2 was quite frankly the best I have ever been to: tears were streaming down my face towards the end and I did not want the applause to stop. From the very first note there was an electrifying atmosphere, and the changes in pace, the sincerity of the playing and the emotions this gave rise to, all this came together to produce a very intense experience.
I paint pictures of Mahler's music and it means a huge amount to me.  After last night I wondered if it was possible to capture on canvas the magnificence I heard at the Festival Hall.  Please will you pass on, if possible, my very very sincere thanks to every member of the orchestra for giving us such a superlative concert.  I was totally 'inhabited' by the resonance of the last last movement.  I still say Mahler is and always be the 'best' genius at composition. No-one compares for experiences in the concert hall....
