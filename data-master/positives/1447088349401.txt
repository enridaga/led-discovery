<p>As a young architectural student, one of the first projects I worked on was the Transport Pavilion at the Festival of Britain and sited alongside the new Festival Hall under construction at that time.&nbsp; I watched with awe the completion of this amazing new concert hall.&nbsp; On Saturday 21st July 1951 the architectural students associations of the Polytechnic and the A.A. held a Concert and Dance at the newly completed Festival Hall to mark the end of a Congress of Architectural Students.&nbsp; Supported by the RIBA, I understand final acoustic arrangements were being tested.&nbsp; It was an amazing and memorable concert with contemporary composers Vaughn Williams, Walton and Britten, conducting their own music.&nbsp; The various conducting styles were very interesting and a lasting memory is Vaughn Williams in a nulging dress suit obviously bought many years before and expecting buttons to fly in all directions at any moment.&nbsp; When the Concert finished we all moved to the foyer where refreshments were being served and almost immediately members of the London Philharmonic took their places on a temporary bandstand and dancing commenced.&nbsp; Polkas and Vienese Waltzes to start but very shortly violins were replaced with saxophones and clarinets and 50's Jazz and dance music took over.&nbsp; A very memorable evening and one my wife and I hold dear, we had just got engaged.</p>
