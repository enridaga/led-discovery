Memories go back to the days of the loud jazz bands of the easy 'nineties [1890's], when we were just starting out with patch-up cornets and trombones, leaky valves on clarinets which were usually minus a key or two, and homemade bass fiddles, and warped guitars. We must have sounded just as lousy as the professional element, but by constant plugging night and day for days, months, and even years, some went on to fame and fortune (also ruin).
