My social life [in Jacksonville, Florida] wasn't anything to scream and holler about. But it wasn't terrible either. Lots of times I stayed home in the evenings with the Thompsons and listened to the radio. I liked that.

The Grand Ole Opry was still a favorite with me, and I also got a kick out of those mystery and FBI shows.
