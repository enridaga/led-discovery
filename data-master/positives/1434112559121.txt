<p>Letter from Bunsen to Julius Schnorr von Carolsfield, London: 28th April, 1851 - I rejoice to see in your case that misfortune and trial better reveal what is in the man, than good fortune ; and that you maintain equanimity in the one case as well as in the other. Who could have believed, dear friend, that there had been in Germany so much wickedness and faithlessness ? Still we will sing the Magnificat, out of which, in the indignation of your honest heart, you quote a suitable verse.</p>
