I went to Manchester for the first performance of ' Faust,' and being anxious to know something about it before the concert took place in the evening I attended the rehearsal. A little incident occurred which revealed to me my father's wonderful accuracy of ear, and which I may be pardoned for repeating. In the second part of ' Faust,' when the hero of the legend meets his doom and is consigned to the 
infernal regions, there occurs an interlude for the orchestra expressive of the exultation felt by the denizens of hell over their latest victim. When I first heard this piece I felt inclined to think my father had given carte blanche to every member of his band to make any noise he liked, provided it was loud and of a horrible nature. 
When it was over, what was my astonishment to hear my father quietly say : ' The second clarinet played an E flat instead of an E natural in the eighth bar. I hope he will take care not to do so at the concert this evening!'
