Freddy Guy was born in Georgia, but he had been in New York most of his life when he joined us in 1925, and he knew Harlem backwards and forwards. He was rather a serious type of fellow, and was always giving us advice, but his guitar was a metronome and the beat was always where it was supposed to be.
