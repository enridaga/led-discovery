Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 22 Sept. 1750 -
Tuesday we dined at Mrs. Forde's, and found the good old lady pretty well. Wednesday, dined at my Mrs. Hamilton's, met by the other, and L. B., and spent the day very agreeably. Miss Hamilton sung very prettily your favorite songs of the Messiah, accompanied by her brother, Mr. Sackville Hamilton, on the violin : she has a sweet-toned voice and good ear, but wants a little management of it.
