During a recent revival of The Beggar's Opera I was asked whether I had seen it before. I had!â€“on February 14, 1853, when a certain John Sims Reeves played the amorous captain. I make no pretence of having been sufficiently precocious to understand the plot, but the scenes, Macheath, Peachum, and Lockit, and the rest of the disreputable crew are distinctly remembered. It is on record that the distinguished tenor was to have been heard during the previous season, but had disappointed an expectant house. On that occasion, although the bill had suddenly to be changed, a crowded audience, in sympathy with the manager, generously accepted the situation and kept their seats.
