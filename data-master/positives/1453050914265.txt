<p>During Hercules' rather pompous Aria... I thought I noticed a merry smile on the Crown&nbsp;Prince's face, and after the performance he said&nbsp;to me : 'You know, when you sang c in alien&nbsp;Zeiten' (for all times), I kept hearing ' in alien&nbsp;Zeitungen'" (in all the newspapers!) He&nbsp;seemed always ready for a good joke.&nbsp;</p>
