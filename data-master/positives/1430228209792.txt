By this time, jazz had become very much identified with the saxophone, and jazz musicians found new ways to express themselves on it. Out of Fletcher Henderson's band came Coleman Hawkins, whose big tone on the tenor saxophone remained the model for the profession until Lester Young appeared with Count Basie's band during 1936. Young's approach and spare tone were quite different, and they were copied by, among many others, Stan Getz, who later did so much to popularize bossa nova, a Brazilian form which set "cool" jazz to samba rhythm. Years later, John Coltrane came to the fore in turn with a searching style that was all his own. On alto saxophone, similarly, there was Johnny Hodges, who played in our band and was widely imitated until Charlie Parker came along with his bop style in the '40s.
