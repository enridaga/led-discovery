<p>This is a series of concerts for the people, at a low charge; the prices being four shillings, two shillings, and one shilling, according to the class of seats. They consist of vocal and instrumental music, but without orchestra. They employ some five or six solo performers, and a choir of about forty-five choristers. Glees and madrigals are sung by the choir, and songs, duets, &amp;c., by the solo voices, with piano forte pieces, violin pieces, or other instruments as it may be convenient to obtain for the different concerts. I attended the second of the series on Thursday last. The large Exeter Hall was full of people, who seemed to be much delighted with the music; indeed I thought that there was more warmth of approval exhibited there than we usually see at the best concerts with us. The solo performers were Miss Pyne, Miss Louisa Pyne, Miss Binckes, Mr. Swift, (a new tenor,) Herr Jonghmans, Mr. Cotton, and Mr. Whitworth. Miss Goddard played serenade (Don Pasquale), by Thalberg, and also an andante and rondo capricioso by Mendelssohn, on the piano forte, and Mr. Richardson played an air with variations on the flute. Miss Binckes has a very fine voice, and sung to the great acceptance of the audience, and Miss Louisa Pyne sung quite a difficult aria by Rode, which called forth a most enthusiastic encore. The pieces for full choir were performed without accompaniment, not even the piano forte being played; and although I have heard a better chorus at home, yet this was truly good. The concert was conducted by Mr. T. H. Severn. The programme contained the music to the National Anthem, printed in full in four parts, and the whole audience joined in this the closing chorus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God save our gracious Queen,</p>
<p>Long may Victoria reign;</p>
<p>God save the Queen!</p>
<p>Send her victorious,</p>
<p>Happy and glorious,</p>
<p>Long to reign over us,</p>
<p>God save the Queen!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"O Lord our God arise,</p>
<p>Scatter her enemies,</p>
<p>And make them fall.</p>
<p>Confound their politics,</p>
<p>Frustrate their knavish tricks,</p>
<p>On Thee our hopes we fix,</p>
<p>God save us all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Thy choicest gifts in store&nbsp;</p>
<p>On her be pleased to pour,</p>
<p>Long may she reign;</p>
<p>May she defend our laws,</p>
<p>And ever give us cause,</p>
<p>To sing with heart and voice,</p>
<p>God save the Queen!</p>
