We turned up unexpectedly at this guy’s house one day, in around the mid-seventies. We surprised him while he was listening to an Engelbert Humperdinck record on his parent’s stereo! It took him a year or so to live this down and it was something we used to bring up at odd moments whenever we were discussing music. He was never allowed to forget it.
