I was indebted to ... [Major Brackenbury] for my introduction to Mrs. Salmon, when she had just made her début as a singer at the oratorios in Covent-Garden theatre. I had heard her the previous evening with great delight, and inquired how it was that the best of Handel’s songs had been given to Miss Stephens: she informed me that Mr. Harris, the proprietor of the theatre, had stipulated with the director, that Miss Stephens should have the choice of the songs, as being the first singer in England. “Of course,” Mrs. Salmon said, “I am obliged to take up with what Miss Stephens pleases to reject." “Well, madam,” replied I, “you have genius enough to give an interest to anything you sing; and so long as you have an opportunity of coming before the public, your auditors will place you in your proper rank and station.” This unjust conduct was the making of her; for a second-rate song of Handel’s, 'From mighty kings,' being given to her, she so embellished and improved it by her facility of voice, that, every time introduced, it became the gem of the performance. She soon passed over the head of her rival, and ever afterwards remained the prima donna of England.
