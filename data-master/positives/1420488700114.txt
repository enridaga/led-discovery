Yet Sargent could sometimes dig in his heels with soloists, and at times he came unstuck in so doing. One such occasion was during a recording of the policeman's song from The Pirates of Penzance with Owen Brannigan. Owen had sung the part often and had his own very 'broad' version of the character, including one line which grated upon Sargent' ears as not being worthy of the many Savoy Opera performances he had directed: 'the po-liceman's lot is not a nappy one' was how Brannie thought it should go. Sargent insisted upon a much more refined and standard BBC/Oxford version, to Owen's obvious displeasure. He got it, of course, as conductors always do; but the broad version had already been recorded, and on the final record you can heard [sic] them both as verses one and two.
