We all had supper together after the performance and were in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>joiliest of moods. Tamagno had a slight cold on <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the chest, but protested that it made no difference <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>whatever in the singing quality of his head tones. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Catarrh in the nose, he said, was fatal, but a chest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>cold made not the least difference to him. Upon this, Lassalle offered to wager that he could sing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>higher with his falsetto than Tamagno with his voce di petto. The challenge was accepted, and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>forthwith the two began a vocal duel the like of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>which I am certain I shall never hear again. Out came Tamagno's A's and B flats, as quickly <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>responded to with the falsetto equivalents from <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Lassalle&rsquo;s sturdy throat. Then the Italian went "one better"; and the Frenchman, in order, as he <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>said, to help himself up the scale, mounted his chair and emitted the B natural; whereupon Tamagno also stood upon his chair and brought out <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>not only a high C, but a ringing D flat. Lassalle was now for mounting the table, but, this being <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;ruled out" as an unfair advantage over a less athletic opponent, he proceeded to get the neces sary notes from the eminence of his chair, amid <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>terrific applause from the rest of the company. Tamagno now made a bold dash for a D natural,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>but did not quite succeed; and as Lassalle fared no better, we pronounced the result a &ldquo;dead heat.&rdquo; Which, at that somewhat advanced hour of the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>night, was perhaps rather a blessing for the neighboring occupants of the hotel.</span></p>
