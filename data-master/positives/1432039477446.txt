In 1876, when we returned to Chicago to work, I was entertained at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Spafford for a number of weeks. During that time Mr. Spafford wrote the hynm, " It is well with my soul," in commemoration of the death of his children. P. P. Bliss composed the music, and sang it for the first time at a meeting in Farwell Hall. The comforting fact in connexion with this incident was that in one of our small meetings in North Chicago, a short time prior to their sailing for Europe, the children had been converted.
