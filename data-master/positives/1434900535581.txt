Go straight to Sadler's Wells, where I have a bit of a meal (meeting Kenworthy - late of Holt) & meet Bridges (up in town for a few days) and go to Ballet at 8.0. V. good Ballet with Anton Dolin & Markova etc. [Britten leaves a long gap here] by Gretry,* rather uninteresting. Manhattan Serenade, ** solo by Dolin - marvellous. Poor music by Geoffrey Toye in a very amusing "Douanes" with Dolin & Ninette de Valois.*** Sylphides**** to end with. Back with Bridges to supper.
