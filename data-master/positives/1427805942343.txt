<p>Around this time--when I was out [touring] as a single--I happened to be in Kansas City for a week or so between gigs. I had some spare time to go out looking for sessions. I met up with Miles Davis. He was playing a club three blocks down from my hotel, and he invited me to sit in. We jammed all night long. Miles turned out to be a nice cat, and I liked listening to his growling, crackling voice. Course I'd always loved the way he played trumpet. For the period, he was into very modern music, and that suited me fine.</p>
