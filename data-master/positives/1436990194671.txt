<pre>Mrs. Billington returned to England this season, after an absence of several <br />years, and was engaged at Drury Lane and Covent Garden, to perform a certain <br />number of nights at each theatre. At both she appeared in Mandane, in <br />"Artaxerxes;" she went through all her operatical characters, in all of which I <br />performed with her. She was received with rapturous applause, and on each night <br />drew crowded houses.
