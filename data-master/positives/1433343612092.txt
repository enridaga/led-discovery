<p>On the way to the graveyard they all walked slowly, following the cornet player. The cornet player was the boss. Sometimes it took them four hours to get to the cemetery. All the way they just swayed to the music and moaned. At the graveside they chanted questions like "Did he ramble?", "Did he gamble?" or "Did he lead a good life until the police shot him down on St James Street?". Then after the body was buried, they'd go back to town and all the way they'd swing. They just pulled the instruments apart. They played the hottest music in the world.</p>
