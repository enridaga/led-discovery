Once a year at the Fairmont Hotel, Anker’s budding virtuosi gave a concert, half display, half competition, to their friends and relations. My turn came in November 1921, when I played a little piece called “Remembrance” and was placed second, to my slight chagrin. I have not the world’s best memory for names, but I recall my successful rival to this day, a girl of twelve called Sarah Kreindler, whose performance of Sarasate’s “Gypsy Airs” justly merited first place.
