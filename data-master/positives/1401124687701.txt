Two memories! Two firsts! One, my first ever classical music concert in the early 50s. I went in school uniform with a school friend (Michael Bowen - not seen him since 1958!) to listen to Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. I was over-whelmed by sounds of a full orchestra live for the first time. 78 rpm records and MW radio could not compete. Magic! Two, my first ever concert by a US jazz group - the Modern Jazz Quartet - in 1958 or 1959. I bought 7s6d (371/2p) tickets for myself and some friends. We were stunned to find ourselves ushered to seats on the platform, and I was sat 3 or 4 metres from John Lewis the pianist. Two hours I have never forgotten. Wonderful. I've loved both genres of music ever since.
