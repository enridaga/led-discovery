Three Beautiful Birds of Paradise... Trois Beaux Oiseaux du paradis. I first heard it at age sixteen. Looking for a practice room (one of Northwestern's gray brothel-like cubicles), I became aware of magic from behind a door. I had to go in. There sat a soprano, deciphering at the keyboard, squeaking prettily. "But what is it?" "Why it's from Ravel's Trois Chansons and all the mezzos in school are auditioning tomorrow for the solo in the second one." So we went through it together - and I was floored! The lady, pale and plain, a Public School Music Major on the verge of donating uninspired instruction to untalented children... - what right she to this wonder" I later stole a library copy and have been on my knees ever since (take that as you will); it was mine. Such moments that break the heart also open the ears; how could I not have dreamed of France! People don't think like this anymore; or if they try, the don't succeed. I won't believe that Ravel toiled to make that one come out: it just was, born from the words.
