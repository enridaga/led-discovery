I attended with a friend the dazzling performance produced by your orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall last Thursday when they held us willingly captive by their playing of Mahler's Symphony No 2. Being a man of no special talent, apart from having the ability to be thrilled by those who do, it would give me great pleasure to give a wee donation; say Â£10 a month to be paid to you by bankers order which would come to just over a hundred pounds a year. It's really quite a paltry, sum though I would give more if
could.
