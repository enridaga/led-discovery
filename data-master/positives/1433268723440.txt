Altogether, conditions were not very different from those I found at the house of Nadine Auer, Leopold Auer’s daughter, who had invited me to hear a young, up-and-coming violinist. I heard a fabulously gifted young man, who seemed diffident about his impending first trip across the borders to Berlin. Reassuring him enthusiastically, I told him that “Evropa” (as the Russians call all countries beyond their frontier to the west) was waiting for artists of his stamp. It turned out that America was, too! The young man was Nathan Milstein, and he was accompanied on the piano by Vladimir Horowitz’s sister.
