<p>I have many wonderful memories which is why I have supported your appeal. However, the one that came most vividly to mind was when my husband and I took our son to his first "grown up" concert. My husband is a jazz fan and was keen to introduce Daniel so we went to see what was I think their last concert at the venue - The Modern Jazz Quartet - that evening remains a heady mixture of Dan's excitement over the music, his face and just his feeling aged 12/13 that he had moved on. I so look forward to making more memories!</p>
