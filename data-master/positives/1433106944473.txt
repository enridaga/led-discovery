<p>On entering the churchyard, at Grantham, I was gratified on hearing the tones of the organ. To enjoy the true effect of this noble instrument, you should never be within view of it. I presently made my way into the organ loft, where I found a rough fellow, like a Cyclops, working away, at a cramped extemporaneous fugue. When he concluded, I bowed a nod of approbation. He got up, and putting a quid of tobacco into his mouth, asked me to sit down and try the instrument. This I declined, and pressed him to give me another fugue. He was pleased, and instantly knocked out a chromatic one, with all the fury of a Polyphemus. I observed it was a fine organ, upon the full church scale.</p>
