This memory spans four decades and four generations. My grandfather always had the same box - on the Red Side - at the Festival Hall, and in the 1970s when I was a teenager he used to take me to concerts. At first I would sit bored and fidgety, but he persevered and was rewarded by my growing love for music. I especially remember during the late 1980s and early 1990s we managed together to see all of the Klaus Tennstedt conducted Mahler Symphonies. We were at the performance of the 5th that was recorded and released by EMI, and whenever I listen to it I am reminded of my grandfather. Shortly before the RFH closed for refurbishment in 2005 I took my son to see Angela Hewitt play Bach. We were in the same box as always, and I was overjoyed to see this young boy utterly captivated  by the music. I am looking forward to once again being a frequent visitor when the RFH re-opens.
