Horowitz played the Bach-Busoni C Major Toccata with some success, because it was a loud piece. Avraamov was horrified by the whole evening: the proletariat did not understand Bach! I think that in those days even the bourgeoisie did not appreciate Bach very much. Even the “decent” public preferred Sarasate. That was impressive music; Bach didn’t have a chance.
