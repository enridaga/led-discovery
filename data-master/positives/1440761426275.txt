<p>Presently the bells began to ring and rang for quarter of an hour. I thought how like the changes were to the Athanisian Creed, and how the systems of the school-men are now to us like a peal of bells rung in a winter's night. They finished ringing off two by two, a major third, a minor third to the dominant ( a beautiful bell with an overtone like a flute , so round) a tone; then the Aâ™­bell went on alone, saying over and over again - 'Deum, Deum'. The organ began to play and the Salvation Band to flourish. It made a nice counterpoint on a ground.</p>
