Rome, 30 August, 1825. - On Charles's birthday, the 25th, we had delightful weather, the sky being clear, the sun bright, and the air delicious.... At dinner we were fourteen in number, besides children. Before dinner, some favourite hymns of Charles's were sung, arranged for four voices, which had been composed (by Reisiger) and practised by the singers without Charles's knowledge, and were therefore an agreeable surprise to him.
