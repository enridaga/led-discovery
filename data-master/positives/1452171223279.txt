<p>As far as the music was concerned I specially remember the touching and beautiful way Mr. Maitland sang my setting of Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Lead, kindly Light.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think any one could have interpreted either words or music to greater perfection, and I shall never forget the infinite pains he took with even the tiniest detail of the song whilst we studied it together.</p>
