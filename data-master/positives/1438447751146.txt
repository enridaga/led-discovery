Patti in aid of the local charities. The <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>journey each way assumed the character of a triumphal progress, the entire route from the station <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to the concert-hall being lined by dense crowds. It <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was touching to witness the eagerness of the humble folk&mdash; men, women, and children&mdash; to catch a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>glimpse of the illustrious vocalist, who once every <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>year came from her mountain home to aid the institution that succored their needy and suffering. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The concert itself was memorable because on this <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>occasion, for the first time in her life, the famous <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>songstress delivered as an encore the soul-stirring <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>strains of the Welsh national air, ''Land of my <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Fathers&rdquo; ; and when, at her request, her enthusiastic auditors joined in the chorus, the effect was <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>simply electrifying. </span></p>
