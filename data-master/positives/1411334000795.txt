When Mr. Hutchinson was in residence I visited him, and spent a pleasant week with the literati of that place [Southwell]. At the residentiary we had quartetts in the morning, and regular concerts in the evening, to which the gentry of the place were invited. Our first violin was a Captain Marsh, of the navy, who was so deaf that he could not hear any instrument but his own, yet was so steady in his time that we had no difficulty in accompanying him. This gentleman was brother to William Marsh, Esq., of Chichester, a well-known composer and astronomer. For further particulars of this untaught genius, see a Life of him in the Dictionary of Musicians. In our parties we had the arch-vicar, the Rev. Mr. Becher, an old acquaintance of the composer Webbe, who wrote some of his best glees in his house. Mr. Thompson, a vicar-choral of the cathedral, and Mr. Heathcot, the organist, essentially contributed to the entertainments of the evening.
