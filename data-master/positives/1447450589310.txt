<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">He set the music up on the stand, and began his attack.&nbsp; To my ear, the result was a confusion of sound most unpleasing.&nbsp; It was so to him, for he stopped, frowned more savagely than before, and made a fresh start.&nbsp; He got very little further before breaking down.&nbsp; But he would not be defeated.&nbsp; Again and again he started, and at last a smile of pleasure lit his face.&nbsp; He turned to me and said, &ldquo;I know!&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t the same as all that!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he nodded contemptuously at the contents of the bamboo stand, which contained, no doubt, Sidney Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tarantella&rsquo; somewhere in the three- or four-inch pile stored on-end in the dark corner.</p>
