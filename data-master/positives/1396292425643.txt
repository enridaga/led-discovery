Having been put into a suit of nankeen, which had a smart appearance, Dr. Arnold, our near neighbour, requested to have my clothes tried on his son, who was of the same age. For this purpose I was carried in the morning to the doctorâ€™s house, stripped, and put into bed to the historian, Mrs. Macauley.  To be thus unceremoniously denuded, made me very indignant; to pacify me they set a-going the chimes of a musical clock which stood by the bedside. I was greatly delighted, and so reconciled to my situation, that it was with difficulty I could be taken away; and I consider this incident to have first awakened my attention to the beauty of musical sounds.
