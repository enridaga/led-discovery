Letter from Mrs. Delany ro Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 20 Oct., 1750 -
I am very desirous of seeing this enchanted place, but it lies entirely out of my way. Tuesday I staid at home, worked hard in the morning, and had no interruptions—that was comfortable. Wednesday, went in the evening to Dublin to the Philharmonic concert. We made four visits on our way to the concert—Lady Roos, Mrs. Fitzmorris, Lady Arabella Denny (found her at home) and Lady Knapton, (Lady Vesey that was), then called in Anne Street, drank tea with my Mrs. Hamilton, and carried her and her daughter Anne with us to the concert.
