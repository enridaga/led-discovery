As we were also now & then join'd by some other amateurs we had sometimes very respectable concerts, both at Weovill & at Mr Wafers [sic], which I believe nobody enjoyed more than I did or was more disappointed at any Friday or Saturday evening passing off without a concert, which was sometimes the case, particularly on Saturdays, as I never went to Mr Wafers but on his sending to let me know some one at least of our performers was come, as the Phillips's did not attend his concerts & those from the other side of the water were frequently prevented from coming over by windy weather, of which Mr Clarke in particular was much afraid... As to Mr Phillips's concerts, Mr Wafer & I were sufficient of ourselves with the family (if nobody else came) to play Corelli, Humphry or Boyce's sonatas etc. w'ch we all enjoy'd & were even now & then glad to be thus left to ourselves & so escape Bach & Abel's symphonies.
