<p>There were night clubs with all of that good music that came from the horns of the great King Joe Oliver (my, my whatta man)... How he used to blow that cornet of his down in Storyville for Pete Lala... I was just a youngster who loved that horn of King Oliver's... I would delight in delivering an order of stone coal to the prostitute who used to hustle her crib right next to Pete Lala's cabaret... Just so's I could hear King Oliver play... I was too young to go into Pete Lala's at the time... And I'd just stand there in that lady's crib listening to King Oliver... And I'm all in a daze&hellip; That was the only way we kids could go into The District--I mean Storyville... I'd just stand there listening to King Oliver beat out one of those good ol' good-ones like&nbsp;<em>Panama</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>High Society</em>. My whatta punch that man had... And could he shout a tune [...] I was being inspired by&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;King Oliver and his orchestra&hellip; So I'd go home very pleased and happy that I did at least hear my idol blow at least a couple of numbers that really&nbsp;<em>gassed</em>&nbsp;me no end....</p>
