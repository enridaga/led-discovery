Letter from Bunsen to Schnorr von Carolsfield, Rome: 8th November, 1828
... I have had a fortnight full of work and of pleasure during the stay of the Crown Prince of Prussia, who has viewed Rome with indescribable enthusiasm, and with a knowing and intelligent eye.
A general German Exhibition was arranged in the hall of Palazzo Caffarelli, to which forty artists (twenty-five of whom were Prussians) united to contribute ; and, although it had not been made a matter of previous preparation, it formed a fine whole, and met with universal approbation. Munich met the taste of the Prince in many ways : he is better satisfied than I am with the building of the Glyptothek, the paintings in which delighted him, as did here those of the
Villa Massimo. Our Capitoline Chapel, now possessed of an organist and leader (Georg) and an efficient band of singers, was thoroughly satisfactory to him.
