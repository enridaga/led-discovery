A party of policemen had gathered in a drawingroom in the West End of London. One was there who had been persuaded by his Christian comrades to attend for the first time a meeting of The Christian Policemen's Association. He went unwillingly and rather late, and did not expect to care for the meeting. But soon after he had entered the room a lady, Miss Beauchamp, sang " Take me as I am " as a solo. The repeated refrain set him thinking. " As I am ! " He had led a rough life, first as a bluejacket and then as a policeman. He could not well be more wretched and miserable than he was that night, with a load of sins upon him and a dark, dreary future to look forward to. He had never thought that Jesus would take him as he was. He had always thought that he must be much better first, and had often tried to make himself better ; but it had been a miserable failure. Now the words, " Take me as I am," sounded over and over again in his ears, and in his heart he repeated them, " Lord, take me as I am." He left before the end of the meeting, and so it was not until the following month that his friends heard of the great change that had come over him.
