One day Jackie was in the kitchen at home with Mum who was ironing. The wireless was on and Children’s Hour was presenting a programme about the instruments of the orchestra. Mum was moving the iron in time to the music and Jackie was swaying from side to side in time with Mum’s strokes. The flute, oboe and clarinet all had their turn, followed by the violins. As the sound of a cello filled the room, Jackie became completely still and attentive. She listened transfixed until the end, leapt up, clutched Mum’s leg and said, ‘Mummy, I want to make that sound.’
