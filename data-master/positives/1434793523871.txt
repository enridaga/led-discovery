<p>Miss Greatorex, organist of St. Martin's, Leicester, presided at one of the finest organs in this country, and admirably displayed its powers. As a performer she was only exceeded by her brother, who, when he came to Leicester, never omitted to visit this instrument. I was one of a few friends regularly invited to the church to hear him play. His style was massive ; he was like Briareus, with a hundred hands, grasping so many keys at once, that surges of sound rolled from the instrument in awful grandeur.</p>
