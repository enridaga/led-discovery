Good news this morning. French at Mülhausen enthusiastically received by entire population. Germans driven off at the point of the bayonet and pursued by French cavalry… I went to the American church, which was crowded. They sang splendidly the hymn “O God of Battles!” which rather upset me. Of course all one’s nerves are on end.
