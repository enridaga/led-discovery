<p>Early breakfast with Mum &amp; catch 8.30 to town - where I go straight to Bridges, where I have lunch with Mr. &amp; Mrs, Miss Fass, Mrs. L. Sutton &amp; John. After that we all go to a concert at the Albert Hall - Royal Choral Soc. where among other things F.B. conducts quite a good show (all considered) of his sincere &amp; touchingly beautiful Prayer.* Malcolm Sargent conducts a virile (but not much more) perf. of Walton's Belshazzar's Feast - which seems to wear worse &amp; worse - the 2nd half particularly being threadbare. Dyson's In honour of the City wasn't worth doing - being aenemic both in material &amp; craftsmanship.**</p>
