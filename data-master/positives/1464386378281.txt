<p>The evening saw the opening of Diaghilev's season and the premiere of&nbsp;<em>Z&eacute;phyr</em>. It was preceded by&nbsp;<em>Pulcinella</em>, which I heard with great pleasure - most skilfully and charmingly done. Then&nbsp;<em>Z&eacute;phyr</em>, and with it some disappointment: wan and often clumsy orchestration, not nearly as effective as it sounded on the piano. Braque's settings were flabby, and Kokhno's libretto pointless. Only in the finale, when the nymphs fan out lying on their backs around Boreas and invite him to give himself to them, did the audience get much in the way of pleasure. The success was lukewarm. Dukelsky came out once to take a bow, anxiety written endearingly on his brow. To sum up, it was rather a disappointment. Nevertheless, the ballet could be re-orchestrated and the settings re-designed, because purely as music it is one of the most significant events of the season.</p>
