When revived for the opening of the season, on the 9th of March 1844, it was supported again by Madame Persiani; Corelli, the new tenor, appearing in the part originally sustained by Conti. Persiani, though now somewhat on the wane, was one of the favourites of the day. Corelli was generally pronounced a pleasant tenor, fitted for the Nemorinos of the stage, and so far an acquisition. But "Adelia," although "backed up" by one of the most successful choreographic displays ever witnessed on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre, would not, could not attract. It lingered on for a few nights, when it was deemed advisable to bring out the promised opera of "Zampa," even without Fornasari.</span></p>
