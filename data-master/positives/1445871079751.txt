<p>Mr Ruscombe Poole borrowed the Registers to look for Rich who was ancestor of a man in Cornwall of that name who hopes to gain some property.&nbsp; This Rich, I understand, was the brother to the famous Harlequin Rich some years ago who it seems came from Overstowey.&nbsp; Rode to Asholt.&nbsp; There was a burial, a relation of our Rich. The Church was very full, Mr and Mrs Blake at Church and several from Overstowey and some famous singing. The little Asholt Clerk had a seat by himself and lifted up his eyebrows and beat time like anything but poor man he could not be heard and if he was it was not worth hearing. I believe there are more coxcombs in singing than in any other art. If a man has any folly about him he is sure to show it when he sings or is in love.</p>
