<p>In June the exercise was performed in the Music Room at Oxford. Long before the arrival of the Vice- Chancellor the room was crowded to excess, and numbers were obliged to return without being able even to get near the door. Dr. Stephen Elvey, his brother, conducted in the magnificent crimson and white robes presented to him by his pupils when he took his doctor's degree. The principal vocal parts were sung by members of the St. George's choir, and the chorus was given in splendid style by the choristers of New College, the lay-clerks of the Cathedral, and members of the Sacred Harmonic Society.</p>
