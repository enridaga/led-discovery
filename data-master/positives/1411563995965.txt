<p>An LPO concert under Klaus Tennstedt - Mahler 6th Symphony. A searing performance - a young man in the row in front of me weeping thro' the slow movement, and a lady sitting behind him passing tissues over his shoulder! And at the end a total silence that seemed to go on for minutes. Then the applause began - and went up and up in volume and lasted till our hands were too sore for more. Thank goodness the performance was recorded to CD.</p>
