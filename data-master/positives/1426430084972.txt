In the twenties the only chamber music considered suitable for high-class music clubs was, of course, strings. Wind music was looked upon as rather low so I felt I had made something of a breakthrough when I persuaded the Wimbledon Music Club in 1929 to listen to and enjoy the Mozart Quintet for piano and four wind. The bassoonist was Jason Lewkowitch who subsequently became the contra-bassoonist for the London Philharmonic Orchestra when Beecham formed it in 1932.
