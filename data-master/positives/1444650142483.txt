<p>1968/9? The most memorable concert (perhaps I was more easily pleased at age 16/17) was Georg Szell conducting the Eroica Symphony with Sir Clifford Curzon playing a Mozart concerto in the first half (was it D Minor, C Minor or A Minor K488?, one of my favourites anyway.)&nbsp; I also remember late 60s Karl Richter conducting St John Passion with Ernst Haffliger as evangelist and a large orchestra.&nbsp; Richter directed from the harpsicord.&nbsp; Saddest was Britten's memorial concert (1976).</p>
