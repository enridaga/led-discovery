[Paganini] invited me to visit him, an invitation I accepted most eagerly. I went 
often, but it would be difficult to relate a single conversation we had together. He sat there, taciturn, rigid, hardly ever moving a muscle of his face, and I sat spellbound, a shudder running through me whenever his uncanny eyes fell upon me. He made me 
play to him often, mostly by pointing with his bony hand to the piano without speaking, and I could only guess from his repeating the ceremony that he did 
not dislike it, for never a word of encouragement fell from his lips.
