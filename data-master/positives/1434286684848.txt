After dinner I go with Barbara to R.C.M. to operas (sitting with Mrs. Bridge & Miss Fass) - Christmas Rose & Blue Peter (Armstrong Gibbs).* The performance vocally quite good (Miriam excellent)** orchestrally bad. C. Rose may not be an excellent opera from the stage point of view, but when there is little action the music is always sublime - & that is O.K. for me! the Blue Peter was an amusing little thing - merely Musical Comedy - clever in its way - but as different as anything from the adorable C. Rose
