Lesson with Benjamin at 2.40. Meet an Italian (?) Violin Scholar at College and arrange to practise duets with him. See Mabel Ritchie, also, & she gives me her address. I listen to B.B.C concert on Miss Prior's wireless. First half (Schuman, Manfred ov. - marvellous work - Beethoven 4th concerto (Beautifully played by Backhaus)) does not come through v. well. 2nd Half - Planets. These works arn't very much to my taste, but they are v. fine & clever. Jupiter has some good tunes; Mars v. striking. Altogether, too much, harp, celesta, Bells etc. Beginning of Saturn & end of Neptune v. beautiful. Uranus great fun. I suppose they were well played.
