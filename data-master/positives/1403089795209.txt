I went the next night to the same theatre, and saw the first representation of the grand serious opera of Œdipe à Colon; the music by Sachini was delightful and enchanting. I there heard, for the first time, the celebrated bass singer Cheron, who played the part of Œdipe and sang it in a delightful style; it was quite different from the performance of the night before, indeed I could scarcely imagine myself in the same theatre. I saw, too, the opera of Phedra, and had great pleasure in seeing Madame Auberti perform the part of Phedra; she was a great actress, and when she sang in demi voice, was quite charming. This unfortunate lady and accomplished actress subsequently married, and with her husband was robbed and murdered by their servant when in England. 

     In this opera I felt much gratified by hearing Monsieur Laisse, possessing a fine baritone voice, with much taste and expression; but his greatest praise, in my opinion, is that he was very unlike a French singer.
