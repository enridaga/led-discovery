Yesterday I went to the opening of the concert season, where I heard Prokofiev’s 'Zdravitsa' and his Classical Symphony. The second half of the concert was Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Unfortunately the whole programme (conducted by Yevgeny Svetlanov) was rather indifferently done, and afforded me little pleasure.
