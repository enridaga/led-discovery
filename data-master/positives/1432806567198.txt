Her Majesty wanted to hear me play the organ (there is an excellent one in the chapel at Windsor) , and then the piano. Finally, I had the honor of accompanying the Princess as she sang the aria from Etienne Marcel. Her Royal Highness sang with great clearness and distinctness, but it was the first time she had sung before her august mother and she was frightened almost to death.
