I don’t go out in the morning, because of beastly weather cold & fog, & so I do my writing & practising in the drawing [room] (in spite of beastly pft). Go to Queen’s Hall to hear R.A.M. Students (under Henry Wood) do Franck’s Beatitudes, in afternoon at 2.30. Sit pt. time with May (Comp. student at R.C.M.) who gave me the ticket. It is a poor work in comp. with Symph. Var, Symphony & Les Djinns etc. partly because of the inane words. Competant performance. Work in evening. – Variations.
