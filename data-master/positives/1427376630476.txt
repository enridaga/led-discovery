<p>My master introduced me to the directors of the different theatres, and I had the <em>entr&eacute;e</em> of them all.</p>
<p>At San Carlo's are performed grand serious operas, (the other three theatres are for the opera buffa,) the first I saw there was Metastasis Olim-piade, the music by Metzlevisic, a German of great musical celebrity. I thought it very fine, and the performance exquisite.</p>
<p>The celebrated Marchesi, the first soprano, performed the part of Megacle ; his expression, feeling, and execution in the beautiful aria, " Se cerca se dice l'amico dov'e," were beyond all praise. Ansani, then the finest tenor voice in Europe, was there; and Macherini his wife, was the principal female singer ; she had a very sweet voice, but small, and of limited compass ; the Neapolitans called her " La cantante con la parruca," from her wearing a wig, in consequence of her head being shaved during illness, previous to her engagement ; but they liked her in spite of her wig !</p>
