<p>In his chamber music Mozart fascinates me by his purity and distinction of style and his exquisite handling of the parts. Here, too, there are things that bring tears to our eyes. I shall mention only the adagio of the G-minor String Quintet. No one else has ever known how to interpret so beautifully and exquisitely in music the feeling of resignation and inconsolable sorrow. Every time Laub played the adagio I had to hide in the farthest corner of the concert-room so that others would not see how much this music affected me.</p>
