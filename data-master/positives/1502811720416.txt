<p>[...] I sought to hide myself no more, but wanted to pour out my soul to the Lord and to show him all of my trouble. I wanted to weep my life away at the Saviour's feet, to wash his feet with tears, and to kiss his feet.</p>
<p>But my heart still remained hard till the next day which was Sunday. I came to the Foundery in the morning and the hymn and the preaching seemed to me, directed immediately to me. They was to my soul as healing medicines. And at the chapel, all the service my heart was poured out before the Lord. It was full and ready to break, and particularly at the Lord's table. Just as I came to it, you gave out a hymn which expressed God's mercies and deliverances. It was so suitable to me it reached my very heart. All that day I thought I could desire no greater happiness than to mourn and weep continually.&nbsp;</p>
