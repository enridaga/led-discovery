...I was elected on to the Mess Committee and also put in charge of the Entertainment Committee... 
   In the Entertainment line, I was kept busy with the band concerts that were to be given in Kinsale and at the Palace Theatre, Cork. In these two concerts we made about £120 which went to the Regimental War Fund for assisting men in the Regiment after the war.
    I also got up weekly concerts which were given by the King’s Jesters, the KOYLI Pierrots, The Smart Set Pierrots and the Officers.
