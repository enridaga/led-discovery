<p>I was often surprised both by the peculiarities of the composer's genius and his original instrumentation; on the whole, however, I still feel as I did after hearing 'Lohengrin.' There are too many recitatives, too much that is fragmentary, in fact monotony, the result is shapelessness. In saying this I bear in mind passages full of genius and surprising effects; but heart and soul are not warmed by being so overloaded with passionate music.</p>
