I go to Amb. Th. at 8.45 - ticket paid for by Miss Fass - to see Uday Shan-Kar & his Hindu dances (inc. Simkie & Robindra - quite young) & musicians (inc Vishnu Dass - marvellous drummer & Timir Bewan).* I haven't seen anything for ages which has thrilled me more. Marvellously intellectual & perfectly wrought dancing. Finest I have yet seen Music, full of variety, rhythmically & tonally. one perfect creation of Shan-kar - an ecstatic dance. Tandava Nrittya was a longer ballet with a very exciting fight.**
