I have not yet told you of the music. It was a 'concerto di musica antica' with the old instruments - arpsicordo, viola d'amore e violino, and the viola tenore. and everyone was interested but I cannot say charmed by the sounds produced by these strange forgotten instruments. The harpsichord resembled the spinet of our grandmothers and dearly drove us all mad with its tinkling tones. The Signora Dolmetsch played a fugue in re minore and it never changed tone but stuck at the re minore for about half an hour. Can you imagine anything more disastrous to our nerves? I wanted to tinkly, winkly winkle a bell et j'ai demande mon dieu de pousser un cri mais il ne me l'a pas permis! But the sight of rows and rows of fashionable bonnets and the consciousness that I had been there before and the consciousness that I had a posh hat on kept me as quiet as a mouse.
