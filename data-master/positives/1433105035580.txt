<p>The work of Dr. Croft, entitled <em>Musica Sacra</em>, was the first folio music-book engraved in this country, and it laid the foundation of good music in the choir of the Great Meeting, Leicester [...] As the anthems of these masters could not be well performed without an organ, my father prevailed upon the Puritan heads of the congregation to concede some of their rigid opinions, and to allow the use of a bass viol to support the voices in the performance of these divine compositions. This was the first instrument of its kind introduced into a dissenting meeting house, and was, for a time, censured as approaching too near the ceremonies of the Church.</p>
