<p>Once in the year, on New Year's night, this performance was varied at 12 o'clock midnight. A chorus, principally of children, accompanied the watchman through the streets, and after the three notes of the horn, sang with him this verse : Das alte Jahr vergangen ist ; Wir danken dir, Herr Jesu Christ, Dass du uns in so mancher Gefahr So gnadiglich behutet dies Jahr. The tune was one of the fine Lutheran chorales, but much embroidered.The effect of the clear children's voices through the stillness of the night being heard faintly in the distance at first and gradually drawing nearer and nearer was overpowering to me, and made all my nerves tingle. I always insisted upon being led to the open window when the small singing crowd passed our house, and then I could admire the watchman with his lantern, look at him with deep- felt gratitude, and envy the children who were allowed to accompany and sing with him.</p>
