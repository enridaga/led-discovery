I had booked a date with Muzak to do some transcriptions with Fats and his Rhythm. As we did three shows daily at the the Loew's State Theatre [across the street from Muzak] we had to sandwich this recording session in-between our stage work…

Once in the studio we lost no time… Everyone was keyed up and in the proper frame of mind for musical stimulation--and the panic was soon on. The boys played like there was no tomorrow. They knew all the tunes and the masters piled up at a truly amazing rate. With the next show ahead Fats had to keep up a terrific pace but with all the drive there was always that feeling of relaxation, of Fats having fun… When Gene Sedric would come up for a solo Fats' booming voice would urge him to greater effort with, "Get on yo feet Baby Bear, and earn yo salary." Or to Slick Jones who would be frantically chewing a wad of gum, "Gimme some skin, man gimme some skin!" And as the pace became more torrid and the joint really began to rock, Fats would scream to Buggs Hamilton, "Ah send me, send me… SEND ME… YEAH!" And Buggsy's trumpet would soar to the clouds and do fine things under the spell of the Waller drive. Yes, it was happy music and it made for a joyous day not only for those who made the music but for us in the control room who were lucky enough to be in on the session. 

The date was over for Fats and his Rhythm with a grand total of twelve sides recorded.
