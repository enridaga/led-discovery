<p>With what glee did I mount the harvest waggon for the fun of jolting over the rugged roads, to the wheat field [...] The day's toil over, we hastened home for the harvest supper [...] The gingered ale went merrily round. Joe, who was a good singer, was called upon to entertain the company. Seeing them tippling a little too fast, he admonished them in the following song:</p>
<p><em>Beware of swallowing too much ale ; The more you drink, The worse you think ; Perchance your health and purse will fail : Beware of swallowing too much ale.</em></p>
