I went one evening to a concert of the celebrated Kozeluch's, a great composer for the piano-forte, as well as a fine performer on that instrument. 
I saw there the composers Vanhall and Baron Dittersdorf ; and, what was to me one of the greatest gratifications of my musical life, was there introduced to that prodigy of genius Mozart. He favoured the company by performing fantasias and capriccios on the piano-forte. His feeling, the rapidity of his fingers, the great execution and strength of his left hand particularly, and the apparent inspiration of his modulations, astounded me. After this splendid performance we sat down to supper, and I had the pleasure to be placed at 
table between him and his wife, Madame Constance Weber, a German lady, of whom he was passionately fond, and by whom he had three children.
