Today, just as I was preparing to go to the Belgian workroom, Florence Younghusband ran in rather breathlessly, telling me to be quick and come with her, Muz too, to the Te Deum Service at Westminster Cathedral, for King Albert...
     We had very good seats, thanks to our ‘reserved’ tickets, near the High Altar, and by the aisle up which Cardinal Bourne passed. He officiated in all the splendour of his scarlet robes and was surrounded with ecclesiastics. The King of the Belgians was represented by Princess Clementine, who was accompanied by her husband, Victor Napoleon. It was a most moving moment when the Brabançonne was played on the grand organ at the end of the service.
