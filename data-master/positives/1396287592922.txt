We gave the little orphans a tea this afternoon. We laid out the tables, they came in and we followed, and as we entered they struck up 'God Save the King' in French, and the eldest girl made us a little speech. They fed as we poured out tea for them, then  they gave us a little concert, 'Vive l'Angleterre!' and 'Vive la France!' Three cheers all round, very happy! Now on duty again.
