I have lately had a sort of fiddle mania upon me, brought on by trying & comparing different Stainers, Cremonas, &c. I believe I have got possession of a sweet Stradivarius, which I play upon with much more pleasure than my Stainer; partly because the stop is longer. My Stainer is undersized; & on that account less valuable, thoâ€™ the tone is as bright, piercing, & full, as of any Stainer I ever heard. Yet when I take it up after the Stradivarius, it sets my teeth on edge. The tone comes out plump, all at once. There is a comfortable reserve of tone in the Stradivarius, & it bears pressure, & you may draw upon it for almost as much tone as you please. I think I shall bring it to town with me, & then you shall hear it.
