<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">The Festival Hall - that magnificient, 'suspended' beacon of the world that London is a big city! In the 90's I often wandered along the South Bank and was delighted to see RAY CHARLES and hear his fascinating voice and sound(?) with those swaying shoulders. I nearly called out "HIT THE ROAD JACK"!!</p>
