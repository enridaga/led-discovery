The Storaces and myself, by appointment, went to pay our respects to Raff, the justly celebrated tenor, esteemed by far the finest singer of his day, and for many years the delight of Naples and Palermo. He was by birth a Bavarian, and had retired to Munich with an ample fortune; he was past seventy, and did us the favour to sing to us his famous song, composed by Bach, " Non so donde viene," though his voice was impaired, he still retained his fine voce di petto and sostenuto notes, and pure style of singing.
