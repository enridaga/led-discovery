I heard Roy [Harris’s] 5th Symph broadcast yesterday.  Decided my chapter on him [in Our New Music, 1941] was triply just.  What a pity – with all that good material he can’t pull it all together and make it go places.  Still, the personality is so strong that it may make up for the lack of intellectual grasp of the material.  I’d be surer of this if he didn’t repeat himself so much in general mood and formulas.  His music shows no signs whatever of reactions to outward events.  Well, you know all this.
