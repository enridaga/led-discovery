Go with Bridges to B.B.C. Studio no. 10 (Waterloo) for Contemporary concert at 9.0. Van Dieran quartet no 5. - rather puerile, I thought for him - not too well played by international Quart. Peter Warlock's Curlew - rather fine, but overdrawn. & Hindemith's v. fine Concert music for Pft (Emma LÃ¼bbecke-Job), Brass & Harps. Magnificently played under Frank Bridge. I really thought, that although there was a certain feeling of experiment running through it, it contained some fine stuff!
