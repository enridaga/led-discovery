The Parcel Post Service was looking for workers during the Christmas holidays and I immediately got a job.... When the job ended, I did a lot of practicing the next two months, including copying solos from records which really helped me. A lot of time was also spent at the movies by myself, and when I returned home, I’d imitate the trombonists I’d heard on the soundtracks. It was a productive period for me.
