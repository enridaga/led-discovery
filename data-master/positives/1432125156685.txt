" I am much interested in sacred songs," writes a missionary in England, " because it was the first verse of ' Only trust Him ' that opened the door of my heart to let the Master into my soul in all His fulness, I was in the army, and found my way to the Woolwich Soldiers' Home, where I heard the Gospel ; and for a fortnight I was groping in the dark for peace, when one evening I heard the singing of ' Only trust Him,' which brought light into my soul. I have ever since been happy, serving Him with my whole heart. I am now a missionary to my comrades."
