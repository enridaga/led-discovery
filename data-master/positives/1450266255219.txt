<p>Mr. Lowell Mason&mdash;a prominent figure in the musical history of the United States. I believe he was never absent from any of our chamber concerts except when out of town. I well remember how, one night in the old Masonic Temple, when we had finished playing Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Quartette in D, op. 44,</em> Mr. Mason rose from his seat in the second row, came to the stage, laid the score of the quartette at my feet, said, &ldquo; It was beautifully played; please keep the score; sorry I cannot stay longer,&rdquo; and walked out in the stately, self-possessed manner so perfectly in keeping with his character.</p>
