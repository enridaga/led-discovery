<p>An evening of contemporary music, with a dull quartet by Casella and Stravinsky's <em>Les Noces</em>. The interest in the hall was palpable; a lot of musicians were present. Stokowski conducted, but he had not thoroughly studied the score, and got away with it only because the four pianos were in reliable hands: Casella, Tailleferre, Enesco and Salzedo.</p>
<p>It went pretty well, and it was very enjoyable to listen to <em>Les Noces</em>. When all is said and done it is Stravinsky's best work. It was a huge success. The programme opened with <em>Les Noces</em>, then Casella's piece (worthless and boring) and then <em>Les Noces </em>was repeated. Sitting in one of the front rows was Rachmaninoff. As soon as he was that the musicians were taking their places to play <em>Les Noces </em>again, he rushed headlong out of the hall, knocking over chairs and treading on the toes of all who were in his path.</p>
