About a month before his death Mr. Bliss went to Chicago to attend a convention called by Mr. Moody, and there, at a morning meeting, where over a thousand ministers were present, he sang, " Are your windows open toward Jerusalem ? " with intense spiritual feeling. One minister cried out : " God bless Mr. Bliss for that song ! " His face fairly shone as he sang, and half of those present were in tears under the influence of the song. Mr. Moody, filled with emotion, leaned his head forward upon the desk. It was the last time he heard his beloved friend and brother sing.
