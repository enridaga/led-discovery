A lady travelling in the East tells of a visit she paid to the Girls' Orphanage in Nazareth, an institution established many years ago in the town where Jesus spent so many years of His early life. The Orphanage was established by a society of Christians in London. Here the lady heard the children sweetly singing : " Jesus of Nazareth passeth by,"and she says that the children were sure the words were all meant for them.
