Oh — but I went to Cambridge with my friend E., & heard Mad. Mara, for the first time, at Manini’s benefit. We went on purpose. Give us credit in yr. black book for that, however. She sung, to our sorrow, only two songs; one, ”I know that my Redeemer", &c., & a bravura song of — I forget -- but it was a wonderful exhibition of power of voice, compass, distinct rapidity, & everything that cou’d be in such a song. Our expectations were fully answered. But -- tell it not near the back stairs — we wished the other song changed; yet she sung it admirably; but it was chosen ad populum, I suppose, not to her own taste. In such a song, I confess, I shd. prefer Mrs. Bates. I heard [Johann Peter] Salomon too, whom I had not heard before. I like him much better than [Wilhelm] Cramer. Cramer is very good at mechanism. Salomon played as many hard tricks as the lover of difficulty could wish; but with more appearance of taste, I think, more tone, more glow, more symptoms of feeling than Cramer. With my eyes shut I could tell that the fiddle was played on by a human creature …
We have been at Ipswich, too, & heard lessons upon the P[iano].F[orte]. a whole evening, in a comfortable way, by Miss Marshall. She played three lessons, lately published, of Coziluc [Leopold Kozeluch], with a fiddle accompaniment, which I think charming music. So are the 3 former, unaccompanied, which she also played. Will you give me leave to like Coziluc still better than [Johann Franz Xaver] Sterkel? Now do y now! Is there not more substance, more composition, &, in slow movements, more pathos in Coziluc? The adagios (with the accompt.) are surely capital.
