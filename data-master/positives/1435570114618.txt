Steuart Wilson and I went to hear Sapellnikoff yesterday in that same Hippodrome, and a woman sang the worst songs in Europe.

'Once in an old-world English country town,
I met a maid
Gowned in brown;
It quite enhanced her loveliness'

The notes were rather worse than the words, but it ended with a change of key and on a top A, so we all applauded loudly and shivered, and I took in my Sam Browne belt one.
