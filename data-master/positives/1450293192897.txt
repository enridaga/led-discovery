<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I have seen only one stage version of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Rite</em> since 1913, Diaghilev&rsquo;s 1920 revival. Music and dancing were better coordinated this time than in 1913, but the choreography (by Massine) was too gymnastic and Dalcrozean to please me. I realized then that I prefer the work as a concert piece. </span></p>
