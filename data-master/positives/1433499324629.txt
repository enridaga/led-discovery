<p>Buddy Bolden was more of a ragtime cornet player at that time than Manuel Perez. He didn't use music. Manuel did use music. Buddy was very big and had a loud tone. You could hear him for a block. Sure, Buddy was louder than Armstrong. The loudest there ever was, because you could hear Buddy's cornet as loud as what Armstrong played through the mic.</p>
