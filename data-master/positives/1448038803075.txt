<p>We have had opportunity to attend but one public religious service in London, in the daily cathedral service at St. Paul&rsquo;s. It was nearly the same as at the Worcester cathedral. The choir is a little larger, but the same irreverent hurrying prevails. The manner of treating the cadences in the chant I like, for there is no singing, drawling style, but the tones are short and words quickly spoken; but with respect to the chanting in other respects, or in general, it is all confused, inarticulate, rapid and unsatisfactory &mdash; still it is not relatively, perhaps, much quicker than the other parts of the service. A company of hungry ones in a second or third-rate American hotel do not eat their dinner in greater speed than these humble confessions and prayers are recited.</p>
