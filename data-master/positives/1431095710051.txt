Who modernized you while you were playing with Jimmy's band?

I was going out to listen to everyone in Chicago. One of the first people was Roy Kral [later part of a piano/vocal duo with Jackie Cain], who was playing with Charlie Ventura's Band out on the South Side in a place called Jump Town. We'd finish up at three A.M., but they'd still be playing for an hour, so we would catch the last set.
