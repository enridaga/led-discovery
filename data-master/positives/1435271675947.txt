I go to Audry Chapman Orch at Clerkenwell with Bridges after an early dinner. F.B. conducts as usual, & the strings of the orch. are for amateurs marvellous - quite the best of all in town. Mozart - Figaro ov. & Jupiter. Brahms-Haydn variations, Schumann Pft. conc. (Irene Scharrer intensions v. fine but execution not so good).
