<p>&hellip;We had a wonderful evening at the Royal Festival Hall on Wednesday when we saw Jascha Horenstein conduct the BBC Choral Society, BBC Chorus and BBC Symphony Orchestra with Norma Proctor, Teresa Streich, Randall Richard Lewis &amp; K ? Borg as soloists singing Beethoven&rsquo;s Mass in D (the Missa Solemnis).&nbsp; We had excellent seats &ndash; almost too near the front and a marvellous viewpoint.&nbsp; It was a memorable evening &ndash; did you hear the Broadcast &ndash; either on Wednesday or repeat &ndash; tomorrow- Saturday&hellip;</p>
