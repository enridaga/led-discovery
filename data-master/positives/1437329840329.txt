<pre>One morning, at a rehearsal at the Rotunda, Madame Catalani was so ill with a <br />sick headache, that she could not rehearse her song ; and as it was extremely <br />difficult for the orchestra, she begged of me to have it rehearsed by the band. <br />Cooke asked me for the part from which Madame Catalani sang ; I gave it him. He <br />placed it on one side of his music desk, and on the other, his first violin <br />part, from which he was to play ; and to my great astonishment, Madame <br />Catalani's, and that of all present, he sang every note of the song, at the <br />same time playing his own part on the violin, as leader ; thus killing, as it <br />were, two birds with one stone, with the greatest ease.<br />
The song was one of Portogallo's, in manuscript, and had never been out of <br />Madame Catalani's hands ; therefore, it was impossible that he could have seen 
it previously ; it was full of difficult divisions, of which he did not miss <br />one. Had I not been an eye-witness of this extraordinary exhibition, I could 
not, as a musical man, have believed it.
