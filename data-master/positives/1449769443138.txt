<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I went to a concert given by David Munrow and the Early Music Consort. I hadn't been to many concerts before of any description, and thought of them as fairly scary and very formal. I was totally entranced by the performance - David was such a charismatic figure and the musicians' passion and pleasure in the music created a sort of charmed circle for everyone that was there. The audience smiled at each other, as each individual's delight added to the overall feeling. The Hall and the audience came alive.&nbsp;</p>
