<p>The &ldquo;Tableaux Vivants&rdquo; were now exhibited. Each tableaux was exhibited three times; they were all magnificently prepared, and the whole exhibition was exceedingly interesting and beautiful. The order was as follows:</p>
<p>1. &ldquo;Orpheus liberates Eurydice&rdquo; from the under world.&rdquo; After P. Cornelius. Accompanied by extracts from the text and the music of Gluck's opera.</p>
<p>2. &ldquo;The Singer's Curse.&rdquo; After M. Tolz. Accompanied by music from Robert Schumann&rsquo;s third Symphonie.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;A Landscape.&rdquo; A group of young men accompany a comrade on his way out of town, and they all sing &ldquo;Must I leave thee, Native Town.&rdquo; His beloved watches from a bower, and after all have disappeared sings a sad song of parting.</p>
<p>4. &ldquo;Ave Maria.&rdquo; After Rubens. Accompanied by a &ldquo;Salve Regina,&rdquo; composed by M. Hauptmann.</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;Grand Battle Piece.&rdquo; &ldquo;Frederick the Great at the Battle of Prague.&rdquo; A most splendid tableaux with many figures. Accompanied by a military movement by the orchestra.</p>
<p>6. &ldquo;Landscape. Review&rdquo; The muses appear on an eminence; on one side in the foreground is a group of Orpheus; next, the young and old singers from the second picture; then, the young man, and his beloved from the third, the monks from the fourth, and Frederick from the fifth. The muses, Thalia, Euterpe, and Erato, advance to the front of the stage, bearing crowns of evergreen in their hands. Euterpe sings a verse of greeting to the assembled singers, and the curtain falls.</p>
<p>The fourth and last day&rsquo;s exercises closed by a grand festive ball, of singers, visitors, and citizens.</p>
