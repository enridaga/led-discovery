<p>In over 50 years of concert -going, Rudolf Senkin's recitals at the RFH in the 1970's stand out as the high point. I was impressed not only by the insight into the music (especially Beethoven) but his willingness to take risks - and is humility. In my experience, no-one has matched him in such works as the Hammerklavier sonata and the Diabelli Variation.</p>
