<p>After dinner, gramophone &amp; listen to Edward Clark conducting a performance of Petrouchka. to say nothing of interpretation (which was ludicrous) it was disgracefully incompetent - the orchestra 'swam' completely about 6 times &amp; it is a wonder of wonders how they ever got to the end together. The inst. playing was bad throughout.</p>
