<p>About six or seven years ago I drove over from Broadway to Cheltenham to hear him [Sir Charles Santley] sing once more at a concert that was being given at the Winter Gardens. Naturally his voice was not what it had been some thirty-five years ago. How could it be? But the old charm was there, the technique was absolutely remarkable for a man of his age, and when, as an encore, he sang a very simple little ballad, it was with all the old charm and beautiful tenderness! It was worth driving any distance merely to hear words pronounced as he pronounced them. And I am glad, more than glad, to have this opportunity of saying what I think&mdash;what I have always thought&mdash;about his art, for in my opinion he is, all round, by far the greatest English singer we have ever had.</p>
