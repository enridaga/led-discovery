Orgitano played the harpsichord pretty well too, and Signore Consorte, a musico, was there to sing. &ndash; There was likewise a pretty good solo hautbois. &ndash; We had all given Caffarielli over &ndash; when behold he came in high good humour and contrary to all expectation was prevailed on to sing. Many notes in his voice are now thin, but there are still traits in his performance sufficient to convince one of his having been an amazing fine singer. He accompanied himself and sung without other instrument than the harpsichord. Expression and grace with great neatness in all he attempts are his characteristics &ndash; both Barbella and he are Bolisarius[e]s, rather in ruin than otherwise, but what remains of them is but the more precious for it.</span></p>
