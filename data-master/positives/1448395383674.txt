<p>In the evening we attended the Baptist Church, Devonshire Square, Bishopgate street. A precentor, standing in front of the pulpit, led the singing. He first read a stanza, and then it was sung by all the people; and, thus, the whole hymn was alternately read and sung. The same obstacle to success in Congregational singing was observable here, as at the Scotch Church in the morning &mdash; the tunes were too difficult, and the effect of the singing was wretched. We are more and more satisfied that tunes must be made more simple in time, and limited in compass of melody, to insure success in this form of church song.&nbsp;</p>
