<p>I have just arrived again in Grez- What a pity you could not come to Munich: not only to hear the Mass but I wanted so much to introduce you to the most important German composers &amp; conductors. My "Mass" made an enormous impression - In fact much more than I ever expected - the Chorus was superb &amp; the Tanzlied went splendidly - The womans Chorus consisted of 26 picked voices, with the Solo Soprano &amp; Alto - &nbsp;It is going to be performed in several towns in Germany next season-</p>
