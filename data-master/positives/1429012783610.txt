By the April to June opera season of 1936 I was playing my second "Ring" with Beecham. My memories of them are as lightweight, lyrical and a trifle on the fast side; but the really unforgettable experience in 1936 was hearing Kirsten Flagstad, the supreme Br√ºnnhilde, for the second time. The audiences cheered her to the echo and even the most hardened player in the pit knew he was hearing a unique voice.
