I was told that he had only just come over to England, and that some German Royalty had given him an introduction to Princess Louise, who, as everyone knows, is devoted to Art in every shape and form, and is herself not only a painter but a sculptress into the bargain. I think it was Herr Henschel&rsquo;s first appearance at a big private party in London, and he was so young that I can well believe it. We were all young then, for this party took place a very long time ago - nevertheless, I remember how beautifully he sang, and how beautifully he accompanied himself in several interesting songs of his own composition.</span></p>
