<p>" On Tuesday morning last, previous to Her Majesty taking her usual exercise in the Park, she was graciously pleased to order the performance of Mr. Elvey's beautiful exercise for his Mus. Doc. degree, and for this purpose Her Majesty's private band was in attendance to take the instrumental parts, and members of the Sacred Harmonic Society to support the choruses. We have had the opportunity of hearing and judging of this sublime piece of music. It was universally admired on its performance in Cardinal Wolsey's Chapel a few days since before a large company, and we are assured by a gentleman who was present that nothing could have gone off more to the satisfaction of all concerned, and not the least so to that of the composer himself.</p>
