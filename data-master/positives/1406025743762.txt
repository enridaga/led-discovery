Shortly after my turn, it was Jackie’s. She was to perform the set piece, Purcell’s Air in D minor. Mum climbed onto the platform with her and played an ‘A’ on the piano for Jackie to tune. Silence descended, and Jackie began. Her concentration was so intense that it seemed as though the whole hall had stopped breathing while she was performing for them.

I loved her playing and had already heard this piece while I was on the swing, but now there was an electric feeling in the air. As the final notes died away, the audience burst into spontaneous cheering.
