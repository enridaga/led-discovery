Thence home, whither by agreement by and by comes Mercer and Gayett, and two gentlemen with them, Mr. Montouth and Pelham, the former a swaggering young handsome gentleman - the latter a sober citizen merchant; both sing, but the latter with great skill; the other, no skill but a good voice and a good basse - but used to sing only tavern tunes; and so I spent all this evening till 11 at night singing with them, till I tired of them because of the swaggering fellow with the basse, though the girl Mercer did mightily commend him before me.
