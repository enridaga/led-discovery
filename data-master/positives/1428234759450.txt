Barney Gordon's saloon was on the ground floor. We entertained, though, in a big room upstairs where the customers sat at tables. There was only a two-piece band. Toots Moore, the drummer, and a piano player who could play only in two keys. 
For a short while I lost my voice trying to sing in his two keys. Barney kept me on while my vocal cords were making their speedy recovery because I could shimmy so good. "Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble," the big shimmy song, had just come out. When the boys played that I'd put my hands on my hips and work my body fast, without moving my feet. There was never anything vulgar about my fast and furious wrigglings. Even in towns where other girl performers were stopped from shimmying by the local bluenoses, no one objected to my doing it.
