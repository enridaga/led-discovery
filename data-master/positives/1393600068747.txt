August 8th. Not a word have I been able to add till now. Mr. [Charles] Hague (of Cambridge) & a scholar of his, have been here ever since Friday last: you may imagine how pleasantly my time has been fiddled away. Hague is both a charming player, & a very pleasant man. Monday evening there was, what there never had been before, a concert at Stony Stratford, for the benefit of Mr. Banet, Organist of Northampton. We all assisted. A very bad room, with a very low ceiling, cramm’d more than full, with all the gens comme il faut in the place & neighbourhood. Dancing afterwards till 3 in the morning. The Doctor [John Hey] & I walked home, at almost midnight, across the meadows. My feet were very wet with the dewy grass, but I caught no cold.
Yesterday I had a most delightful day at Mrs. Prowse’s at Wicken. We dined there with a large family party — all the Sharpes in the world. Music in plenty, & of the pleasantest sort.
