Not long ago a lady came to me to hear her 
voice. When she entered my study I could not 
help noticing her appearance ; she was short 
and stout, and not at all prepossessing in any 
way. That would not have mattered if her 
voice had been good, or she had sung well. I 
heard her sing a few ballads, which she sang 
wretchedly. She said she was forty-two, and 
that she wanted to enter the musical profession. 
She added that she had been for four years 
under a master, who had told her she could 
easily earn four pounds a day by concert singing. 
I at once disillusioned her and told her she had 
better give up all idea of singing in public ; and 
then she departed, very despondently. Poor 
woman ! it was a nasty task to have to disap- 
point her ; but it would have been far more 
cruel to have raised her hopes.
