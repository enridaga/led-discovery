 1989 was the best of the three years [photographing the Bern Jazz Festival], filled with great music from pianists Michel Camillo and Hank Jones; the great drummer Art Blakey and his Jazz Messengers; the steady jazz bassist Milt Hinton (a wonderful photographer, too); bluesman Albert King; trumpet players Freddie Hubbard and Tom Harrell; the always energetic singer Dee Dee Bridgewater; clarinetist Buddy DeFranco (still alive and cookin'); the composer and saxophonist Benny Golson. Freddie and Benny years ago were part of the early sixties band of Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers--so the festival was a small sort of reunion for them both…

The Detroit-based Moss Family Singers brought the festival to a close, and with it my time in Switzerland… I was proud to be a part of those times.
