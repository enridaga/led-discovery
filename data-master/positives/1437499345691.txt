<pre>On the 5th of September, 1811, I made my last appearance on any stage, on the <br />stage where I had made my first appearance, when a boy, in 1779 Mr. Bartlett <br />Cooke accompanied me on the flute and hautboy, when I acted first in 1779, and <br />when I last performed in 1811, both in my native city. </pre>
