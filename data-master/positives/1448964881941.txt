<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I have many happy memories of the RFH, from the opening of the hall when I was still at school! Going with friends to Sunday afternoon recitals, we really thought it was something, so different and special! The sixties memories of catching the early train from Kingsbury, to be at the box office as early as possible to get tickets for my idol Arthur [Artur] Rubinstein's concerts and recitals! I met so many nice people in the queue over the years! The queue stretched right around the block! Happy times, and many more followed throughout the years since!</p>
