    Knowing the idiosyncrasies of artists, I was naturally rather interested to see how Caruso would behave when he paid his first and only visit to Glasgow.
    I was with him in the ante-room, and, to my surprise, he spent his time drawing caricatures of everyone who passed. With a few strokes he drew one of me that set us both laughing. All the time he was munching his lips. Then when his call came he braced his shoulders and walked on to the platform as if he was going to meet a friend.
    I remember he sang eight times. Most artists hang back after each song to see how much the people will applaud. Caruso, however, came out, and, when the cheers were ringing, raised his eyebrows as much as to say : “Do they want another?” and went back straightaway.
