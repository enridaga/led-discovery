The first audition of ‘Oedipus’ took place at the Théatre Sarah Bernhardt on May 30, and was followed by two more under my direction. Once again I had to suffer from the conditions under which my work was presented: an oratorio sandwiched between two ballets! An audience which had come to applaud ballet was naturally disconcerted by such a contrast, and was unable to concentrate on something purely auditive. That is why the later performances of Oedipus as an opera under Klemperer in Berlin, and then as a concert under my direction in Dresden and London and in the Salle Pleyel, Paris, gave me far greater satisfaction.
