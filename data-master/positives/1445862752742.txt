The vespers were said by Cardinal York assisted by several bishops - there were Mazzanti, Giovanini and Christofero to sing, besides the whole choir and several supernumeraries. The fat Giovanini, famous for playing the violoncello as well as for being one of the maestri di capella of St. Peters, beat time. The solo parts were finely sung by the 3 singers above mentioned and the choruses by 2 quires and 2 organs admirably performed. There were no other instruments than the 2 organs, 4 violoncellos and 2 double basses. There were some fugues and imitations in dialogue, between the 2 choirs which had a very fine effect. The service was in the large Winter chapel on the left in which is the largest organ.</span></p>
