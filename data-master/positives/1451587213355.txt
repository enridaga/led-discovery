<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I often wonder which production of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Katerina Izmailova</em> &ndash; Nemirovich-Danchnko&rsquo;s or Smolich&rsquo;s- was closest to my own conceptions. It is extremely difficult to decide, because I really liked both of them, but in different ways. Nemirovich-Danchenko&rsquo;s great talent, and his application of the whole dramatic tradition of the Moscow Art Theatre system to this operatic production, occasionally brought truly staggering results, but at the same time I felt that in places he relied more on Leskov&rsquo;s story than on the libretto of the opera. Smolich&rsquo;s production, however, was marked by a profound knowledge of the mature opera. Musically, his production was on a very high level. </span></p>
