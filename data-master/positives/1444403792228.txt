<p>We had the Memoir Club on Wednesday.&nbsp; Clive &amp; Maynard read; both elaborate &amp; polished, Clive mellow &amp; reminiscent about Mrs Raven Hill...Maynard, of course, was the solid piece of the evening, so long indeed that we had to leave before the end.&nbsp; I was a little bored by the politics, &amp; a good deal impressed by the method of character drawing...Then Melchior; &amp; his room, where the three clerks refused to leave off playing the piano.&nbsp; 'Smoking isn't allowed until 5' they said; 'This is the German revolution' was Melchior's comment.&nbsp;</p>
