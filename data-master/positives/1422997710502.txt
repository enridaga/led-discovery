Next morning we were rehearsing at ten o'clock, but it didn't help very much because most of us had been out all night, and Beecham, knowing this, just played a few bars of Dennis Brain's Mozart concerto, a line of two of Sibelius's 'Tapiola' and left the rest to the inspiration of the evening. He was very wise. It was a magnificent concert.
