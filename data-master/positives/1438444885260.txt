<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The early summer of 1890 was to witness the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>debut of the successor to Liszt and Rubinstein, of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the greatest of the fin de siecle group of great <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>pianists&mdash; Ignace Jan Paderewski. This event <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>created interest at the time among a very limited <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>circle. It was anticipated with curiosity only by <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the critics and dilettanti who follow the trend of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>musical events in Paris. For several months we <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>had been receiving vivid accounts of a young Polish pianist, &ldquo;with a wonderful aureole of golden hair,&rdquo; who executed miracles upon the keyboard, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>who composed delicious minuets and played Chopin to absolute perfection. But London cares <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>little, as a rule, for what Paris thinks of new artists, and it displayed anything but a burning impatience to hear Leschetizky 's latest pupil. This <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>fact was sufficiently demonstrated by the meagre <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>audience which gathered at St. James 's Hall on the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>9th of May for the first of the four recitals announced by the composer of &ldquo;Paderewski 's Minuet&rdquo;. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>A more coldly critical assemblage perhaps <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>it would have been impossible to find. Not a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>soupcon of magnetic current was in the atmosphere&mdash;not even the quickened pulse arising from <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the anticipation of &ldquo;sensational effects." <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When M. Paderewski appeared upon the platform there was a mild round of applause accompanied by an undercurrent of whispering and suppressed murmurs that had evident reference to his <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>unwonted picturesqueness of aspect. The deep <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>golden tinge of his hair seemed to accentuate the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>intense pallor of his countenance. One could <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>plainly see that he was nervous; but in those deep, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>thoughtful eyes, in those firmly-set lips, in that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>determined chin, one could read also the strong, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>virile qualities of the self-contained, self-reliant <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>artist, already accustomed to conquer audiences <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and to create magnetism in the most sterile space. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Exactly how he played that day&mdash; I mean, as compared with the Paderewski whose every mood was <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>by and by to become familiar&mdash; it is rather hard <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>for me to say. That he strove to be &ldquo;sensational&rdquo; <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I do not believe now, though at the time it was <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>difficult to think otherwise. For surely his contrasts were startling in their violence, and the instrument fairly thundered under his execution of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a forte passage. At times there seemed to be no <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>restraint whatever. His magnificent technique <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>enabled him to give free rein to his impulse and <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>imagination, and laissez aller was then the word. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>If you loved sensationalism in a pianist, here unquestionably was a virtuoso capable of providing <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>an unlimited quantity of it. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>And such was the prevailing impression in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>minds of the aforesaid critics and dilettanti when <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>they left St. James's Hall that afternoon.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"><br /></span></span></p>
