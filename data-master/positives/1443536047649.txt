<p>I wrote to you last Saturday and gave you an account of all that had happened till that time. That night we went to Mrs. Barbier's benefit, which was not very full. She sings well, with a bad voice, but having at home an entertainment so excellent in that way, I cannot say I can bear any other singing.</p>
