Go to dinner with Bridges at 7.0 & go to B.B.C. concert with Grace (Beth & Joan Wynne-Reeves also go) afterwards. Wood conducting Hindemith's Unaufh√∂rliche.* Perf. mediocre competent but not inspired choral singing not even that [BB arrows back to 'competent' here] & some soloists. Adeleid Armhold was frightfully good tho'. The work is frightfully long & disconnected, naturly being wedded to such ludicrous words. It contains some fine things (esp. in second half), but it is too monotonous seeming to me a work of devices (clever enough) rather than inspiration.
