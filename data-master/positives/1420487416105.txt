There was never a moment of unpleasantness during the whole series; not a wrong note or a fumbled beat. The performances were unquestionably good, but somehow unmemorable - so much so that although every concert was recorded, and cassettes of them all were available at very moderate prices to the players, very few indeed of the Ozawa records were ordered, while others by conductors of no greater claim to fame were in great demand. This indicates that in some cases conductors have different effects upon different orchestras, because it hasn't always been like this with Ozawa. It could be that in him there was then just a little too much involvement in the international orchestral scene, and possible at that time he has to yet stayed in one place for long enough.
