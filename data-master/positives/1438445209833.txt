Yet I had found <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>so much to admire, so much to marvel at, so much <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that was individual and supremely masterful in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Paderewski's playing that I determined not to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>miss a single recital of the three still to come. The second drew a better audience, though nothing <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>approaching a crowd; and this time the new pian- <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>ist included Bach, Beethoven, and Schubert in his <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>scheme, together with more Chopin and Paderewski. The &ldquo;barometer'' began to rise. </span></p>
