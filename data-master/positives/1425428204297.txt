There were many visiting artists whom I heard for the first time. I was impressed with a violin concerto by Carlovicz, performed by Hubermann, and with Szigeti’s playing of the Busoni concerto. There were chromatic passages for violin with flute which sounded like two flutes. Szigeti’s palate was very rich. Both Hubermann and Szigeti represented a school little resembling the one I knew in Russia, leaning less heavily on sensuous beauty of sound and sheer brilliance, which the Russians strived to achieve.
