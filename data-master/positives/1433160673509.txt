It may be remembered that this anthem was originally composed for the "Festival of the Ancients "in 1850. It was dedicated by special permission to H.R.H. Prince Albert; and a few weeks before the performance at Exeter Hall it was given at Windsor Castle before Her Majesty under Dr. Elvey's direction.
