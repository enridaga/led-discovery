<p>I remember in particular one experience with Rimski-Korsakov. It happened in St. Petersburg when Siloti took me to a performance of one of Rimski-Korsakov&rsquo;s operas at the Maryinsky Theater. During the intermission after the first act, Glazunov &ndash; he had been a pupil of Rimski-Korsakov &ndash; came to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been talking with Nikolai Andreevich, and he&rsquo;s nervous because you&rsquo;re here. He&rsquo;s afraid you won&rsquo;t like the music.&rdquo; Imagine the modesty of the man! He was then in his sixties and at the height of his career, and I was not yet thirty. I felt embarrassed to reply. But I asked Glazunov to please let Rimski-Korsakov, and I told him how much I loved his music. And he evidenced such appreciation!</p>
