Rehearsing VT's songs, for Maurice Grosser's memorial tomorrow, with a 24-year-old ebony baritone who was "anxious to work with the great Ned Rorem" (Virgil's sardonic slogan). The ebony baritone is clearly miffed by the elderly spectacle I represent. Certainly I speak no longer of my body as an erotic object, but that as an ailing object.
