Went to town in the evening with Lawton and Constable, to the Canadian service at the theatre. We were just in time for the last hymn, 'Abide With Me'. It sounded fine played by their brass band, and they played on for about an hour after the service - all sorts of things, but chiefly patriotic music. About five weeks ago some of the Canadian Battalion though they would like some music and set to work to form a band. They collected Â£60 among themselves and sent to England for instruments, and now have a good band going.... The audience loved the music and for the most part looked cheerful. There were only six women - two of us, three sisters from No. 2 and one from No. 8 - but we get used to being very much in the minority. The music was most refreshing, and I only wished the poor fellows who lay dying in our hosptial could have heard it too.
