<p>Yesterday in London the usual sticky stodgy conglomerations of people, sleepy and torpid as a cluster of drenched bees, were crawling over Trafalgar Square, &amp; rocking about the pavements in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The one pleasant sight I saw was due rather to the little breath of wind than to decorative skills; some long tongue shaped streamers attached to the top of the Nelson column licked the air, furled &amp; unfurled, like the gigantic tongues of dragons, with a slow, rather serpentine beauty. Otherwise theatres &amp; music halls were studded with stout glass pin-cushions which, rather prematurely, were all radiant within - but surely light night have shone to better advantage.&nbsp; However night was sultry &amp; magnificent so far as that went, &amp; we were kept awake some time after getting into bed by the explosion of rockets which for a second made our room bright. (And now, in the rain, under a grey brown sky, the bells of Richmond [are] ringing - but church bells only recall weddings &amp; Christian services). I can't deny that I feel a little mean at writing so lugubriously; since we are all supposed to keep up the belief that we're glad an enjoying ourselves.</p>
