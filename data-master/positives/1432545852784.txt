I shall never forget the impression this Tuba Mirum made on me when I first heard it at St.Eustache under Berlioz's own direction. It amounted to an absolute neglect of the author's directions. The beginning of the work is marked moderate, later, as the brass comes in, the movement is quickened and becomes andante maestro. Most of the time the moderato was interpreted as an allegro, and the andante maestro as a simple moderato.
