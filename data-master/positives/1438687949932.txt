A new opera and a new soprano singer were both forthcoming on the occasion. The opera, given for the first time in this country, the "Due Foscari," of Verdi, and the singer, Madame Montenegro, a Spanish lady of good family, with a clear soprano voice of some compass, and an attractive person, pleased, without exciting any marked sensation. Coletti, in the character of the Doge, one of his most famous parts, was, by general accord, pronounced to be an admirable, not to say a great artist; whilst Fraschini, by his energy and power, contributed to the effect of the ensemble. The first appearance of Lucille Grahn, on the same occasion, added to the eclat of a brilliant reopening.</span></p>
