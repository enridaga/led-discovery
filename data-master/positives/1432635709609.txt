<p>B.B. knows a lot of chords, but he'll tell you himself, he can't play and strum chords all at the same time. A lot of times when B.B. is playing, he may have the guitar on the intro, the solo, and on the going out. In between, just playing regular chords, he don't do it. He usually stands there and sings and claps. But that's the way his style is rounded. He can play one of the best arrangements of "Going Home" on a guitar that I've ever heard. One night, he walked into Don Robey's studio there in Houston. They happened to be playing there that night, just a bunch of musicians getting together and jamming. Not like the amateur jams you see in Dallas, these were professional guys going to the test. A guy picks a tune and the band goes off and plays, and each guy takes a solo to the fullest of what he knows. So B.B. walks in, sits down, and listens a minute. Then he reaches over and grabs a guitar, and everybody looks at him, because he's supposed to know what he's doing. But he decided he would give them a little more something to worry about. The horns were doing their part, then he went off to do his solo, and he did about two things in one. When he got ready to modulate to the song he was gonna do, he just did a lot of stuff like fast notes and running chords. He even did "Tiger Rag." Everybody said, "Now this cat is playing this stuff like he'd been doing it all his life." But that wasn't the point. What he knows, and the way his style was, he had to study that. He had studied music in that form. That's why it was so easy for him to do it.</p>
