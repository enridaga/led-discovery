<p>On the whole, after living nearly a year in Spain, I&nbsp;came to the conclusion that Spanish musical audiences&nbsp;were amongst the most enthusiastic I had ever encountered; but, as a rule, only when the music of their&nbsp;predilection &mdash; every phrase of which lends itself to the&nbsp;practice of the sister-art, dancing &mdash; constitutes the entertainment provided for them. I have seen them sit,&nbsp;frigid and silent, through excellent operatic performances ; and for classical compositions they have neither&nbsp;inclination nor patience. In the national <em>zarzuela</em>...they take the liveliest delight; and no wonder, for more amusing and better played pieces I have never seen,&nbsp;even in Paris. But, when all is said and done, what&nbsp;goes straight to their hearts is the <em>seguidilla</em> in which&nbsp;the strains they love aud the steps they admire are&nbsp;triumphantly combined.</p>
