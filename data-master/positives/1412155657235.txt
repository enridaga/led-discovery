There is not the least doubt that quadraphonic 8 Track sounded fantastic. The sound bounced round the room rather like Dolby stereo today. In fact, even the standard 8 Track was a great improvement on most record players of the time. Unless you are scrupulously careful, vinyl records get scratched and dusty, a thing which never happened with an 8 Track stereo cartridge. Apart from the vastly improved sound, the thing was so fantastically modern; if you had an 8 Track in 1973, you really were a trend setter. Mind you, if you still had one ten years later, after the introduction of compact discs, you would have looked a bit sad.
