I drove early with Lafont to the Hotel de Ville, where Cherubini's new Cantata, and the Interméde by Boieldieu and Berton, written for the christening of the Duke of Bordeaux, were rehearsed. The first of these works was under the direction of the great master himself. His squeaky, sharp little voice was sometimes heard in the midst of his conducting, and interrupted my state of ecstasy, caused by his presence and composition. The whole of the magnificent and far-famed Court band was in attendance. The Prefect, Count Chabrol, and his wife, whom I met at this rehearsal, offered me, in the most friendly manner, a ticket for the grand ball to be given in honor of the christening. In the evening I attended the general rehearsal of an opera which Cherubini, Paér, Berton, Boieldieu, and Kreutzer had jointly composed in honor of this same christening. The final chorus by Cherubini made an indelible impression on my mind. Each master conducted his own pieces, and Cherubini was loudly cheered.
