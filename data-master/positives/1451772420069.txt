<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">I am presently enjoying my second visit this year to Tbilisi, the beautiful capital of Soviet Georgia. The purpose of this visit is to hear new works by Georgian composers. I came with great hopes, and these hopes have been borne out. At a review concert a few days ago, many successful works by talented Georgian composers were performed. / It was encouraging to see that Georgian music is pushing ahead, no small thanks being due to the younger generation of composers. Among the outstanding youngsters whose work I heard were Alexander Shaverzashvili, Archil Chimakadze, Revaz Lagidze and Otar Gordeli &ndash; all of whom were educated at the Tbilisi Conservatoire. I would even make so bold as to claim that in no other republic of the Soviet Union is there such an upsurge of young talent as in Georgia. / One characteristic feature of the young Georgian composers is the fact that they respond in their works to the burning issues of the day and speak about Soviet reality at the tops of their voices.</span></p>
