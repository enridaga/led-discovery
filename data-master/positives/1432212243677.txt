" For many years past I have been an infidel, and often lectured to audiences in opposition to the Bible. To-day, in the presence of all you who see me, I declare that I am a converted man. I owe the softening of my hitherto stony heart to a Gospel hymn sung by Mr. Bliss, the refrain of which is, ' Will any one then, at the beautiful gate, be waiting and watching for me ? ' It reminded me so tenderly of my Christian wife, parents, brothers, sisters and children who have gone before me that it quite broke me down ; and now Christ and the Word have become my best hope and stronghold."
