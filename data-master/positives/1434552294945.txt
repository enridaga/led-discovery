Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Delville, 15 Dec. 1750 -
This week I have had a feast of music. At the rehearsal on Tuesday morning, and last night at the performance, of the Messiah ; very well performed indeed, and the pleasure of the music greatly heightened by considering how many poor prisoners would be released by it. You may (Bushe says) write to Mrs. Dillon when you pleaseâ€”she is sure she will be glad to hear from you; her two modest, innocent girls went with us to the Messiah, and asked much after you.
