<p>Some of my most pleasant hours have been spent in the company of musical friends. Excepting the Opera and the Philharmonic Concert, music seldom gratifies me so much as in private parties... It is from instrumental music that I have derived the greatest pleasure, as in that, the sounds can be more correctly governed, than in the voice. For the chamber, I would only admit the following instruments : the piano, harp, and a quintetto of violins, violas, and violoncellos. Sometimes the flute may be added, if the performer has skill enough to keep it within bounds.&nbsp;</p>
