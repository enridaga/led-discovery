I understood then why pitch always has a tendency to rise, for, wedded as Joachim was to orthodoxy in all things, I nevertheless caught a few remarks about "increased brilliancy," and so on. That Concerto, which has never been among my favourite Brahms works, may for aught I know be child's play to students nowadays; at that time however the technique was unfamiliar and not considered favourable to the instrument. Wags called it "Concerto<em> against</em> (instead of<em> for</em>) the Violin." But I fancy my musical sensibility was blurred in the wild excitement of at last getting to know the great man himself.</span></p>
