David McCallum... gentle of voice and coaxing rather than domineering, he could draw the loveliest of sounds from a section of players of mixed styles and abilities. His own tone, produced alike from one of his valuable violins - he had a Guarnerius, an Amati and a Bergonzi at one time, I believe - or any old fiddle he was asked to try, was warm, generous and the nearest I ever heard to that of his own particular idol, Fritz Kreisler. Anyone who heard him play the solo in Delius's First Dance Rhapsody never forgot it.
