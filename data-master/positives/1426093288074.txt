<p>After the orchestral rehearsal of my second concerto it was decided that it should be given a public performance, and so I shall appear in it next Monday, the 11th. Although in one way I am not too pleased about it, on the other hand I am curious as regards the general effect it will make. I believe the Rondo is bound to impress everyone. Indeed after hearing this Rondo Soliva said to me; [in French] "It does you the greatest credit". Kurpinski spoke at length of its originality and Eisner of its rhythm. If only I did not have to have those wretched clarinets and bassoons in between the concerto-movements I could produce what one might call a very nice evening, with Gladkowska singing in the first half and Wolkow in the second.</p>
