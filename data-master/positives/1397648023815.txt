Last night C[hristie], Jobbie and I were all on duty and it was so slack that I paid a visit along the lines and found J and C just going into [hut] 35 to hear one of patients, a boy called Perry, sing. So I added myself to the audience. He has a high falsetto voice that is well trained and rather nice to listen to - as nice as falsetto ever is. Sang really very well indeed and of course without accompaniment.
