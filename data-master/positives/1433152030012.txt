While the Metropolitan Church and Abbey were in a cold and languishing state about the middle of the century, St. George's Chapel possessed the finest and best-trained choir in England. On Sunday afternoons people flocked from all
parts to hear as good a rendering of modern Church music as can now be heard in St. Paul's Cathedral, the organ being frequently supplemented by instrumentalists from the Queen's and Guards' bands.
