From a practical point of view there was no religion in the front line, although our unit padre used to come and visit us quite a lot. But he was never allowed to stay in one place for too long because he got in the way. Behind the line there were the usual church services and then there was a church parade on a Sunday, in which the whole battalion sang lusty hymns to a wheezy harmonium and the padre preached a sermon that you couldn't hear anyhow.
