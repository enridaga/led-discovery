There was so much music day and night on that tour with the Jazz Masters that even Bubbles, my Pekinese dog, developed a sensitive ear for it. The last song on my program was "Down Home Blues." On hearing me finish that number Bubbles would know it was time for me to come off. He'd trot out of the dressing room and onto the stage, pawing at my dress to be picked up.
