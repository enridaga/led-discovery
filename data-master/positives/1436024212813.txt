<p>Man, I had a right to be scared when I played my first gig in Chicago, and, believe me, I was. Those were the days of tough competition in solid cats like Roy Palmer and Kid Ory on trombone and Joe Oliver, Tig Chambers, and Sugar Johnny on trumpet--competition that would scare the notes out of anybody, and I was no exception.</p>
<p>I remember I was taking lessons from Roy Palmer when the gig came up. Roy was trombonist with Doc Watson who had all the gigs in town sewn up. Doc had some fine men in his outfit like Roy and William Hightower and Horace Eubanks. After hearing them play so much, I was really scared when Richard Jones asked me to sit in with his band in Chicago. Jones was a wonderful pianist...</p>
