<p>At Edmond's I sang each night the numbers I'd done at the Lincoln --"Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble," "St. Louis Blues," Minor's Blues," and "I Want to Be Somebody's Baby Doll so I Can Get My Lovin' All the Time." Though I often look back on that time as the happiest in my life, working in that cellar was like my tour. There was no set closing time, and once again I was working until unconscious. We'd report at nine o'clock at night and sometimes not get out of there until eight, or even ten, the next morning. Yet we'd make only three or four appearances a night. We always had to wait for our turn to go on. But then we could stay out on that floor long as we liked if the tips kept coming into the kitty. The customers took a great fancy to my blues by the time I'd worked there two weeks. One of their great favorites was "Chinese Blues." I made up my own words for this number, and in the song I acted out my life with Rocky.</p>
