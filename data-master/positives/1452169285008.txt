<p>I never heard any one interpret it [&lsquo;When Passion's Trance&lsquo;] more beautifully than she [Edith Santley] did, nor shall I ever forget how she began the second verse -</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">&ldquo; It were enough to feel, to see</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">Thy soft eyes gazing tenderly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">The way she lingered over the notes to which those words &ldquo;thy soft eyes&rdquo; were set, was absolutely lovely; nor have I ever heard it sung with anything like the exquisite tenderness and restrained passion she put into it. It certainly is supremely interesting to a composer to see how a singer can identify himself with certain of his compositions till he really <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">cannot</em> think of the song apart from him. To me the opening phrase of the second verse of &ldquo;When Passion&rsquo;s Trance&rdquo; is like a lifelike portrait of Edith Santley, nor can I ever connect any one else with it.</p>
