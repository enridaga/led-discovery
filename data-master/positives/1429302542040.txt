<p>Maceo Pinkard allowed me to pal around with him on Broadway, just as though I were really somebody too. I was with him in 1925 on one of the days that I think were very important in the history of Tin Pan Alley. It was the day he wrote "Sweet Georgia Brown." He played it, and looked to me for my reaction. How about that? "It's great," I said, and I sat with him in his office while he made the lead sheet and piano copy. The next day, it was printed, published, and on the street. I heard it on Broadway before anybody but Maceo Pinkard.</p>
