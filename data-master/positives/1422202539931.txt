We were almost opposite to the Queen's Hall of happy memory, and the BBC Symphony had just finished a rehearsal there. I instantly recognized one of their two principal clarinettists, Nicholas Tschaikov, then a man in his fifties and a player with a world-renowned technique, probably second to none in sheer virtuosity. This was painfully and deliciously obvious as he tried out a new clarinet, identical with my own, in that showroom. There really seemed to be nothing he couldn't do with it and he made a great joke of it, playing the finale of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto - the solo fiddle part - at a truly indecent tempo.
