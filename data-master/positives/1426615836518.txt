<p>Two days later I was at Leopold Godowsky&rsquo;s. The lovable old man, no longer active as a pianist, lived up to his reputation as a wit, entertaining his friends and playing some of his clever and overexpanded transcriptions. His nimble fingers&rsquo; appetite, as if not satisfied with the offered intricacies, hungrily snapped with lightning speed at more keys than seemed possible. Almost inaudible, it was fascinating to watch. His son-in-law, David Saperton, played something of Godowsky too-to my surprise, still faster and softer. With Godowsky, I played his Larghetto lamentoso, a singing piece I always liked. Its slow tempo came as a relief.</p>
