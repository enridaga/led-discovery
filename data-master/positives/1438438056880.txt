It was a great occasion, and the public<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>recognized it as such by crowding the house in every part. Rarely have I known Covent Garden to be pervaded so completely by an atmosphere<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of excitement and curiosity. Only five years previous the same opera had been given there in German before a comparatively lukewarm assemblage of Wagner partizans. Now every section of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the operatic community, united in love and admiration for a great artist as well as for a great <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>composer, was fully represented. That the sticklers for the exact letter grumbled at Mancinelli's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>prodigious cuts may go without saying; but that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>could not be helped, and, indeed, their complaints were almost unheard amid the general chorus of gratification and pleasure. </span></p>
