Letter from Mrs. Pendarves to Mrs. Dewes, at Bardley. Bullstrode, 21 Dec. 1740 -
Mr. Handel has got a new singer from Italy. Her voice is between Cuzzoni's and Strada'sâ€”strong, but not harsh, her person miserably bad, being very low, and
excessively crooked. Donellan approves of her : she is not to sing on the stage till after Xmas, so I shall not lose her first performance. Everything harmonious and delightful will bring you more strongly to my mind, a seat that you possess without a rival.
