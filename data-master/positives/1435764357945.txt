<p>I remember the loveable Jimmy Rushing, "Mr. Five by Five", from when we was singing with Bennie Moten and later with Basie. Unlike the run of blues shouters, Jimmy could read music, and he could be heard ten blocks away without a microphone (they used megaphones then, anyway).</p>
<p>Jimmy was big brother to me and some of the other band wives. I remember him playing piano and singing wonderful ballads to us; other times he would keep us laughing with his risqu&eacute; stories, getting a kick out of seeing us blush.</p>
<p>Basie drew Jimmy and several other of Moten's men into his outfit and built the band that blew up a storm at Kaycee's [Kansas City's] Reno Club.</p>
<p>While the Count was getting this group together, he sent out for Jo Jones on drums.</p>
