<p>To Cambridge... Dined in Corpus with an air-marshal whose name I can't remember and then on to <em>King Arthur</em> by the Cambridge Operatic Society. Dryden simply could not go wrong when he wrote for the stage.&nbsp; There is no corner of the cheek his tongue was unacquainted with - the scene where Emmeline recovers her sight is almost Barrie-ish; yet over the whole is the nobility of a Godlike rational technique.&nbsp; The music is neither Godlike nor rational - perhaps only Gluck's is: but O Lord how lovely and how English it is, English in its inadequacies, for Purcell's small-talk is all about the weather, and in its excellencies, its extraordinary poetry and eccentricity, queerness, authenticity of imagination.</p>
