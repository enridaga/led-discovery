<p>The presentation of the medal was accompanied by an address from Mr. Horsley, couched in the following words : " Mr. George Elvey, in the absence of the Gresham Professor of Music, whose advanced age prevents him from attending here to-day, it is my grateful office to present you with this medal. It is highly gratifying to you, sir, and to me, as an English musician, to know that there are persons who have a taste for the highest and noblest productions of our art, and who are ready to hold out every inducement for their cultivation and encouragement. You have well responded to their good intentions. Your anthem, which we have just heard, is calculated to do you the greatest credit, whether we consider it in regard to conception or execution. The style is truly ecclesiastical, the construction of the parts shows that you have carefully studied good authors, and that your mind is imbued with their excellences.</p>
