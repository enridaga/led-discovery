<p>I got to know [Fletcher] Henderson in the 1935-36 period, when I was the arranger for Jack Hylton. We were appearing in Chicago, and I met F.H. through Benny Goodman, for whom Smack [Henderson] made so many arrangements.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Every night after I finished at the Gold Coast Room of the famous Drake Hotel, I used to call for Goodman, and we all proceeded to the Grand Terrace Ballroom, where Henderson was appearing with his band.</p>
<p>For me, the first hearing of Smack's band was a thrill I shall remember for as long as I live. The <em>jump</em>&nbsp;that this band had was simply amazing. In the band was Roy Eldridge--to me the guy who could squeeze anything out of a trumpet--and I have never heard anyone reach so high in my life. Then there was Buster Bailey on clarinet--who Benny thought was the last word-- and a tenor player, Chu Berry.</p>
<p>Yes, I agree that Coleman Hawkins was and is great, but Chu played choruses that really would "make the angels sing."</p>
