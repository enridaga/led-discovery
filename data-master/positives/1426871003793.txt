 However, the whole affair seemed to have had an adverse effect on Beecham for at the second concert, in spite of having al the correct music and an international broadcast scheduled and advertised, he decided to play a totally different programme again. Astonished listeners in England, including my own family, kept hearing one piece announced and a different one played throughout the broadcast and the poor fourth flute, who had come all the way just to play in Arnold Bax's "Garden of Fand", which was never performed, had nothing to do but get dreadfully drunk.
