<p>On Easter Monday we went up to visit the Murrys &amp; see Hampstead Heath.&nbsp; Our verdict was that the crowd at close quarters is detestable; it smells; it sticks; it has neither vitality nor colour; it is a tepid mass of flesh scarcely organised into human life.&nbsp; How slow they walk! How passively and brutishly they lie on the grass!&nbsp; How little of pleasure or pain is in them! But they looked well dressed &amp; well fed; &amp; at a distance among the canary coloured swings &amp; roundabouts they had the look of a picture...Yet the sight had its charm: I liked the bladders, &amp; the little penny sticks, &amp; the sight of two elaborate dancers performing to a barrel organ in a space the size of a hearthrug.&nbsp;</p>
