Rubinstein, whom we heard fourteen years ago in London as a prodigy, appeared now as a composer of a Symphony, which he has named 'Ocean.' The clearness of the first movement had the same soothing effect on me as a calm unruffled summer sea; afterwards, however, we had all the storming and roaring that are now the fashion, and the boisterous elements became so hopelessly incomprehensible that my thoughts could find no anchorage in their unfathomable harmonic depths. I fully recognize, however, in Rubinstein a pre-eminent talent for composition.
