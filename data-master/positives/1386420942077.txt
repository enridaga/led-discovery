Lord Nelson's van was strong - three 3-deckers, viz. Victory, Temeraire and Neptune, and four 74s... the bands playing 'God Save the King', 'Rule Britannia', and 'Britons Strike Home'; the crews stationed on the forecastle of the different ships cheering the ship ahead of them when the enemy began to fire, sent those feelings to our hearts that ensured us victory.
