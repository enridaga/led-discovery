Paul Mendelssohn asked me, in the name of his sister-in-law, to join Hauptmann, David, and Rietz in editing his brother's posthumous works, a service which I shall render with affection and reverence. The very next evening some movements of the posthumous quartet were tried at David's. One in F minor is, I think, the most valuable; the Quintet in B major, too, is a great work.
