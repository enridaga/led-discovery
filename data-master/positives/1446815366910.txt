<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I have a mix of very happy memories from my many varied visits to the Royal Albert Hall, from classical masterpieces to modern day performers like the Gotan Project and Jamie Cullum, the Festival Hall never failed to entertain, inside and outside of the auditorium with those friendly spaces and wonderful views.I can't wait to see it in it's latest incarnation.Thanks for the memories and here's to the future</p>
