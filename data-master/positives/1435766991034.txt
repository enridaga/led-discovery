The little theatre in the Haymarket opened on June 25th, and brought out "The Kentish Barons," a play in three acts, interspersed with music; the drama by the Honourable Francis North, second son of Lord North, the prime minister ; the airs were composed by Miss Monk, a dilettante, and very dilettante-like music it was. The language was bold and poetical, and written in elegant blank verse ; but, owing to the inferiority of the music, it did not meet with unequivocal success. On the first night, I went behind the scenes, and was introduced to its witty author, who honoured me with the most marked friendship and regard during the remainder of his life. I was so much pleased with the poetry of one of the songs, that I requested a copy of it from the noble 
author, to which I composed the music, and often sang it to him and the kind, good Countess of Guilford, both now no more. 
SONG. Written by Francis, Earl of Guilford. 
I.
No, Clifford, no, for six long years 
I felt a lover's hopes and fears; 
The raging frenzy now is past, 
Peace dawns upon my heart at last. 
II. 
Think not that I'd inconstant prove, 
Where once I vow'd eternal love ; 
My heart had still felt all its flame, 
Had beauteous Laura felt the same. 
III. 
Doom'd absence-lingering pangs to try, 
I felt a transport in each sigh ; 
My lot was happy, though severe, 
And pleasure mingled in each tear. 
IV. 
In vain I tried each honest art 
To fix her foolish fickle heart ; 
But since she's gone, e'en let her go ; 
I'll sigh no more, no, Clifford, no.
