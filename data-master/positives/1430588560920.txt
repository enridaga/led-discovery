<p>The Sunday following this exhibition was appointed for my concert, and the room, owing to the popularity and interest of the Marquis and Marchioness, was crowded ; Signer Barbella conducted the performance ; Signor Salinbeni was first violin ; and, luckily, Signora Chiavaci, a very good singer, was passing through Verona on her way to the theatre at Bergamo at the time, and being an intimate friend of Signor Barbella, at his request, she agreed to stop a day and sing at my concert, which she did gratuitously, and was much and deservedly applauded.</p>
