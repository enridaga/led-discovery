<p style="text-align: left;">After that Mum &amp; I go to G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung at the Opera. The orchestra wasn't at its best; the horns not being at all Wiener Philharmonische standard. Br&ugrave;nhilde (Konetzi) was very fine indeed - Kalundberg as Siegfried not coming up to her at all. The scenery was fine, tho' the end was distinctly lame for the music, but then what wouldn't be? Krauss was fine, but somehow alot of the Act III was disappointing; notably the funeral march.&nbsp;</p>
