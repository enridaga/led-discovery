But I haven't mentioned the Opera yet. Never have I heard the Barber as last week with Lablache, Rubini and Malibran (Garcia), nor Otello as with Rubini, Pasta and Lablache; or again, Italiana in Algeri as with Rubini, Lablache and Mme Raimbeaux. Now, if ever, I have everything in Paris. You cannot conceive what Lablache is like! They say that Pasta has gone off, but I never saw anything more 
sublime. Malibran impresses you merely by her marvellous voice, but no one sings like her. Miraculous! Marvellous! Rubini is an excellent tenor. He sings true notes, never falsetto and sometimes his ornamental runs go on for hours (but sometimes his decorative passages are too long and he deliberately uses a tremolo effect, besides trilling endlessly which, however, brings him the greatest applause). His mezza voce is incomparable.
