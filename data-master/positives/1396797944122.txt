At five they [the patients] had tea, each landing feeding its own men. It was a big job feeding my 70-odd - and they did all eat. They looked rather pretty, sitting under the decorations in their blue clothes and the caps from their crackers. We iced two of the cakes and lit fancy candles on them, then after tea they settled down to a sing-song among themselves. The CO came and told them a few Irish stories and I joined Matron’s party to go to dinner at the officers’ mess. I did not want to, as I was very tired, but I enjoyed it very much, all the same. We had a good dinner with claret, champagne and port. Then there were toasts to King George - for which we all rose in our places - to us, the sisters - for which the men rose - and after drinking the toast they sang ‘For They Are Jolly Good Fellows’. After dinner some of the others joined us and we had games and music round the Christmas tree and finally went home around midnight.
