<p>... [W]hen we got home, there, in the front parlour, stood a new instrument, another upright, but in a plain black case, severe, formidable. &nbsp;No piano-slip, no photograph frames, no vases, softened its professional outline. &nbsp;It stood apart, like a priest, expressionless, different from the fussy life around it &hellip;</p>
<p>Slowly... [Jack] advanced towards the piano, his face expressionless, though a false diagnosis might have described it as sulky. &nbsp;I leaned forward to peer round the archway. &nbsp;I saw him pause, then open the lid. &nbsp;The keyboard, dead-white instead of the colour of old teeth, was as austere as the ebony case. &nbsp;He drew up a chair, sat down, and raised his hands above the keys. &nbsp;Another pause followed. &nbsp;He may have been afraid, or incredulous.</p>
<p>Then he struck a chord and ran up and down a scale. &nbsp;Even my childish ear recognised at once the quality of tone. &nbsp;It had a velvet softness, but there lay upon this velvet a clear-cut diamond of sound.</p>
<p>Jack leaned forward as though he were losing his senses. &nbsp;Then he began to play, and I recall the piece; it was a Spanish dance from an album called &lsquo;From Foreign Parts&rsquo;, by Maurice Moszkowski. &nbsp;He had memorised it before returning the book to the library.</p>
<p>I do not know who was the more entranced and surprised, Mother or I. &nbsp;We stood, clinging to each other, listening to those crystal notes, and I had the illusion of <em>seeing</em> them as well as hearing them, so hard, so clear, dropping into the incongruous cosiness of our Victorian sitting-room &hellip;</p>
<p>...Here was an experience that demanded more than I was capable of at seven years of age. &nbsp;I stared at the black beauty, and at my brother seated at it, back bent, a frown on his face. &nbsp;I identified the two. &nbsp;They were creatures of a kind. &nbsp;They belonged to the same incarnation, remote from the world of suburban Battersea &hellip;</p>
<p>It might be hyperbolical to suggest that Jack and the new piano recognised each other: but so it seemed &hellip;</p>
<p>Mother and I were so completely hypnotised by the music itself, and by the quality of Jack&rsquo;s technique revealed through the connivance of the new instrument, that Father came home unperceived, without either of us noticing &hellip;</p>
