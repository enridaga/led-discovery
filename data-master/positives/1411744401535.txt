Of the many American stars who appeared at the Empire, I place one high above the rest. She was Lena Horne and I have never seen or heard any singer quite like her. Teeny-boppers, thank God, didn’t exist then or, if they did, they didn’t bop in the theatres. Lena Home was listened to with love and, can I say it, with respect.
