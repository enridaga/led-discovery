[Storace] received me politely, and informed me that his opera of " La Scuola dei Gelosi," was the first to be performed, in which I was to make my debut...The Emperor, Joseph II. accompanied by his brother Maximilian, the Archbishop of Cologne, were present at the performance, and evinced their approbation by the applause they bestowed. At the period I speak of, the Court of Vienna was, perhaps, the most brilliant in Europe. The theatre, which forms part of the Royal Palace, was crowded with a blaze of beauty and fashion. All ranks of society were doatingly fond of music, and most of them perfectly understood the science. Indeed, Vienna then was a place where pleasure was the order of the day and night.
