Mabel Ritchie sings my 3 songs before going off by train at 9.48. Walk with Mummy, Beth, & Caesar, & pack in morning. Catch 2.31 to London. Mum & Pop bring me to station in car. Pretty good journey, on time. Meet Barbara, by accident, in Metropolitan, at Nottinghill Gate. Attempt to write in evening, but am driven to desperation by a loud wireless on landing outside.
