In the winter of 1848-49 I ventured upon a series of six chamber-music concerts, assisted by two modest local artists ; but in spite of the efforts of my friends, who canvassed most energetically for subscribers, their total number reached only sixty-seven; the sale of single tickets for the first concert amounted to three, and to a few more for each one of the succeeding concerts. These were small beginnings indeed, but did not dishearten me. Every item in the programme was new to the small audience and received with appreciation.
