<p>It was long past midnight when Hellmesberger&nbsp;suddenly rose in his place and exclaimed, "Enough talk&nbsp;for the present. Let us have some music. Sivori is&nbsp;dying to play us something classical of his own composition; and I &mdash; I have brought with me a new quartet by&nbsp;a young composer whose name I forget &mdash; he is a mere&nbsp;boy and none of you have ever heard of him &mdash; which I&nbsp;and my comrades here would like to play to Volkmann.&nbsp;Heckenast, I know you have a four- sided desk somewhere in this hovel of yours; produce it, and let us get&nbsp;to work. We will play in the next room, opening the&nbsp;folding doors, and my Englishman shall turn over. Our&nbsp;audience &mdash; including the maestro who looks so comfortable that I would not have him disturbed for the world &mdash;&nbsp;shall remain in here and listen, if they please to do so."&nbsp;Sivori laughingly begged to be allowed to hear the "new&nbsp;work" before contributing his mite to the entertainment,&nbsp;and without further delay the prearranged "surprise"&nbsp;was put into execution. Volkmann sat ensconced in a&nbsp;huge arm-chair, smoking a powerful Partagas, his eyes half-dosed, and his whole attitude expressive of that&nbsp;blissful state of body and mind, bight kief. As the&nbsp;executants commenced the spirited Allegro with which&nbsp;his G minor quartet opens, every eye was turned towards&nbsp;him. He started up, as though stricken by an electric&nbsp;shock, hastily put down his cigar and clutched both arms&nbsp;of the fauteuil, looking about him confusedly, like one&nbsp;suddenly awakened from a deep sleep. Presently, he&nbsp;sank back into his seat, covering his face with his hands;&nbsp;and when we next caught a glimpse of his sad grey eyes,&nbsp;they were wet with happy tears. Never before or since&nbsp;that memorable night have I heard the quartet &mdash; perhaps&nbsp;his most passionate and romantic composition for&nbsp;strings &mdash; so magnificently played, or so enthusiastically&nbsp;applauded. At its close, a shout of "Eljen &amp; Volkmann!" was raised by all present, and Heckenast called&nbsp;upon his guests to drink " the Master's " health in brimming bumpers of Roederer. Rendered speechless by&nbsp;glad emotion, Volkmann could only express his gratification by repeatedly pressing the artistic hands that had&nbsp;wrought him such paramount pleasure, his cheeks glistening the while with "unfamiliar brine." A little later,&nbsp;when he had recovered his self-possession, he sat down&nbsp;to the piano of his own accord and held us spellbound&nbsp;for some twenty minutes with an improvisation "on a&nbsp;heroic subject" (which I recognised years after in his&nbsp;recueil of "Musical Poems," intituled "Visegrad"),&nbsp;ever to be remembered by the survivors of that joyous&nbsp;company as an extempore production of unique beauty&nbsp;and indescribable fascination.&nbsp;</p>
