<p>I was doing one-nighters all over New Orleans in yacht clubs, country clubs, and promoting my own dances at Pete Lala's hall Sundays and Cooperative Hall on Mondays. These were the top jobs in New Orleans. After he joined me, Louis [Armstrong] improved so fast it was amazing. He had a wonderful ear and a wonderful memory. All you had to do was to hum or whistle a new tune to him and he'd know it right away. And if he played a new tune once, he never forgot it. Within six months, everybody in New Orleans knew about him.</p>
