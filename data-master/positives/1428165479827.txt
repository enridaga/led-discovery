The opera in which I was to make my appearance at Florence, was " II Francese in Italia," " the Frenchman in Italy....The eventful night fixed for my first appearance at length arrived. I made my debut, and received a most flattering reception. I was encored in two of my songs and a duet. Though, at that time, I would not have exchanged situations with the Grand Duke himself, I was so elated by my success ; yet I could not avoid attributing it, in a great 
measure, to my extreme youth, and the strong party made for me by Lord and Lady Cowper, and all the English that were in Florence ; besides, I was the first British male singer who had ever sung in Italy, or indeed on the Continent. Several other persons of distinction also patronised my first appearance, which was honoured by the presence of the Pretender, who entered his box before the opera began...in this state he visited one of the theatres every night (he had a box in each) ; in a few minutes after he was seated, he fell asleep, and continued to slumber during the whole performance.
