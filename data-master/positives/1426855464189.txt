Sometimes I'm asked about my biggest musical influence as a kid. I always give one name: Mr. Wylie Pitman. I called him Mr. Pit. 

Now you won't find Mr. Pit in any history of Jazz, and the man's not in the Down Beat Hall of Fame. But sweethearts, you can take my word for it: Mr. Pit could play some sure-enough boogie-woogie piano. And best of all, he lived down the road from us. 

Red Wing Cafe. I can see the big ol' red sign smack in front of me right now. That was Mr. Pit's place. It was a little general store where he and his wife, Miss Georgia, sold items... [and] rented out rooms. 

Mama and me were always welcome there and, in fact, during one period when we were really down and out, we lived at the Red Wing Cafe for a while.
