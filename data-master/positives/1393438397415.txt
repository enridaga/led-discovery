We have all been attending the celebration of the anniversary of the legal establishment of Protestant worship in Heidelberg two hundred years ago (the whole country had been Protestant long before, for it has the honour of being among the earliest to renounce sanctioned corruptions, though it did not till 1656 attain liberty of worship from its rulers), which took place amid the circumstances which mark and assist simple earnestness of feeling—a hymn sung forth from the church-tower, accompanied by the Posanne [sic] (trombone) at sunset on Saturday and at daybreak on Sunday—as is done on all great festivals: overflowing congregations, and eloquent preaching from Schenkel.
