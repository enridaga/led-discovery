<p>At this period, the Beggar's Opera was prohibited by the Irish Government from being acted, which of course made the public more eager to see it. It was suggested, that if I could make interest to get permission to have it acted for my benefit, it would draw a great house. I, therefore, waited on my good friend, Mrs. Jefferies, sister to Lord Clare, the Lord Chancellor, to entreat her to use her influence with his Lordship to get me permission to have it acted. She pleaded my cause with great zeal, got a verdict in my favour, and the performance of it brought me an overflowing house. The managers ought to have been well pleased that I took this measure and carried it; for the piece, ever since that time, has kept its station on the Dublin stage.</p>
