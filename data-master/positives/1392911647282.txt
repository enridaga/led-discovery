Our Durhamers ... have been so eager upon piping and singing, that in stead of the Morning Prayer at 6. of the clock, which was wont to be read distinctly and plainly, for Schotlers, and Artificers before they began their work, they brought in a solemne Service, with singing and Organs, Sackbuts and Cornets, little whereof could be understood of the people, neither would they suffer them Sacrament to be administred without a continuall noise of Musick, both instrumentall and vocal, to the great disturbance of these holy actions.
