<p style="text-align: justify;">Here let me refer, par parenthese, to the English debut of Edouard de Reszke. That event properly belongs to 1880, when he appeared for the first time at Covent Garden as Indra in "Le Roi de Lahore." He was then about twenty-six, and his noble bass voice had already developed in full splendor the richness of timbre and amplitude of volume for which it is remarkable. He lacked ex- perience, of course ; the art of later years was yet to come. Still, the sonority and grandeur of his tones were an unalloyed delight, notably in such parts as Basilio, St. Bris, Count Rodolfo, and Walter ("William Tell"), and he instantly won hearty favor. He returned regularly for the four succeeding seasons.</p>
