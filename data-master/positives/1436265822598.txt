<p>The second occasion was at Osborne House, Isle of Wight. I went with M. Johannes Wolff and M. Joseph Hollman in 1889 to play there before the Queen. We played part of Mendelssohn's Trio in D minor I remember the late Prince Henry of Battenberg turning over the leaves for me, and telling me that he often played the 'cello. The Queen gave me a pair of gold sleeve-links, with a diamond in the middle of each. Just as at Balmoral, it was nearly dark when we arrived at Osborne, and I had no opportunity of seeing the natural beauties of the place.</p>
