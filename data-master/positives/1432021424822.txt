Only the professors and their wives were invited, and everybody was dressed in mourning. After preliminary music, one of the Directors, standing before Mendelssohn's bust, made a speech to the pupils, exhorting them to emulate their great model, the founder of the Institution. The ceremony was very imposing, and we were particularly struck with one of the last songs of Mendelssohn, which Frau Frege gave with exquisite pathos. Joachim led the F minor Quartet admirably, and with the correct conception of the work.
