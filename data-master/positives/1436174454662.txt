<p>I recollect, when I was staying at Orleans House, the Duchesse d'Aumale telling me that Her Majesty Queen Amelie, the exiled Queen of France, widow of King Louis Philippe, was coming to her in a few days to hear her play some duets for piano and harmonium with me, and we had several rehearsals. On the eventful day the Queen arrived, with her entourage of the old French nobility, including the Duc de Montmorency. She was a tall, stately woman, with a very dignified air. She complimented us both warmly on the music, and added a few gracious words to me.</p>
