<p>In April, 1874, Sir George's oratorio, "The Resurrection and Ascension," was performed by the St. George's Choral Union at the Queen's Hall, Glasgow, and met with marked approval. We cannot refrain from quoting from a full description which was printed with the book of words for the occasion. After going through each movement it concludes thus : "So ends a work replete with the most scholarly writing, the most tasteful and elegant melodial designs, the most genuine impulse of a poetical nature, with a dignified and yet tender expression of the purest and most exalted Christian sentiment."</p>
