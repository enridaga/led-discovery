The first show was Shaw's "Saint Joan" with music composed by Herbert Menges who did most of the West End theatre music at that time. The conductor was Arliss Marriott who also played the flute and had apparently invented a plan for a sort of computerized flute where everything would be electronically controlled! Besides flute and clarinet the band consisted of violin (John Stratton) bassoon, (Cecil James) trombone, (Morris Smith) possible a cello and a trumpet for fanfares. The Saint Joan was Helen Hayes, Cecil Trouncer the Grand Inquisitor - I shall never forget his wonderful voice in that tremendously long speech in the Trial Scene - and Alec Clunes was Gilles de Rais. Shaw was present at the later rehearsals, sitting in the stalls and making comments in his beautiful soft Irish voice. I remember he was very pleased with Helen Hayes but told her that she must not try to act too much - "be simple".
