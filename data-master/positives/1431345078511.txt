And Glazunov played the piano rather well, I must add. In an original manner, but well. He didn’t have a real piano technique and he often played without removing his famous cigar from his right hand. Glazunov held the cigar between his third and fourth fingers. I’ve seen It myself. And yet he managed to every note, absolutely everything, including the most difficult passages. It looked as though Glazunov’s fat fingers were melting in the keys, drowning in them. Glazunov could also sightread the most complicated score and make it sound as though an excellent orchestra were playing.
