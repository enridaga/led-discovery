During my stay in Paris I was a witness of the impressive funeral cortege of Gambetta. The playing of Chopin's Funeral March by one of the bands in the
procession (I think it was the band of the Republican Guard) was truly superb. At some of the Colonne concerts, also, I was particularly struck by the brass of the orchestra ; it seemed to me superior to anything I had heard in England. But probably one would not be able to say the same to-day.
