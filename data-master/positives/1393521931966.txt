The Harper amuses me, but I shall have too much of him if detained longer than to-morrow. You would like that appendage to Welch inns; it makes them chearful; and you would like the looks of the people -- it is usually women who are the drudges, and all the girls seem to me to be very pretty, very goodhumoured, laughing, and talkative; the lower sort of people all are without the least affectation. A tour in Wales with one's own horses, if one had time and money enough for that purpose, would be very pleasant.
