Yesterday I [Sir Charles Halle] first rehearsed with Wieniawsky ; then, at Joachim's, I 
assisted at the rehearsal of the Beethoven quartets that he is to play on Wednesday; it was magnificent, I have rarely had a greater treat. It gave me such a rage for work that I practised from dinner-time until one o'clock in the morning, and wish I could begin again to-day.
