<p style="text-align: justify;">[My] younger brother, Max, had shown considerable aptitude for the violin, and was taking lessons from Louis Ries, the well-known " second violin " of the Monday "Pops." Afterward he studied under the late J. T. Carrodus, and joined the orchestra of the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, of which Carrodus was for many years the <em>chef-d'attaque</em>. I used to play Max's accompaniments in the family circle; and it was solely the fraternal spirit of emulation, impelling me to try to shine side by side with my younger brother, that led me to keep up my study of music.</p>
