<p>My companion prevailed on me to accompany him to Padua, where he had business to transact. It was very little out of our way, and I had a strong desire to see that learned city. When we arrived, we went to an inn, called the Stella d'Oro. Padua was interesting to me, as the birth-place of Tartini ; and the two greatest singers of their time were living there retired, Pachierotti and Guadagni. The latter was a Cavaliere. He had built a house, or rather a palace, in which he had a very neat theatre, and a company of puppets, which represented L' Orpheo e Euridice ; himself singing the part of Orpheo behind the scenes. It was in this character, and in singing Gluck's beautiful rondo in it, " Che faro senza Euridice," that he distinguished himself in every theatre in Europe, and drew such immense houses in London.</p>
