Being so full of interesting, unforgettable events, our ten-day sojourn in this wonderful republic simply flew past. The most vivid impressions I have are of my many meetings with the people of Kirghizia. About thirty concerts were given during the ten days. We even met people on the highways, along which our caravan of vehicles travelled&hellip; On the mountain pastures and in the cotton fields we met highly cultured people, who displayed broad interests and made some very true and interesting judgments about music. We saw with our own eyes that communism is not just a dream, but a reality, being brought about by the Sovet people, including the workers of Kirghizia. </span></p>
