All I can say with regard to the whole matter is that when an important Russian orchestra recently came to give a concert at the Festival Hall I attended the rehearsal, and my attention was immediately drawn to the poor quality of the viola section. In the interval I scrutinized these violas and found most of them to be ridiculously under-sized instruments, quite incapable of producing deep C string sonority.
