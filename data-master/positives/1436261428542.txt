<p>On April 17th M. Emil Sauret played Heinrich Ernst's F sharp minor Concerto, consisting of one movement called Allegro Pathetique. I had engaged him specially from Berlin to play for me, and he acquitted himself splendidly. For this concert I had also engaged Madame Marie Roze, who sang Gluck's air from <em>Alceste</em>, "Divinites du Styx," and the aria "L'amer saro constante" from <em>Il Re Pastore</em>, by Mozart, with violin obbligato by Sauret. I suggested this beautiful song to Madame Roze because I had first heard it sung by Jenny Lind on her musical tour in 1856 to Ernst's obligato, and was always so charmed with its beauty and the way she sang it that I had never forgotten it. Rubinstein's Symphony in F major was given as a novelty.</p>
