Chicago cast, for<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the rentree of Jean de Reszke; but the opera failed <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to please.
Not even the genius of the artist could <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>invest with enduring interest a work consistently <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>sombre, undramatic, and dull.
