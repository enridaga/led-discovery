<p>Things have moved very rapidly of late years. It was only in 1904, I remember, when Massenet's opera Herodiade was given at Covent Garden for Madame Calve, that the management were compelled by the Censor to change the title of the opera. The title chosen was Salome, as likely to give less offence to public prejudice! Herod was renamed Moriame, roi d'Ethiope, and Herodias was also renamed. But it was difficult to make the illusion complete. In the scene in the Temple the seven-branched candlestick was seen, and Madame Calve led a procession of girls carrying palms and singing " Hosanna." When the Roman prefect appeared and began his address to the Ethiopian crowd, he mistook their nationality and addressed them as " Peuple juif " !</p>
