Ordinary practise  in  morning, with  Mass  afterwards.  Practise  2â€”3, then College. V. nice lesson with Benjamin. Go to Shaftsbury Avenue to H. Reeves; get Tchaikovsky concerto (Bb) cheap ed. & Ravel. Bolero soiled (4/6) Go to B.B.C. Symphony concert with Mrs. Bridge in evening. The orchestra is most magnificent material; but I dislike Boult; he doesn't play a stringed instrument & you can tell it by listening to the strings. Beethoven 8th disappointing. Rubenstein played the Tch. [Tchaikovsky Bb] concerto magnificently, but rather as if he didn't like it.
