I have found a Motet of Josquin superior to all I sent you; but it was too long to print or even transcribe, but I hope to shew it, & chew it with you some time or other. Oh! I like all things to compare notes, & sentiments about these matters, & am extremely pleased with your comments, & remarks. They proceed from great knowledge of Harmony, & & experience in musical effects in full compositions. When I work at your remarks on my MS I'll have a letter on the stocks, & tell you all my feelings whether similar, or different from yours.
