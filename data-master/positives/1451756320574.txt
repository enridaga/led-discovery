<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">The orchestral rehearsals of my version of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Boris Godunov</em>, in the capable hands of Samuil Samosud, afforded me much pleasure. I was also shown sketches for the stage sets of the opera by the artist Pavel Williams. They are very good. / The Bolshoi Theatre singers chosen for the opera are also excellent, and I have no doubt that this production will turn out to be an important landmark in the history of Soviet theatre. </span></p>
