<p>They passed through Medst&uuml;gan one day, and a tiny little woman belonging to the company came to the cottage where DD. [Miss Edith Balfour] and I were staying. We were in the garden, and she saw one of the guitars lying on a bench near us. She picked it up eagerly and brought it to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play, play! &rdquo; she said in Swedish.</p>
<p>I took it up and said to DD., &ldquo;Let us sing her that little German Volkslied, &lsquo;Verlassen, Verlassen.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 12.55pt; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; margin: 0cm 56.0pt .0001pt 0cm;">She didn&rsquo;t take her eyes off us from beginning to end. She seemed utterly lost to everything else around her. As we finished the tender little melody, to which I sang an alto part, she suddenly buried her face in her hands and burst into tears ! She cried and cried, till we felt quite distressed. After a few moments she took up the guitar and stroked it lovingly. I only knew a few words of Swedish, but I managed to tell her that I would make her a present of one, and she was so delighted that I was more than glad to have had this happy thought.</p>
