Sir,
The rest of your Thermometricall Discourse is safely come to my hands:1 only I must give a litle advertisement concerning the Carrier, from whom when 'twas  sent to my house, there was not only demanded by the porter his due for his peins of bringing it (which was satisfied by me, as formerly) but also for the carriage from Oxford to London: But when I lookd upon the roll, I found a piece of the Cover torne out, just where the words, Carrier paid, are wont to be written: which making me suspect a Cheat, I refused to pay that part of the demand, shewing the ground of my suspicion to the sheporter that brought it me, who would putt it of upon the being rubbed of in the sack among other things.
