<p>Mel [Fr&auml;ulein Marie Stieffel] was a first-rate musician, and played the piano beautifully. The first time I remember really appreciating music was on one winter afternoon. I was alone in the sitting-room, trying to do my lessons, perched up on my favourite window-seat. In reality I was listening to the trio my governess was playing in the next room with a violinist and &rsquo;cello player, friends of hers, who used sometimes to come over from Mannheim to make music with her. I don&rsquo;t know what they were playing,&mdash;it was probably something classical,&mdash;but it began to affect me very strangely. I felt horribly sad, but I wasn&rsquo;t crying. I was simply longing for something, but I didn&rsquo;t know what. After a while they left off playing, and Mel came into the sitting-room to see what I was doing. Evidently I didn&rsquo;t look quite normal, for she asked me what was the matter. I said in a choking voice, &ldquo; I think I have a sore throat.&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t a sore throat, but it was the first time I had ever had a lump in my throat, and I didn&rsquo;t know what it meant then.</p>
