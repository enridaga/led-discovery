All my NY News is probably stale for you by now.  Virgil’s opera was original-looking on stage – no one has ever seen anything quite like it before. But I thought there was more music in Four Saints [in Three Acts].  It’s as if a new musical idea hasn’t occurred to him in 10 years.  The prosody, as per usual, is superb – but then it’s easy to have good prosody is you have nothing else on your mind (I’m quoting myself).
