<p>Tamberlik studied with me Meyerbeer's <em>Le Prophete</em>, and also the title-role in Hector Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini. I was present at the first performance of the latter opera on June 25th, 1853. Berlioz conducted it himself, but it had no success, and was withdrawn after the second performance. My disappointment was great, as I had also coached Madame Nantier Didie for the part of Ascanio. My diary says: "May 22nd. To Madame Didie. M. Berlioz there: tried over Madame Didiee's part for his opera Benvenuto Cellini, which is to be pro- duced at Covent Garden under his direction. He beat time and I accompanied this difficult music prima vista."</p>
