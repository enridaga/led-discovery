In Kaycee [Kansas City] we had a kind of counterpart of [Art] Tatum, an ear man called Sleepy, who played almost as much as Art, and in the hard key--A natural, B natural, E natural. 

Another unsung piano player was Lincoln, known as a three chord man. His harmonies were the worst, yet he was terrific with the beat. Martha Raye, then eighteen, stopped in Kansas City on her way to California  and got hung up listening to Lincoln's nasty beat. She stayed close on to two weeks, and was down at the clubs digging the music and singing like mad, night after night. Martha hated to leave and nearly missed doing her picture. That was how Kaycee would get to you, for there were always places open and music to hear.
