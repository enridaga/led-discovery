<p>Today Ethel comes.&nbsp; On Monday I went to hear her rehearse at Lady Lewis's.&nbsp; A vast Portland Place house with the cold wedding cake Adams' plaster: shabby red carpets; flat surfaces washed with dull greens.&nbsp; The rehearsal was in a long room with a bow window looking on, in fact in, to other houses - iron staircases, chimneys, roofs - a barren brick outlook.&nbsp; There was a roaring fire in the Adams grate.&nbsp; Lady L. now a shapeless sausage, &amp; Mrs Hunter, a swathed satin sausage, sat side by side on a sofa.&nbsp; Ethel stood at the piano in the window, in her battered felt, in her jersey &amp; short skirt conducting with a pencil. There was a drop at the end of her nose.&nbsp; Miss Suddaby was singing the Soul, &amp; I observed that she went through precisely the same attitudes of ecstasy and inspiration in the room, as in a hall. There were two young or youngish men.&nbsp; Ethel's pince nez rode nearer &amp; nearer the tip of her nose.&nbsp; She sang now &amp; then; &amp; once taking the bass, made a cat squalling sound - but everything she does with such forthrightness directness that there is nothing ridiculous.&nbsp; She loses self-consciousness completely.&nbsp; She seems all vitalised; all energised: she knocks her fat from side to side. Strides rhythmincally down the room to signify to Elizabeth that this is the Greek melody; strides back; Now the furniture moving begins, she said, referring to some supernatural gambols connected with the prisoner's escape, or defiance or death. I suspect the music is too literary - too stressed - too didactic for my taste.&nbsp; But I am always impressed by the fact that it is music - I mean that she has spun these coherent chords harmonies melodies out of her so practical vigorous, strident mind.&nbsp; What if she should be a great composer? This fantastic idea is to her the merest commonplace: it is the fabric of her being.&nbsp; As she conducts, she hears music like Beethoven's.&nbsp; As she strides &amp; turns &amp; wheels about to us perched mute on chairs she thinks this is about the most important event now takign place in London. And perhaps it is.</p>
