Christmas past and Christmas gone!... Must have had the biggest crowd of visitors in our No. 1 of any in the hospital.... The Major turned up bringing some Belgian officers with him. He had brought a Belgian band over from Criel and they played round and round the camp, then went and had tea and great festivities in the Mess.
