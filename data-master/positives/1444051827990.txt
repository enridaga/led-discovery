<p>I dine to-day wdth Sir John and Bunny, in the afternoon sit with Lady W. Yesterday I dined at Mrs. Percival's, and in the afternoon Phil and I went to the oratorio at Lincoln's Inn, composed by Porpora, an Italian, famous for church music, who is now in England : it is a fine solemn piece of music, but I confess I think the subject too solemn for a theatre. To have words of piety made use of only to introduce good music, is reversing what it ought to be, and most of the people that hear the oratorio make no reflection on the meaning of the words, though God is addressed in the most solemn manner; some of the choruses and recitative are extremely fine and touching, but they say it is not equal to Mr. Handel's oratorio of Esther or Deborah.</p>
