<p>In 1955 I was a 22-year-old teacher in training. I attended several concerts in the Festival Hall 1955-60. Which do I remember? Which one do I cherish most? Oct 57 Holst's The Planets LPO conducted by Boult.&nbsp; Oct 58 Bizet and Franck Symphonies RPO conducted by Beecham. November 59 Beethoven's Choral Symphony Philharmonia Joan Sutherland and Jon Vickers conducted by Klemperer.&nbsp; December 59 Haydn, Mozart, Liszt and Rossini RPO conducted by Beecham.&nbsp; June 61 Stravinsky's Firebird and Orff's Carmina Burana conducted by Stokowski.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the best? July 1956 Verdi's Requiem conducted by Guido Cantelli (his last in London) with Schwarzkopf / Tagliavini / Ebe Stignani. Wonderful.</p>
