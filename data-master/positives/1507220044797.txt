And there, all the trumpets and knights and lords and heralds of arms in their coats of arms. And after, all they in their scarlet and all the bishops in scarlet. And the Queen and all the footmen waiting upon the Queen to Westminster Hall. And there Her Grace was changed. And in the hall there met all the bishops and all the chapel with three crosses and in their copes, the bishops mitered and singing <em>Salve festa dies</em>. And all the street laid with gravel and blue cloth unto the abbey and railed on every side. And so to the abbey to Mass. And there Her Grace was crowned.&nbsp;</span></p>
