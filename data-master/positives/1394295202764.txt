They sing in parts, keeping the Same time and varying the 4 notes without ever going beyond them.  So many singers & so few notes you always hear the whole together.  The difference of Words and Voices make some variety.  The Singers (that I heard) were all women.  One confined herself entirely to the Lower Note which acted as a Drone.  They sing slow and ended with the minor Chord
