...I arrived at Hereford in time for the morning service at the cathedral, and on entering the organ-loft found a clergyman presiding at the instrument. I was much pleased by the manner in which he treated it, presuming him to be an amateur. The choir immediately attracted my attention by the taste with which the service was executed. On expressing this I was informed that the vicars-choral were all clergymen, and that no one could hold that office, or become organist, but a graduate of the university. Having visited nearly all the cathedrals, this was the first instance iin which I found educated persons appointed to those offices. The organist politely introduced me to these gentlemen, and in the afternoon I was treated with a delightful service...[O]n the Sunday morning I promised myself a further acquaintance with these gentlemen, and went in good time to the minster in expectation of meeting my friends. I found an inferior performer at the instrument, and was told that the gentlemen choristers were all absent, being gone to do duty at their respetive livings in the neighbourhood; and that Sunday was the only day in the week the cathedral service was not performed. The psalm-singing by the congregation had no charms for me, and I left Hereford with gloom and disappointment.
