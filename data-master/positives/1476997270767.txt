<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;">When critics complain that they are tired of familiar masterpieces and even talk, as I once heard one do, of a desire to ban certain works like the Beethoven symphonies for a period of years, I wonder if they give a thought to the many who, at every concert, may be hearing them for the first time?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Berlin Philharmonic played on this, for me, historic occasion nothing more adventurous than the Third Brandenburg Concerto, the Fifth Symphony, <em>Tod und Verkl&auml;rung</em>, and the Prelude to <em>Meistersinger</em> &ndash; works so well-known that the composers&rsquo; names are redundant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yet the word &lsquo;unadventurous&rsquo; is singularly inappropriate in this context, for the whole evening was an incredible adventure to me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I had heard none of the music before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The actual sound of the orchestra was a blessing: &lsquo;I have never felt so near to heaven&rsquo; whispered my mother after the Bach, which was probably played in a rich sonority quite alien to more modern ideas of authentic style, but which fell like balm on the ears of the uninitiated [&hellip;]</p>

Forster&rsquo;s Helen said, &lsquo;appeared in person&rsquo;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The &lsquo;revelation&rsquo;, the crystallisation of emotion into the moment that is infinite &ndash; an effect described so beautifully and so understandingly by Victor Gollancz, as an antidote to <em>The Devil&rsquo;s Repertoire</em> &ndash; reached me in full measure.</span></p>
