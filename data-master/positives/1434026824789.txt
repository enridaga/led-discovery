<p>Extract from a Contemporary notice, 1st May, 1847 - It may not seem irrelevant to the mention of Mendelssohn to add a 'contemporary notice' from the recollections of a son present on that last and memorable occasion. The last song accompanied by Mendelssohn was selected by himself from his Oratorio of ' St. Paul,' saying, ' We will have this for a close ! ' It was the grand composition to the words, ' Be thou faithful unto death ' (Sei getreu bis in den Tod)&mdash;and having played the last note, he started up, and precipitately left the room and the house, exclaiming to those who followed him, ' I cannot take leave ! God bless you all ! ' It is not known what cause produced this unusual sense of the solemnity of parting ; but whether or not he may have been possessed with some foreboding, he was certainly about to be met on his return home by the tidings of his beloved sister's sudden death&mdash;the gifted Fanny Mendelssohn Bartholdy, wife of Professor Hensel &mdash; a loss most peculiarly afflicting to him.</p>
