<p class="MsoNormal">Lester had a sound like a French horn. Sort of deadish, unready horn sound. It was magnificent! And the lousiest tenor saxophone you'd ever want to look at. It was a Pan-American, with rubber bands, glue, chewing gum &ndash; and he just sat there blowing wonderful stuff. He was my idol.</p>
