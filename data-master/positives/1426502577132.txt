On Wednesday I was at the Bayers' with Slavik until two in the morning. He is 
the only one of the artists here with whom I am in sympathy and intimate contact. That evening he played like a second Paganini, but a Paganini rejuvenated, one who with time will surpass the first. I shouldn't believe it if I had not heard him frequently: I really am sorry that Titus has not met him. He makes the listener speechless and brings 
tears to one's eyes more than that, he makes even tigers cry, for both Prince G. and Iskr. went away deeply moved.
