<p>One Sunday in !966, I was driving around Detroit with my Mom and playing with the radio in our car. The dial landed on 1440AM just as Joe Henderson&rsquo;s sax solo from &lsquo;Mode for Joe&rsquo; was kicking off&hellip;.this was my first real exposure to jazz and it totally blew my mind! For a theoretical standpoint, I had no idea what those musicians were doing&hellip;nonetheless the music spoke to me on a deep, conversational level. Joe begins his solo with anguished cries that allow you to project your own personal frustrations on them (that particular day, my sources of angst were most likely a dread of junior-high-school biology class as well as a lack of success with girls). After 20 or so bars, Joe Chambers kicks in with a profoundly swinging ride cymbal and the saxophone just grooves on out. I could relate to that too: if adversity was not gonna break Joe&rsquo;s stride it wasn&rsquo;t gonna break mine either. When the song ended, I felt like the coolest, most empowered 15-year old in Detroit &ndash; isn&rsquo;t that something? Great music somehow helps you make sense out of your life, figure out who you are and where you want to be.</p>
