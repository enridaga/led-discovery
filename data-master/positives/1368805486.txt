[W]hen I was about six years old...I used to go to an old man by the name of Skolmuck on the reservation. He was in his nineties, and a bunch of us kids would bring different gifts like maybe a sack of beans, corn, tobacco, and we'd go over and listen to him sing the chants of the Pimas. And we would listen to the stories of the early days of Pima land when...the tribe used to fight with the Apaches.... And where the music part comes in is...the Indians have...battle songs...and I think everybody...in the early years...have some connection with rhythm, melody.... And I can vouch for my tribe. We had rhythm and song too.  And when we visited old  Skolmuck, we would just, out of respect for an old man who...still followed the tribal chants...we would sit around close to him, and he would sing to us.
