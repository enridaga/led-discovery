<p>L. was told the other day that the raids are carried out by women.&nbsp; Women's bodies were found in the wrecked aeroplanes.&nbsp; They are smaller &amp; lighter, &amp; thus leave more room for bombs.&nbsp; Perhaps its sentimental, but the thought seems to me to add a particular touch of horror.</p>
<p>I went to the Magic Flute, &amp; thought rather better of humanity for having that in them. Goldie was in the same row with me, thinking I daresay much the same thoughts, though the proximity of two youthful men may have coloured them differently.&nbsp; There were Roger &amp; Pippa, &amp; Sheppard &amp; finally Mary Hutch. &amp; Jack &amp; Alix &amp; James - all collecting in the hall for a moment in the twilight, for the sun, at 10 of a hot day, was hardly out of the sky.</p>
