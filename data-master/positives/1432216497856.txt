At Dundee a gay, thoughtless young woman was one day invited by an acquaintance to accompany her to a meeting. She declined to go, saying that she did not care to hear Moody and Sankey. On being further pressed, she consented and went. She was not impressed by anything she heard in the course of the meeting. Indeed, she thought there was " nothing in it," and wondered why people should make so much ado about what seemed so commonplace. The last hymn, " Yet there is Room ! " was being sung by Mr. Sankey alone. He had reached the last stanza â€”

Ere night that gate may close, and seal thy doom. 
Then the last, low, long cry " No room ! no room ! " 
No room, no room ; oh, woful cry, " No room !"

These last words of Dr. Bonar's hymn fell upon the ear of the young woman like a sudden thunderclap. She left the meeting, but the words went with her. " No room ! no room ! " still rang in her ears. Conscience awoke at the sound of this warning bell. Nor could she rest, until she found rest in the great Redeemer.
