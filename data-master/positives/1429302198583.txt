When I first came to New York, Count Basie was playing piano over on Fifth Avenue between 134th and 135th at a place called Edmond'sâ€¦ I used to go over there every night and stand on the opposite side of Fifth Avenue and listen to Count Basie wail. It was wonderful except for the fact that I was too young to be allowed into a place like that. One day, I shed my adolescence by putting on long pants. They thought I was a grown man and let me in. I fooled them, and I'm glad, because I finally got to stand alongside the piano and watch the great Count Basie.
