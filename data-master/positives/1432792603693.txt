<p>Although Manchester at that time was a long journey from London, I neglected no opportunities for keeping myself familiar with what was going on in the Metropolis in the way of music. For instance, I made a great effort to hear Bach's " Passion " music - produced under Dean Stanley's auspices - conducted by Barnby in Westminster Abbey; a very notable event which really set an example that has been widely followed. I had been promised a ticket, but it did not arrive. However, I went up to London and to the Abbey, but was sternly refused admission, as I had no ticket. I might have said, "You won't let me in now, but you will some day," but I didn't, and solaced myself by going to the opera and hearing "William Tell."</p>
