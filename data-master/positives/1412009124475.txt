The music we listened to was an important part of who we were. Some of the lyrics seemed to speak directly to us and we felt that whoever wrote those things had a lot in common with us. Now, although my tastes ran to bands like The Who, I happen to know that my little sister had exactly the same idea about this when she was listening to her Donny Osmond records. Perhaps this is a bit like good poetry, it comes across as being personal, even though the man who wrote it might have been dead for centuries. So I listened to songs that said things like: ‘I’ve seen the needle and the damage done, a little part of it in everyone, but every junky’s like the setting sun’, and it would make me think about some of the drug users I had known. My sister listened to ‘Puppy Love’ and felt just the same; it spoke to her.
