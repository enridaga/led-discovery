The family of the Greatorexes coming to settle in Leicester was a favourable circumstance for music. Anthony Greatorex, the founder of the family, came from Shottle, a village in Derbyshire, and was by trade a nailer. Having a taste for music, he used, with his eldest daughter, to attend at wakes and fairs, and was looked upon as an extraordinary musician; he played upon a rustic instrument called a hurdy-gurdy, to which his daughter danced. Being a steady and clever man, he was promoted to an organist's place, and immediately set about teaching his daughter the harpsichord. In the year 1774, the organ in St. Martinâ€™s Church having been just erected, Miss Greatorex, at the recommendation of Mr. Cradock, was appointed to that instrument, although but thirteen years of age. Her progress in music was rapid, and in a few years she became a performer of eminence. When the family removed to Leicester, their son was only eight years old, but remarkable for his grave and studious turn; his mind had a strong bias to mathematical pursuits, but living in a musical family, his ear was imperceptibly drawn to the study of musical sounds. Possessing great industry, he soon became eminent. His father, having obtained a place as vicar-choral in the cathedral at Carlisle, young Greatorex soon afterwards was appointed organist in that place.
