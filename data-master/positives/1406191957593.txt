At the New York Wurlitzer shop Oistrakh compared his state-owned Stradivarius with the instruments the dealer was offering. It was interesting for me to observe Oistrakh checking out the capabilities of a violin new to him. He tried to squeeze out as loud a sound as possible, eventually reaching a screech. Onstage Oistrakh never took his instrument to such extremes; he never squeaked.
