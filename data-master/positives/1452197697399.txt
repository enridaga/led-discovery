<p>Indeed he [Dr. Leopold Damrosch] was an enthusiastic apostle of what&nbsp;was then called " Zukunftsmusik " (Music of&nbsp;the Future), and one of the early champions&nbsp;of Liszt and Wagner. At these concerts the&nbsp;Soprano Soli were frequently sung by Dr.&nbsp;Damrosch's beautiful wife, Helene von Heimburg, a singer of rare accomplishments, and&nbsp;gifted with a most sympathetic voice. Her&nbsp;singing, for instance, of the part of "Die&nbsp;Jungfrau" in Schumann's <em>Paradise and Peri</em>&nbsp;still lingers in my memory, as I am sure it does&nbsp;in that of all who had the good fortune to&nbsp;hear it, as something singularly beautiful and&nbsp;touching.</p>
