The theatre, which is one of the largest in Europe, was open, and I saw Cimarosa's beauti-ful opera, " II Falegname," ably performed by three great buffo singers Mandini, Blassi, and Leperini. At this period, Bologna was the mart (the carnival being over in all other places) to which actors from all parts of Italy resorted, to make their future engagements. The large Cafe dei 
Virtuosi was filled with them from morning till night, and it was really amusing to see them swarm round a manager the moment he entered. I passed 
much of my time there, and there first saw and heard the two extraordinary blind brothers, called " Le bravi Orbi." They were natives of Bologna, and during the spring and summer travelled to Rome, Naples, Venice, &c. ; their talents were every where held in the highest estimation ; the one played the violin with exquisite taste, the other the violoncello with such wonderful execution, as to have obtained from the Bolognese the additional cognomen of " Spacca note" - "Split note." I never missed an opportunity of hearing them.
