After supper go with Bridges to B.B.C. Studio no. 10 concert at 9.5. V. good playing, tho' not perfect owing to under-rehearsal. Haydn Clock. Simp. Delius Cuckoo (a miracle) & Tschaikovsky's wonderful Francesca de Rimini which F.B. made sound terrifying. Before Fran. Arthur Benjamin conducts his Vln concerto (Brosa - magnificent).* Not pleasing as a whole; there are some good things, but many week ones. Back to Bridges with Brosas.
