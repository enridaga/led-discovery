Several of our concerts which were more of less in the 'stick's were of surprising importance... and it's always unwise to assume that even a concert of unusual music will not be directly compared with some of the finest performances to be found anywhere. I was quite surprised by this aspect of American musical organization on one occasion in Virginia. Beecham has decided upon Sibelius's Seventh Symphony as the climax of the first half and it worked perfectly - one of the most hair-raising performances I have ever heard, even from him. I wondered if it could possible have been wasted upon the audience on that occasion, because they looked quite unsophisticated. Soon I was to know the truth. The lade organizer was sitting next to Joan, and was insistent that she should take a message back-stage. 'Please tell Sir Beecham,' she begged, 'that we've all had the world's greatest artists in this Masonic Temple - but this is the very first time we've ever been able to make money!' I wonder what 'Sir Beecham' would have said to that, in view of the Â£100,000 fees he was giving to sponsor the tour? The message was never delivered, naturally!
