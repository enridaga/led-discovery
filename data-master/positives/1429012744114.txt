Beecham also conducted "Die Meistersinger" uncut which made a very long evening but he always said it was no use cutting that opera as it always took just as long to play.... We had what you might call time and motion problems again when rehearsing the end of that same act [the end of Act 2]. After the fight is over the Night Watchman walks slowly across the back of the stage from the OP side, blows his horn (this is represented by the off-stage tuba). sings a little song and blows another call before he exits on the prompt side. The tuba player has to make his way round backstage from the OP side to the prompt side to be ready for the second call. It is a long way and Bob Chator was having difficulty in negotiating the impedimenta and covering the distance in time, with the result that the Nightwatchman blew a silent note.
"He hasn't quite got there, Sir Thomas."
"Let's do it again, starting from that side to save time."
Off we went but poor Bob Chator who only knew that they were going to do it again" was racing back to his original starting-point on the OP side while the Watchman had found himself delivering another silent raspberry. Thoroughly exasperated Sir Thomas decided to go right back to square one and the Watchman returned to make his original entrance on the OP side; but conflicting messages reached the hapless tuba player who was, as usual, en route for somewhere but never there. The concerted wrath of all those in authority fell on him and he rushed screaming from the theatre and was never seen again. I don't remember any trouble with his replacement who must have been of sterner stuff.
