<p>I remember bringing my son here on his birthday it was a Handel Anniversary Celebration Concert can&rsquo;t remember which year but it was sort of probably mid-80s and he came totally bored and ended up jumping to his feet and applauding and has had a lifelong love of Handel ever since and he got the whole audience to their feet and I shall never forget that and I shall probably remind him of it next week when I see him. He&rsquo;s 36 now and I shall totally embarrass him but I shall never forget the rapturous look on his face and it was thanks to this concert hall.</p>
