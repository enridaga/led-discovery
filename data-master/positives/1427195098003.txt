In spite of his declining physical strength, the charm of his playing remained as great as ever, some of the new readings he was compelled to adopt having a 
peculiar interest. Thus at the last public concert he gave in Paris, at the end of the year 1847 or the beginning of 1848, he played the latter part of his 'Barcarolle,' from the point where it demands the utmost energy, in the most opposite style, pianissimo, but with such wonderful nuances, that one remained in doubt if this new reading were not preferable to the accustomed one. Nobody but Chopin could have accomplished such a feat.
