<p>There is another peculiarity of Berlin musical audiences&nbsp;which no lover of the divine art who has spent a winter&nbsp;in the German capital can have failed to notice...The peculiarity I refer to is an&nbsp;amazing tolerance of false intonation. Men may sing&nbsp;sharp, and men may sing flat ; but the Berliner endures&nbsp;them for ever &mdash; that is, to borrow a term from Bret&nbsp;Ilarte, if he "likes their style." To be persistently,&nbsp;remorselessly, homicidally out of tune is no offence in a&nbsp;popular vocalist, male or female, belonging to the Royal&nbsp;Opera Company, or to any of the leading operetta casts in Berlin. All tho public favourites di primo cartello&nbsp;whom I heard in the house on the Opernplatz between&nbsp;the years 1867 and 1878, with those distinguished&nbsp;exceptions &mdash; Pauline von Rhaden, better known by her&nbsp;spinster name of Lucca, Amalio von Voggenhuber,&nbsp;otherwise Frau Krolop, and Ernst, the lyric tenor &mdash; sang&nbsp;more or less out of tune...And yet I have never heard&nbsp;them called over the coals, or even gently rebuked, by&nbsp;a Hofoper audience for committing the atrocity which&nbsp;the Germans describe as " detonation." On the contrary, I have over and over again heard them, one and&nbsp;all, vehemently applauded and enthusiastically called&nbsp;before the curtain for singing in a manner that set my&nbsp;teeth on edge, and caused cold shivers to flutter down&nbsp;either side of my spine.</p>
