<p class="MsoNormal">There was a guy there, I think he was a little effeminate, that lived there. He was a bartender or something, and he played piano. He was a traditionalist. The pure chords, you know, one, three, five chords. Art would upset him so badly sometimes. Art would tell me, &ldquo;Say, watch John. Watch what I'm going to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So he would start playing <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Danny Boy</em>. This was one of this guy&rsquo;s favorite tunes. He'd start playing it and then about four bars in, he'd hit one of these outrageous chords and this guy would say, &ldquo;Art, you boob, you don't even know the chords.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And Art would die. He would just laugh, you know. Had a tremendous sense of humor.</p>
