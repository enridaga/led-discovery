<p>Go to. B.B.C. Concert (1st half - Area,* 2nd half - Stalls with Bridges). Strauss - conducting Mozart Eb Symphony, his own three H&ouml;lderlin Prayers (beautifully sung by Margarete Teschemacher), &amp; Domestic Symphony.** Dull &amp; annoying Mozart - can it be he who wrote Don Juan? H&ouml;lderlin songs; boring &amp; monotonous Straussian sounds. Domestic: amusing, &amp; annoying by turns; but with some lovely bits. Orch. as good as could be with such a conductor (or rather beater). Come home by bus, via. Bridges by 11.5.</p>
