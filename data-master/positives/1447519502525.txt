<p>Last evening as I was leisurely approaching Marion, I was suddenly startled by hearing a hearty hurrah! I dismounted as quickly as I could and hurrying into Main Street found that the citizens were bidding farewell to the Marion Light Infantry who were going off to the war. The Judson girls, numbering about eighty were assembled in the city hall and they struck up the "Marseilles Hymn" just as I reached there. It was grand, it was thrilling. Who could not fight after such a farewell!</p>
