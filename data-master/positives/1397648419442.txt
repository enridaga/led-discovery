Third and last performance of ‘Crucifixion' took place yesterday at 2.30 for patients. Not quite such a big audience what with the weather being so bad and rain dripping through the roof, flooding the floor in places. It was quite a creditable show on the whole. The conductor was quite pleased with it and congratulated us all afterwards, but our performance still left a good deal to be desired. Rather uncertain in places. Perhaps ‘Revenge’ will be more perfected. We start with the first practice on Thursday night.
