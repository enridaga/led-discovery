At 11 looked up Mr. Gunton to talk over the performance of the 'Messiah,' which must take place without a rehearsal...so that conductor, chorus, solo-singers and 
organist for a great performance met for the first time in the hall, and at the moment of commencing the concert! Nevertheless even-thing went well ; the chorus was excellent (from Liverpool), the organist also, the solo-singers, Madame Rudersdorff, Miss Messent, Miss Dolby, Mr. Lockey, and Mr. Thomas altogether left very little to be desired, and so the conducting was not unpleasant. A young bass-singer, Cuzner, made his debut in the air 'Why do the Nations,' and gave proof of a good voice.
