<p>What we used to do was put the record on--one of the [New Orleans] Rhythm Kings', naturally--play a few bars, and then all get our notes. We'd have to tune our instruments up to the record machine, to the pitch, and go ahead with a few notes. Then stop! A few more bars of the record, each guy would pick out his notes and boom! we would go on and play it. Two bars, or four bars or eight--we would get in on each phrase then all play it.</p>
