The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were so good-natured as to ask us to dinner on Wednesday, and take us on to one of the Ancient Concerts. I told the Duke I should write to you about my having been for the first time at an Ancient Concert, by his kindness, and he said, ‘Yes, she used to go to the Ancient Concerts—she knows I am an old Handelian.’… I am sure I wondered at his spirits and lungs—talking all dinner-time and even more than usual across the table to the Duke of Wellington and Lady Mansfield; and then, throughout the concert, singing after everything, vocal or instrumental.
