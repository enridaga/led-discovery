May I thank you again cordially. / The Kolischs played marvellously. Everything seems so simple, so self-evident in their performance, that one would think it is easy. Their virtuosity, their sonority, their understanding, their style, are admirable. I confess they are the best string quartet I [have] ever heard. I am so enthusiastic about their performances that I asked Kolisch to play my new Concerto for Violin, which Klemperer wants to perform next year in Los Angeles, London, and Moscow. I am sure there is nobody today who could play it as well as he. </span></p>
