The occasion was made truly representative, the great heart of the Welsh nation responding to the cry of its sons in distress. A vast congregation attended, while there was a fine choir of mixed voices drawn from the various Welsh churches and chapels in the Metropolis and district, augmented by a contingent of singers from the Welsh Guards that magnificent body of men that, young in war, is already old in fame. The service was mainly in Welsh, and proved a revelation in congregational singing. 
The varied selection of hymns sung in the Nave included "Aberystwyth," "Llanfair," "Dwyfor," "Ebenezer " tunes dear to Welsh choralists and the great " Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" ("Land of my Fathers"), the solo part in which was magnificently sung by Mr. Ben Davies, from a station in the organ-loft. All the hymns were accompanied by the band of the Welsh Guards and by the organ. Written and composed specially for the service was " The Paean of Wales," a hymn-setting that I made of some stirring and uplifting verses by Bishop Boyd Carpenter. This number was sung in
English. The hymn during the collection was sung in Welsh, and to enable my boys to take part, it was written out phonetically, and so taught to them.
Mr. Lloyd George said I should have " a good Welsh accent before the service was over."
