<p>Saw (?) last concert held by the Radlett Music Club &ndash; John Williams, the guitarist was the main performer.&nbsp; He is a pupil of Segovia and very young.&nbsp; He played works by Bach, Scarlatti and Villa-Lobos &amp; other Spanish composers.&nbsp; You may have heard him on the wireless &ndash; he is the best classical guitarist in this country &amp; we were very impressed with the ease with which he played the most complicated passages&hellip;.</p>
