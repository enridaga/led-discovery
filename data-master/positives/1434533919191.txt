Imagine my joy, therefore, when for the first time I was taken to the theatre where they were giving an opera with which as a pianist I was already familiar. It was 'A Life for the Tsar', and it was then I heard an orchestra for the first time. And what an orchestra- Glinka’s! The impression was indelible, but it must not be supposed that this was due solely to the fact that it was the first orchestra I ever heard. To this day, not only Glinka’s music in itself., but his orchestration as well, remains a perfect monument of musical art – so intelligent is his balance of tone, so distinguished and delicate his instrumentation; and by the latter I mean his choice of instruments and his way of combing them. I was indeed fortunate in happening on a 'chef d’ouvre' for my first contact with great music. That is why my attitude towards Glinka has always been one of unbounded gratitude.
