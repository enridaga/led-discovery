What we lose in musical charm we gain in a certain ingenious sense of reality. I think the power of WAGNER, the solidity of his work, largely turns upon this. He is never afraid of length, of silence, even of dulness, caused by protracted or delayed action. Like DE BALZAC, he knew well how to work up slowly and surely to a consummate effect, and his effect never hangs fire, nor is it ever liable to an anticlimax, that bane of second-rate artists.</span></p>
