[&hellip;] Before entering the wood we rested a little, leaning on a gate that gave us a distant view of the town.&nbsp; Suddenly, through the hazy heat, I heard distant bells, the music of which seemed suspended in the still air.&nbsp; I was held motionless, the scenery vanished, and I was aware only of downward-drifting sounds that seemed isolated from everything else around me.&nbsp; I have no doubt now that this experience, held captive for so long in my inner consciousness, gradually became so embedded in my musical thinking as to be the means whereby the disembodied bell-sounds I heard that summer afternoon became transmuted into those downward scales that constantly act as focal points in my textures.</span></p>
