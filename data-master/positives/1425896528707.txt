<p>The score of the <em>Rondo a la Krakowiak</em> is finished. The Introduction is original more so than I look in my felt greatcoat. But the Trio is not yet ready. Upstairs a room has been put at my disposal; the stairs lead up to it from the wardrobe-room. There I shall have an old piano, an old desk and a den of my own. My orphan Rondo for two pianos has found a foster-father in Fontana (you've perhaps seen him sometime at our house-- he goes to the University). He has practised it for about a month but has at last learnt it and we recently tried it over at Buchholtz's to see how it might have sounded. I say "might have" because the two instruments were not in tune. We did not achieve the proper expressiveness and the thing did not go well in all those little details (you know what I mean) which give nuance to any piece of music.</p>
