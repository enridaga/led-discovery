<p><em>Rest in Peace, Uncle Fred </em>was my first attempt to integrate jazz - or music of any sort - into the essential fabric of a television play.&nbsp; It was almost the last time - possibly the only time - that Tubby Hayes appeared in a play...[T]here was a little coda to the play that wasn't seen at the time.&nbsp; It should have been but it wasn't. The band is packing up at the end of the gig and the idea was that Tubbs would play one chorus of the National Anthem on vibes and get it slightly wrong.&nbsp; Then theoretically, the audience would say: 'Wow! What a wonderful, highly- barbed, satirical, nay coruscating comment on the state of the nation.' Or words to that effect.</p>
<p>When we recorded the play Tubbs duly played the National Anthem, as requested, getting it slightly wrong.&nbsp; It worked brilliantly. Unfortunately, when the play was transmitted, the engineers responsible assumed the play was finished and hit the Stop button.</p>
