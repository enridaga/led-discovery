After dinner I go with F. May (his tickets) to Oriane Madrigal Society concert at Aeolian Hall. under C.K. Scott. This choir sings quite well - but no remarkable tone, ensemble, or intonation. Although pitch was maintained well, as in Harrison's interminable & dull-as-ditchwater "Blessed Damsel" for female voices.*
