<p>I also included Wagner's then little-known work, the exquisite "Waldweben" from Siegfried, in the programme. I remember at the rehearsal, on going through it with the orchestra, there were some difficult passages for the reed instruments, in imitation of the notes of the bird, which have to be played in time against the rest of the band. As they did not get them right, I took up Mr. Pollitzer's violin and showed them how the passages ought to go, and they all applauded me.</p>
