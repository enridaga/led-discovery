Frances has just returned from an excursion to visit some of the Protestants scattered in the mountain villages of this country, having taken with her Mademoiselle Charbonnet, and M. Espineth, a missionary. The only place you ever heard of before, on their tour, was Antibes, where they visited a shoemaker-family, the only Protestants in the place, and made them very happy by Bible-reading, exhortation, and hymn-singing: then they rested the horses at a town called Vence, and proceeded to a place near the village of Carros, the habitation of a family of paysans who cultivate a property of their own, where last year the mother died, an earnest Protestant. There they staid all Sunday, and on Monday proceeded by S. Jeannet to La Gaude, making visits, and gladly received, by the few melancholy people who lead the life of outcasts, and are in proportion refreshed by sympathy. It is sad that most of the Protestants of La Gaude have emigrated to America, unable ot bear the discomfort of standing alone.
