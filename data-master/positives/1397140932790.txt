Miss Williams, our Assistant Matron, and I went to the Army School ‘at home’.... Tea was all right and there was a band which played outside the mess during tea then later in the lecture hall, which was a large hut with a splendid waxed floor. British nurses are not allowed to dance - but the Canadians and Americans are. That explains our misery in a nutshell - OUR PEOPLE DANCED, and it is Miss Williams’ duty, being in charge of the party, to report it. If she reports it officially, it means drastic punishment for the offenders. If she does not, she has not done her job. The moment we spotted three of ours in full swing we fled from the hut and spent the rest of the time wandering anywhere that was not near the dancing.
