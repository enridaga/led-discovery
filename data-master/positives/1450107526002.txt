It was <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&lsquo;Der alte Mittag</em>&rsquo; and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">&lsquo;O Mensch, gibe acht&rsquo;</em>. I wonder if you feel the same about it. Both parts, in their simplicity and poetry, are deeply affecting. Then we were very interested in the wordless choruses. We had never heard anything like that before. I think you are the first to have attempted such a thing. I believe this field offers many possibilities- quite remarkable effects could be obtained. </span></p>
