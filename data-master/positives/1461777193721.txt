<p style="text-align: left;">It is but a few years since we had the honor of introducing chanting into some of the American churches (other than Episcopal) for the first time. At that time, perhaps some fifteen or twenty years ago, chanting had not been heard of in a dissenting congregation in England. Now it is common here to hear a congregation chant a Psalm. And it is often very well done, much better than we have often heard it by some four or six voices.</p>
