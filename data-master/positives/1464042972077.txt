<p>Dukelsky was waiting waiting for us after&nbsp;<em>L'Enfant</em> to play us his ballet, so we proceeded into a rehearsal room where we were joined by Kokhno. Dukelsky described the ballet as 'classical with a whiff of Russian', a description I did not much care for. And certainly the first number, which was lively and not at all bad, answered to the description. But I already liked the theme of the second number, and the rest of the piece, especially the superb theme and variations (even though the theme itself was in some ways derivative and stylised). The penultimate number I liked less. All in all, though, this was an evening that happens all too rarely: having before one a genuinely important composer. I do not think I am mistaken. I congratulated Dukelsky most sincerely and returned home with the ballet ringing in my ears.</p>
