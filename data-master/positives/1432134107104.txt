I remember when I played the Adagio from the Elgar Concerto in Westminster Abbey we all climbed up to the organ loft. Rubio insisted on coming too and sat next to Margaret. The organist was, I must say, a little heavy-handed and Rubio struck the arm of his chair with such vigour that it made the poor organist jump, then turning round to Margaret said in a loud voice, ‘He play terrible, comme un pied!’
