Here I was wander from chronological exactitude to remember Sir Henry, no respecter of composers, who rescored a great deal of the music played at the Proms in those days. Among other gems I remember the "Song of the Rhinemaidens" arranged as an orchestral piece with three solo violins instead of three clarinets - and later I myself accompanied Elsie Suddaby in a Bach aria rescored most unsuitably for triple woodwind.
