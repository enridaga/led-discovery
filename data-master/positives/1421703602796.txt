<p>Carnegie Hall this afternoon for Leontyne Price's recital. She sang Psalm 148 from Cycle of Holy Songs, the first piece of mine I've ever heard her do, and again, like last Wednesday, I squirmed at the selection. If Leontyne is the leading soprano on earth today, couldn't she perform, by that token, something more "representative" from among my 130 published songs? I feel right about only fifteen; the rest are to be had for the asking. What I love, nobody sings, what they sing, nobody loves.</p>
