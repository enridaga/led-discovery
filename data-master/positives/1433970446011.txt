Signor Velluti, I believe, is the last of this race of singers, to the honour of Buona parte and the age. I sat next to this elegant man at the dinner of the Royal Academy of Music, immediately on his arrival in England, and after dinner he sang for the first time in this country. I was extremely interested in his appearance ; like Pacchiarotti there was a melancholy in his countenance, and a touching sweetness in his voice. When I heard him on the stage I liked him not so well ; but in acting there was an elegance in all his movements. His greatest fault was, that in certain notes he sang too flat ; but the passion and grace with which he executed everything was new and delightful.
