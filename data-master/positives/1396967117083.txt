A concert was convened of the amateurs at the Exchange for his [the young William Crotch's] benefit, at which he performed several pieces to the admiration of the audience. After this, he exhibited his talent upon the violin, which he played left-handed, and being very small of his age, he stood in a chair to lead the concert. In one of the pieces he stopped Mr. Tilley, who was the principal violoncello, and pointed out a passage—infant as he was— that our grave performer had played incorrectly.
Such early indications of talent gave high expectations of future greatness, and had he not gone into the schools to be saturated with the rigid harmonies of the ancients, which sealed up his genius, we might have boasted of a native Mozart. The result has been that the general cast of his ideas has been founded upon the works of Handel and other masters of the old school.
