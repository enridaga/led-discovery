A simply pelting morning & part of afternoon. There should have been a match v. J. Zingari but it was naturally put off. I spend most of afternoon in music rooms, gramophoning & practising viola & piano. After (there is a new record of Wagners Overture to the Mast.) After tea I play duets with Berthoud (Mozart VI. concerto in D maj) & Trios with Floud Schumann Quintet (Floud Pft, VI Berthoud VI. 1 & 2, me the rest)
