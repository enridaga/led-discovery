I leave to the last what is perhaps the most spectacular career from the Hubay fold: Eugene Ormandyâ€™s. After a brilliant beginning on the recital stage, he abandoned our instrument for the baton. His phenomenal rise from the pit of the Capitol Theater on Broadway to the Philadelphia Orchestra (via the Minneapolis) needs no detailed chronicling. That he still retains a redoubtable mastery of our instrument he has proven to me repeatedly in improvised quartet sessions. This despite the fact he never touches a violin nowadays.
