<p>This day is one of the greatest and most glorious days of our lives, with which, to my pride and joy the name of my dearly beloved Albert is forever associated!... A little rain fell, just as we started; but before we neared the Crystal Palace, the sun shone and gleamed upon the gigantic edifice, upon which the flags of every nation were flying.... The sight as we came to the centre where the steps and chair (on whcih I did not sit) was placed, facing the beautiful crystal fountain was magic and impressive. The tremendous cheering, the joy expressed in every face, the vastness of the building, with all its decorations and exhibits, the sound of the organ (with 200 instruments and 600 voices, which seemed nothing), and my beloved Husband the creator of this great 'Peace Festival', uniting the industry and art of all nations of the earth, all this, was indeed moving....The organs were but little heard, but the Military Band, at one end, had a very fine effect, playing the March from Athalie, as we passed along.</p>
