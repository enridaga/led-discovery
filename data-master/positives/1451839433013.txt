<p>    <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman';">I am happy that my Violin Concerto was first performed by this great musician. Oistrakh also gave me advice while I was writing this work. In the sheet music the violin part is marked &lsquo;Edited by D. Oistrakh&rsquo;. And I should point out that this does not mean formal editing or checking the music, but real help in the work&rsquo;s composition. / Oistrakh has performed my concerto several times, and each time with such inspiration and understanding of my intention, and of the ideas and emotions expressed in the music, that I cannot help thinking: if I were a violinist I would try to perform it just like that!</span></p>
