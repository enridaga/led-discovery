<p>A tolerable number at Church at Asholt considering the weather. A disagreeable fellow was playing his fiddle in the Church when I came in, without tune or harmony, intending I presume to accompany the Psalm Singers. I however ordered him to stop his noise which he would hardly do and then he began trying his discordant hautboy. I had a good mind to order him to be turned out.</p>
