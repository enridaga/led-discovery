<pre>This season [in 1811], a musical drama, called" Gustavus Vasa," for which I <br />composed the whole of the music, was produced. Mr. Young was the hero of the <br />piece, and acted very finely. Mrs. Dickons was the heroine, and sang the songs <br />allotted to her with great effect. Few singers possessed so much science as Mrs. <br />Dickons; she, at different periods, held the situation of first singer at Drury <br />Lane, Covent Garden, the Lyceum, and Italian Opera House; and wherever she was <br />placed, was esteemed for her many valuable qualities. "Gustavus Vasa" met with <br />approbation, and was performed a number of nights. </pre>
