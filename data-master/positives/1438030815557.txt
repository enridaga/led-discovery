<p>Listen to wireless after tea. Bax Symphony 5 (didn't interest me much - too full of notes &amp; clich&eacute;s - still I can't judge - bad wireless &amp; I didn't really concentrate). Horowitz gave a very brilliant, but rather insensitive show of Tschaikovsky concerto, a work which I admire but cannot like very much - only because I have heard it too often</p>
