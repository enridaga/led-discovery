Perhaps Fricsay's trouble was that in the 1950s he was overshadowed by a most magnificent Ariadne auf Naxos, the first version of Strauss' opera, with Molière’s Bourgeois Gentilhomme (the play) as the first half, complete with Strauss' splendid incidental music. The stage production was by Miles Malleson, and the opera version in the second half was conducted by Beecham and produced by Karl Ebert. There are some things one should not have to compete against, and possibly Fricsay knew it.
