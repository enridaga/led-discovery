Play abit of Bridge after dinner & listen to Chamber Concert after that (Cobbett prize works). Plant. of Hurlstone capable but undistinguished, I felt.* Brosas played it well. Ireland's 1st Vln Sonata (himself & that superb Brosa). Fine material but over long. V. Williams 5tet has some good things in it, but technically inefficient & imitative, & didn't seem to hang together.** The playing didn't do much to redeem it either.
