<p>Dear R V W You have really done it this time. Not only have you reached the heights but you have taken your audience with you. Also you have proved the musical superiority of England to France. I wonder if you realised how futile and tawdry Ravel sounded after your Epilogue. As a consequence of last Friday I am starting an anti-Gallic League the motto of which shall be 'Poetry not Pedantry'. More when we meet!</p>
