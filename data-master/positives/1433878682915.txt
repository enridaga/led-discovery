<p>Freddie Keppard [&hellip;] was one of the greatest, but you never hear much about it. The difference between him and Joe Oliver is that Joe didn't drink, at least not that much. Freddie was the original man to come out of New Orleans to New York. He had a chance to make the first jazz records--before the Original Dixieland Jazz Band--but he was afraid people would steal his tunes and arrangements so he didn't record them.</p>
<p>Freddie could play as soft and as loud, as sweet and as rough, as you would want. He loved to play <em>Pagliacci</em>, too.&nbsp;Freddie and the other musicians had no idea that the music they were playing was unusual. Manuel Perez was another [trumpet player] who was very good. As for the crowds, they came in to drink, to dance, to hear the jazz music. All of the those clubs carried shows and there were singers that went from table to table.</p>
