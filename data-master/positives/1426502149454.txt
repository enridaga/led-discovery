I shall go to the theatre where there is to be a concert at which we shall hear Herz, that Jewish violinist who only just avoided being hissed off at Mile Sontag's concert in Warsaw, and Dohler, a pianist who is to play works by Czerny. To end the concert Herz will play his own Variations on Polish Airs.
