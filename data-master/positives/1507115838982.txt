By the way at Fenchurch a goodly pageant with four giants and with goodly speeches. The Genoese made it. At Grace Church another goodly pageant of the Easterling's making. And at Leadenhall was another pageant hanged with cloth of gold and the goodliest playing with all manner of&nbsp;musicians. And there was one blowing of a trumpet all the day long.</span></p>
