I knew back then [1940’s] that Nat Cole was bigger than ever. Whites could relate to him because he dealt with material they understood, and he did so with great feeling. Funny thing, but during all these years I was imitating Nat Cole, I never thought twice about it, never felt bad about copying the cat's licks…

He was a guy everyone admired, and it just made… musical and commercial sense to study his technique…

Today I hear some singers who I think sound like me. Joe Cocker, for instance. Man, I know that cat must sleep with my records. But I don't mind. I'm flattered; I understand. After all, I did the same thing.

As a teenager, and even in my twenties, my voice was light. But during this period in [Tampa] Florida, I learned some of the tricks of working with a PA system. I could make my voice heavier; I could give it more resonance by turning on a little more bottom and tweaking up the treble end at the same time. That kept me sounding clear, but also deep.

My voice never changed drastically. As I got older, it developed more resonance of its own. But I experienced no dramatic fluctuations, and I really never lost my old voice or gained a new one. The kid sound and the adult sound just blended together.
