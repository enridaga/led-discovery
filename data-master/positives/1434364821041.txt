Letter from Bunsen to Mrs. Schwabe, 28th May, 1856 -
10th June.â€”The arrival of the great violinist, Joachim, and the presence of Neukomm, have caused us a succession of musical enjoyments, most thoroughly delighted in. I am ever busy with the file on my Egyptian work, but it
will go off in four days. The ' God-Consciousness ' proceeds rapidly, and I have great joy in it. My wife will probably remain at home, but Theodore and I shall certainly join you in Switzerland.
