The Coronation took place on Sunday, 5th September, and the performance by the whole Choir of the Papal Chapel of the ' Tu es Petrus ' of Palestrina, can hardly have been forgotten by any one of the probably few survivors of that grand solemnity. As the music through the ear seized upon the whole soul, so did
the eye meanwhile revel in the various combinations of architecture with animated, not to say impassioned, humanity, under that mellow light disclosing with vivid clearness all form and colour without either glare or haze, in the unearthly effect peculiar to St. Peter's.
