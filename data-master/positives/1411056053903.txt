BLACK ANGELS:KRONOS QUARTET:ELIOT CARTER???USA. I attended a pre-concert talk by the composer...CARTER(correct me if I'm wrong...white haired...charming)and later heard the Kronos quarter play BLACK ANGELS which involved bowing the rims of wine glasses...then piece using recording of Ginsberg reciting HOWL! A most wonderful experience.
