<p>Is it mere coincidence that later in the day I finally played Schoenberg's <em>Trio Op. 45</em>? The Record's been lying there for years. It's not as though I haven't given him a chance, since I've known Schoenberg for as long as I've know <em>Nightwood</em>, and I've earned the right to ask: Is there a reason to listen to Schoenberg? Does his <em>Trio</em> say anything? Once I wrote that he was a genius without talent (the opposite of Boulez, who has knowledge without the wisdom - but also no talent). I still feel it - though one is not supposed to wonder about the rocks, for Schoenberg's 'fait accompli'.</p>
