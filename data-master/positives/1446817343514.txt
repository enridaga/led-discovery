<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My friend called and said she had free tickets for Brian Wilson. I almost passed the opportunity up as I wanted to take my food shopping home!! Glad I didn't - it was amazing - a great bunch of musicians. P.S. I work for Radio 4.&nbsp; We are about to launch a season of programmes on the theme of memory. Think we have missed a great tie-up opportunity here.</p>
