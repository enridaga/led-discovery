I am not at all steady when I stand up. My hands are not functioning very well either; however I went to the Great Hall of the Conservatoire on 23 December to hear Haydn’s 46th symphony and my 14th. There are to be further performances of my symphony on the 28 December in the House of Scholars and on the 30th in the Great Hall of the Conservatoire; if I feel strong enough I shall attend these concerts. / It seems to me that Miroshnikova and Yevgeny Vladimirov sing better than their opposite numbers (Vishnevskaya and Reshetin). Barshai’s orchestra is simply superb.
