Did you play any improvised music at that time?

No, I just liked to play. I loved the sound of the instrument. But a little later, when I was eleven or twelve, one of my uncles, who is a fine jazz pianist, introduced me to Fats Waller and Art Tatum on records, and it blew my mind. Then I got serious.
