On November 12th of this year, his oratorio, to which reference has been made as having been composed in 1838 for his Mus. Bac. degree, was performed by the Sacred Harmonic Society at Exeter Hall. The place was crammed, as the work, which was acknowledged to be a fine one, excited great interest in the musical world. The following interesting account was given at the time : 
" The performance opened with an anthem by the leader, Mr. Perry. This was followed by a short oratorio by Dr. Elvey, which appeared to be the principal attraction of the evening. The subject of it was ' The Resurrection and Ascension. Had Dr. Elvey failed in this effort, one of the most arduous that a musician can undertake, such a failure would have been by no means discreditable. But he has succeeded, and to such an extent as to give him a fair title to be ranked among that class to which Handel and Haydn belong. From the general feeling of the audience, and its effect on ourselves, we are led to predict that Dr. Elvey can, and will, produce works of the greatest power and effect. "The reputation of Dr. Elvey as a profound musician and excellent organist must be greatly enhanced by this composition."
