It was my brother’s birthday and there was to be a big party, all a surprise. Freddie Keppard’s Band has been hired for it… There was dancing, people getting together, things being real lively. The band was playing back in the kitchen. It had been understood that the clarinettist, George Baquet, wouldn’t show up till later; he had another engagement on a parade. So the band went along playing without him for a time, but it got going real good.
     I stood around there hearing them play. I was standing back by myself in the entry to the kitchen, and I couldn’t help myself. I knew I was too young for them, but I sure wanted to play along with them all the same. So I sneaked away and got the clarinet and went into the front room where nobody was at. It was dark in there. I began to follow right along with the band with that clarinet of my brother’s what he had given me.
    At first no one heard me. But then, the way I was told it, people began to take notice. And then the men in Keppard’s band, they noticed it and began to look at each other. Who the hell was playing? They prowled all around and at last they found me. They opened the door and they couldn’t believe their eyes. One of them laughed and said, “Well, you’re awful little, but we heard you, and you were sure playing like hell.”
