<p>I was a youngster in the 1950s and my parents took me to my first classical concert at the Royal Festival Hall. It featured Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and we sat in the third row of the stalls. (Very close to Beecham!) I was amazed to hear him speak to his orchestra in critical terms but then the most unforgettable event occurred. There was a piano concerto (I cannot remember the name of the composer or soloist) but Beecham was obviously dissatisfied with the pianist's tempo and throughout one movement banged on the piano lid with his baton to make the pianist keep to the timing of his (Beecham's) interpretation. In fifty years of concert going I have never seen that again!</p>
