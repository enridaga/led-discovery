<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">The annual Christmas Carol Concert for the stars. We saw so many of them - Vera Lynn, Bob Monkhouse, Max Bygraves and many more. My mother always looked forward to the concerts so much, but this particular one each year was very special. Also, when my friend and I were in our 30's we came to a ballroom dance one year and Joe Loss and his orchestra were performing. A memorable evening. He was a great fan of ours.</p>
