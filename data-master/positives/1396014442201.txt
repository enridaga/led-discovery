LGo to College at 10.0 for lesson with Ireland (He arrives 10.30!). V. fierce! I had done rather a bad bit of pt. writing in the mass - those consecutive 5ths always escape my notice! Practise in afternoon. Go for an ice to Selfridges with Barb, after tea at 5.0. She doesn't go to choral because of theatre, & I don't go because of going to Howard Ferguson, where I arrive at 1/4 to 7. Dinner & 2 pft duets after. Mozart Eb concerto, Brahms Quintet, FÃªtes (Debussy), La Valse (Ravel). Back by 10.15
