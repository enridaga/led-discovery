<p>Spot on <em>60 Minutes</em> with the un-winsome Marvin Hamlisch (refers to himself as "the kid") apropos his new show, <em>Smile</em>. Cast, producer, composer, and director have worked valiantly against the odds and are praying for a successful Broadway opening tomorrow. I pray for its failure. Snippets of song divulged on the television seem no more than vamping &agrave; la "Chorus Line" interjected with Kern's "I won't dance".</p>
