Miss Hutchinson and I went to a concert given by the Canadians in aid of British prisoners in Germany. The concert was excellent and they raised Â£60 in proceeds. The 'Minstrel troop' were very cleverly dressed in hospital 'blues' - jackets blue-side out and trousers white side out, with a flaming red bow at their necks.
