Germany was definitely becoming the center of the musical movement, and spared no effort to make it succeed. In this connection I should like to mention the enlightened activity in the realm of music of such organizations as the ‘Rundfunk’ (Radio) in Berlin and that of Frankfort-on-Main, and to note particularly the sustained efforts of the latter’s admirable conductor, Rosbaud, who, by his energy, his taste, his experience, and devotion, succeeded very quickly in bringing that organization to a very high artistic pitch. My visits to Germany were then very frequent, and I always went with the same pleasure.
