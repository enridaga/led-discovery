Passing by the Abbey of Ulverscrot, you come to the romantic domain of Bradgate Park. This affords a delightful ramble “mid oaks and rocks and purling streams," and is certainly the most Arcadian scene in Leicestershire. In summer it is constantly visited by parties, who “spend the livelong day” in rural felicity; every one bringing his picnic basket well stored. The place of dining, where the table-cloth is spread upon the short and glossy turf, is under the shade of the walnut-trees that surround the ruins of the ancient mansion. I have seldom been of these parties without music, and once our society performed an instrumental concert in the coppice at the top of Old John. Here, as upon Bardon Hill, you have a most extensive view. The day was opened by a piece of ordnance fired off at intervals, awakening the echoes in every direction, and the sounds of the sylvan orchestra drew crowds of listeners from the surrounding villages.
