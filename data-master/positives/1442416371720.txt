<p>I have memories of playing in the Festival Hall with the London Philhamonic, London Symphony, B.B.C. Symphony etc, with such conductors as Victor de Sabata etc, etc. Also a marathon series of concerts given by Rostropovich when he played all the 'cello concerto repertoire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R.M. double-bassist.</p>
