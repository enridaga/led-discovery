As a youth I was very harsh and intolerant. The slightest deviation from the planned performance of one of my works irritated me extremely. This lasted a fairly long time, and included collisions that had a fatal effect on the future of my works. I feel that this was part of the problem with my Fourth Symphony, and it’s painful for me to think about it. These and other circumstances and also, naturally, age have changed my position somewhat. I certainly haven’t become more complaisant, but I have begun expressing my point of view in such a way that the point is made without mortally insulting the performer. / A major factor is that more attention is paid to my opinion. Before, in order to be heard, I had to be extreme. Later, musicians began to understand mere hints. It became easier for me to speak to musicians. But harder at the same time. Why harder? Because when a single word carries more weight it also hits harder.
