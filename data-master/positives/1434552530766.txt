<p>There were a lot of keen youngsters around Chicago in those days [early twentieth century]. Buster Bailey was a kid just beginning, while Tommy Ladnier was only just starting out. I didn't play anything then, but was thinking of taking the clarinet. I used to sit on the bandstand all night, listening.</p>
<p>At that time we used to hang around Joe Oliver's band on off nights. Joe was at Royal Gardens then and coaching Louis Panico, Isham Jones' cornetist. Joe's band was probably at its peak then with Johnny Dodds on clary; brother Baby Dodds drumming; Honore Dutrey, trombone; Bill Johnson, bass; little Lil Hardin on the ivory.</p>
<p>I used to sit behind Dutrey every night and watch him play cello parts all night long because cello parts were easier to get than trombone music. Other musicians were considered out of the ordinary of they could play just one cello part. Dutrey was wonderful about showing me fine points on the horn. I learned lots from him.</p>
<p>That band just went mad when they played. Usually fast stuff, the Garden was a turmoil and a tumult from the start of the evening until the last note died away. Why! I thought they'd blow the roof off the place for dead sure, especially after Louis Armstrong joined the band.</p>
