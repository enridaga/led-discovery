<p>[Mlle Sontag's] <em>diminuendi</em> are the <em>non plus ultra</em>, her <em>portamenti</em> wonderful and her scales, particularly the chromatic scales, are unsurpassable. She sang us an aria of Mercadante very, very, very charmingly, and Rode's Variations, especially the last one with the trills, couldn't have been better. The Variations on a Swiss theme gave such pleasure that, when she was recalled, instead of making deep curtsies she sang them again!</p>
