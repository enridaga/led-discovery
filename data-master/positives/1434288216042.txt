Extracts from Diaries -
The day was splendid,â€”glorious sunshine and a light breeze : the sea quite calm, and sparkling. As we got farther out, the enormous and magnificent men-of-war (the Duke of Wellington, the Agamemnon, &c.) were an unique spectacle, the background being filled by hundreds of yachts with sails brilliant in the sunshine. We reached our vessel by ten o'clock, and were soon in sight of the Victoria and Albert, which was no sooner perceived than all the ships saluted ; the sound, and the appearance of the vessels enveloped in smoke, was exceedingly grand. We kept constantly near the Queen's ship, and thus could follow her movements, and saw the whole royal party, including our Prince, conveyed to visit the Duke of Wellington man-of-war. Once we got alongside the Prussian ship Gefion, on which order was given for the sailors to man the yards, which is one of the most striking of sights, and being the highest naval compliment, was much appreciated. The band on the Getion
played Prussian national airs. About twelve the signal was given for going out to sea, and we advanced about twelve miles south of Portsmouth, till we came in sight of 'the enemy,' when the firing commenced (at three), but to my
disappointment (for the effect was awfully grand) lasted but fifteen minutes!
