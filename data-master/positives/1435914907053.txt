Unfortunately, Jenny Lind was persuaded in the zenith of her career (I believe by the Bishop of Norwich) to give up the operatic stage and sing only for the glory
of God. The astounding news of her decision came in the spring of 1849 with Mr.
Lumley's announcement of a final series of operas in concert form. Only one took
place when Die Zauberflote was given. It was described as a "Grand Evening Classical Performance." Jenny Lind sang the part of Pamina, and Lablache showed his usual droll humour as Papageno. I played the bells in his song. My
diary says: 
'Wednesday. There was a rehearsal of Zauberflote. Balfe asked in French, "c'est-ce qu'il y a un bon pianiste?" My father said at once "Mon fils, mon fils!" so
I had to play the bells and was applauded by the whole orchestra.

Thursday, April 12th, was the concert. There was no acting whatever; the singers
all sat on seats on the stage, the orchestra was as usual. The song of Papageno in the second act was encored. Jenny Lind sang very beautifully'.
