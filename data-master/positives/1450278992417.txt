<p class="MsoNormal">Madame Urso deserves something more than a mere passing mention. She is easily the most remarkable violin player who ever came to America and made her home among us. I well remember her as she appeared at her <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">debut</em> in Jonas Chickering&rsquo;s piano rooms. She was then a little girl of eleven, with the same sad and interesting face that she has now. Yet, when not playing, she is full of fun, and her conversation is richly humorous.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Her playing as a child was very artistic. She made her <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">debut</em> in the &ldquo; Fantaisie &rdquo; on <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">II Pirate</em>, by Artot, accompanied by her father on the piano, and she won an immediate success.</p>
