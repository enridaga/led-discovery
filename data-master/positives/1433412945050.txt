I remember the Onward Brass Band had to play the marches for the Masonics or the Odd Fellows. They hired one band during the day--a big military band--that would play all the marches and that would introduce each dignitary of the organisation with military music. But the band was sitting. And between those introductions and the marching and the drilling, they would play some dance music, so they would swing. 

They played the shuffle beat on the snare drum and mostly two beats on the bass drums. At first, in the bands, the snare drums and the bass drums were played by different men like in the marching bands. But there was one particular guy in New Orleans who put the two drums together and played both himself, and that's where the foot pedal was invented.
