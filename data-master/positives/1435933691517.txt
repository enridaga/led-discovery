In Pittsburgh, my home town, I was told about a great young pianist just coming up… Erroll Garner, then going to Westinghouse High School with my niece. 

I arranged to visit a friend's house to hear Erroll and was surprised to find such a little guy playing so much. And he did not even read music. The next few days were spent just listening to him. He was original then, sounding like no one in the world but Erroll Garner. 

At one point, I tried teaching him to read [music, but]… he didn't want to bother… [so] I tried to guide him any way I could, as others had guided me. I realized he was born with more than most musicians could accomplish in a lifetime.
