<p>In the matter of technique Jos&eacute;ffy&nbsp;is one of the world's wonders... The&nbsp;last time I met him was in poor Johann von Herbeck's&nbsp;sky-parlour, where he kept a large party of musical&nbsp;critics and executants up till daybreak by a very&nbsp;remarkable prodigality of his r&eacute;pertoire's apparently&nbsp;inexhaustible resources. At the conclusion of this&nbsp;entertainment, his hearers being fairly worn out with&nbsp;the high tension at which he had kept their nerves for several hours, nothing would satisfy him but that I&nbsp;should play him a match of " Kegel " billiards at a caf&eacute;&nbsp;of his predilection, which enjoyed the distinction of&nbsp;being permitted to keep open all night long, and &mdash; like&nbsp;the Maison Dor&eacute;e of old &mdash; had not been closed to its&nbsp;customers for many a year.</p>
