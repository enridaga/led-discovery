If I have not mentioned playing for Sir Adrian Boult, the kindest and most courteous of men, it is because he remained loyal to his BBC orchestra and did not often conduct the LPO until much later on. We only did a couple of concerts with him, one that I remember was on the occasion of the award of the Royal Philharmonic Societies Gold Medal to Richard Strauss. We played "Also sprach Zarathustra" and there was what one might call a very uncoordinated bit both at the rehearsal and the performance but fortunately the aged composer appeared to be fast asleep at the time.
