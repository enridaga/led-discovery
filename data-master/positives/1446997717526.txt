<p>We had a man with three of his children who gave us a most extraordianry Concert. The youngest child was not above six years old and blew the French Horn and his brother about nine or ten who played on the fiddle. It is astonishing how well and with what accuracy they played. The man's wife is now brought to bed at Taunton of her seventh child. They are all Musical and take to it very early. I have observed that Musick has little to do with Intellect in general but depends mostly on ear and it is thus that children before their understanding arrives in any degree of perfection yet become proficient in Musick and even Idiots, and certainly Madmen, sometimes excel in Singing and Musick.</p>
