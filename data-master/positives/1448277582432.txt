<p>The concert last evening was, perhaps, inferior to the general average. A principal point of attraction is always found in the Symphony, and on this occasion it was not a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Mendelssohn, but an original manuscript composition of a member of the Orchestra, Ferd. Hermann, that was performed. Herr Hermann directed his own Symphony. It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. There is always so much caution and incredulity, and sometimes suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to&nbsp;fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties.</p>
<p>Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner in which his work was received, and probably a young composer does not often obtain greater approbation. There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again.</p>
<p>Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, London, sang with approbation; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charmingly sung by Miss Mayer, coming seemingly fresh from the heart, on the tones of a sweet voice.</p>
