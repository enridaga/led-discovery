<p>Their [three Strauss boys] musical feats of course reached old Strauss' s ears,&nbsp;much to his gratification: but he made no sign until,&nbsp;several months having elapsed since he first became&nbsp;aware that they were acquiring celebrity, it struck him&nbsp;one day as absurd and unnatural that he should be about&nbsp;the only musician in the Kaiserstadt who had never&nbsp;heard any of his own son's compositions. Forthwith he&nbsp;sent a message to his wife, who occupied apartments&nbsp;above his own, but two flights higher, to the effect that&nbsp;he would esteem it a favour if she would permit his sons&nbsp;to pay him a visit. His request was granted at once,&nbsp;and the three boys were ushered into their father's presence. But, strange to say, the ''Waltz-King" (as the&nbsp;Viennese had christened Strauss the elder) had no piano-forte in his rooms. What was to be done? After some&nbsp;hesitation, he decided upon sending another message&nbsp;upstairs to ask Mamma Strauss to lend him her piano&nbsp;for an hour or two. Presently down came the piano,&nbsp;and the boys began to play &mdash; first their father's music,&nbsp;and then their own. The old man's delight was un-&nbsp;bounded; he embraced them over and over again, gave&nbsp;them his blessing, and then sent them back to their&nbsp;mother, together with the piano and his "compliments&nbsp;and thanks!"</p>
