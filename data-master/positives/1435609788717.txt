I then went to Wiesbaden to take part as soloist in my Concerto at a symphony concert conducted by Klemperer. It was there that I got into touch for the first time with this eminent conductor, with whom later I so frequently had the opportunity and pleasure of working. I shall always retain a grateful and affectionate memory of our relations, for I found in Klemperer not only a devoted propagandist of my work, but a forceful conductor, with a generous nature and intelligence enough to realize that in closely following the author’s directions there is no danger of prejudicing one’s own individuality.
