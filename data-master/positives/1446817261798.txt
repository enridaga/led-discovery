<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">My memory of the Royal Festival Hall was a tribute celebration to Kirsty McCall following her untimely death. It was a wonderful evening of a wide mix of stars coming together to celebrate Kirsty's life through the singing of her songs. Very poignant.</p>
