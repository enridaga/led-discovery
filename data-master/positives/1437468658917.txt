<p>After supper, we gaze at a segment of&nbsp;<em>60 minutes</em> featuring three examples of idiot savant... The third, not only retarded but blind, is a pianist. He just began playing one night, on that untuned upright of this foster parents rendering Tchaikovsky's First Concerto. Whatever does it come from? marvels the interviewer. "It's becuase I'm a musician," explains the savant. To "test" this talent, the interviewer plaus for him - and for us - the opening of Debussy's&nbsp;<em>Soir&eacute;e dans Grenade,&nbsp;</em>which the savant immendiately replays on his upright. The replay, which satisifies the interviewer and, presumably, ten million viewers, is in fact a coarse echo, an iterated C sharp ostinato with some Cui-type D-naturals and augmented seconds. The wonder is not that the savant could imitate Debussy even this well, but that Debussy himself once formed&nbsp;a trite tango, with the merest of "displacements", a nuanced and tasteful masterpiece. This boy plays by ear, no better and no worse than the urchins at JH's church. The&nbsp;<em>60 minutes</em> program goes on to inform us of the high fees these idiot savants now claim for their gifts. Savants, perhaps. Idiots, hardly.</p>
