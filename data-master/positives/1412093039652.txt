My father used to claim that he couldn’t actually hear any music when I had one of my records on. He said that it just sounded like a noise to him and that all he could hear was the boom, boom, boom of the bass. Another of his complaints was that he couldn’t hear the words and that when he could, the lyrics didn’t seem to make any sense. It is quite funny in retrospect, because I now realise that he was trying to wind me up and succeeded very well.
