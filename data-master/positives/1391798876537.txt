Yesterday I preached here in the morning, & (after a good peck) went with my landlord to Cotesbatch, & preached about idle words to Dr. Marriott, after a great treat on the harpsichord by Miss Greatorex, who was come thither, luckily, to teach. The good people were so civil as to press us to drink tea with them, so after dinner we all went & had a very pleasant afternoon, & I took my fiddle & accompanied (do you hear, Richard?) Miss G. & the two Miss Marriotts, who play well, very well indeed. I assure you this was a treat to me, especially as it was quite unexpected.
