Miles himself was growing more expansive. He positively reveled in the newfound physical freedom the wireless unit gave him, and he began playing with the band members, developing little tricks of call-and-response with Bill Evans. Miles had obviously developed a father-son thing with Bill, and it was easy to see why: Bill was always happy; he was fresh-faced, young, and full of talent. After Miles happened to hear him play piano one day, he began to incorporate this into their musical interactions as well. Miles would come over and play a phrase at Bill, and Bill would repeat it on his sax. Bit by bit, the phrases would get longer and more complicated until Miles would finally blow some really strange series of notes that Bill couldn't repeat. In retaliation, Miles would drag Bill over to the keyboard, sit him down and make him play. It looked like a father marching his son to the woodshed. It may have been corny, it may have been cute, but the audiences adored it.
