<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Kraftwerk - 2004.&nbsp; An absolutely incredible live performance in 3 parts - a portion of Kraftwerk classics, opening with "Man Machine" (with Ralph Hutter, Florian Schneider and colleagues silhouetted behind a stage curtain) to "Trans-Europe Express" and including "Tour de France", "The model" and "Radioactivity", all accompanied by film images, Kraftwerk in matching grey suits. A short break followed by the bard in computer graphics - luminous outfits and a third section performed by their robots.</p>
