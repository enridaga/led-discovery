At risk of sounding like some typical middle-aged man, all the modern pop music sounds the same. It is loud and there is just not the variety that there once was. Just look back to the seventies and think a little about the different hit songs that one might hear; Carly Simon, Slade, Kate Bush, The Who, James Taylor and Crosby Stills. They are all completely different styles of music, with a huge range of types and a lot of experimentation. You can’t see anybody still wanting to play any of today’s popular music in forty years time, the way that music from the seventies is still played.
