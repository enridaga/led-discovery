<p>It was the Summer of 95. Elvis Costello's Meltdown, one of the best weeks of my life. It opened with The Jazz Passengers and the Gorgeous Debbie Harry. Elvis joined them on stage for a couple of songs. I believe I went to 5 evenings of concerts that week. The highlights were seeing Steve Nieve's solo gig, coming out of their (sic) and meeting Elvis and then going into see Elvis and the Brodsky Quartet (with Steve Nieve on piano), it was bliss. The series introduced me to artists such as Bill Frissell (sic), who played with Elvis and out of which a Live CD Deep Dead Blue, was produced. I first saw the Gospel group The Fairfield Four perform here, amazing vocalists. It was the last night of EC's Meltdown and Elvis had several artists on to celebrate "The Song", one being June Tabor and another was Jeff Buckley. I hadn't heard of Jeff until that moment and he absolutely stole the show. It was one of those hair-standing moments you feel. What a shame that week had to end.</p>
