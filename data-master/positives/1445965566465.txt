Not only all the vocal, but the instrumental parts were executed by women, concealed from view in a grated gallery. Their performance was perfect, and some of the voices exquisitely beautiful, in every pitch of which the female organ is capable. The oratorio I heard was that of Sampson, in Latin, the composition of Bertoni, by whose favour a party of English was admitted into the interior, to a morning concert, when we had not only the pleasure of hearing a delightful selection of music, hut the almost incredible sight of an entire orchestra of female performers.</span></p>
