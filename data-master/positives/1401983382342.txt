We had been on holiday in France for ten days. Although there had been rumours of war, my father didnâ€™t believe them. But then war broke out, so we made our way to Le Havre by boat. We went to a hotel, had a clean-up and then went out in the town and then the excitement began. It was absolutely incredible. The British Expeditionary Force was coming in. The soldiers were marching in, all singing...and oh! terrific excitement!
