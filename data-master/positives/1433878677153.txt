<p>Mr. Cheslyn invited me to spend a few days at Langley Priory, to meet the lyric bard, Mr. Anacreon Moore [...] He might be compared to the poets of old who recited their verses to the lyre ; his voice, rich and flexible, was always in tune, and his delivery of the words neat and delicious ; his manner of touching the instrument was careless and easy ; his fingers seemed accidentally to drop upon the keys, producing a simple harmony just sufficient to support the voice. In such company his performance was delightful, always indulging in the amoroso, a style peculiarly his own.</p>
