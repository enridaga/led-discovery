<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">Festival of Britain year, or was it 1952?&nbsp; The Vienna State Opera were sold out.&nbsp; My mother and I camped out overnight for standing tickets.&nbsp; I was 12.&nbsp; While queuing, two people emerged, unable to stay for the last act of 'The Marriage of Figaro'.&nbsp; They gave us their tickets.&nbsp; My first memory was the magic of the sight and the music of Barberina seeking the pin.&nbsp; Mystery, wonderment.&nbsp; Never forgotten.</p>
