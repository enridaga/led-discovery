I think one of the greatest conductors was Weingartner who was one of the most courteous of men. He conducted the Schubert 'Unfinished Symphony' and the Beethoven 'Pastoral' when we played in Vienna again and was very anxious for us to go to supper with him afterwards. I think his conducting was something apart, something beyond this world, but he had great gaiety too.
