I remember singing a song somewhat similar to this as a solo in Mr. Moody's Tabernacle in Chicago at the close of an evangelistic meeting in 1872. Mr. Bliss came in late and stood just inside the door, listening. At the close of the meeting he came up to the platform and spoke enthusiastically about the piece, and remarked that he also would try to write a hymn on " The Prodigal," Not long afterwards I heard him sing this beautiful hymn, which he entitled " Calling Now."
