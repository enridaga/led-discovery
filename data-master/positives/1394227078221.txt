At this time it was that I first began to be pleased with vocal music in parts, it being the custom of my grandfathers on a Sunday evening, after reading a sermon etc. to sing a psalm or two together, in which my aunts & I used to sing the treble (or air), my uncle George the tenor & my uncle Henry the bass, by which addition to the melody I thought the effect much improv'd & render'd very grand.
