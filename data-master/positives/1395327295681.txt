Next in the succession of Beecham's leaders came one of the ripest of all the characters....He made the most gorgeous sound, soft and rich, the absolute equal in many ways of that of the great Fritz Kreisler. This sound he used to superb effect in all his solos, but he was also able to project it into any section he led, and I sometime feel that under his leadership the Beecham orchestras achieved their finest string sonority.
