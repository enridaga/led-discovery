Letter from Bunsen to his wife, London: 15th October -
After a pause, I gave, ' England and Prussia for ever ! ' and spoke withal. Thereupon were sung, 'Des Deutschen Vaterland,' and ' Bekranzt mit Laub,' and ' Was blasen die Trompeten.' The general enthusiasm was stimulated by the speeches and the songs, which told of England and Prussia as not contending against but emulating each other ; the tone of feeling was that of exalted cheerfulness, purified by consciousness of the solemnity of the point of union.
