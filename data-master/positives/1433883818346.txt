<p>In September, 1827, we embarked on board the steamer at the Tower stairs for Rotterdam [...] As soon as we had dressed I repaired to the cathedral, and was just in time for the morning service. On entering, at the eastern end, I had a full view of the organ, which so much surpassed in magnitude anything of the kind I had seen before, that for a while I was at a loss to conjecture even at what I was looking. The massive columns of silver rising from the floor up to the roof, and filling up the whole width of the middle aisle, was a spectacle without parallel. The sounds did not correspond with the appearance, as but few stops were used, and those not of a quality to be admired.</p>
