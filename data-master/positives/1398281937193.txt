Mary's Bar on Eighth Street. It is already eleven summers ago that John Myers and Frank Etherton worked there, whining the tunes that Paul Goodman and I composed for them: Bawling Blues, Jail-Bait Blues, Near Closing Time. Occasionally, for comic relief, Eugene Istomin would play Ondine on the tuneless piano and the drunks would actually stop talking.
