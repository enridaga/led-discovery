<p>I went with Adam Oliver's band, my first band, played with them just a short while, and I had the opportunity of hearin' King Bolden's Band at Lincoln Park. And I got crazy to play with Bolden and Bolden played my style of music. I liked to read, but I played that head music better--more jazz to it. I liked to read, and I could read good, but Bolden played pretty much by ear. And made up his own tunes; but everything that he played, I could whistle, I could play. And I jumped Olivier's band and went with Bolden. That was in 1895.</p>
