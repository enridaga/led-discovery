<p>During&nbsp;my repeated and, on more than one occasion, protracted&nbsp;sojourns in the Principality [of Serbia] &mdash; that was its rank until&nbsp;a few years ago, when it promoted itself to the rank of&nbsp;Kingdom &mdash; I have frequently, much too frequently,&nbsp;heard male Servians grunt and female Servians squeal,&nbsp;under the pretence of singing, in a manner that would&nbsp;have done distinguished credit to the most vociferous&nbsp;hog of all the bristly herds that constitute the staple of&nbsp;their national trade ; and it has been my dismal fate, times without number, to listen to Servian military bands,&nbsp;doing such deeds of terror with brass and wood, as have&nbsp;blanched my cheek and chilled my blood. But no sound&nbsp;of strictly Servian origin that has ever reached my ears&nbsp;could be justly described as musical.</p>
