<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 150%;">Webern&rsquo;s choral harmony disconcerts me, too, for example at the words &lsquo;<em>Im Dunkel&rsquo;</em>, near the end of the First Cantata, and again in the parallel-interval passages in the fifth movement of the Second Cantata. I can see the interval logic and the purity in these constructions. And I am willing to believe that they derive from a teleological conception of form, though some might call it a mania for total serial identification. But it <em>is </em>harmony, after all, and in the case of the <em>&lsquo;Im Dunkel&rsquo;</em> passage, banal harmony.</p>
