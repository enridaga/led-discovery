One evening, returning on foot from a late party, as I was passing Eue Taitbout I sang tolerably loud, there being no one very near, the theme of the Finale of Beethoven's Choral Symphony, which I had heard on the previous Sunday at the Conservatoire. I had not noticed a gentleman who was walking about five yards before me in the same direction, and who, hearing me sing, stopped when I came up to him, when I recognised the redoubtable conductor of the ' Concerts du Conservatoire,' M. Habeneck, whose personal acquaintance I had not made. He addressed me with, ' Ah, vous chantez la neuvieme ? ' and on my replying with a few enthusiastic expressions, he asked brusquely: Who are you ? ' I gave my name, upon which he shook hands with me, said he had heard often of my doings, and to my surprise and delight ended with the question : ' Why don't you play at our concerts ? ' I explained frankly that I had not dared to apply for such an honour ; and ' Call to-morrow and we will arrange that,' was his welcome answer.
