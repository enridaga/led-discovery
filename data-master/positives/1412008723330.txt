There were a number of different and distinct styles of popular music when I was a teenager. There was a sort of snobbishness about which you favoured. Those who liked heavy rock like Black Sabbath would be a little ‘sneery’ about gentle stuff like James Taylor or Joni Mitchell, say. Those who liked Carole King would feel that their tastes were superior to somebody who liked ABBA and so on. Occasionally there was crossover from one type of music to another, but often teenagers were insular and conservative when it came to other people’s music.
