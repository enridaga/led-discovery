It was from some one in the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>famous pianist's entourage, reminding me that <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>M. Paderewski was very fatigued after his heavy <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>work in the provinces, and begging that I would <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>under no circumstances ask him to play that evening. I was half amused, half annoyed by this unexpected communication, which, of course, I knew <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>better than to regard as inspired by my guest of <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>honor himself. It was also entirely superfluous, as <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>I always made it a strict rule never to request an <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>artist to perform in my house who did not come <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>there for that purpose or with that expressed intention. However, I thought no more about it until <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>after dinner, when I took an opportunity to inform <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Paderewski, in a whispered &ldquo;aside&rdquo;, of the strange <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>warning I had received. I assured him seriously <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that I had not had the slightest idea of asking him <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to play, and that my friends were more than satisfied to have the pleasure of meeting him and enjoying his society. He replied : <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Do you imagine I think otherwise? This is a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>case of 'Save me from my friends!' That I am <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>tired is perfectly true. But when I am in the mood <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to play fatigue counts for nothing. And I am in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>that mood to-night. Are you really going to have <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>some music?" <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>''Yes, Piatti has brought his 'cello, and he is <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>going to take part in the Rubinstein sonata in D."&nbsp;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>"Then I should like to play it with him; and more beside, if he will permit me. Piatti and I <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>are now old colleagues at the &ldquo;Pops,&rdquo; and we always get on splendidly together." <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What could I say?&mdash; save express my gratitude, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and apprise my friends of the treat that was in <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>store. It was the more welcome because it was virtually unexpected. An unalloyed delight was the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>performance of that lovely sonata by the &ldquo;Prince <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of 'Cellists&rdquo; and the greatest of living pianists. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Both seemed to revel in the beauties of a work admirably designed for the display of their respective instruments, and the rendering was in every <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>way perfect. After it was over, dear old Piatti, <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>who rarely talked much, said to me in his quiet <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>way, &ldquo;I quite enjoyed that. I have played the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>sonata with Rubinstein many times, but it never <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>went better than to-night.'' Later on he played <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>again; and so did Paderewski&mdash; with Sullivan close <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>by his side, watching with fascinated eyes the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>nimble fingers as they glided over the keys. That <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>evening the illustrious pianist was inspired.</span></p>
