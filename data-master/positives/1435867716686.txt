At this period [in 1794], Mr. Sheridan was getting largely in my debt ; I, myself, was not keeping out of debt and my wine bills were very large ; the purple tide 
flowed by day and night ; and I never stopped it, for then "I took the DRUNKARD for a GOD." One day, I called upon him, and requested he 
would let me have a little money ; he put me off, as usual, with promising he would let me have some to-morrow. To-morrow was always his favourite 
pay-day ; but, like the trust-day at a French inn, that morrow never did I see. In the midst of all this, he told me how much he was pleased with Tom Welsh, (then a boy,) and his singing "Angels, ever bright and fair," the night before. 
"He should be encouraged," said he ; " go and tell him, that, in addition to his salary, I shall send him a present of 200l. ; and you shall take it to him." "Shall I?" said I, (making the quotation from Lionel and Clarissa), I think the borough 
maybe disposed of to a worthier candidate;" but neither Welsh nor I ever got a halfpenny of the money.
