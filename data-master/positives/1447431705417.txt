<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">A very special memory for my twin sister and myself was the first time we saw Bruno Walter conduct, and an exciting new German baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau sing in a performance of Mahler's 'Songs of a Wayfarer' in May 1955.&nbsp; I think it was probably Fischer-Dieskau's first appearance in this country.&nbsp; Unforgettable! A second special memory is of the concert 'Homage to Gerald Moore' on his retirement from the concert platform on 20 February 1967, with Victoria de los Angeles, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Elizabeth Schwarzkopf: a wonderful evening!</p>
