Lords day. Up and walked to Pauls; and by chance it was an extraordinary day for the Readers of the Inns of Court and all the students to come to church, it being an old ceremony not used these 25 years - upon the first Sunday in Lent. Abundance there was of students, more than there was room to seat but upon forms, and the Church mighty full. One Hawkins preached, an Oxford man - a good sermon upon these words: “But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable.” Both before and after sermon I was most impatiently troubled at the Quire, the worst that ever I heard.
