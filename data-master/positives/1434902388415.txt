Go to dinner with Iris Lemare at 7.0. & afterwards to the first of the MagNaghten-Lemare concerts. R.O. Morris Canzon no. 6. (Dull & academical I thought). Dorothy Gow's Phant. some amusing music, but bad str. writing. Stuart Wilson sings 8 Oliver Gotch songs - works of a clever Amateur. Maconchy Vln Sonata (Helen Perkin & Anne MacN) interesting tho' lacking in individuality & Haydn's 1st quart. played v. roughly.*
