<p>I hope you will enjoy that long twilight; but here it is beautiful too in our solitary garden, all full of oldfashioned roses, and birds and "Hollunder b&uuml;sche". It is so intoxicating! I don't know whether you feel all this rich summer beauty, glow and perfume as I do, but I always hear it in your music, much more than in anybody else's. I love the accompaniment of: Nur schneller mein Ross; it is just my summer Stimmung, and I manage to play it, a desperate effort, but so exciting! Il pleure dans mon couer is beautiful too, but more in town, or perhaps in autumn when one feels like that.&nbsp;</p>
