<p>At day-break, one morning, I was awakened by the beating of drums, and an uproar in the street ; I found the King and Queen had made their escape from Paris ; the tumult was terrific ; all the gates of Paris were closed ; the national guards called out ; in short, all was anarchy and confusion; and although those dreadful scenes have been too accurately described to need an observation, it is impossible for one who has been an eye-witness to the horrors of a revolution, to refer to the period without touching on the subject...</p>
<p>The next day Paris was all in a bustle ; couriers gallopping backwards and forwards, dragged off their horses by the mob, and obliged to shew their dispatches before they were allowed to proceed. In the evening, the King and Queen were expected to arrive at the Thuilleries...About six o'clock they entered the Thuilleries. I shall never forget it ; it was a heart-breaking sight to see them brought prisoners into their own palace.</p>
