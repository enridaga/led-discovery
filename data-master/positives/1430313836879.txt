 Back in the city [New York, 1970s], I took on the job of road manager for my former band, Rat Race Choir. I was beginning to accept the fact that I would never be as good a guitar player as I wanted to be. I'd heard John McLaughlin playing on Miles Davis's 'A Tribute to Jack Johnson' [album] and also saw him perform live with the The Mahavishnu Orchestra, and he made me want to cut my fingers off in frustration. How could anyone play that fast, I wondered?
