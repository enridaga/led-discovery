An extract from a Contemporary Notice, 1st May, 1847 -
It was on this last occasion of Mendelssohn's presence in London, that he was requested to conduct the execution of the Oratorio of ' St. Paul,' when the Queen and Prince Albert had promised their presence at Exeter Hall. It is well remembered how striking was the effect of his reception by the orchestra, filled with musicians unusual in amount of numbers and of talent, who, as
he entered, struck up the air of triumph, ' See the conquering hero comes! '—after which, on Her Majesty's entrance, ' God save the Queen' was given with thrilling effect. The Oratorio had (and has) but the one imperfection (shared with the ' Elijah ') of over-tasking human powers of taking in the abundance of musical meaning— half the piece would be quite enough for thorough enjoyment.
