And there was as goodly a Mass as could be heard, and every clerk having a cope and garland, and with hundred streamers borne and the&nbsp;waits&nbsp;playing. And they marched about Cheap, and so to Leadenhall unto St. Ethelburga's Church, and there they put off their gear. And there was the Blessed Sacrament borne with torchlight about, and repaired thence unto the Barbers' Hall to dinner.</span></p>
