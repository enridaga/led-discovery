<p>The highlight of the Sheffield Festival was seeing and hearing Rachmaninoff. We performed his cantata "The Bells" though nobody quite seemed to know why he did not in the end conduct it himself, and I was sitting close to him as he played his Second Piano Concerto. He wore an evening dress that was literally green with age, sat very still and hummed throughout on one note while, without any histrionics, he produced the most beautiful playing I have ever heard - an absolute revelation.</p>
