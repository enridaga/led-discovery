<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 9.1px; font-family: Arial;">I attended the Midnight Jazz Matinee at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday 15 October 1957 organised by Christain Action to raise funds for the defence of the 156 accused in the South African Treason Trial. The Humphrey Lyttleton and the John Dankworth bands played as did Lionel Hampton. I still have the programme which has a photo of the 156 accused on the front cover. Nelson Mandela can be seen standing in the middle of the picture. Kind regards,</p>
