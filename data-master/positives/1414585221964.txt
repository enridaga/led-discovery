<p>Vienna</p>
<p>Meine liebe Grace, ...</p>
<p>... The friends we stayed with in Basel were such dears &amp; treated us so well - I've never had such a time - everyone seems to be wealthy there - wonderful houses, marvellous food, &amp; they took us everywhere in glorious cars. Musically too - very good. There is an excellent opera - I heard four operas very well done, a simply lovely show of Zauberfl&ouml;te. One of the people I stayed with knew Weingartner (who lives there) &amp; I had a very long talk with him &amp; found him nice &amp; helpful, tho' not interested in modern music at all - in fact I went tp a rehearsal &amp; show of a concert of Strauss he conducted and it was VERY BAD - but the orchestra was first-rate, and oh - Elizabeth [sic] Schumann was a dream. But I am all E.S. mad now - I heard her here on Sunday - but more of that later. - We stayed in Basel - (talking plenty of German as they speak very little English) - just a fortnight, &amp; them spent 3 days in lovely Salzburg on the way here. Of course, after Zauberfl&ouml;te I was thrilled with Mozart relics, &amp; there are many of those there.</p>
<p>... Music: - 3 times to the opera so far - Fledermaus on Saturday, 'Cav. &amp; Pag' (this was substituted for something else at the last moment), &amp; Falstaff last night, Vienna went mad over this last - it was a new production &amp; the applause lasted for nearly a quarter of an hour - [baritone, Jaro] Prohaska (from Berlin) &amp; [conductor, Clemens] Krauss coming back time after time. Grace - you must admit that this is great stuff - I don't expect you to accept early Verdi - but the Requiem, Otello, &amp; this, you must like - especially when done as it was last night - it was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thrilling</span>. Of course the orchestra - it was full number last night - is unsurpassable. I went to a show at the Konzerthaus on Sunday, &amp; sat next to an awfully nice young Viennese, who told me lots about everything. Mengelberg, who wasn't too good - his Pastoral was BAD - conducted. Oh - but the orchestra, it nearly drove me potty!! Never such tone, &amp; precision, &amp; spirit - the first horn - well, all the horns - the orchestra played as if it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wanted</span> to play - I felt sorry for you with those London orchestras! Much as I want to like them, &amp; do admire a lot of their playing, it's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nothing</span> like this. However you know it already.</p>
<p>... Herzliche Gr&uuml;sse</p>
<p>BENJAMIN</p>
<p>P.S. [written at the head of the letter] I didn't sat the concert on Sunday included Mahler 4th of which I bought the score. It really is a most lovely work - &amp; was played beautifully - Elizabeth [sic] Schumann singing the last lovely solo like a dream. I am longing for more chances to hear more Mahler</p>
