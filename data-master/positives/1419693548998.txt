With his Schubert, Mozart and Brahms I myself felt much less satisfied, and sometimes wondered if he should conduct the sort of music he has obviously rejected in his own writing. Recent years, however, have shown a pleasing change in his attitude, and most players now feel a secure warmth in his conducting which he did not have as a young man. It will be interesting to see what the next stage turns out to be, as he enters his sixties.
