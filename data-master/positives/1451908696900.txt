<p>&nbsp;Later on I repeatedly heard&nbsp;him [Leonhard Emil Bach] play at Berlin and Vienna, in both of which critical&nbsp;cities he took a high position among the younger&nbsp;apostles of sensational pianism. Since that time his&nbsp;style has ripened, and his production of tone has become&nbsp;far mellower than it was during his " storm and strain ''&nbsp;period.&nbsp;</p>
