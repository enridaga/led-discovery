<p>Joining the crowd, I followed my nose to the corner of Hayne and Meeting to see the Liberty Pole erected. It is some eighty or ninety feet tall with a gilded ball on the summit. Scarce had I reached the arena and secured a standing place before the cannon of the LaFayette Artillery boomed on the air amid the cracking of glass and the banner was unfurled amid the huzzas of the multitude, bearing a palmetto sprinkled with fifteen stars and the legend "Animis Opibusque parati" - the gift of the ladies of Charleston. After a prayer, the audience of five thousand was addressed by Theo. Barker amid immense applause. Suddenly one universal shout went up and the banner of the Mercury office, the first one in the city, spread together with a real palmetto were received and placed at the mast head. Dr. Robertson, Mr. Hammond and others spoke amid enthusiastic cheering and delightful music from the band. At one o'clock the crowd retired peaceably to their homes and I muddied (not muddled) went with them. Hurrah for noble South Carolina. She has begun good work. May she ever prosper.</p>
