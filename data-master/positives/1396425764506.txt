I spend 2 hrs reading poetry solidly, & then write - in desperation a very short song - "Sport" of W.H. Davies. I don't like it; even less than usual. Practise 11.30-12.30; 2.15-4.15 5.0-6.0 (the extra hour to make up for some of the time I've missed. I listen to Delius (1st Cuckoo & Summer Night) on Miss Prior's wireless at 8.0 against a background of Jack Payne - even then they were miraculous. He is a wizard.
