In due season, after my arrival at Verona, I waited upon the Marquis of Bevi Acqua to deliver my letter of introduction. I found him at home in his magnificent house ; he received me with marked kindness, and did me the honour to introduce me to his lady and three of her lovely daughters. The letter explained the particulars of my story, and the Marquis invited me the next evening to a concert at his house. Of course I accepted the invitation. I found an elegant assemblage of the first people of Verona. In the course of the 
evening, I sang two songs, and accompanied myself on the piano-forte, and the company seemed pleased with me. The story of my escape from Brescia, and its half-romantic cause, had created no small share of interest for me; and when I waited on the Marquis the next morning, I found that he and the Marchioness had planned a public concert for me under their patronage. I was introduced by them to Signer Barbella, the first piano-fortist and composer in Verona, who was directed by the Marquis to engage the concert-room and performers for me; all which he did with economy and punctuality.
