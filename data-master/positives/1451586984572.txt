<p><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">It will soon be a year since the first production of my opera <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk</em>. That production was a great lesson for me. / I feel that as far as my works for the stage are concerned, <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Lady Macbeth</em> represents a step forward. Recalling my failures in this area (the ballets <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">The Golden Age</em> and <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Bolt</em>), I began to look for the reasons for these failures and for the success of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Lady Macbeth</em>, and established that the essential element in the opera is the attempt to penetrate as deeply as possible into the content of the given material. </span></p>
