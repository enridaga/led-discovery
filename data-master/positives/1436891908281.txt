<pre>My next musical productions were in a play taken from Mr. Lewis's romance of 
"The Monk," by Mr. Boaden, and performed at Drury Lane, called "Aurelio and <br />Miranda." I thought there was a great deal of merit in the writing; but it was <br />only acted six nights: many thought it indecorous to represent a church on the 
stage (which, by the way, was a fine specimen of the art, painted by Capon). But <br />the powerful objection was, the unearthly appearance of Kemble, as the Monk. I <br />never shall forget his attitude immediately after his entrance; his dress the <br />look. The tout ensemble struck me to be more than human. He was hailed with the <br />most rapturous applause ; but he stood motionless, with uplifted eyes, and <br />apparently regardless of the public tribute.</pre>
