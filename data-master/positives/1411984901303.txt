...I recall a little incident which exhibits my Father’s morbid delicacy of conscience. He was accustomed, in his brighter moments... occasionally to sing loud Dorsetshire songs of his early days, in a strange, broad Wessex lingo that I loved. One October afternoon he and I were sitting on the verandah, and my father was singing; just round the corner, out of sight, two carpenters were putting up the framework of a greenhouse. In a pause, one of them said to his fellow: ‘He can zing a zong, zo well’s another, though he be a minister.’ My Father, who was holding my hand loosely, clutched it, and looking up, I saw his eyes darken. He never sang a secular song again during the whole of his life.
