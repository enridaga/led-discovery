Can you imagine hearing Louis Armstrong playing the trumpet with Fats Waller at the piano, getting the flavor of the numbers together? The late Leonard Harper (one of the greatest Negro producers that ever lived) calling his chorus to the floor, and giving them the routine. Comedians repeating their parts on the side. All gaiety, laughter, enthusiasm. 

Yet, what stood out most was Louis and Fats. To see these two geniuses at work, two of the most magnetic personalities in the world, to me, is something I'll treasure for the rest of my life. Louis would play the tunes at first in the lower register, with a tone as broad as Fats himself. These low, thick, round notes that come out of Louis's horn on the lower register, I have never heard come out of another trumpet in all my life--and I've heard many a trumpet in my days. Fats was always kidding with Louis, and I remember when they started one time to rehearse "Ain't Misbehavin' ". Fats sat down at the piano and began to sing it to Louis, and what an accompaniment he gave to it as he sang! Pure unadulterated blues. If you don't think that's possible--try a piano and sing it.
