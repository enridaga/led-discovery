<p>The second of Koussevitzky's concerts, including a piano Concerto by Tailleferre. At first it seemed an attractive piece, light and Mozartian. But not for long: later on it turned into a derivative bore. From the point of view of a pianist playing this Concerto it was very feeble. It is no easy matter to compose a Concerto that is interesting for a pianist to play. Time was when Ziloti was very critical of my First Piano Concerto in this respect: it was insufficiently pianistic. Well, this one was far less so, and to make matters worse she was barely audible.</p>
