Our third concert, consisting of French music, attracts a much younger audience and the dome feels fresh and open. David and I play the Saint-Saëns Allegro Appassionato, and Fauré's 'Après Un Rêve'; Robin and I play the Ravel Habanera, Liat sings the Chansons Chansons Madécasses of Ravel, and Krysia, David and I do the Ravel Trio, which is very enthusiastically received. People in the audience magically say all the right things afterwards; one says he liked the trio because we didn't have to demonstrate 'playing together', we simply were together. Another says that she loves the unified atmosphere that results from our doing everything ourselves with such a small number of people. There is an archetypal Domus concert-goer who says that she never goes to classical concerts, but had read that we were supposed to be friendly, had come along as an experiment to the first concert, and had come back to every concert since. Several people again comment how exciting it is to be at such close quarters to live performers, and how they feel touched by the physical effort and communication, as though by a live current.
