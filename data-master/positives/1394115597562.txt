Balls has brought back some good records with him, and they are the only source of my joy. (Schuberts unf. Symp (very cut), Casse Noisette, & both Peer Gynt Suites). No letter from Mummy. She hasn't written since Friday, & then only a note. I play Hockey for first time, & consequently I'm very tired now (in evening). Orchestra practise 5.45. (Beethoven ov. Prom.) (Bach Peasant Cant.) Oh! The music's lovely, but Oh! The playing!!
