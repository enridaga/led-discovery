About two years later my friend Rembert Wurlitzer, the renowned violin dealer of New York, called me in Philadelphia. He was brief. “It is here. Just arrived from London. Hurry.” Sensing what to expect, I dashed to New York. There, facing the “Baudiot” Stradivari, and after striking only a few notes on it, once more I gave free reign to my enthusiastic impulses and bought the cello on the spot. At as first encounter one feels an immediate rapport with some people, so it was with the “Baudiot.” There was no need to get better acquainted – no work, no study required – and I played on it from the first day with joy and complete confidence.
