<p>To return to Gratz : the time at length arrived for opening of the operatic campaign. The company was good, the first comic man, Guglielmi, excellent ; La Signora Benini was a great favourite. The first opera was " La vera Costanza," the music by Anfossi. I had some good songs in it, and was in high spirits. As it was the custom for the ladies, the first night of the opera, to go in grand gala, the boxes and parterre were a perfect blaze of diamonds, and every part of the house was crowded. I was supported by numbers of my countrymen, who were present ; and, independently of them, the applause I received was beyond my expectations, and far beyond my merits.</p>
