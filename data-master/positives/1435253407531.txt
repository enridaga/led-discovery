I feel better this morning, and this evening's rise in temperature is
very usual after all. No symptoms, hardly even a head-ache, except at times to-day. ('1812' on a gramophone: I must stop to listen : six months ago I should have said I was tired of it, but when you've heard almost no music since, 
your heart goes out to it!).
