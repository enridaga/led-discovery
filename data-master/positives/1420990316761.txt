<p>That evening I d&eacute;buted in Madeleine's territory as a r&eacute;citant. Donald Pippin had arranged a balanced program at the Old Spaghetti Factory on Green Street. First a Lully Suite for eight instruments. Then my Lovers, narrative in ten scenes for harpsichord, oboe, cello, vibraphone and tom-toms. Followed by Lou Harrison's Jeptha's Daughters with Robert Duncan declaiming. Finally Fa&ccedil;ade, deliciously conducted by Hughes, with Lou and me as speakers. This was possibly its most amusing American performance, Lou's timbre being squeaky, mine low-pitched and both our dictions impeccable. But we had too much fun performing - the audience was left out. Should only be done by the English.</p>
