Another satisfaction of this decade was being entrusted with the introduction of Frank Martin’s new Violin Concerto at the Paris “Festival des Chefs d’Oeuvres du XXème Siècle,” at the Edinburgh and Holland festivals, at La Scala in Milan, in Geneva, Lausanne, and Brussels, and later with the New York Philharmonic (Mitropoulos), and in Cleveland (Szell), Cincinnati (Johson), and Dallas (Hendl). I had “discovered” (for myself, that is!) Frank Martin very early in his and my careers, in the early 1920’s, when Ansermet gave the first performance of the young composer’s 'Rhythmes', by which I was greatly impressed. Ansermet remained a stanch advocate of Martin’s music throughout those decades, and it added to my satisfaction that it was he who conducted that first Paris performance in 1952.
