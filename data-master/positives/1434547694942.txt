Letter from Mrs. Delany to Mrs. Dewes, Without date, but evidently Augt., 1750 -
You have never mentioned Carolan's tunes since you said you had received them, have you tried them ? I think some are very pretty ; Sir Toby Buck and Mich 0' Connor are great favourites. We have the same harper in the house we had when at Hollymount ; he plays very well, and knows a vast variety of tunes ; and hot as the weather is the young folks meet here once or twice a week and make up at most three couple, always dance six or seven dances, and I love to see them mirthful, though I don't find myself always inclined to join with them.
