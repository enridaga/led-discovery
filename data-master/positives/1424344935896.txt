<p>Among his [Ysa&yuml;e] compositions are six sonatas for solo violin, one of which, the fourth, he dedicated to Kreisler. Philip Newman, an outstanding fiddler and a pupil of Ysa&yuml;e, told me that he stood outside the bedroom door on the day Ysa&yuml;e died in 1931 and played this sonata to him. He was afterwards informed by Antonine Ysa&yuml;e that his father opened his eyes when he heard the violin and at the end of the first movement murmured &lsquo;Very fine!&rsquo; During the finale Ysa&yuml;e tried to beat time and when the sonata came to an end he said, &lsquo;Splendid!- but a little too fast.&rsquo; Those were the last words he spoke.</p>
