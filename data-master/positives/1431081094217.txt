Do you ever go back and listen to your early trio recordings with Cal Tjader (on drums and vibes) and Ron Crotty (on bass)? There was a two-record set of those sessions reissued on Fantasy recently.

Yes, I had to go back and listen to them for that reissue. There was a lot going on there. I never really locked in and polished up any one of the things I was doing.
