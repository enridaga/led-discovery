<p>On the 3rd of February, I witnessed an appalling spectacle, at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket: their Majesties, on that night, had commanded three pieces,-"My Grandmother," " No Song, no Supper," and " The Prize," all written by my friend, Prince Hoare. To have them all performed on the same night, by royal command, was no small compliment to the author, and must have been highly satisfactory to him,- The crowd was so great, that at the opening of the doors, in going down the steps which led to the pit, three or four persons slipped and fell, and several others were hurried over them ; sixteen persons were trampled to death, and upwards of twenty were taken up with broken limbs. The news of this fatal accident was, very judiciously, kept from their Majesties until after the performance was over, when they evinced the deepest sorrow and regret at the event.</p>
