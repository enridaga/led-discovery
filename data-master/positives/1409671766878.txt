<p>[quoted from the author's diary:] "I was also invited by T&uuml;rpen to an interesting Musical Soir&eacute;e. I found assembled there a small but a very select company of the most zealous friends of Music in Magdeburg. I played Quartetts by Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, and in conclusion the Es-Major-Quartett of Rode. I was accompanied very well in all of them, so I that could give myself entirely up to my feelings. The company seemed enchanted. Herr T&uuml;rpen affirmed that I understood better than any one how to render the peculiar style of each Composer. As finale, our host played a Trio by Mozart, right well, on a very good pianoforte by Blum of Brunswick. But he has the bad habit of drawing out the 'Canto' too much, by which he rather injures the expression than improves it."</p>
