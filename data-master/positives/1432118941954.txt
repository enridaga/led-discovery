We had a lovely performance of Mendelssohn's 'The Son and Stranger,' at Frau Frege's. The orchestra was under Rietz, David with Joachim and other great artists assisting. Frau Frege, in the part of a naïve rustic maiden, sang and acted charmingly; Fräulein Buck and Pögner acted the old parents; Widemann was the lover; scenery and decoration charming.
