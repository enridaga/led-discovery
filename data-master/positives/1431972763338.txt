At the age of eighteen months I was taken to my first concert by my parents. The Band of the Royal Engineers, my father’s regiment, was playing at the Queen’s Hall. My mother was very thrilled and put on her best hat, the first time she had been able to wear it since her return from India. I also had my best bonnet put on my head and a blue sash tied round my waist. Off we started in a four-wheeler. /At the concert I sat between my dear ones, but I was visible but the tip of a sun bonnet and a pair of white kid shoes. My mother righted me and it was at that moment I caught sight of the cello. I do not suppose that Sergeant Conker (how could I ever forget him?) was a great cellist but he and his cello certainly conquered my heart.
