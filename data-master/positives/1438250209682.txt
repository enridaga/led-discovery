<p>After an early dinner I go with the Bridges to a concert of the Audrey Melville orchestra which F.B. conducts. The orchestra isn't good - the prof. wind being appalling. But even then we had good shows of the Leonora 3 &amp; Borodin's lovely 2nd Symphony. Thelma Reiss plays the Dvorak Vlc concerto, with very lovely tone but not quite musically enough.&nbsp;</p>
