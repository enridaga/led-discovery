<p>We have also a Mlle Belleville, a Frenchwoman who plays the piano very charmingly, with an extraordinarily light touch, and very elegantly-- ten times better than WoerHtzer. She is giving a concert on Wednesday. She was present at that famous soiree musicale at Court, where Mlle Sontag sang. The two young ladies both performed. So did Woerlitzer but he was not so well received, as I was told by Kurpinski himself, who accompanied Mlle Sontag. People expressed their surprise to me that I was not invited, but I myself felt no surprise.</p>
