Here has been a Mrs. Baker (wife of a Col. Baker who has a house at Lowestoft, & a house in Parliament Street) of whose Pianoforte playing I have often heard great things; but she much more than answered my expectations, & has charmed me most outrageously. Suffice it to say, that she is, by far, the best player (Professors out of the question) that I ever heard: that her singing, too, thoâ€™ not so extraordinary as her playing, is very interesting: that she is handsome & extremely lively & pleasant. I have been engaged to meet her & accompany her, at morning concerts, & evening concerts; & had one rich musical afternoon here. I invited no unmusical, or half musical hearers, & we enjoyed the music we liked without the necessity of playing worse music to please popular & ignorant hearers. Indeed, it was a high musical treat to me
