Here I was in Jacksonville [Florida] trying to fit into something new: new people, new surroundings, new chances, new dangers. And I responded by seeking out any piano I could find.

The first one was in the union hall, and I played it whenever I could. I went in and heard what the other cats were up to. I was specially interested in the piano players. But after a while, when those guys saw me coming, they stopped playing; they knew I'd be copying their licks and they didn't want to give 'em away.

"Here comes that kid," they'd say.

And I could understand how they felt. They were right. Once I heard what they'd be putting down, I started running with it. Like a thief in the night.
