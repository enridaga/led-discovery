To H. E. E. HOWSON. College-Worcester.

Dec. 23.

The Mozart is great fun, but though I played him practically all the first two days, he has to retire for the moment. I am having lessons from Ivor Atkins. He was splendid. After being in the house five minutes he said, 'Now how much can you practise? Three hours, I suppose?' So I said I would and he would hear of nothing but Bach's forty-eight preludes and fugues, and started me on one of the few that have five parts. His playing of a prelude I had ground away at was a perfect marvel. And here am I booked for Thursday with that fugue, which I haven't yet touched, and a prelude going across country, 'for technique' as he calmly put it - which I can nearly play badly after some hours. A remarkable man, of whom I stand greatly in awe.
