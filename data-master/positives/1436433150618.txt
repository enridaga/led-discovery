<p>While we were talking, the Earl of Westmorland came up and spoke to me. Lord Cardigan said, "Ah, vous connaissez Monsieur Ganz?" "Mais oui, et ses parents. Ses oncles etaient mes premiers violon et violoncelle a Berlin." Lord Westmorland, who had been English Minister in Berlin, was one of the most distin- guished musical amateurs of the time. He composed operas and cantatas, and founded our Royal Academy of Music. His grand-daughter, the present Lady Londesborough, was a pupil of mine. As he was going away Lord Westmorland said, "I live only five miles from here, and would be very happy to see you if you will come over." There were many distinguished guests there, including Count Pourtales, Lord and Lady Ernest Bruce, the Earl and Countess of Jersey and their daughter, the beautiful Lady Clementina Villiers. The day after we had music in the afternoon, and I played to Lady Clementina, and she played some Chopin Valses and other pieces to me very beautifully. Mrs. Dudley Ward, a pupil of mine (afterwards Mme de Falbe), sang the same evening.</p>
