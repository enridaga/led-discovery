<p>In the evening the wireless did Pergolesi's <em>Stabat Mater.</em>&nbsp; I find that as I grow old I like this sort of music better and better, and respect it a great deal for being noble and unassuming and humane.&nbsp; I see why Stendhal thought so well of it. As one becomes disillusioned about people's intellectuals by seeing people so continually fools, one attachs more and more value to people's emotionals. Portico-music. I like porticos and Bernini colonnades, and poplar-tree colonnades too.</p>
