But I donâ€™t want to stop without telling you what I hinted at in the Town Hall, namely: that I enjoyed and admired the Overture to White Wings very, very much. It is just the sort of music that it should be and the sort that you should write. I was a little surprised at its shortness, but that is perhaps the fault of the title Overture. It is more an Introduction to Act I and if called that (or something similar) would seem just the right length, which it undoubtedly is in its role of starting this going. It seemed very well suited to the story, the period and the stage. It all sounded and I congratulate you on the way it was written and the way it was scored. I hope someone will have the sense to put it on. But if not you must go right ahead anyhow and count it not a bean. Excelsior!
