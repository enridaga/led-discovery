<p>In the afternoon&nbsp;<em>Scythians&nbsp;</em>and the Third Concerto in Amsterdam, the main event of my Dutch tour. To begin a programme with&nbsp;<em>Scythians</em>, having its first performance in the country, is quite something. It had a good reception, if a little restrained. After that I played the Third Concerto, better than yesterday, without getting lost, and even whipped up the tempo. Its success was exceptional, the hall (three-quarters full) rose to its feet and gave me a standing ovation. Some of the orchestra also stood, the first time in my life this has ever happened, and I was overwhelmed.</p>
