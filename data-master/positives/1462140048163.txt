<p>'last night I realized how thoro'ly brave &amp; spiritedly experimental a being that dear Delius is. Taking lots of risk, &amp; not content with mere "safe" well worn conventional pranks like that tiresome R. Strauss (how he wrote D Juan I cant fathom) Delius's stuff on the band sounds&nbsp;<em>so&nbsp;</em>poetic &amp; full of tender &amp;&nbsp;<em>rare&nbsp;</em>things...I dont say his form is convincing or that he is an out-&amp;-out genius but he's a most sympathetic &amp;&nbsp;<em>instructive&nbsp;</em>talent, with a dear abstract, compassionate, poetic soul.</p>
