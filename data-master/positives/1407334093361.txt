Now my house is full, and four fiddlers that play well. [...] So away with all my company down to the office, and there fell to dancing and continued at [it] an hour or two - there coming Mrs. Anne Jones, a merchant's daughter hard by, who dances well. And all in mighty good humour; and danced with great pleasure, and then sung, and then danced, and then sung many things of three voices, both Harris and Rolt singing their parts excellently. Among other things, Harris sung his Irish song, the strangest in itself, and the prettiest sung by him that ever I heard. Then to supper in the office, a cold good supper and wondrous merry. After supper to dancing again and singing, and so continued until almost 3 in the morning and then with extraordinary pleasure broke up; only, towards morning Knipp fell a little ill, and so my wife home with her to put her to bed, and we continued dancing - and singing; and among other things, our Mercer unexpectedly did happen to sing an Italian song I knew not, of which they two sung the other two parts too, that did almost ravish me and made me in love with her more than ever with her singing.
