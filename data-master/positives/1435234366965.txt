<p>In those days they almost came to blows in Harlem-- musicians I mean, about the two styles of playing. Why, when I joined Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club, about 1925 I guess, the men in the band were always fighting about which was the better style, Eastern or Western. 'Course, when I say Western, I mean everything that came out of New Orleans, Chicago, St Louis, Kansas City and places like that. The Western style was more open-- open horns and running chords and running changes. With Ellington it was the new men like myself and Johnny Hodges and Bigard against guys like Bubber Miley and Tricky Sam Nanton. They were playing wah-wah music with plungers and things. Actually, our coming into the Ellington band made them change somewhat.</p>
