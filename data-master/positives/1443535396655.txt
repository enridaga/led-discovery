<p>Monday being St. Cecilia's Day it was celebrated with great pomp at St. Patrick's Cathedral. We were there in the greatest crowd I ever saw; we went at 10 and staid till 4; there is a very fine organ, which was accompanied by a great many instruments, Dubourg at the head of them; they began with the 1st concerto of Corelli; we had Purcell's Te Deum and Jubilate; then the 5th concerto of Corelli ; after that an anthem of Dr. Blow's, and they concluded with the 8th concerto of Corelli. Perhaps you think this was entertainment enough for one day ; pardon me, we are not here so easily satisfied as to let one diversion serve for the whole day and we double and treble them. Lord Montjoy made a fine ball for the Duke and Duchess of Dorset and their retinue, our house was among the invited people, and Monday was the day fixed on.</p>
