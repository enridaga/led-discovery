Exhilarating to have a real concert hall in London, daringly designed, a tribute to British architecture, built in spite of post-War austerity. Not sure what our first visit was, but probably Sibelius' 5th Symphony, heard at last without the distorting echoes of the Albert Hall. A treat we hadn't thought we should ever have. In 2000+ Hugh Wood's glorious Symphony, a galaxy of shattering sound experiences building to an unbelievable climax. Shall we ever hear it again?
