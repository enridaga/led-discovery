I was at a session in EMI Studios on November 7th when the announcement came that all was well with mother and son, after a very protracted period of surgery. Everything stopped. Beecham made a little speech, promising to present a silver loving-cup (which is now our pride and joy) if I would inform him of the name of this 'new prodigy'. We were in the middle of a recording of the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Isaac Stern as soloist. We started again. The slow movement opens with a long clarinet duet. It fell apart, three times. Beecham just smiled, and started again; but I swear it was his fault, beating semi-quavers instead of quavers... To this day, when I see him, Isaac Stern still asks, 'How's the boy?' He finds it hard to believe that the large and looming lawyer, as Tim now is, can be the same person as the cause of al that excitement in 1951.
