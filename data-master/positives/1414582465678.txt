<p>My dear Herbert, I am always grateful to you for your delightfully generous appreciations. If any among my friends take the trouble to write to me about my work it means a very great deal, and you and 'R.V.W.' are particularly nice about this. It was a very fine performance of Fand - nearly as good as Tommy Beecham's (to me) never-to-be-forgotten effort a little while ago [23rd November 1931]. Personally, I love that work of Ralph's [Piano Concerto] and indeed like it better than anything else of his that I know. I don't think that it is right formally at the end, for that last cadenza confuses the issue, but in my view that dynamo-like toccata is splendid, and the stretto of the fugue one of the most stimulating bits of primitive violence in all music. Perhaps the Valse wants some re-phrasing to get more kick out of it, but that is good too. I believe you will come to delight in this work if you have a chance to get to know it well, as I did at rehearsals. Ever yours with kindest wishes ARNOLD</p>
