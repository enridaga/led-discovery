A day of sun and cool wind, perfect for marching, and the luck to be at the head of the column, immediately behind our newly formed drum-and-fife band, made the march to Halloy a pleasure. The noble band is only eight flutes, six bugles and six drums; but a little band goes a long way to shorten the road: even its failures, greeted with cheering, help men to keep their eyes off the “Boots-boots-boots-boots movin’ up and down again!”
