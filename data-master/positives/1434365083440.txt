Letter from Bunsen to Mrs. Schwabe, Charlottenberg: Sunday 19th June, quarter past five in the morning -
Through and above the sounds of all the church-bells, and the gurgling of the Neekar, the trumpet-tones from the tower of the Holy-Ghost Church, rise to my balcony with the soaring hymn, ' Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott ' (' God is our
stronghold firm and sure '), and I hasten to tell you how beautifully the festival has opened, with the finest summer morning, after days of sultry thunder-weather. Let us hail the glad omen with thankful joy !
