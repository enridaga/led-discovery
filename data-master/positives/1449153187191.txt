<p>&nbsp;Coltrane would play all night, and come off in the intermission and go somewhere and play - stand in the corner or something. You know, Miles had to make him stop, because he would play an hour solo himself, and we were only supposed to be on the stand for forty minutes or something. He had incredible chops - he couldn't stop. Miles used to say, &ldquo;Man, look, why don't you play twenty-seven choruses instead of twenty-eight?&rdquo; Coltrane would say, &ldquo;I get involved in this thing and I don't know how to stop.&rdquo;</p>
