The ' Festal March' which followed, was composed for, and performed at the marriage of Her Royal Highness the Princess Louise, bold, clever, and modern in style, aptly instrumented, and with a vein of fresh melody running through the march, as well for the construction as for the performance, gave great pleasure to the audience.
