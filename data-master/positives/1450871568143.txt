But there was one member of our little society who made a great deal more noise than I did, for he was able to sing two different notes at one and the same time; the effect was quite startling, so much so that I was positively fascinated by him, and stared at him with such interest that Mr. Rose-Innes, who sang with the basses, laughingly accused me of having lost my heart to him! If I did, it must be acknowledged that my first love was a unique specimen of humanity.</p>
