<p>As the weeks went by [in Sierra Leone], so we got to know some villages particularly well and became friends with their chiefs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>One of them was exceptionally helpful and offered to stage a performance by his musicians and dancers in our honour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We were delighted and decided to try to film and record it.</p>
