Paesiello was the Emperor's favourite amongst them; indeed, he took an unbounded interest in his success, and was so enchanted one day by a song Paesiello had just written, that he caught him by the hand, saying, "Without doubt you are the greatest composer that ever lived." "No, sire, I am not," replied he; "while Cimarosa lives, to him must be given the palm." Paesiello wrote the opera of "Proserpine," which was brought out at Paris under the auspices of the Emperor; but somehow or other it did not suit the French taste, and proved a failure. Napoleon was furious at the non-success of his protege&rsquo;s opera, and observed, "It is not to be wondered at, for the French understand nothing of music." Paesiello thought so too; for though so highly patronised by the Emperor and court, he quitted France in disgust. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> <br /></span></span></p>
