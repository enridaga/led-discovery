EDWARD DANNREUTHER and MR. WALTER BACIIE, the Flying Dutchman was at last indifferently produced at Covent Garden. I well remember the occasion. ILMA DI MURSKA played Senta admirably well, though too old for the part; and, notwithstanding the efforts of MR. SANTLEY, the recitative music was nearly unintelligible, owing to want of intelligence on the part of the band. The whole thing was clumsily put on the stage, and Senta's solos and the choruses alone pleased.</span></p>
