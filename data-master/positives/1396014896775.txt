I get up for Breakfast. Go to see Mrs. Bridge 9.30. Usual practices, & College in afternoon. Mr. Bridge takes me to B.BC. Queens Hall Concert. 6 Brand. Concertos & 2 Arias, Keith Falker. Soloists H. Samuel (marvellous), A. Catteral (v. good technique,), etc. (Brain, marvellous & L. Goossens). I am rather tired of sequences at the end, tho' it was v. enjoyable. Don't v. much like Wood's Bach. Disappointed with no. 2. 6 (with a mass of violas) very fine, & 5. 3 was thrilling.
