<p>During the winter&nbsp;of the year 1872 I had the pleasure of attending a&nbsp;meeting of the Orchestral Knitting-and-Roast-Veal&nbsp;Association, held at No. 48, Leipzigers Strasse, in Athens&nbsp;on the Spree... It offered to its members a&nbsp;happy combination of concerted music, seasonable&nbsp;industry and solid nourishment, thus gratifying at once&nbsp;their intellectual, moral and physical cravings...During my three hours and a half&nbsp;membership I was witness to his [the Grand Guard] admirable fulfilment of&nbsp;other duties attached to his responsible position. P. G.&nbsp;Bilse was an excellent conductor, and a man of refined&nbsp;musical taste, judiciously conservative in his fidelity to&nbsp;the classics, and yet tolerant of innovation where innovation is justified through intrinsic merit.</p>
