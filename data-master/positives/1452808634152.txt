<p>In Berlin, where I had settled for the time&nbsp;being, many musical homes were opened to me,&nbsp;like Madame Clara Schumann's, the Simrocks',&nbsp;the Joachims'. In the latter house as well as&nbsp;in that of the Simrocks I was soon a frequent&nbsp;guest, participating in the many musical gatherings happening there, and if, needless to say,&nbsp;I grew more and more gratefully conscious of&nbsp;the privilege of a closer acquaintance with so&nbsp;great a musician as Joachim, I confess I hardly&nbsp;to any lesser degree appreciated the wonderful&nbsp;art of his wife.</p>
