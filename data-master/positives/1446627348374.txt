<p>Sir,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will any of your Dissenting friends kindly inform me, through the medium of the WELSHMAN, whether Dissenting chapels are strictly intended for <em>religious purposes</em>? I am led to ask this by circumstances which have happened during the last few weeks. I have been staying for the above period in the town of Llandovery. On Monday evening last, happening to pass one of the chapels, I heard singing, and stopping to listen, distinctly heard "Men of Harlech" sung, I must say, in a very creditable manner. I have also been informed that the A.B.C. duet has been sung in the Methodist Chapel, on a Sunday night after divine service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am, sir,&nbsp;</p>
