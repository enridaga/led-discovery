A month or so before I was to start a South American tour which included a recital in Guatemala City, a letter reached me in San Francisco from Guatemala City’s resident conductor, a man called Paco. Its substance was: “Forgive us if we seem presumptuous. Knowing you were coming here, we wondered if you would consider performing the Beethoven Concerto with us. We shall perfectly understand if you refuse. We are not very good but we will work before you come, and if, at rehearsal, you find us impossible, you must say so honestly; it will already have been a privilege to go through it with you. . . .” Such a request could not be denied. I suggested that if the rehearsal went well, we would perform together in the second half of my scheduled concert. When I arrived I was touched beyond words. Not only had Paco rehearsed the orchestra every day for a month; he had rehearsed every section and every individual player. Each detail was in place, each note in rhythm and in tune, each piano and each forte observed. Yes, there have been greater performances, but here was utter conscientious integrity and Beethoven shone through it undiminished.
