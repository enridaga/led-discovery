The first time we heard Rufus "Speedy" Jones was the night in Miami when Jackie Gleason had gathered all the big bands together for a television show. Rufus was then with Count Basie, and Sam Woodyard, who was with us, was very complimentary. Rufus had been given big solo spots, and his explosive rhythms and animation came off in very convincing, symbolic patterns. His horizontal movements--straightforward and circular--from cymbal to cymbal, along with his eyes and eyeglasses, all seemed to play a part in this mysticalizationisimist's paradiddled self-portrait tapestry.

Since Rufus Jones has been with us, his supporting role, particularly in African, jungle, and oriental pieces, has constantly led to demands from the audience for him to be featured solo. Just as constantly, his drum solos have been show-stoppers that result, half the time, in standing ovations.
