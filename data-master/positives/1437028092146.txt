<p>It was during this opera that, its fortunes waning,&nbsp;the services of the late Lord Alfred Paget were&nbsp;requisitioned to induce the then Prince of Wales&nbsp;(King Edward VII.) to visit the Empire. The&nbsp;Alhambra had passed through a thorny licensing&nbsp;session on its application for a music-hall license,&nbsp;and the songs of Arthur Roberts were hotly&nbsp;criticized. The night the Alhambra re-opened,&nbsp;Roberts sang a great ditty there called " I'm a&nbsp;"highly respectable Singer." This publicity raised&nbsp;a doubt as to the class of performance that was&nbsp;anticipated at the newer house. It first opened&nbsp;with "Chilperic" by Herve a revival, then followed&nbsp;"Polly," by Edward Solomon and "Jimmy" Mortimer, the once Editor of "The London Figaro,"&nbsp;a paper subventioned to keep alive the Bonapartist&nbsp;spirit of Napoleon III. Transferred from the&nbsp;Novelty, &ldquo;Polly" shared the programme, with the&nbsp;first, performance in England of the "Coppelia"&nbsp;ballet, and it took us later on into "Pocohontas,"&nbsp;by Sydney Grundy and Edward Solomon, in which&nbsp;Mr. Hayden Coffin made his first professional appearance&nbsp;on any stage. It was agreed that, if the&nbsp;Prince of Wales came, a sort of matchwood tunnel&nbsp;should be built to his box to ensure what we were&nbsp;told was much needed privacy; this was intimated&nbsp;to us by Lord Alfred Paget. This was accordingly&nbsp;done, much to the annoyance of the Royal visitor,&nbsp;who showed his usual consideration and tact by&nbsp;not using it, but by mixing among the audience,&nbsp;and during the interval visiting the golden upstairs&nbsp;foyer (the first specimen of the new extravagance&nbsp;in decorative music-hall art), and enjoying a cigarette&nbsp;with Mr. Henry Osborn O'Hagan, the financier&nbsp;of the concern, the lately-deceased manager, Mr.&nbsp;H. J. Kitchens, and the late Lord Alfred Paget.</p>
