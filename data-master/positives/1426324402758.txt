After excessive consumption of bouillabaisse it was only logical for me to hurry to Vichy, but I did not go there to drink its mineral water but to play the Schumann Concerto with Sir Thomas Beecham. I had played with him on other occasions, and, appreciating his musicianship, I regretted that my shaky English hindered me in the appreciation of his famous wit. / The rehearsal went fine, and in the evening, had it not been for the hotel bellboy, I would have arrived at the concert in the best of spirits. As I was about to leave, the bellboy, catching me off guard, snatched my cello and before I could utter a word bicycled full speed with it toward the concert hall. I ran screaming after him and watched the cello swaying from the side to side as the bicycle disappeared. Out of breath when I caught up with him at the stage-door entrance, he looked pleased with a job well done. /  Fifteen minutes later I met Sir Thomas on-stage. He conducted with great gusto and the Schumann proceeded inspiringly. It continued so even after I noticed Sir Thomas swaying from side to side. It distracted me and brought my thoughts to the bellboy again for a moment. But I was glad that the performance did not suffer from it. / After the concert we paid each other compliments. / Sir Thomas said, “Great playing.” / I said, “Fine bicycling.” He looked at me, surprised, but said nothing.
