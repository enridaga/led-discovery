Outstanding among my continental excursion was a trip I made in February 1933 which included recitals in Rome, Milan and Pisa with Alfredo Casella. Casella was a brilliant pianist, his speciality being his performance of modern music for which he was world-famous. Included in the programmes were two sonatas for viola and piano by York Bowen, and my arrangement for viola of John Irelandâ€™s violin sonata in A minor. Casella played piano solos of his own composition and I also contributed the Bach Chaconne in our joint recitals. I enjoyed myself very much in this collaboration for his playing was magnificent.
