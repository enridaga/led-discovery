Soon after I went to Holland. It was a joy to be there again. I love the Dutch audiences, they are so sincere! I shall never forget the experience we had at Rotterdam. Margaret accompanied me and I was to bring out the Delius Sonata and the Kodály Sonata. I had been told before that, in this city, an audience never clapped until the end of a concert to make sure that they liked one’s playing, but I could not quite believe this until it happened, and it did! The hall was full but as I came onto the platform with my sister there was dead silence. I bowed, I played the first Sonata – not a murmur. All we could hear was our own footsteps going off the platform. It happened again and again until the end of the concert when a storm of applause broke forth and I was so very, very, thankful!
