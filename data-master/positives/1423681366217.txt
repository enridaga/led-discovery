Write & Practise Pft before going to R.C.M. for lesson with Benjamin at 12.20. Practise before, & write after, tea, both here. Go to Queen’s Hall, with Mrs. Bridge, who gives me ticket, to B.B.C. Symp. Conc. Orch, material wonderful, Adrian Boult – muck! Brandenburg Conc. no. 3. – heavily played – tone wonderful. Ensemble of Beethoven Symph. 4, bad; otherwise moderate – not sparkling enough. Best of all, Backhaus in Schumann Concerto. Really inspired. Florence Austral sings Closing scene from Gotterdämerung wonderfully. Back by 11.0
