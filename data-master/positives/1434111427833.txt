<p>An extract from a Contemporary Letter, Mr. Adderley's, Hams House: 19th September, 1849 - We left these amiable friends, after passing truly pleasant days with them, on Monday, the 16th, and arrived by five o'clock at the Manchester station, where Mrs. Lee was kindly waiting to fetch us. That day there was a large dinner party of remarkable persons &mdash;glad to see Bunsen, and with whom he was glad to converse. The same was repeated daily, whether at the Bishop's, or at other hospitable houses; one was the house of Mr. Fairbairn, so highly esteemed by all who knew him ; another was the house of Mr. Schwabe, by whom we were invited to a dinner and musical party afterwards, to meet Lord and Lady Wilton and many others ; the music was very well chosen, Mr. Schwabe understanding the fine arts, as we further perceived, when by daylight we saw the copies he has brought from Spain, of Murillos at Seville, and many other fine things.</p>
