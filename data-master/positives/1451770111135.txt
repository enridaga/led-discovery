<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">Two of the Festival&rsquo;s most interesting performances were given by the Frenchman Charles Munch, conducting Arthur Honegger&rsquo;s new symphony (written in 1943), and by the Swiss Ernest Ansermet, conducting Stravinsky&rsquo;s Third Symphony. Honegger&rsquo;s symphony is notable for its striving towards great depth of thought and emotion. The same tendencies can be seen, I think, in Stravinsky&rsquo;s new symphony, in which his typically brilliant orchestration is accompanied by simpler, pithier musical language and more profound emotions. </span></p>
