…[W]hen King Joe Oliver, the trumpet man of those days, sent for me to leave New Orleans and join him at Lincoln Gardens to play second trumpet to his first trumpet, I jumped sky-high with joy…

I arrived in Chicago about eleven o'clock the night of July 8th 1922… The King was already at work. I had no one to meet me. I took a cab and went directly to the Gardens. 

When I was getting out of the cab and paying the driver, I could hear the King's band playing some kind of real jump number. Believe me, they were really jumpin' in fine fashion. I said to myself, "My Gawd, I wonder if I'm good enough to play in that band."...

When I got inside and near the bandstand, King Oliver spied me. He immediately stopped the band to greet me, saying, "Boy, where have you been? I've been waiting and waiting for you."… They went into another hot number. In that band were King Oliver, trumpet; Johnny Dodds, clarinet; Honore Dutrey, trombone; Baby Dodds, drums; Bill Johnson, bass; Lillian Hardin, piano, of course she became Mrs. "Satchmo" Louis Armstrong later, (tee hee).
