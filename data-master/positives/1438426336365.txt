It was emphasized by the fact that they were to be accompanied by their friend and confrere Jean Lassalle, and that the "French Trio," as they were subsequently rather inaptly designated, would make their rentrees together in a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>gorgeous revival of "L'Africaine." That was a <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>great night. The house was literally crammed from floor to ceiling, and the Prince and Princess <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of Wales led the applause that greeted the now <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>famous Polish tenor on making his debut upon the <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>stage of Covent Garden in the role of Vasco di <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Gama. He sang magnificently, while Lassalle's <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Nelusko was, if possible, more fervid, more picturesque than ever. Nordica was less well suited as <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Selika than as Marguerite in &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;, which part <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>she sang with the three distinguished artists later <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>in the season. Altogether, though, it was a remarkable performance, and fairly set the seal upon <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Jean de Beszke's renown in England, besides adding materially to Augustus Harris's prestige as a metteur en scene.</span></p>
