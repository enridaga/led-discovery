A warm golden afternoon and the mountains white with snow. The frosty sun set on the snowy mountains, their great white slopes and snow fields. A party of the young men from the village have just gone past my window in the clear bright frosty moonlight with an accordion well played and sweet voices singing 'Though hardy Norsemen'.
