<p>Dash off - with Bridges - to the Mercury Theatre where Iris Lemare conducts a show of my 'Boy'. Mostly very poor I'm afraid - Herod being esp. wobbly. I came out after it, not being able to stand the strain!</p>
<p>Funnily enough so many people liked the work. The boys (St. Alban's Holborn) were very, very good and beautiful.</p>
