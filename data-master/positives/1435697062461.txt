Go on to Covent Garden & meet Beth & Grace before 6.0. Tristan begins at 7.0. Good seats (3rd row of Gallery - 3rd for preference). Frida Leider suddenly [in]disposed, Henny Trundt is rushed from Cologne in the aft. V. good; rather ungainly but sings & acts well. A mild Isolde, who is most impressive at the end. Melchior is simply superb. What a voice! The subtlety of his movements is incredible Olczewska & Janssen (Bran. & Kurn [Brangena and Kurnewal]) were worthy of themselves - colossal & moving achievements. Beecham & orchestra, only blots on the marvellous show. For Anglais v. good. But what music! Dwarfs every other art creation save perhaps 9th. [Symphony - Beethoven]. The glorious shape of the whole, the perfect orchestration: sublime idea of it & the gigantic realization of the idea. He is the master of us all. Since heard that Beecham was vilely rude to Leider who refused to sing in morning. I am not surprised.
