<p>    <span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;">As I did not want to cause a scene at the celebrations, I didn&rsquo;t protest when, on the occasion of your Gala concert in Vienna, you committed the barbarity of performing my 1st Suite in truncated form. However, I learn from the newspapers that you have done so again in Budapest, and I must therefore raise my voice in protest. It is generally accepted as improper and impermissible to omit movements from sonatas or symphonic compositions when these are played as a serious concert. This sort of thing can only be countenanced at &lsquo;zoo&rsquo; concerts or &lsquo;young people&rsquo;s concerts&rsquo; with anthology-type programmes. My own composition, to which I now refer, is not only symphonic: there is such a close thematic connection between the movements that certain bars of some of the movements cannot be understood unless one has already heard the preceding movements. / In these circumstances I have to inform you that I should be greatly obliged if you would never play any of my pieces again. </span></p>
