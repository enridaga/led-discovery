The following is illustrative of the attitude of the old master towards Debussy. At a concert where one of the latter’s works was on the program I asked Rimsky-Korsakov what he thought of it. He answered in these very words: “Better not listen to him; one runs the risk of getting accustomed to him and one would end by liking him.”
