On Christmas Eve, we caroled gaily all about camp, a very pleasant episode. The weather was not too good, windy and inclined to rain in short sharp showers, but anyway it kept off fairly well till tour was almost finished. A goodly number turned up. We assembled at church at 5.45 and were provided with hurricane lamps arrayed in red paper. We began our round with great verve. Chance conducted our party very well. All did our very best and Keenan made the thing go with real swing. I never heard singing so good. We got numerous invitations to sing in the huts and went to a good many where we rendered one or two of our repertoire in best style before moving on. Had a harmonium with us for part of the time. We ended up at the YMCA and gave two carols outside there and then went in to sing 'O Come all ye Faithful'. All rather tired and hoarse when it was over and I was glad to come back to shelter and rest.
