A Gala Night tonight. Concert and entertainment in the Cinema at 8.30 in honour of dinner given by Officers' Mess to a whole collection of French Generals and worthies.... [T]he convalescent camp band is giving selections at intervals by the light of an acetylene flare. I can see the dinner at full swing, everyone hard at it, takling and eating, through the windows of the Officers' Mess.
