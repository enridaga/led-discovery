The first music I heard here was in the street, immediately on my arrival, performed by an itinerant band of two fiddles, a violoncello, and a voice, who, though unnoticed here as small-coal-men or oyster-women in England, performed so well, that in any other country of Europe they would not only have excited attention, but have acquired applause, which they justly merited. These two violins played difficult passages very neatly, the base stopped well in tune, and the voice, which was a woman's, was well toned, and had several essentials belonging to that of a good singer, such as compass, shake, and volubility; but I shall not  mention all the performances of this kind which I met with here; as they happened so frequently, the repetition would be tiresome.
