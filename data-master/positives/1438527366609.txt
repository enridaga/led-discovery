It was a charming example of the Auber<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>school, and was ably conducted by Mr. Herbert <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Bunning&mdash; himself a composer of recognized <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>merit, whose opera &ldquo;La Princesse Osra&rdquo; was to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>be mounted at Covent Garden nine years later. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>That this Englishman will one day make a big mark in the world of music I instinctively feel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>His is a singularly graceful talent, and of orchestral effects he is a consummate master. When he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>comes across a really good libretto we shall perchance discover in him the successor to Arthur<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Goring Thomas. </span></p>
