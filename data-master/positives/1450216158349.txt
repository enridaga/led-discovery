I remember two memorial concerts. The first, on 6 November, was conducted by N&aacute;pravn&iacute;k in the R&eacute;union des Nobles. Besides the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Path&eacute;tique</em> Symphony, the programme included the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Romeo and Juliet</em> Overture and the Violin Concerto played by Leopold Auer.</span></p>
