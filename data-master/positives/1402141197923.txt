... I remembered the curious sensation I once had during an Italian church concert in which VÃ©gh played the Bach D minor partita. It was partly an illusion caused by his 'speaking' tone on the violin, and party it was the very real contours of his sound, like contours on a map, but I felt that instead of listening to music I was listening to information, and that I could not afford to miss a single link in the sense of it. I had no urge to drift in and out of the music as I so often do, It was like being lost in a maze and hearing someone explain, just once, the way out of it. Lots of good performers give me the sensation of knowing how to get lost in the music, but not many make me feel certain they can find their way out.
