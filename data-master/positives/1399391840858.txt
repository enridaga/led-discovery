Dear Camilla

I enjoyed my week at Worcester Three Choirs (Festival), as ever.  A great mix of wonderful music, in fine performances.  To pick a ‘highlight’ is well-nigh impossible.  Gerontius ‘special’.  Caractacus excellently sung + played, very committed, I thought.  Mahler 3 outstanding, Brahms Requiem very moving I felt….with all best wishes
