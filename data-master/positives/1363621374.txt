Memo, organist of St. Mark's, arrived here a few days ago with the most excellent instrument, and played before the Cardinal, and afterwards before the King, with much commendation. "He played, not merely to the satisfaction, but to the incredible admiration and pleasure of everybody, and especially of his majesty, who is extremely skilled in music, and of the two Queens." The King has appointed him his chief musician, and says he will write to Rome to have him unfrocked, that he may attain holy orders and become his chaplain. This is a piece of fine fortune, as a royal chaplain is a very profitable employment.
