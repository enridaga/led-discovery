Aunt Sophie is playing some melodies of the Ukraine on the piano, and that reminds me of our country house. I am carried back thither and all my memories recall poor grandmamma. Tears rise to my eyes; they fill them and begin to flow.... Poor grandmamma! It makes me unhappy that you are no longer here!... Aunt Sophie is still playing; the notes reach me from time to time and penetrate my soul.
