When the folky character of the blues, the fervor of the gospel songs, the rhythmic attack of the New Orleans musicians, and the more sophisticated approach of the East Coast players all came together in New York, jazz was provided with a new springboard. It was also transformed by the genius of Louis Armstrong, who influenced almost every trumpet player of his own and the following generations. He had tremendous gifts and a likable personality that won him friends everywhere. His imagination was matched by his technical ability, and he played high notes on his horn such as had not been heard before. And it was not only trumpet players who tried to imitate his phrasing, but trombonists, saxophonists, and clarinetists, too. In Chicago, he teamed up with a young man from Pittsburgh named Earl Hines, who developed an unusual style on the piano that was the counterpart of his trumpet playing. This piano style also became widely influential.
