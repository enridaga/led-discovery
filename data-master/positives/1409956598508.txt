After the visit to the directorâ€™s office demanded by protocol, I was taken without much further ado to hear the children play.

What I saw was the end product of the teaching in various stages of finish, but not the teaching itself. Perhaps from pride in achievement, perhaps from a certain caginess, the authorities were reluctant to let me eavesdrop on a class at work, and instead produced a range of pupils from seven years old up. I was tremendously impressed by the quality of real performance shared by all these neatly turned out, eager, healthy children. Even the youngest, playing simple exercises, had an aplomb, a feeling for shape and presentation, that suggested they were performing in Carnegie Hall.
