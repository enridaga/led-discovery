I write this letter & very willingly too, at the request of Miss Marshall who will deliver it. She is going to town for a little while & thirsts for Music. She lives at Ipswich, where she hears nothing worth hearing but her own playing.... I accompanied her in many Lessons of Boccherini, Eikner, Sterkel, Haydn, &c., yesterday morning & the evening before. She is improved since I heard her before. Her hand is really powerful, & a match for everything in the way of difficulty. In one faculty She seems to me to be above par. She is surprisingly ready in playing d. livre ouvert. She played several of the most uncommon of Haydn’s lessons, which She assured me She had never seen, very nearly, I think, as well as practice cou’d have made Her. Lord! how Mr. & Mrs. B. wou’d have held their sides, if they had heard me play the Duett lesson of Coziluc with Miss M. yesterday! Did you ever see a Cow in a Post-Chaise?
