Horowitz looked at the piano. He moved toward it and apologetically asked, “Can I?” It’s a curious phenomenon with some performers that even before they touch their instrument one instantly expects a miracle to be revealed. Horowitz was such an artist. He tried the piano hesitatingly at first, but hours later I still listened to his playing of unequalled force and poetry./ The next day and the next we saw each other. I listened to him and we played together and we spoke of music, of its many facets, and of its problems, which we agreed could not be solved in words or in theories, but only experienced.
