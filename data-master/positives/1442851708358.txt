<p>I remember the R.F.H. being built and going to the carol concerts by the United London Hospital Choirs as my brother was a medical student. I have good memories of singing with the Brighton Festival Choir on many occasions and thinking how lucky we were especially listening to Dame Janet Baker singing Mahler. Two years ago my daughter and I were upgraded to the Royal Box for the 2nd half of the concert of Sir Willard White - that was a special memory for me.</p>
