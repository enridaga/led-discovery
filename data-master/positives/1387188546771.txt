Dear Kingsley

I suspect I shall have to apologise for a dull letter this time, as I am feeling quite gloomy today, and was feeling equally gloomy yesterday and indeed have every prospect of feeling gloomy tomorrow. And when on is gloomy it is hard to write words that will make another man laugh with his mouth when he sees them with his eyes, as you so delectably put it...

...My favourite record at the moment is ‘Blues in C sharp minor/Warming Up’ – but I don’t suppose you possess a copy.  Eldridge’s playing in the blues is fine  - especially one suicidal note in the last chorus that gives me the impression of falling from an enormous height to be dashed to pieces.  ‘Warming Up’ is bad, but Wilson’s introduction & chorus are lovely and worth all the rest.
