We have lately had very comfortable fiddling here; indeed, the best dilettante fiddling I ever had to do with. My friend Mr. Tindal is come to settle (for the present, at least) in this neighbourhood. He is going to succeed me in the curacy of Fordham. He plays the fiddle well, the harpsichord well, the violoncello well. Now, Sir, when I say well, I can’t be supposed to mean the wellness that one should predicate of a professor who makes those instruments his study; but that he plays in a very ungentlemanlike manner, exactly in tune & time, with taste, accent, & meaning, & the true sense of what he plays; &, upon the violoncello, he has execution sufficient to play Boccherini’s quintettos at least what may be called very decently. But ask Fisin; he will tell you about our fiddlings, & vouch for our decency, at least.
