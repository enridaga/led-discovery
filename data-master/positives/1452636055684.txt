So we went on,&nbsp;actually for hours, he playing and I singing,&nbsp;to the great delight of our host, who, equally&nbsp;interested in us both, confessed to being baffled&nbsp;as to which of us in his opinion had the greater&nbsp;talent, until, at the end of a most enjoyable&nbsp;evening, he had to be satisfied with declaring&nbsp;that both Frederic Cowen-- for that was the&nbsp;boy's name-- and I had the chance of a brilliant&nbsp;future before us : a future which, alas, at the&nbsp;time I am writing, has turned into a past,&nbsp;though, I am sure, one we neither of us two old&nbsp;friends need be ashamed of.&nbsp;</p>
