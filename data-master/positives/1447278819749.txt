<p>The Ges&ugrave; is possessed of three organs, not very powerful or rich in combinations, but exquisitely sweet-toned&nbsp;and in perfect tune &mdash; at least, they were so sixteen years&nbsp;ago ; one in either wing, or arm of the cross in the shape&nbsp;of which the church is built; the third just above the&nbsp;main entrance opposite the high altar. On these charming instruments, for more than an hour before the Pontififs&nbsp;arrival at the church door, did three accomplished organists successively play voluntaries, movements from masses,&nbsp;and selections from familiar Italian operas. As soon as&nbsp;the final resolution of some glorious old fugue &mdash; the subject of which seemed to be struggling in the toils of&nbsp;counterpoint, like Laoeo&ouml;n with the serpents &mdash; had died&nbsp;out amid the solemn thunder of the pedal pipes, a sweet&nbsp;melody from <em>Lucia, L'Italiano in Algeria or Ernani </em>would&nbsp;steal upon the ear from another quarter in all the plaintive tenderness of a mellow wooden flute-stop. And&nbsp;then, almost before this insinuating song had melted&nbsp;away into silence, its last lingering note would be&nbsp;drowned in the joyous chords of some sturdy old "Jubilate," square, simple, and just sufficiently aping the fugal&nbsp;form to interest the scientific musician, while delighting&nbsp;the not-scholastically trained ear. It was, indeed, a&nbsp;plenteous regale of sound, thoughtfully arranged and&nbsp;tastefully served.</p>
