Our first concert was a very great one. I played the Dvořák Concerto with Nedbal, a close friend of Dvořák. He taught me a great deal for which I have always been grateful. In the interval outside the artistes’ room, a quartet of cellos began to play. We opened the door and there, seated outside, were the first Cellist, Hugo Kreisler (brother of Fritz) and three others playing Kreisler’s 'Liebesfreud'. It was such a charming tribute and touched us deeply.
