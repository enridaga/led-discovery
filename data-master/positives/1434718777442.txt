As a kid (and Louis [Armstrong] always called me Kid Muggsy, inscribing my prized pictures of him that way), I would go down to the South Side and listen hour after hour to those two great trumpet players, Joe King Oliver and Louis. That's when they were at the old Lincoln Gardens. It got so that I knew every phrase and intonation they played, just from listening, so that, in spite of myself, I was doing the same things--as nearly as possible, of course. 

You can imagine the thrill it was the first time they let me sit in with them and play. I even remember the first tune--it was "Bugle Blues", an original Joe Oliver tune. Gosh, I wish I could describe the way those two used to play those pretty breaks! Nothing in the world was like it.
