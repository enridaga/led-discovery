<p>Sunday noon, Joaqu&iacute;n Nin-Culmell called for at the hotel and we drove out (again to Oakland) for lunch at the Milhauds'. I'd not seen them in - how long? ten years? - and found Darius at seventy-five looking healthier, more black-haired and thinner than before despite his arthritic complaints and eternal wheelchair.... We played the tape of Lions and Madeleine and I did all the talking - mostly about Stockhausen who's now on the Coast, about the trials of Darius' forthcoming Son et Lumi&egrave;re project, and about flagellation.</p>
