This morning I heard the whole service after the Ambrosian manner, was introduced to the Maestra di Capella, Signor Jean Andre Fioroni, who invited me into the orchestra, shewed me the service they were to sing printed on wood in four parts, separate, cantus-altus-tenor-bassus - out of which after the tone was given by the organist Signor Jean Corbeli they all sung, namely 1 boy, 3 castrati, 2 tenors and 2 basses, under the direction of the Maestro di Capella, without the organ. He beat the time, though there were no bars: the music by Signor [illegible in original MS] who was Maestro di Capella in this Church about 150 years ago. I afterwards heard the first organist play a quarter of an hour in a very masterly and grave stile, suited to the place and instrument. From thence I went home with Signor Fiorini, who shewed me all his musical curiosities, and played and sung to me a whole oratorio of his composition, and was so obliging as to promise me a copy of a service of his in 8 parts, with which I begged of him to favour me in order to convince the world that thoâ€™ the theatrical style is very different from that of the Church, yet this latter is not wholly lost.
