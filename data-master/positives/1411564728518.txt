Looking forward to RFH reopening in 2007! 1999 Berlin Philharmonic/Claudio Abbado - absolutely stunning performance of Mahler 3 - spellbinding! 20+ minute standing ovation and cheering from audience afterwards. Far and away the best performance in recent years. Also highly rated (in my view) - Berlin Philharmonic/Simon Rattle - a beautiful rendition of Mahler 5, particularly the wonderful French horn solo(ist), in 2002 - another long (15 mins) ovation afterwards!
