<p>In the morning I went to the rehearsal, because Koussevitzky had promised to play my Quintet with the same expanded forces as he had performed it in New York in the autumn. The players had naturally forgotten the Quintet (well, probably they had never learnt it thoroughly in the first place), while Koussevitzky was miles away from being able to conduct the third movement and had to leave it out. In consequence the Quintet sounded like nothing on earth and the whole impression was painful. I was upset, but when I got home and looked at the score I found that in fact it was all well constructed and should have sounded good, except that it needs to be learnt by heart and, of course, played without doubling the instrumentation.</p>
