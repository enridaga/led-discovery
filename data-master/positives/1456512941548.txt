<p class="MsoNormal">One evening, after our performance, Pavlova and the entire Company were invited by a Japanese artist to his home.&nbsp; We sat, or rather knelt, round three sides of the oblong room, while a few understanding geisha brought us extra cushions which they tucked into the bend of our knees.&nbsp; This relieved the strain a little.&nbsp; The walls of the room were of dull gold and there was a painted screen of great beauty along one of them.&nbsp; Before each of us was placed a little black lacquer table with a tray of Japanese delicacies and of course a cup of warm rice wine, <em>sake</em>.&nbsp; At the end of the room, behind the <em>Shoji</em>, was a Japanese orchestra consisting of the lute or <em>koto</em> (13 stringed Japanese lute), the flute, and percussion.</p>
