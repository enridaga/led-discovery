While I was in Lexington I went out among the colored people there. I found many old settled people, as well as kids, who had never seen a show in their whole lives, or even a movie. So we got the band up there and gave our show for them. 

The night we gave our show the tears came to my eyes as I watched ragged and hard-working colored farm women humbly handing in to the school the cakes and other stuff they'd cooked. As they watched our show those people just sat there, awed and thunderstruck by everything: our clothes, the music, the dances. We might have been people from another world, with no blood or color or language in common with them.
