<p>The concert on June 12th was noteworthy for the first appearance of Herbert Sims Reeves, son of the famous tenor. When he came on the platform there was such a storm of applause, lasting for at least five minutes, that it quite unnerved him. However, he pulled himself together and sang his first song, which was the recitative "Nel fragor della festa," and the aria "Alma soave," from Donizetti's <em>Maria di Rohan</em>. He sang it extremely well, and was several times recalled, but one could see he was very nervous at the ordeal. His second song was Schubert's "Ave Maria," and his third "Refrain thy Voice from Weeping," from Sullivan's Light of the World, which the composer kindly conducted to give eclat to young Reeves's singing. Herbert Reeves is the image of his father, though somewhat smaller, being short and slender. He had a small tenor voice, but sang with great taste, and, having been well taught in Italy, pronounced his words clearly and well.</p>
