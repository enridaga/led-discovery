This being the first time I ever was at this long establish'd annual performance I was very much pleased with it, & thought even the tuning to the celebrated fine organ there had a grand effect. The leader however (Mr Brown) Mr Beresford & I were by no means satisfied with, tho' he had been a capital performer of the old school, having formerly been selected as a firm steady played by Handel to lead his oratorios, but having now been for some years out of practice he happen'd to make a grand mistake in a part of Dr Boyce's anthem (always perform'd at that time) w'ch seem'd extremely to diconcert the old Doct'r at the time, who conducted the performance.
