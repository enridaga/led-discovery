About the year 1782, young Crotch was brought to Leicester, as a musical prodigy, being then not more than five years old. He was brought first to our house, and played upon the piano-forte as he sat upon his mother’s knee. At that time there were not more than two or three piano-fortes in the town or neighbourhood; mine was esteemed a good one, made by John Pholman, I suppose in Germany, and before any were made in England. Upon this instrument Crotch first exhibited his extraordinary talent in Leicester. I laid before him Handel’s organ concertos, which, without difficulty, he played at sight. He was a delicate, lively boy, and, next to music, was most fond of chalking upon the floor. I was much surprised to see how readily he sketched a ship in full sail, during which I struck some notes on the piano, forming a confused sound, and requested he would tell me the notes of which it was composed. This he did instantly, while so employed.
