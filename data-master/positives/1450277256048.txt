<p class="MsoNormal">One episode in the Club&rsquo;s history may be of some little interest. We arrived one morning in a certain Michigan town, and were met at the railroad station by a friend of long standing. In a very serious tone of voice he informed me that another good friend of the Club, a &rsquo;cello amateur, was so far gone in consumption that his physician and family had given him up; he would probably die during the day. The expected visit of the Mendelssohn Quintette Club had apparently kept him alive; he wanted to hear the <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">Tema con Variazioni</em> from the Schubert D-minor Quartette before he gave up the ghost He had placed a sum of money in the teacher&rsquo;s hands to pay us. Would we gratify him ?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The situation quite shocked me. I said, &ldquo;Of course we will play, but don&rsquo;t talk of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The sick friend was at the same hotel in which we were to be quartered. The plan was for us to play in a room at some little distance from his, but with both doors open. He wanted the music to reach his ears as a last sweet echo of his departing musical pleasures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We prepared to play very soon after our arrival at the hotel. To me, who knew the young man well, it was a very solemn moment. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>To play under such circumstances required some self-possession.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">On a lower floor in the hotel lay a brother of the sick man who was also in a rapid decline, and very near death. The mother was in attendance at his bedside. Scarcely had we reached the middle of the piece, when a messenger from the mother came to request us to stop, for the brother down-stairs was so affected that she feared immediate death. We ceased playing. This latter brother died during the ensuing night; but the one who wanted the music lived on, and some favorable change occurred which gave him a fresh lease of life,&mdash;good for some years after the time he thought he was to hear his parting Swan Song</span></p>
