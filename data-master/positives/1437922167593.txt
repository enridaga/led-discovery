<p>Listen to broadcast of concert performance of Wozzeck (1st in England) from Q.H. - by B.B.C. orch &amp; Adrian Boult with Bitterauf as Wozzeck (superb) &amp; May Blyth as Marie (Seemed excellent) &amp; large &amp; efficient cast.* It wasn't very satisfactory as a broadcast - voices too loud, &amp; blurring. Only the third Act (&amp; bits of second) were intelligible. The music of this is extraordinarly striking without the action, while that of the first isn't - except for the exciting march &amp; beautiful little lullaby. The hand of Tristan is over alot of the intense emotion, but Berg emerges a definite personality.&nbsp;</p>
