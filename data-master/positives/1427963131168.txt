 [In 1960]…  I did those duets with Betty Carter… [There] was something special about the music we made together.

I had first heard Betty the night I ran into the Cookies back in Philadelphia. She was singing with Hamp's band, and I was impressed. She's a hell of a singer. I like to compare her to Sarah Vaughan, which is like comparing Benny Goodman to Artie Shaw. Sarah's like Benny. She has unbelievable technique and deserves all the praise she's gotten. She's a master. But Betty's like Artie. She's a marvelous technical singer, but she's also got that old feeling --that raw feeling--that destroys me.
