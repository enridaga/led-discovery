Finish (after one or two attempts) the Slow movement, of My quart. I am quite pleased with it. Practise as usual, in aft. with Lauricella. Go to sing (in evening dress) at the Cecil Sharp house, at a Folk song, & Folk-dance concert at 8.30. Patuffy Kennedy Fraser also sings, quite charmingly, some Hebridean Songs with harp. We sing a group of Madrigals, & a group of Folk song arrangements. Interspersed with these are many & monotonous (I am heretic enough to say!) folk dances, thoâ€™ some were beautiful Barbara, of course, sings, & Miss Hurst also goes. Back at 11.15.
