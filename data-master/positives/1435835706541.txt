The memorial concert for Donald Gramm as mournful, not because it was a memorial, but because the audience in the oddly shaped much acoustically happy hall at Rockefeller University wasn't that aware of the fact of Donald. What's more, my smarmy little speech about his infinite variety was, I realize now, in contradiction to the Debussyan had of the program, since Donald never did Debussy songs. Hilda and Will sang nicely, however.
