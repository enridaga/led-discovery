At the beginning of the 1928-1929 season a new organization came into being, known as the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris, or O.S.P., created by Ansermet, who became its principal conductor. At its invitation, I conducted two concerts at the Théatre des Champs-Elysées with this new group, and it was a joy to work with these young musicians, who were so well disciplined and so full of goodwill, and who were forbidden to indulge the odious habit of deputizing, of which all conductors complain and from which I suffered so much at the rehearsals of 'Le Baiser de la Fée' .
