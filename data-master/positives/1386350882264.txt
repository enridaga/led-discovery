We dined again at the Table d’Hôte, and had to endure scraping more discordant, than I expected to find in any part of this land of Music, from a Man and two Boys. To add to our comfort, we had the pleasure of hearing from an English Gentleman at the Table, that the preceding Day, they had had delightful Music from a Band of Wind Instruments.
