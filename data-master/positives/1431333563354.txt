You seem to have an affinity for stride piano playing as well, although your work doesn't sound like stride in the traditional sense.

I do love James P. [Johnson] and Fats [Waller], but I don't know if that style of music is sad enough for me to listen to for a whole evening. I don't consciously take twenty stride records home and devote a summer to listening to them, as I'm doing now with Billie Holiday's Verve releases.
