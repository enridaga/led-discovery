"The Germans, in composing, think too much of science, but are unmindful of that which touches the heart. This fault is also shared by the French composers: all their operas want grace and gaiety." On the appearance of the opera "L'Irato" which is written in the Italian style, Napoleon, ignorant as to who the composer was, begged Mehul to be present. After some demur he consented. The overture was much applauded, and the Emperor observed to Mehul, "Now, you see, there is nothing like Italian music." The opera then proceeded, and was throughout much admired by the audience; and when at the end the authors of the piece were called before the curtain, Mehul, the composer, and Marsollier, the writer of the piece, appeared, and were received with boisterous applause. The Emperor, delighted, sent for Mehul, and cried out, in a tone loud enough to be heard by many present, "Attrapez moi toujours de meme, mon cher Mehul, et je m'en rejouirai pour votre gloire et mes plaisirs."</span></p>
