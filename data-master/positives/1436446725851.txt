Before Sir Augustus (then Mr.) Harris became 
manager of the Covent Garden Theatre, he 
started Italian Opera at Drury Lane. That was 
in 1886, and I remember one evening on which 
a grand opera (I think it was Faust) was given, 
at which I was present, when Ella Russell, Jean 
and Edouard de Reszke, and other good artists 
sang. Harris was sitting in the stalls immediately 
in front of me, and, turning round, said to me 
in a despondent way : " Ganz, look at this empty 
house!"
With such good singers he felt quite dis- 
couraged, but he had his reward later on.
