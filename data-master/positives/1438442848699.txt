Rosa had <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>commissioned Frederic Cowen after his return <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>from Australia to write an opera expressly for <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>him. The libretto was supplied by Mr. Joseph <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Bennett, who, knowing the composer's fondness <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>for Scandinavian color, founded his plot upon an <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>episode in the ancient Icelandic tale of &ldquo;Viglund<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the Fair." Cowen's &ldquo;Thorgrim" was duly produced at Drury Lane on April 22,&mdash; some thirteen <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and a half years after Carl Rosa had brought out <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>his &ldquo;Pauline" at the Lyceum,&mdash; with Zelie de Lussan, Barton McGuckin, and Frank Celli in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>principal parts. The Prince of Wales, to whom <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the work was dedicated, attended the first performance with the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>and the composer conducted an admirable rendering of his opera. Yet, despite a cordial reception, &rdquo;Thorgrim" failed quite to hit the mark, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>the effect of its many beauties was lost because<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>of a story too unattractive and too undramatic to appeal to the popular taste.</span></p>
