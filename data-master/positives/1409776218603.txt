[Hepzibah Menuhin in a letter to Yehudi Menuhin, reflecting on their experiences playing duo:]

“I remember one Mozart Sonata at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, 1938,” wrote Hepzibah, “and it went so beautifully, of its own accord, that we were both quite thrilled with it. In fact, just at the coda I was listening so spellbound that I forgot to play, and only came in, a split second late, by a tremendously shocked effort of will. We both laughed at this, and then very much enjoyed the after-concert crowding of well-wishers, because we felt we had for once deserved their praise.”
