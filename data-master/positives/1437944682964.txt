<p>After dinner - 2nd Int. Chamber concert at Teatrino Com. Goossens &amp; the Grillers really play my Phant. very beautifully &amp; it's quite well received. Other works - Trio by Neugeboren (apparntly v. conventional - I didn't hear it) - Strurzenegger a Cantata for Various instruments rather colourless - an interesting quartet by Spinner - and a fiendish Vln Sonata by Jezek - with quite the worst fiddling I've ever heard - by S. Novak. After that we leave - at 11.30. 2 other items.*</p>
