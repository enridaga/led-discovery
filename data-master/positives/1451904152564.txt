<p>His [Alfred Gruenfeld's]&nbsp;<em>tours de force,</em> in&nbsp;the way of mere execution, were no less surprising than&nbsp;his versatility with respect to touch and tone-production.&nbsp;I have, for instance, repeatedly heard him play Chopin's&nbsp;well-known waltz in D flat &mdash; the right-hand part, of&nbsp;course &mdash; in octaves at full speed, without omitting a&nbsp;single ornament. Every pianist will admit that this, in its way, is an incomparable feat. With such marvels of&nbsp;dexterity, however, he was never weary of regaling his&nbsp;friends, and would play to them all day and all night&nbsp;long, if they wished it, without exhibiting the least sign&nbsp;of fatigue, I never, before or since, encountered such&nbsp;an indefatigable performer.</p>
