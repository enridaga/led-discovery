HI , came to see Carlos Santana and his band in the 90s.About half way into his set he started getting heckled so he stopped the show and starts talking to the audience.One woman wanted to know why there were no women in his band as he always preached equality and love. The best one was a guy who wanted to play Santanas guitar so he invited him up and let him play.A great night in a very special hall.
