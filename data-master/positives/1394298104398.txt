Diversions and Musical Instruments they have but few; the latter Consists of 3 or 3 sorts of Trumpets and a small Pipe or Whistle, and the former in singing and Dancing.  Their songs are Harmonious enough, but very doleful to a European ear.  In most of their dances they appear like mad men, Jumping and Stamping with their feet, making strange Contorsions with every part of the body, and a hideous noise at the same time; and if they happen to be in their Canoes they flourish with great agility their Paddles, Pattoo Pattoos, various ways, in the doing of which, if there are ever so many boats and People, they all keep time and Motion together so a surprising degree.

Their signs of Friendship is the waving the hand of a piece of Cloth, etc.
