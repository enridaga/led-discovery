<p class="MsoNormal">This morning to the conservatorio of S. Onofrio to see the boys take their lessons and to hear some of the best of them play. They were all hard at work and a noble clangor they made, not to be equalled by<br />a 100 mouths, a 100 tongues<br />a 100 pair of iron lungs<br />ten speaking trumpets etc<br />However the ears of both master and scholar are respected when lessons in singing are given &ndash; as that is done in a quiet room, but in the practicing rooms the noise and dissonance are not to be described or imagined. &ndash; However I heard in a quiet room 2 of the boys accompany each other in a solo on the violin by Giradini and one on the base by the performer. The first was but indifferently played, but the 2nd was both a pretty composition and very well executed.</p>
