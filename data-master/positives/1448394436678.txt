<p>We did not arrive in London until after most of the musical season was over; consequently there is not much to be heard. On the very day of our arrival, however, we had the pleasure of attending a very fine performance of &ldquo;The Musical Union.&rdquo; The following was the programme for the occasion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Quintet, G minor, Mozart.</p>
<p>Allegro, Adagio, Minuet, Finale.</p>
<p>MM. Sivory, Mellon, Vieuxtemps, Oury, and Piatti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Trio, E flat. Op. 70, Beethoven.</p>
<p>Adagio and Allegro, Allegretto, Minuet, Finale.</p>
<p>MM. Hall&eacute;, Sivory, and Piatti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Leider, Mendelssohn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Quintet, Op. 20, Beethoven.</p>
<p>Allegro, Adagio, Minuet and Trio, Presto</p>
<p>MM. Vieuxtemps, Mellon, Oury, Webb, and Piatti.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here was a programme worth one&rsquo;s attention, whether the compositions, or the performers be considered. It was interesting to see such artists taking subordinate parts, that the compositions might be as perfectly rendered as possible. It is needless to add that the result did not disappoint expectation. This was the last concert of the Union for the season. Sixteen performances have been given; eight evening concerts, and eight subscription matinees. The Union have secured the very best artists; and three Italians, two Hungarians, two Bohemians, two Belgians, one Bavarian, three Prussians, one Austrian, one Frenchman, and five Englishmen, have been employed. So, it seems as many foreign artists are employed in London as in New York.</p>
