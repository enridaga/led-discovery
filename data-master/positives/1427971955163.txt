I ain't real narrow in my tastes. In fact, I'm crazy about "Indian Love Call." I heard Jeanette MacDonald do it with Nelson Eddy when I was a kid, and I thought it was beautiful. I dug her kind of singing; she had real control and true feeling. I recorded the song in the late sixties and then sang it as a duet with Susaye Greene, one of the Raeletts, all over Europe and Japan. People flipped.

I've been lucky that way. I've been able to rummage through the attic of my mind and pick out all the old tunes that I like.
