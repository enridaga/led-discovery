<p>On Sunday, I walked from Beaumaris to the ferry that crosses the Menai Straits to Bangor &mdash; a shorter route by four miles than over the suspension bridge. We arrived just as the congregation were leaving the western end of the cathedral, in which the service is conducted in Welsh, but in form precisely as in our parish churches. I called upon the organist, Dr. Pring, who took me to the organ loft, where his son did the duty. Fortunately, it was the anniversary of the national school, and I had the pleasure of seeing the Bishop, the dean, and the precentor officiate in the service. We had extraordinary music upon this occasion, and I was gratified by hearing the duetto from the Leicester ode, Here shall soft Charity repair. It was admirably sung &mdash; superior to anything I had heard in the country.</p>
