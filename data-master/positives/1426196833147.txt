We were not very good and never could manage more than one piece at a concert: "Rosamunde" overture or the "Valse des Fleurs" from "Casse-Noisette". I seem to remember the great BBC announcer, Alvar Liddell who was also a pupil there [at King's College Wimbledon], playing the cello solo in "William Tell" overture - perhaps our only claim to fame.
