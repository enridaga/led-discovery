Back in New York, I was having a couple of drinks with Bud Freeman and Pee Wee Russell one evening in a little speakeasy on 51st Street, when Pee Wee began talking about a trombone player, the greatest thing he had heard in his life…

Pee Wee introduced us… [to] Jack Teagarden, from Texas, and looked it. "Fine," we said. "We've been hearing a lot about you, would sure like to hear you play."

The guy says, "All right'" gets his horn out, puts it together, blows a couple of warm-up notes and starts to play "Diane." No accompaniment, just neat; he played it solo, and I'm telling you, he knocked us out. He really blew it. And when he'd done that he started on the blues, still by himself. 

We had to agree with Pee Wee, we'd never heard anyone play trombone like that. We were flabbergasted.
