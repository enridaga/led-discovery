<p>I made my debut in London as a violinist in 1848, when I played these very "Variations," at that time a very popular violin solo (reader, don't laugh!) at the Albion Hall, Hammersmith. I felt very nervous, but got through the ordeal with considerable eclat. I find the following note in my diary: "Thursday, May 15th. I went with Mr. Milligan to Hammersmith, where he was giving a concert at the Albion Hall, and I played the Variations of Rode: I was applauded. I stayed the night at Milligan's and the next morning we drove back home by omnibus: he gave me a shilling."</p>
