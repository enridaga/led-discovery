<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Courier New'; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">Absurd as it may seem, the &ldquo;Nibelungen&rdquo; dramas were given out of their proper order because<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>a certain great Bayreuth artist insisted upon making his English debut in a particular character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Herr Max Alvary wished to be seen for the first&nbsp;time here in his fine impersonation of Siegfried;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>consequently, we had to have &ldquo;Siegfried" first;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>then &ldquo;Rheingold" and &ldquo;Walkure&rdquo;, and then<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;Gotterdammerung" to wind up with. I know <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>not whom to blame the more, Alvary for demanding such a piece of vandalism, or Harris for al lowing it; but in either case &ldquo;de mortuis nil nisi<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>bonum," and there I halt. Certainly Alvary was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>an ideal Siegfried; and he had no less an ideal<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Brunnhilde in Rosa Sucher, who unfortunately<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>was recalled to Germany after a night or two.</span></p>
