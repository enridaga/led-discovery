The next evening we all... went to the concert in hopes of hearing Mrs Porter sing again, but she was not there. Some of the Marine Band however who attended gave us after the concert "How great is the pleasure" & "Which is the properest day to drink" with great accuracy, tho' their voices were rather harsh & rough. At this concert I tried the eccentric Overture to The Deserter (w'ch having heard & been pleased w'th in London I bro't down with me) some parts of which seem'd to please very much, but other were so little to Mr Hudson's taste (who play'd the violoncello) that he kept on abusing it pretty freely as he play'd it, notwithstanding it's [sic] having been introduced by an amateur present & a stranger. As soon as the concert ended this consequential gent'n I remeembered told the ladies that he was as tired as if he had been sawing mahogany...
