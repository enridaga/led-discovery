It was at the house of Signor Domenico Baldigiani. Nardini led, and played a solo admirably, little Linley played a concerto very well - Mr Hempson one on the flute - la Mellini, a young lady sang very prettily and some <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">misses</em> played and sang vilely. The master of the house is a good gent. harpsichord player, they say, but did not perform. There were 2 harpsichords one played by Signor Frei and the other by an abate - but only in accompanying. When most of the company was gone I was <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">dragged</em> to the harpsichord tho' not to <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">execution</em>. They pretended to be pleased, but I was by no means pleased with myself and came home very sulky - O, but I forgot - the Corilla sung - and not ill.</span></p>
