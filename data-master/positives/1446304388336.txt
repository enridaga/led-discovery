<p>Our summons to the Royal Lodge was last Monday ; we went at 6 from Bulstrode, called on Mrs. Walsingham for a quarter of an hour, and then paid our duty to their Majesties, received with their usual grace. All the Royal Family were assembled except Prince William, who is very well recovered. The King was so gracious as to make me name the pieces I liked best of Mr. Handel's music, and they were well performed, and the Concert ended at 10 with the of Correlli; but the young Princes were so wonderfully civil, and so full of address, that I lost many delightful passages of y<sup>r</sup> music. We were dismissed at a q<sup>r</sup> before eleven, and got home by 12, gloriously lighted by your friend Madame Luna.</p>
