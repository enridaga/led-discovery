<p>I came to New Orleans in 1906, when I was fourteen years old. It was after I heard Buddy Bolden, when he came through my hometown, Plaquemine, Louisiana, on an excursion, and his trumpet playin' excited me so that I said, "I'm goin' to New Orleans." I had never heard anything like that before in my whole life[.]</p>
<p>[...&nbsp;In] New Orleans [&hellip;] my first musical job was singin' and playin' the piano at a spaghetti place[. &hellip;] At that time piano players would come in from all over the South for the races, and all the local piano players would listen to 'em to catch ideas. I'd stay up all night and then go to work the next day.</p>
