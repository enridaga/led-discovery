<p>Listened carefully to Carter's <em>In Sleep, In Thunder</em>, both with and without score in hand, and with (I think) and open mind, but can't make sense of it. It is without sense. Not that I'd have done so differently, in the vocal line, with such texts (and I could have used such texts), but the jumble of instruments is incoherent.</p>
