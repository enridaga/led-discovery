<p>I first attended the RFH in the opening week (while still at school). The concert included Beethoven 9 (my first live hearing) and I recall that Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was the soprano in the finale. The first half (or 1/4) was the Beethoven Choral Fantasia - my first hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
