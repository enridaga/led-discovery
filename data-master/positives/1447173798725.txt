<p>I taught Music in Crayford, Kent and took a party of schoolchildren to the Saturday Morning Concerts at the Festival Hall. They were the Robert Mayer ones. Once the Queen Mother attended and as we all stood up to see her wave goodbye one of the senior girls said to me 'Miss she hasn't put her chair back' to which I replied 'When you become Queen Mum someone else does that for you!' Also David Attenboro [sic] did a presentation once of 'Peter and the Wolf'. Saw the Oberkirchen Children's Choir once too and tucking into their tea nearby!</p>
