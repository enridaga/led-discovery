To return to 1934, on the day that I had a phone call from Fred Laurence to say that I was "in", I remember that I had a streaming cold and was playing in the Verdi Requiem at St Martin-in-the-Fields for Arnold Goldsborough [sic] whose concerts were well known in the thirties. His orchestra was always composed of young players so there were plenty of my College friends there to congratulate me and buy me a beer.
