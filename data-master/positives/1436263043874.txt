<p>This concert was also noteworthy for the first performance in England of Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, Episode de la Vie d'un Artiste, Op. 4. Single movements had been previously performed here, but the Symphonie had not been played in its entirety except by me. The work created a veritable sensation. It required an augmented orchestra and the following extra instruments: one flute, two bassoons, one contra-fagotto, two cornets, one ophicleide, one tympani, two large bells (which I had specially cast), and four harps (in my opinion the proper effect cannot be obtained with a less number), making a grand total of ninety-two orchestral performers. The second movement, a <em>scene du bal</em>, a charming waltz movement for which I engaged four harpists who came in with brilliant effect, was enthusiastically encored. It is not for me to attempt a description of this, perhaps the most characteristic work of Berlioz, and I can only hope that all my readers have heard it since then.</p>
