<p>I like his [Igor Stravinsky's] Violin Concerto, and I love his Mass &ndash; marvellous music. Fools think that Stravinsky&rsquo;s composing deteriorated towards the end. That&rsquo;s calumny and envy speaking. To my taste, it&rsquo;s just the reverse. It&rsquo;s the early works that I like less &ndash; for instance, <em>The Rite of Spring</em>, which is rather crude, so much of it calculated for external effect and lacking substance. I can say the same for <em>Firebird</em>, I really don&rsquo;t like it very much.</p>
