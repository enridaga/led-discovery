<p>I told you I was to have a tiny ball on Monday; my company came at eleven exactly, as appointed; the fiddlers here before them. They had all breakfasted, and were eager to begin, which they did immediately. Seven couples. I never saw a happier set of dancers. I had all ages, from twenty-one to eight years old, Miss Anne Hamilton, the eldest ; and to keep her in countenance, and to gratify ourselves, Mrs. F. [Hamilton] and I made a couple for above half their dances. At one o'clock they found prepared for them in my dressing-room green tea, and orange-tea, and cakes of all kinds. In half an hour they returned to their dancing till half an hour after two, and then rested till dinner. I had one table which held eleven, and another of eight. The two Mrs. Hamiltons and Bushe were all the company besides the dancers. At 5 o'clock the fiddlers struck up again, and for two hours more they danced as briskly as if they had not danced at all. At 7 I made them leave off, and gave them tea, and played to them on the harpsichord, till they were cool enough to venture home.</p>
