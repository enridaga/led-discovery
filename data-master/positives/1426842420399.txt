Yesterday (7 July) I gave a second matinee at Lord Falmouth's residence. Among other things Viardot sang my Mazurkas. It went very well, but I don't know whether I shall make 100 guineas out of it. I shall only find out on Monday. The season here is now over. I don't know what my plans are or how they will turn out.
