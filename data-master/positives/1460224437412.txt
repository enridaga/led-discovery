<p>I should like to let you know what pleasure your quartet gave me &amp; in what a strange mood it left me. It will be of little importance to you if I tell you how much I love &amp; esteem you, but it is true &amp; comes from my heart &amp; so I thank you for all the pleasure that I feel in your works.&nbsp;</p>
