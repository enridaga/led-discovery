What fun our travels were and what a glorious city was Budapest at this time. It was here that I had the honour of meeting David Popper, a wonderful man with pure white hair and black, black eyes. He was so delightful and enthusiastic about my cello when he entertained us at his house after a concert and I played some of his lovely pieces to him. He told me then how heartbroken he was that so many cellists, however great, always played his music as though they did not liked it, and always so quickly. He then took up his cello and although elderly, played to us with all the charm possible, accompanied by his wife.
