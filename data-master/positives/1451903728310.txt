<p>When Alfred Gruenfeld was in London during the&nbsp;season of 1879, he was only three-and-twenty, but had&nbsp;so thoroughly mastered the technical difficulties of his&nbsp;art that &mdash; at least in that particular direction &mdash; he had&nbsp;nothing to learn. He was, even then, an admirable&nbsp;sight-reader, and gifted in no small measure with the&nbsp;rare faculty of felicitous improvisation. Many of my&nbsp;readers doubtless remember what a sensation he created&nbsp;at a monster concert in the Floral or St. James's Hall (I&nbsp;forget which) by an extempore treatment of the leading&nbsp;themes in <em>Lohengrin</em> which he played as an encore. His&nbsp;capacity for imitating the styles and methods of living&nbsp;and dead composers amounted to little short of genius.</p>
