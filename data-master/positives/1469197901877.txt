A more exciting scene of its kind I had never witnessed. In the deliciously cool, clear atmosphere of that early morning in July, the square was filled with soldiers, and during the preparations for marching the magnificent band played two or three fine marches in a most effective and charming manner. I retired again to rest with the sounds of military music dying away as the soldiers filed off, and indulged in my dreamings of no end of martial music.</span></p>
