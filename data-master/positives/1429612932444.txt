During this season 'Oberon' was frequently given at Covent Garden, and also Mozart's 'Seraglio' not, however, the pure unadulterated Mozart music, such as we Germans know, but with whole numbers cut out, and other popular English melodies substituted. A fearful desecration! The culprit who has this Pasticcio on his conscience is Kramer, of Brighton, director of the King's band. As a compensation for this musical outrage, we had some rich and often amazingly beautiful scenic effects.
