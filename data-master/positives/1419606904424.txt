In 1950 we had Ferenc Fricsay to conduct nine performances of Figaro at the Edinburgh Festival. For us it was a non-event, and all we can recall is his sadness at not being able to get the very special pianissimo he wanted because of the shallowness of the pit. Others seemed able to do so but Fricsay really failed, and the orchestra found him less than impressive; yet within a year or two he was achieving great success with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and hearing him perform made one wonder how we had somehow missed one of the good ones.
