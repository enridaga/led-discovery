To return to my Abbey work: On June 2nd, 1877, a special service was held in connection with the Caxton Celebration. This Celebration was to commemorate the work of Caxton, whose printing press was set up in the Abbey Precincts. I suggested Mendelssohn's " Hymn of Praise" as a suitable work to be performed on the occasion, as it was expressly written for the Gutenberg Festival held at Leipsic in 1846, in commemoration of the invention of typography.

We gave the work with full orchestra, and I contributed a setting of the Canticles for full orchestra and choir.
