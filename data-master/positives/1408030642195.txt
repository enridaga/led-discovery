Go to College, after beginning an unsatisfactory piece for violin & pft, for aural training with Mr. Allchin at 11.0–12.0. Back for lunch. Practise 2.15–4.10. Meet Barbara at Selfridges at 5.0 after having gone to the Aeolian Hall [Bond Street] for some Music. The Madrigal choir is bigger than before, & is I think v. good.
