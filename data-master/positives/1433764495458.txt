<p>Letter from Bunsen to his Sister Christiana, Rome: 29th April, 1820 - Next week we plan inviting a few Italians, that we may have some of the old Latin Church music performed. . . . I have had a selection of psalm and hymn compositions for four voices, copied for me, . . . and look upon it as a great treasure. They are mostly by Palestrina, who flourished about 1550. This is the only piece of luxury I have allowed myself, and it is not a very expensive one.</p>
