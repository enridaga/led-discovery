To-day I actually mustered courage to go to dear Nonsuch again though there was a time and not so very long ago when I thought I could never go there any more.... . As I drew near the Church a tall fair young lady with a blue dress and black jacket and luxuriant coils of very bright golden hair turned in at the Churchyard gate. She was accompanied by a little boy and went into the Church evidently to practise on the organ. I did not know who it was at the time but afterwards I learnt that it was Miss Ada Wyndham. I entered the Churchyard and walked round it till I heard the tones of the organ, when I stole softly into the Church that I might not disturb or annoy the fair organist. I saw the seats in the Chancel where dear Ettie and May used to sit and I seemed to feel them near me in their own dear Church. The organ ceased and I feared I should be discovered. The young lady, evidently unconscious of my presence, spoke kindly to the boy and asked if he was tired of blowing. He said ‘No’ and she began another time. I stole quietly out of the Church and sat down on the steps of the porch listening to the organ and thinking of dear Ettie and May and the beloved feet which had so often come down that winding meadow path and trodden the steps of the porch where I was sitting.
