<p>Shadow was replaced by Lou Henley, a truly wonderful pianist who always called me "Waters." Lou kept telling me I ought to learn other-type songs so I could do request numbers for the other girls when they didn't show up. "I don't want to learn nothin' new," I told him. But Lou kept at me, and I finally agreed to rehearse with him. But I warned him, "It's the story told in the songs that I like. If I don't like the stories in these songs you're pesterin' me about I won't sing them." However, after that I'd go to Edmond's early. Lou Henley got me to sing the popular ballads of the day--"Dear Old Pal of Mine," "My Buddy," "Rose of Washington Square," and "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody." To my surprise I found out that I could characterize and act out these songs just as I did my blues.</p>
