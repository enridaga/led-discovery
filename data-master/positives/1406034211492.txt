The fooling over, Jackie launched into the Adagio of the Beethoven Sonata in D and I was instantly overcome by the intensity of her sound. Her playing was becoming even more powerful and confident. As always, she gave everything, and there she was, pulling me emotionally to pieces again, when suddenly she stopped.

‘You turn, Hil. I’ve done enough. I’ll wait for Bill.’

I began to feel as if I was going to the gallows. I knew I should not be playing in the same concert as her and that I would not be able to perform.
