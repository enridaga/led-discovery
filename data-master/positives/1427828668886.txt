The following year, 1881, my father took his band and chorus to London and gave a performance of ' Faust 'at St. James's Hall, the soloists being the same as in Manchester. Again the chef d'oeuvre of Berlioz was received with acclamation, and both there and in Manchester it has been repeated over and over again with ever increasing popularity, whilst in nearly all the greater towns of England it has been 
performed with the utmost success.
