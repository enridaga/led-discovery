<p>Bunny came from the Haymarket Opera, and supped with me comfortably. They have Farinelli, Merighi, with no sound in her voice, but thundering action &mdash; a beauty with no other merit ; and one Chimenti, a tolerable good woman with a pretty voice, and Montagnana, who <em>roars as usual!</em>&nbsp;With this band of singers, and dull Italian operas, such as you almost fall asleep at, <em>they presume</em> to rival Handel &mdash; who has Strada, that sings better than ever she did; Gizziello, who is much improved since last year; and Annibali who has the best part of Senesino's voice and Caristini's, with a prodigious fine taste and good action !&nbsp;<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, 'Courier New', monospace; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.42857; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #f5f5f5;">We have had Alcina, and </span>Atalanta, which is acted tonight for the last night with the fireworks, and I go to it with Mrs. Wingfield. Next <span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Wednesday is Ponis and Annibali sings Senesino's part.&nbsp;</span>Mr. Handel has two new operas ready &mdash; Erminius and Justino. He was here two or three mornings ago and played to me both the overtures, which are charming.</p>
