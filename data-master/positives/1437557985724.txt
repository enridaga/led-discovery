<pre>On the 16th June, 1813, I took my annual benefit at Drury Lane, and brought out <br />the sequel to the "Beggar's Opera" (Gay's "Polly,") altered by Mr. Horace Smith, <br />one of the authors of "The Rejected Addresses;" but the subject was a bad one. <br />I composed new music to it, but it did not succeed, and was withdrawn. </pre>
