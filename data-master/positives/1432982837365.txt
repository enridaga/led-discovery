8. To Cwmystradlyn with E. B. Williams & Friend. Talk of music in S. Wales, choral conductors, the little attention paid to reading and theory & great deal to voices and musical expression. Tiresome walk up the Cwm - deserted works &c.

10. Small Chapel - not larger than a common cottage - coarse featured large boned people. Execrable singing - the conductor making a portamento of a third at the accent. Fair speechifying.
