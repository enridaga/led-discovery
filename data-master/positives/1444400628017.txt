<p>A bright night; with a fresh breeze.&nbsp; An old beggar woman, blind, sat against a stone wall in Kingsway holding a brown mongrel in her arms &amp; sang aloud.&nbsp; There was a recklessness about her; much in the spirit of London.&nbsp; Defiant - almost gay, clasping her dog as if for warmth.&nbsp; How many Junes has she sat there, in the heart of London? How she came to be there, what scenes she can go through, I can't imagine. O damn it all, I say, why cant I know all that too? Perhaps it was the song at night that seemed strange; she was singing shrilly, but for her own amusement, not begging. Then the fire engines came by - shrill too; with their helmets pale yellow in the moonlight. Sometimes every thing gets into the same mood; how to define this one I don't know - It was gay, &amp; yet terrible &amp; fearfully vivid.</p>
