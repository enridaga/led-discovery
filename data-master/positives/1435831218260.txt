<p>I have known Lester Young around twenty-three years. He's been playing the same horn all along. He's been Lester and nothing else. He hasn't changed. What people don't realize is the environment he has to be around in order to play the kind of horn he's capable of. Sometimes when a good musician has inferior men with him it's like Stan Musial playing sand-lot baseball with a bunch of kids around Central Park.</p>
