<p>In 1870, when the Franco-German War broke out, Charles Gounod, like many other Parisians, came over to England to get out of the war. He lived at Tavistock House, with Captain and Mrs. Weldon, where Charles Dickens once resided, near Euston Square. Georgina Weldon used to receive her friends, including a number of distinguished artists, on Sunday afternoons, and on those occasions Gounod used to accompany her in some of his newest songs, many of which he had dedicated to her. She had a lovely high soprano voice, and was, in those days, a great beauty. She used to call Gounod "Papa." Gounod also sang his own songs, such as "Maid of Athens," with perfect charm. He had only a small voice, but he sang exquisitely, every word being distinctly heard, and of course he played his own accompaniments to perfection.</p>
