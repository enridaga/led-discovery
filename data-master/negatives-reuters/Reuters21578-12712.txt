Live Hog futures recovered from early
profit-taking and ran up to new day's highs at midsession.
Futures posted gains of 0.80 to 0.12 cent paced by July.
    Early commercial profit-taking lacked followthrough and
prices ran up again on scattered demand. Computer house buying
added to strength and futures ran up to new day's highs,
traders said.
    Light hog runs and expectations of steady to higher cash
hogs again tomorrow provided the bulk of support. Farmers are
taking to the fields in some areas and sending fewer hogs to
market, they said.
    Although cash hams are called sharply lower at noon, most
traders noted this had been expected as Easter demand abated.
