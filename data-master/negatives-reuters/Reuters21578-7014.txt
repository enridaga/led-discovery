Wyman-Gordon Inc said it plans
to invest 11.7 mln dlrs in two projects to improve the
company's metals technology capabilities.
    The projects include the installation of a plasma cold
hearth refining system in its Millbury facility for the
production of nickel-base alloy power metal and titanium alloy
electrodes, the company said.
    The other involves the modification of its 35,000-ton
hydraulic forging press, Wyman-Gordon said.
    Both projects are scheduled for completion in 1989, the
company said.
