Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> has found cracks in
the tails of two of its own DC-10 aircraft made by McDonnell
Douglas Corp &lt;MD.N> and a third belonging to the Dutch airline
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines &lt;KLM.AS>, a Swissair spokesman said.
    A Swissair spokesman said the cracks, in the horizontal
tail surface, came to light during routine maintenance of the
Dutch aircraft here on March 18.
    Subsequent checks on Swissair's 11 DC-10s showed similar
problems, thought to be due to material fatigue, he said.
    The spokesman said the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority
(FAA) and McDonnell Douglas have ordered checks of all 400
DC-10s in use by airlines worldwide.
    Swissair said both the FAA and Swiss aviation authorities
had allowed it to continue to fly its DC-10s on condition the
damage was repaired and planes were checked after each landing.
    Several days ago, Swissair announced a firm order for six
McDonnell Douglas's MD-11s, with an option for 12 more, to
replace its DC-10s. The MD-11 is a development of the DC-10.
