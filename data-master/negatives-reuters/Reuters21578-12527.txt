CBT corn futures traded firmer early,
holding gains of 1-1/4 cents to 3/4 cent per bushel in
moderately light early trade.
    Yesterday's sharp jump in the weekly corn export figure to
about three times last year's weekly inspections, plus the
outlook for a continued active export pace due to the decline
in the U.S. dollar this year, supported nearbys, traders said.
    Cargill, the Illinois Co-op, Refco and ADM were the
featured buyers of old crop May, with CIS a buyer in new crop
December, pit brokers said.
