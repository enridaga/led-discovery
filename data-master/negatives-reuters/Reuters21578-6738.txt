Biosensor Corp said it signed an
agreement with Del Mar Avionics, Irvine, Calif., to market the
Biosensor Multiday system.
    Multiday monitoring products can analyze patient heart
signals for up to five days in or out of the hospital. Patients
can transmit complex cardiac data over the telephone to their
medical center, allowing physicians to review the information
as necessary.
