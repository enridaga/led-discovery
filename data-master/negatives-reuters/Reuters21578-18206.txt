&lt;Montenay Power Corp> said it reached final
agreement on a 15-year-contract for operation of the Dade
County Resources Recovery Facility, the largest plant of its
type in the world.
    The company is part of Montenay S.A, a subsidiary of
&lt;Compagnie Generale des Ezux> of France.
    It said county commissions ratified the contract which
calls for investment of 45 mln dlrs to refurbish the plant and
restore it to its original capacity of 920,000 tons of solid
waste per year.
   
    Montenay said the agreement allows Dade County to maintain
its disposal fee at 27 dlrs per ton, by far the lowest of all
counties involved in resource recovery in Florida.
    The company said it will receive 22 dlrs per ton of refuse
processed, split revenues from electricty sold to FPL Group
Inc's &lt;FPL> Florida Power and Light Co subsidiary with the
county and retain revenues from the sale of ash, minerals and
other recycled materials.
    Montenay said the contract extends through 2002 its
operation of the plant, which began in 1985 when the company
took over the plant from the previous owners.
