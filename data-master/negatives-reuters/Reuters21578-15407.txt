Pogo Producing Co said it should gain
some 700 to 800 barrels per day of additional oil production
when new onshore wells start production in June.
    The company said work on offshore properties appears to be
on schedule to complete the addition before year end of about
10 mln cubic feet of gas and 400 barrels of liquids to Pogo's
daily producing capabilities.
    In the first quarter, liquids production averaged 8,525
barrels daily, down from 11,233 barrels a day in the year
earlier quarter.
