NEC Electronics Inc, a
unit of NEC Corp &lt;NIPNY> said a U.S. District Court judge
denied NEC's motion to disqualify Judge William Ingram from
presiding over its lawsuit against Intel Corp &lt;INTC>.
    NEC said it sought to disqualify the judge when it learned
in October 1986 that Ingram had an ownership interest in an
investment club that owned Intel stock.
    Ingram reported that his interest in Intel through the club
amounted to about 80 dlrs worth of Intel's stock and the judge
ended his participation in the investment club after NEC moved
to have him disqualified, an NEC spokeswoman said.
    NEC said it intends to appeal the ruling.
    NEC sued Intel in December 1984 seeking a judgement
declaring that microcode, or the control function, in certain
NEC microprocessor products does not infringe on any valid
Intel copyrights.
    Intel subsequently filed a suit charging NEC with
infringing on Intel semiconductor copyrights.
