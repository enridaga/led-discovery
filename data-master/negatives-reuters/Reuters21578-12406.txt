Cambridge BioScience Corp said
it received Federal Drug Administration approval on its
"Investigational New Drug" filing to begin human clinical
trials of its second generation diagnostic test for AIDS.
    The company said it anticipates the test may be released to
worldwide markets by late 1987 or early 1988.
    Cambridge BioScience also said it expects to file soon an
"Investigational New Drug"  with the FDA on its screening test
for detecting AIDS antibodies.
    This test, which is being evaluated in emergency situations
in several African nations, does not require highly trained
technicians nor instrumentation, according to the company.

    Cambridge BioScience explained that the filing for human
clinical trials for AIDS that received FDA approval, utilizes
recombinant-DNA technology to detect and screen antibodies in
blood or serum of patients infected with the AIDS-causing
virus.
    The other separate planned filing with the FDA is a
revolutionary, five-minute latex agglutination screening test
for detecting AIDS antibodies, the company said. This test,
utilizes latex beads coated with CBC's recombinant antigen
which attract and hold AIDS antibodies, forming clusters
(agglutination), which indicates a positive result.
