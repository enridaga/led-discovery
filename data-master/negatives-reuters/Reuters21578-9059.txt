Jaguar Cars Inc, a subsidiary of Jaguar
PLC, said it introduced its new 1988 XJ6 luxury sedan to
replace its Series III XJ6 sedan.
    The 40,500-dlr car will be available in showrooms starting
May four, the company said.
    Many parts of the XJ6 and the 44,500 dlr Vanden Plas have
been changed, adding high-tech features. The car has seven
micro-processors that control its major electrical functions.
The in-car computer offers a wide array of trip information.
    The Vanden Plas offers more features than the basic XJ6.
    Jaguar said it has a "substantial waiting list" for the
cars in Europe, where it was introduced last October.
