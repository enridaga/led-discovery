Perry Drug Stores Inc, which two
weeks ago reported sharply lower first quarter earnings, plans
to slow its expansion to five to six pct annually from 15 pct
last year, Chairman Jack A. Robinson told Reuters.
    Robinson said after the company's annual meeting that Perry
also would slow its acquisition program, through which the
company has moved into the auto parts business.
     Although Robinson would not make a specific earnings
forecast, he said "We expect to regain our earnings momentum in
the second half of the current fiscal year, ending October 31."
    Perry Drug earned 13 cts a share in its first quarter this
year. It made 11 cts a share in last year's second half, down
from 51 cts in the 1985 second half.
