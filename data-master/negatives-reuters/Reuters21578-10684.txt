The U.S. Treasury said it will sell
13.2 billion dlrs of three and six-month bills at its regular
auction next week.
    The April 6 sale, to be evenly divided between the three
and six month issues, will result in a paydown of 1.65 billion
dlrs as maturing bills total 14.85 billion dlrs.
    The bills will be issued April 9.
