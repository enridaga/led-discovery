will begin delivering this fall a 25 MHz, 32-bit ZEBRA
multi-user business computer system.
    The company said the new computer will double the terminal

    The new ZEBRA 8820 will accommodate up to 256 concurrent
users and will use up to five Motorola Inc &lt;MOT>
microprocessors when fully configured.
    General Automation said all ZEBRA 7820 computers will be
fully upgradable to ZEBRA 8820.
    First customer deliveries are scheduled for
October-November, 1987.
