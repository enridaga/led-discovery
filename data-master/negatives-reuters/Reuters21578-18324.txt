International Game Technology said it
will report a profit of between 900,000 dlrs and one mln dlrs,
or 17 cents to 19 cents a share, for the fourth quarter ended
Sept. 30.
    Subject to a final audit, the company said it would post
quarterly revenues of 21 mln dlrs to 23 mln dlrs.
    For the year, International Game said it would report a
profit of one mln dlrs to 1.1 mln dlrs, or 17 cts to 19 cents a
share, on revenues of between 82 mln dlrs and 84 mln dlrs.
    The company said a change in accounting procedures removed
the effect of its investment in Syntech International Inc
(SYNE>O), which impaired earnings in the first three quarters.
