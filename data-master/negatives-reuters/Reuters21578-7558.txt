Mylex Corp said it has received scheduled
orders to resume shipments under an existing contract with one
of its major customers that it did not name.
    In May it said it did not have product releases from that
customer.
    Mylex also said it has introduced an International Business
Machines Corp &lt;IBM> personal computer compatible system board
using Intel Corp's &lt;INTC> 80386 microprocessor called the Mylex
386-A motherboard.  It said standard configuration includes one
or four megabytes of onboard 32-bit random access memory and 64
kilobytes of cache memory.
    Mylex said it will market the product directly and through
distributors to original equipment manufacturers, value-added
resellers and system integrators, with shipments to start in
mid-April.
