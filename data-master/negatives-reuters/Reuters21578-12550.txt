Gold and silver closed off the day's
highs on profit-taking, but silver, which continued to set the
pace, remained well up on yesterday's close, dealers said.
    Underlying speculative demand for silver remained strong
but profit-taking eroded the gains, taking the metal off
indicated highs at around 6.80 dlrs to close at 6.64/66 dlrs an
ounce. Yesterday's close was 6.52/54 dlrs.
    Some investors were noted selling gold and switching into
silver. This combined with profit-taking to push gold down to a
close of 418.50/419.00 dlrs from its opening 421.80/422.20 and
yesterday's 421.50/422.00.
    Dealers said it was unclear if the silver rally had peaked
or if fresh gains could be achieved in New York.
    "A lot depends on the Dow Jones index," one dealer commented.
"Further gains in stock prices would take away a lot of the
support for silver and gold."
    Platinum ended 50 cents higher at 563/567 dlrs.
