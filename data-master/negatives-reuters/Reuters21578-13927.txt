Denpac Corp said it placed an
order for the assembly of the first 100 production units of its
Sinterloy processor, which will begin delivery later this year.
    The company said two pre-production units have been placed
for clinical and laboratory evaluations, with an additional six
pre-production units to be placed shortly.
    The company said the Sinterloy processor is used by dental
laboratories to fabricate dental appliances such as bridges and
crowns.
