AID Corp said its stockholders
will be asked to change the company's name to ALLIED Group Inc
to more closely reflect the corporate logo adopted last year.
    It said stockholders of record March 31 will be eligible to
vote at the meeting.
    The company said its board has approved an amendment to the
pooling agreement effective January one, whereby &lt;AMCO
Insurance Co> will increase its participation by assuming 33
pct of ALLIED Group's combined written premiums. AMCO had
previously assumed 30 pct of the combined written premiums.
    With this amendment, AID said, its subsidiaries now assume
41 pct of the total combined written premiums.
