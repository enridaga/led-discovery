Tenera LP said it plans to
periodically repurchase up to 200,000 limited partnership units
in the open market.
    The timing and amount of the proposed purchases will depend
on the prevailing market price and trading volumes in the units
to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission regulators,
Tenera said.
