Shooting erupted at Philippine army
headquarters early this morning, an independent Manila radio
station said.
    Radio DZRH said it was checking unconfirmed reports that
about 120 mutineers had surrounded an office building inside
Fort Bonifacio.
    An officer told Reuters an alert had been sounded at the
camp.
    A Reuter reporter at the camp said the gates had been
sealed and guards were preventing anyone from going inside.
