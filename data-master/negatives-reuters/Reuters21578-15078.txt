A Brazil Fund through which foreign
investors will be able to buy stocks in Brazilian companies
should start operating in about two months, the Securities and
Exchange Commission said.
    A spokesman told Reuters that four institutions in the
United States were interested in participating in the Fund --
Merrill Lynch and Co Inc, Salomon Brothers Inc, the IFC and the
First Boston Corp.
    The spokesman said the Fund, approved last December, was
expected to attract about 100 mln dlrs of investments.
