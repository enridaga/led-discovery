BP Canada Inc, 64 pct-owned by
British Petroleum Co PLC, said it and state-owned Petro-Canada
were proceeding with Wolf Lake 2, the second phase of a
bitumen-recovery project in Wolf Lake, Alberta.
    The expansion, with an estimated pre-start up cost of 200
mln dlrs, will add 15,000 barrels a day to current capacity of
8,000 barrels a day.
    Construction will start in early 1988, with 248 wells
drilled initially and 975 more wells to be added over the
project's 25-year life, BP Canada said.
