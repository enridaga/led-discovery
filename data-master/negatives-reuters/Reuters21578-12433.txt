Prices for the better quality "AB" grades
were steady but those for all others were lower at the weekly
Nairobi coffee auction, the Mild Coffee Trade Association
(MCTA) said.
    Sources at the major coffee broking firms said prices were
generally irregular and were 30 to 50 shillings (1.9 to 3
dollars) lower per 50 kg, on the previous week's levels.
    The demand was good and all quality coffees were sold, they
added.
    The MCTA said the Coffee Board of Kenya (CBK) offered
35,000 bags as it did last week, and sold 95 pct.
    Prices per 50 kg were as follows, last week's in brackets:
 T 1405 1755(1430 1695)   E 2200 2295(2190 2295)
TT 2000 2129(1900 2303)  PB 2280 2333(2202 2349)
 C 1750 2239(1720 2282)  AA 2200 2650(2250 2600)
AB 2000 2350(2100 2419) MSC  700 2199 (850 2190)
