Net profit and sales for the
Pirelli group's worldwide activities should both grow well in
1987, said Jacopo Vittorelli, chief executive of Societe
Internationale Pirelli SA &lt;PIRI.Z>.
    Sales rose 17.5 pct to 2.75 billion dlrs in the first half
of 1987, and Vittorelli told reporters they were likely to show
the same percentage growth for the year as a whole.
    However, he declined to predict the likely growth in net
profit for the year. It rose by 31.7 pct to 80.6 mln dlrs in
the first six months. In 1986 group net profit was 141.0 mln
dlrs, up from 101.5 mln the year before.
