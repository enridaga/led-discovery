system, to save passengers between 30 dlrs and 100 dlrs off
Northwest's lowest published roundtrip prices.

airfares from New York of as low as 518 dlrs roundtrip, or from
San Francisco for 298 dlrs roundtrip, for example, the airline
said.
    It added that the service's ticketholders can begin their
trips anytime from April 20 through May 31 and travel must be
completed by June 12.

before departure, or within 14 days of making reservations,
whichever comes first.
