Genetic Laboratories Inc said
it set up a wholly owned subsidiary that will encorporate its
reconstructive plastic surgery products.
    Genetic Laboratories said one of the reasons for the move
was to "facilitate the sale or merger" of the business "with
other companies specializing in plastic surgery."
