The government said it will freeze
prices at end-December levels within five days.
    The announcement followed a wave of strikes that swept the
country in protest against a wages freeze.
    The government, in a statement through the official Tanjug
news agency, said the freeze would affect food, consumer goods,
tools, textiles and furniture and would last 90 days.
