The World Bank said it approved a 25
mln dlr structural adjustment loan for Mauritius to aid that
country's industrial sector.
    The Bank said the 17-year loan will support policy reforms
designed to help increase the efficiency of the country's
manufacturing sector, develop export enterprises and encourage
efficient use of resources.
    It added, "The increased availability of foreign exchange
for imports is expected to help the expansion of industrial
output and exports."
