Britain withdrew four more diplomats from
its diplomatic mission in Tehran, leaving only two officials in
their posts.
    The Foreign Office said the four had left Tehran earlier
today and would arrive in London tomorrow.
    Britain and Iran have been embroiled in a three-week-old
diplomatic row which began when a British diplomat was beaten
and abducted for 24 hours in the Iranian capital.-
