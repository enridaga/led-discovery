Privately-held Piper Aircraft
Corp said it has decided to resume production of some Piper
models that had faced suspension as soon as existing orders
were filled.
    The company said the decision to resume production
reflected improved demand for Piper products mainly due to
currency factors and reduced inventories.
    It said it will immediately resume production of the
PA-28-161 Warrior, PA-28-181 Archer, PA-28R Arrow, PA-28-236
Dakota, PA-32 and PA-32R Saratoga and Pa-34 Seneca in numbers
depending on market demand.
   
    The company said it will continue to make the PA-46 Mailbu
and resume production of the Cheyenne IIIA and Pa-42-400
Cheyenne late this year.
