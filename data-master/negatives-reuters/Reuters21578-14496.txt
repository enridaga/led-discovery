Dest Corp said it expects a 17
pct increase in revenues for its fourth quarter ended March 31
compared with the 4.8 mln dlrs reported for the same quarter a
year earlier.
    The company said the increase is due to increased demand
for its PC Scan product family.
    The scanning products are used with desktop publishing
systems, Dest also said.
