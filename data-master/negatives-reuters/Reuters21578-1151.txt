Hewlett Packard Co said it
unveiled the HP LaserJet Series II printer, the next generation
of its laser printer line.
    The company said the HP LaserJet II offers more
capabilities than earlier models, but at 2,495 dlrs, costs 500
dlrs less than previous machines. The LaserJet II prints eight
pages a minute and can be used for desktop publishing, word
processing, and spreadsheet and graphics printing.
    It also said it introduced a larger laser printer to
accommodate numerous workstations and a machine used to scan
documents.
    The company also said it introduced the HP LaserJet 2000,
its first printer designed to be used with personal computer
networks, departmental systems and minicomputers. It can print
20 pages a minute, and has an entry price of 19,995 dlrs.
    It also unveiled the SP ScanJet, a flatbed desktop device 
that scans printed images of text. The scanner works like a
photocopier storing the copied images on a hard disk, the
company said. It costs 1,495 dlrs.
    Hewlett Packard also said it brought out a new family of
plotter machines, the HP Draftmasters I and II. The new models
replace the HP 758X series of drafting-plotter line machines
used for computer aided design. The Draftmaster costs 9,900
dlrs, and the Draftsmaster II, 11,900 dlrs.
    A smaller plotter, called the DraftPro, was priced at 5,400
dlrs. It is designed for use with a personal computer.
