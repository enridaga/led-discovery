Sugar beet plantings are almost
complete in southern West Germany but are lagging behind in
other regions, trade sources said.
    In the west of the country, about 60 pct of the plantings
were completed, while in the north only 40 pct of the sugar
beet area has been sown, they said.
    The weather is forecast to stay mild in northern West
Germany in the coming days and more planting progress is
expected there, they said.
    This year's area sown to sugar beets is likely to fall to
38,500 hectares from around 40,000 last year.
