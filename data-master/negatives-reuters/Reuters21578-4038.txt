Scott Instruments Corp said it
has decided to concentrate on marketing new applications of its
existing research.
    It said it will realize cost savings from the reduction of
manufacturing and marketing staff and overhead expenses.
    The company said it will seek to license its Coretechs Vet
3 speech recognition product to other companies and have them
provide manufacturing, market development, distribution and
support activities in the industrial market.
    It said it is near completion of talks for a British
company to distribute Vet 3 in Britain and Europe.
