filed a coutersuit in the U.S. District Court in Detroit
against Advanced Voice Technologies and that it denied all
allegations in Advanced's March lawsuit against Reynolds.

with pirating a computer-based voice messaging system for auto
dealer departments using confidential information it received
while test marketing the system for Advanced.

enter the market and compete with Advanced through a public

monetary relief based on Advanced's activities.
