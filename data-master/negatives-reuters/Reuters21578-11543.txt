One miner has died and 44
miners remain trapped a half mile underground in a fire at a
Noranda Inc copper mine, officials said.
    Noranda said 26 miners had made it to a lunch room, where
they had air and water, but 18 others were unaccounted for.
    Two rescue teams were searching for the missing men.
    Noranda spokesman Lionel Gleeton said miner Ange-Marie
Kenney, in his 30s, died when he was caught in thick smoke
about 1,000 feet from the lunch room. His body was found by
rescuers.
