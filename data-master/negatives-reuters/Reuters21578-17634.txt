The American Hospital Association said
the best way to prevent the spread of AIDS to hospital workers
is for workers to wear protective clothing rather than through
routine tests of all hospital patients for the disease.
    The non-profit advocacy organization, which represents
hospitals and patients, recommended that hospital workers
should wear protective gear whenever there is a chance they
will be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids, regardless of
whether the fluids are known to be infected with AIDS.
    The group also said that "reliance on negative AIDS test
results to determine when to take specific precautions can lead
to a false sense of security among health care workers."
    So far there are nine cases on record of hospital workers
contracting AIDS from hospital patients. Despite the low risk
of contracting, the group said, "Hospital workers are
understandly concerned about their vulnerability (to AIDS)."
    There are 3.6 mln workers in the nation's hospitals with
nurses and housekeepers the most likely to come in contact with
blood and body fluids on a daily basis, the group said.
    Among the Americal Hospital Association's recommendations
were that health care workers exposed to body fluids must wear
gloves, and in some cases, gowns, masks, and eye coverings.
