U.S. T-bond futures gained half a point
in the few minutes after news that the U.S. Non-farm payroll
rose more slowly than earlier believed over the last two
months, dealers said.
    June T-bonds were trading at 97-2/32, or 31/32 down on the
day, immediately before the figures. When the news came out,
they made session highs of 97-17/32 before slipping to 97-
12/32.
    The payroll rose by 164,000 in March, against analysts'
expectations of a 225,000 gain, while the Labour Department
revised the February increase down to 236,000 from 337,000.
