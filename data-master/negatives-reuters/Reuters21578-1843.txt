A tremor hit northern Chile early today
but there were no immediate reports of victims or of damage to
the country's vital mining industry, the National Bureau for
Emergencies, ONEMI, said.
    The effects of the tremor at 0620 hrs (0920 GMT) registered
four to six degrees on the 12-degree Mercalli scale in
Antofagasta, 1,000 km north of Santiago, and five to six
degrees in Chuquicamata and Calama, at the centre of Chile's
mining region.
    The tremor was followed by a milder aftershock at 0758 hrs.
    An ONEMI spokesman said windows had been broken and a
number of cornices had fallen off buildings in the worst-hit
areas. These effects are described as up to seven degrees on
the Mercalli scale. The tremor caused a partial power cut in
northern Chile, the spokesman added.
    Quoting from the latest report from the area, received at
8.37 A.M., He said the effects of the tremor registered two to
three degrees on the Mercalli scale in Arica, on the northern
border with Peru, and three to four in Copiapo, 700 km north of
Santiago.
    ONEMI could not provide a reading on the Richter scale.
