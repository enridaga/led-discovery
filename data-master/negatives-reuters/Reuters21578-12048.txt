President Reagan set the
Export-Import Bank's direct loan ceiling in fiscal year 1987 at
800 mln dlrs, a decrease of 100 mln dlrs.
    In a letter to Congress, Reagan also said he was not
seeking any additional legislation to rescind any authority of
the bank, which aids U.S. exports.
    Reagan said he had concluded that the statutory 1987 limit
for Eximbank loan guarantee commitments should not be changed,
noting that "continued growth in the U.S. economy and global
recovery could create unexpected demand for guarantees and
insurance."
