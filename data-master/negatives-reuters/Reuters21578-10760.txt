Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he would
not call snap elections although disarray within the opposition
was a strong temptation to do so.
    Confirming earlier comments by government officials, Hawke
told reporters in Canberra: "I am confident that Labour would
win an early election. I have decided, however, that the
election will be held towards the end of this year or early
next year.
    "The Australian people want continued strong leadership and
a government that will continue to guide them through difficult
economic times into renewed prosperity."
