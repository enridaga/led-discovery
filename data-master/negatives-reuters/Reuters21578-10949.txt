M/A-Com Inc said its board
authorized the repurchase of up to five mln of the company's
common shares from time to time in the open market or private 
transactions.
    The company also said its board named Thomas Burke
president and chief executive officer.
    The buyback authorization is in addition to a previous
approval last September to repurchase 12 mln shares.
    The company currently has about 32.2 mln shares
outstanding, after completion of the buyback of nearly all of
the 12 mln shares, a spokesman said.
    The repurchase of the additional five mln shares will
depend on market conditions, the telecommunications and
microwave components company said.
    Burke, 57, has been chief operating officer of M/A-Com
since last November. Before that he was executive vice
president, finance and administration.
    In February 1986, M/A-Com's former chairman, president and
chief executive, Richard DiBona, suffered a stroke. After that,
director Frank Brand, who had been executive vice president,
was named acting chief executive and director Irving Hellman
was named acting chairman.
    Brand and Hellman gave up their interim posts yesterday,
the spokesman said, adding the company will have no chairman
for the time being.
    In a statement, Burke said he plans to announce a major
change in the company's organization in the next few days. The
spokesman declined to elaborate.
