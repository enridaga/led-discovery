Peripheral Systems Inc said it
completed tests of the Nucell-50 radio isotope generating
system, known as a resonant nuclear battery, designed to
produce up to 50 kilowatts of AC electricity.
    The Nucell-50, developed by privately-held &lt;Nucell Inc>,
converts the natural decay of radioactive materials directly
into electricity whout a nuclear reaction or fission process,
the company said.
    Peripheral said it entered into a previously announced
agreement to acquire Nucell, subject to shareholder approval,
and has been providing research funds and engineering to it.
    The merger calls for an unspecified amount of stock to be
paid for Nucell, the company said.
    The Nucell-50 unit, which measures 12 inches by 15 inches
and weighs less than 50 pounds, can operate continuously for
many years, the company said.
    The device uses a small amount of radioactive material,
which can be shielded for consumer use, the company said.
    Initial funding of the Nucell research and development was
provided by individuals, many of whom were officers and
directors of Peripheral, the company said.
