A World Bank mission today held talks
with a senior Finance Ministry official to discuss Brazil's
requests for loans, ministry officials said.
    They said Brazil, the bank's biggest customer, was asking
for two billion dlrs for the financial year starting in July,
including 500 mln dlrs for the energy sector.
    The mission, headed by Gabin Ran Kankani, head of the
Bank's Brazil division, met Finance Ministry secretary Nailson
Nobrega.
    Officials said they had provided the World Bank with
information on the economic plan now being drawn up by Finance
Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira.
    The government has invited the IMF to come to study the
plan next Monday.
    Bresser Pereira will use the plan as the basis for
negotiations with creditors next month in an attempt to
reschedule the country's 111 billion dollar debt.
