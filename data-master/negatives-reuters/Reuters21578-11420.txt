About 10,000 workers have gone on
strike in eastern Yugoslavia during the past few days demanding
higher wages, the official Tanjug news agency said.
    It said about 20 strikes broke out in the Yugoslav republic
of Montenegro, triggered by falling incomes and minimum wages.
More than 600 workers in the Visokogradnja construction firm at
Titograd left their jobs because they had not been paid for
three months, Tanjug said.
    Yugoslavia has been hit by a wave of strikes after the
government introduced a pay freeze in February to try to stem
wage rises and almost 100 pct inflation.
    Tanjug said the majority of the strikes in Montenegro were
in loss making companies whose weaknesses would have led to
unrest even if a wages freeze had not been implemented.
