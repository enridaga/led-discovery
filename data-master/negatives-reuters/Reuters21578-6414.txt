North Korea said it welcomed new
contacts between Korean and U.S. Diplomats and would impose no
restrictions on them, the New China News Agency reported from
Pyongyang.
    A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement said it hoped
diplomatic contact would help "promote sincere conversations
with goodwill and broad-mindedness," the agency said.
    The United States on March 9 lifted its ban on its
diplomats speaking with North Korean diplomats on neutral
territory.
