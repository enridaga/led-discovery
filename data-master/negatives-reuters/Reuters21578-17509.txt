Textron Inc unit Bell
Helicopter Textron Inc said it and two United Auto Workers
union locals agreed to a new three-year contract, ending a
three week strike.
    It said production and maintenance members of Local 218 had
been on strike for three weeks while clerical members of Local
317 had been on strike for a week. A total of 4,000 people were
out on strike.
    A company spokesman said the strike was based on a
disagreement over the method of future pay rises.
    The spokesman said the company's original offer was based
on lump sum payments over three years at six pct in the first
year, four pct in the second year and three pct in the third.
    He said management and the unions later agreed to a system
that combined general pay increases with lump sum payments over
the life of the contract.
