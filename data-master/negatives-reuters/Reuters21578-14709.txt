Chrysler Corp's pension expense is
expected to increase by more than 50 pct this year due to new
pension accounting standards, its annual report said.
    It said implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards Number 87 issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board in December 1985 this year is expected to
increase Chrysler's pension expense by more than 50 pct when
compared to pension expense calulated under the prevsious
standards.
    Last year, the report said, the company's pension expense
was 236.3 mln dlrs, up from 219.8 mln dlrs in 1985.
    A Chrysler spokeswoman said the exact amount of the
increase caused by the accounting change will be reported when
the company reports first quarter earnings late this month.
    The report also said Chrysler is continuing its program,
announced in December 1984, of buying up to 56.25 mln shares --
adjusted to reflect two three-for-two stock splits since then.
    The company had acquired about 42.3 mln shares by the end
of 1986, the report said, adding there is no target set for
completion of the program.
