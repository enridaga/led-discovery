Sears Roebuck and Co, said it reached
an out-of-court settlement with the Federal Trade Commission
over the labeling of some down-filled garments sold in 1978 "to
avoid further legal expenses."
    In a statement, Michael Bozic, chairman of Sears
Merchandise Group, said "As part of the voluntary corrective
program, Sears removed 75 mln dlrs worth of down-filled
merchandise from sale prior to the FTC investigation, retested
and where necessary, relabeled goods and nationally offered a
full refund."
    Sears said it was "the only retailer to take extensive
steps to protect consumers, despite the fact that down-labeling
discrepancies were industry-wide in 1978."
    Both Sears and Kellwood Co, a Sears supplier, agreed to pay
penalties of 200,000 dlrs each to settle the charges.
