The U.S. Agriculture Department has
ended its screwworm alert control program in Albuquerque, New
Mexico, because the potential of a screwworm outbreak in the
area has been contained.
    The department said the program was set up after a case of
screwworms was confirmed in a hunting dog being returned from
Venezuela.
    It said six weeks of surveillance has failed to turn up an
additional cases of screrwworms.
