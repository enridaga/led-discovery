Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
affirmed the ratings on 1.4 billion dlrs of debt of Marine
Midland Banks Inc and unit, Marine Midland Bank NA.
    Affirmed were the parent's A-2 senior debt and preferred
stock and A-3 subordinated debt, and the unit's Prime-1
commercial paper, A-1 long-term deposits, A-2 subordinated debt
and Prime-1 short-term deposits.
    Moody's cited a 400 mln dlr addition to the firm's loan
loss reserves as a reflection of exposure to economically
troubled borrowers. Moody's said the addition merely more
accurately reflects economic reality.
