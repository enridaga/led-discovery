The United States and Japan are waging a
behind the scenes battle at this week's Asian Development Bank
meeting over Tokyo's attempts to win a greater say in the
organization, U.S. And Japanese delegates said.
    Washington is opposing the Japanese efforts because it
would mean the end of the long-standing parity between the two
nations in the Bank, U.S. Officials said.
    Right now, the two countries' voting shares are about
equal, Japan having 12.53 pct and the United States 12.36 pct.
The slight difference is due to a temporary delay in the U.S.
Subscription to the Bank.
    "It's quite a delicate matter," Japanese Finance Ministry
deputy director general Fumiya Iwasaki told Reuters. "I don't
see the discussion ending soon."
    The issue is further complicated because other member
nations would have to give up some of their power in the Bank
if Japan were to increase its influence, he said.
    Tokyo raised the issue at last year's annual meeting in
Manila, arguing that the 3.7 billion dlrs it has contributed to
the Bank's soft loans fund entitled it to a greater say in the
overall organization. The United States has given 1.2 billion
dlrs to the Asian Development Fund.
