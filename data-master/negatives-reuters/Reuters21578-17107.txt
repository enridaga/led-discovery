Federated Financial Savings and
Loan Association said per share earnings in fiscal 1987 ending
September 30 will be reduced by about 16 cents a share due to
the write-off of its secondary reserve with the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp.
    The company did not specify the amount to be written off in
the current year.
