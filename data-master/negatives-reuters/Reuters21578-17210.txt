A spokesman for Continental Illinois
Corp said the bank will not comment on rumors that it will soon
add to reserves to cover possible losses on loans to developing
countries.
    Rumors circulated on Wall Street today that Continental
would soon join the long list of banks adding to reserves. Some
analysts speculated that a decision would be announced after
Continental's regularly scheduled board meeting, which will be
held Monday. "Our board meets on the fourth Monday of every
month, but their agenda is confidential," the spokesman said.
He said "we will not comment on any rumors."
