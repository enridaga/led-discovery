General Motors Acceptance Corp (GMAC),
the financing arm of General Motors Corp of the U.S., Will
launch its planned one billion U.S. Dlr medium term note
program in the international capital markets on April 7, said
Wendy Dietz, a vice-president at Salomon Brothers Inc, New

    She told a conference here on medium term notes that GMAC
is looking to obtain as fine pricing on the paper as it does
