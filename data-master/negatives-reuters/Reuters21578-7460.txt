LSI Logic Corp is issuing a 100 mln dlr
convertible eurobond due April 14, 2002 with an indicated
coupon of 5-3/4 to 6-1/4 pct and priced at par, Morgan Stanley
International said as lead manager.
    Terms will be fixed within five days and the conversion
premium is expected to be 24 to 26 pct above the share price.
The bonds are non-callable before April 14, 1990 unless the
share price exceeds 130 pct of the conversion price for 20
consecutive trading days.
    Any calls will be at 100 plus the coupon in year one,
declining in equal amounts to 100 in 1997.
    Gross fees are 2-1/2 pct, with one pct for management and
underwriting and 1-1/2 pct for selling, Morgan Stanley said.
    The bonds will be issued in denominations of 1,000 and
10,000 dlrs and listed in Luxembourg.  Pay date is April 14.
