the program which gives customers a choice of 3.9- to

    Ford said buyers of all 1986 and 1987 Taurus and Sable
models can choose between the low financing rates or cash
allowances of 400 dlrs.
    Buyers of all other eligible cars will get a cash allowance
of up to 600 dlrs, plus the low financing rates. It said those
buying trucks can choose between the low financing or a cash
rebate of up to 600 dlrs.
    Ford said the program takes effect now and applies to most
vehicles delivered to retail customers from dealer stock. A
program for Mustang ends March 31 as announced earlier.
