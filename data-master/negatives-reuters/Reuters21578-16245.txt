The U.S. Treasury said it will sell
13.2 billion dlrs of three and six-month bills at its regular
auction next week.
    The June 8 sale, to be evenly divided between the three and
six month issues, would result in a paydown of 1.3 billion dlrs
as maturing bills total 14.512 billion dlrs.
    The bills are to be issued June 11.
