The Federal Aviation Administration
said it expected continued growth for commercial aviation in
the next 12 years, with passenger traffic increasing at an
annual rate of 4.5 pct on major scheduled airlines and 6.7 pct
on commuter airlines.
    However, the FAA forecast projects slower growth for
general aviation than for the air carriers.
    The number of hours flown by private and business flyers,
for example, is expected to grow at an annaul rate of less than
one pct compared with a six pct rate in the 1960s and 1970s.
