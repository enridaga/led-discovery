The West German Finance Ministry said the
cabinet will discuss a bill on Wednesday to increase tax cuts
by an extra 5.2 billion marks next year to a total of 13.7
billion marks.
    The additional tax cuts were agreed within the government
coalition in early March after Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg pledged at the six-nation monetary conference in
Paris in February to increase the size of the 1988 tax cuts.
    The bill will be presented in parliament at a later,
unspecified date after the cabinet's deliberations.
