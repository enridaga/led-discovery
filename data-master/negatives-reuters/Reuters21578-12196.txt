Iran said it had achieved important
victories against Iraq on the southern war fronts last night.
    A brief Iranian news agency IRNA report said "Important
victories achieved in southern fronts Monday night." It gave no
further details.
    Iran launched a major offensive, codenamed Karbala-5,
towards the major southern Iraqi port of Basra in January, but
there have been no reports of heavy fighting in the area in
recent weeks.
