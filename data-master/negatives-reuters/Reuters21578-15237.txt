The U.S. Agriculture Department has
narrowed by three cents the price differential between the
Louisiana Gulf price of corn and posted country prices pegged
to the gulf price, USDA officials said.
    The change, effective April 27, means posted county prices
will be three cents higher in the region, Robert Sindt,
assistant deputy administrator of USDA's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
    Trade sources said USDA adjusted the differentials because
gulf prices had shown some weakness in recent days compared
with the rest of the country.
    Sindt said Louisiana Gulf corn price differentials that had
been between four and eight cents would, effective Monday,
range between one and five cents.
    Trade sources said cash bids at the Louisiana Gulf have
been between three and 4.5 cents weaker than in the rest of the
country in recent days, and that USDA's move would strengthen
the front end of the corn market.
