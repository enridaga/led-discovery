Gold share prices closed mixed to
slightly firmer in quiet and cautious trading, showing little
reaction to a retreat in the bullion price back to below 420
dlrs and a firmer financial rand, dealers said.
    Heavyweight Vaal Reefs ended eight rand higher at 398 rand
but Grootvlei eased 40 cents at 16.60 rand, while mining
financials had Gold Fields up a rand at 63 rand despite weaker
quarterly results. Other minings were firm but platinums eased.
    Industrials also closed mixed to firmer, the index once
again hitting a new high of 1757 from Friday's 1753 finish. The
overall index also hit a new high of 2188 versus 2179 on
Friday.
