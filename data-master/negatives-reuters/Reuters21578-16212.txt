Standard and Poor's Corp said it may
downgrade Hospital Corp of America's 1.8 billion dlrs of debt.
    S and P cited uncertainties over the company's major
restructuring. It noted that Hospital Corp has agreed to sell
104 acute care hospitals to a new company owned by an employee
stock ownership plan.
    The sale is for 1.8 billion dlrs cash. If the proceeds are
used primarily for share repurchases, weaker asset and cash
flow protection will result, S and P said.
    Hospital Corp currently carries A-rated senior debt and
A-minus subordinated debt.
