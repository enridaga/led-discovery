Rubber prices of all types firmed on
good demand for the 234 mln kilos offered at the Colombo
auction, brokers said.
    Among latex crepe, the best crepe one-X sold at an average
20.10 rupees per kilo, up five cents from previous levels.
Crepe two traded at 19.60 against 19.50 last week and other
grades also showed gains.
    Trade sources reported increased demand and more
speculative buying compared to earlier weeks.
    Among sheet offerings, RSS1 gained 20 cents from last week
to trade at 19.00 rupees a kilo. Other sheet rubbers were also
firm on speculative buying.
    Brokers noted bidding remained steady throughout the sale,
particularly for the best crepes and RSS1 types.
