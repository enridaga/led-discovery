Martin Ardbo, managing director of &lt;AB
Bofors>, which is at the centre of a police inquiry into
illegal arms shipments to Iran, has resigned, the company said.
    Ardbo was Bofors marketing head at the time peace groups
say the company supplied arms to countries Sweden had
blacklisted.
    Ardbo was stepping down from his post at Bofors but would
continue to work for the parent company, Bofors said in a
statement. "For the past two years, an inquiry into alleged
illegal arms exports has been carried out at Bofors. Arbo has
decided that it would be unsuitable if he continued to
represent the company," the statement said. It gave no further
details.
