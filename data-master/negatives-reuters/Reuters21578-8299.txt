Sony Corp said it plans to
begin shipping samples in the fall of a 130 millimeter erasable
magneto-optical disk system used for data storage. It said it
estimates the cost of the sample drives will be one mln yen
with sample media costing 30,000 yen.
    Sony said it will ship samples to potential customers in
Japan or overseas depending on demand.
    Sony said the product's development stems from continued
progress in key technologies such as newly structured recording
layers using a polycarbonate base and high power lasers with
high-speed data transfers, among other things.
