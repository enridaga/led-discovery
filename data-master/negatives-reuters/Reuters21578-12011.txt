Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co said it raised the
wholesale price for seven-stick packages of its Spearmint,
Juicy Fruit, Doublemint and Big Red brands, marching
competitive moves to a 35 cts retail price. The gum previously
sold at 30 cts a pack.
    The company also said on March 30 it brought out a
five-stick package of the four brands. The new package-size,
generally phased out by the trade in 1972, was priced at 25 cts
a pack, Wrigley said. A company spokesman said the five-stick
size was "well received" by the trade.
