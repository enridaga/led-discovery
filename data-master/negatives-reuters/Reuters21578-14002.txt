Salomon Brothers Inc said it was altering
the management structure of its London operation, Salomon
Brothers International Ltd, following a similar move in New
York last October.
    Under the new structure, Charles McVeigh, who currently
heads the London operation, will be chairman, while Miles
Slater will be president and chief executive officer. Slater
will continue to be in charge of the firm's international fixed
income commitment taking and international capital markets
services.
    Bruce Koepfgen, manager of the London office, will be U.K.
and European sales manager and general manager of the office.
    A board of directors also is being introduced consisting of
seven managing directors involved in key areas of the firm's
business.
    They are Peter Clarke, George Hutchinson, Koepfgen,
McVeigh, Sheldon Prentice, Slater and Daniel Tyree.
