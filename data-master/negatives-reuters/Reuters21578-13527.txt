&lt;Goodman Fielder Ltd>, an Australian
food products and supermarket firm, is planning a 100 mln U.S.
Dlr multi-option note issuance facility, lead manager BT Asia

    Under the three-year "evergreen" facility, which can be
extended annually, notes will be issued by its subsidiaries
&lt;Goodman Fielder New Zealand Ltd> and &lt;Goodman Fielder

    The facility is underwritten up to 75 mln dlrs at a maximum

The underwriting fee is 10 basis points, BT Asia said.
    The facility will allow the issuers to opt for notes not
exceeding 50 mln Australian dlrs and 50 mln New Zealand dlrs on
a non-underwritten basis, but the outstanding total is limited

one to three years, it added.
    The management fee was not disclosed and syndication is
