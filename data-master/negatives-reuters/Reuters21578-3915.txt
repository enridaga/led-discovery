The French government plans new
legislation this year which will lower the thresholds at which
investors in companies must declare their shareholdings, Bourse
officials said.
    The new rules, part of a scheme to provide more openness in
corporate ownership structure, will lower the initial
declaration threshold to five pct of a company's capital.
    Under current rules, an investor has to notify the Bourse
supervisory commission when a holding exceeds 10 pct, and again
at 33 pct and 50 pct. The officials said a 20 pct level has
also been added to the scale.
