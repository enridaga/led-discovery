Aides to South Korea's President Chun Doo
Hwan are urging him to reopen talks on electoral reform to
defuse nationwide political turmoil, the state radio said.
    It said ruling party officials would tell Chun he should
consider reversing an April 13 decision to shelve the debate on
reform until after the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
    Ruling Democratic Justice Party executives met today to
draw up a proposed package of measures. These included resuming
talks, releasing political detainees and lifting the house
arrest of top dissident Kim Dae-jung, the radio said.
