Philadelphia Electric Co said the
Operations Engineer at its Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station
has been replaced with another nuclear experienced, qualified
engineer holding a senior operator license at Peach Bottom.
    Early last week, the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission ordered that unit three of the nuclear power plant
be shutdown after determining that operators were sleeping on
duty.
    In a letter to the commission detailing actions taken as a
result of that order, the utility said the Operations Engineer
had been reassigned to corporate headquarters on April 6.
    Releasing its letter to the NRC, Philadelphia Electric said
it "will have no future comment on this response pending
Nuclear Regulatory Commission disposition" of the case.
    Effective April 11, the utility said, it is establishing
24-hour coverage of operations by at least one independent,
nuclear experienced engineer or physicist per shift posted
within the control room complex who will report directly to the
company's Superintendent of Nuclear Operations Quality
Assurance Division at corporate headquarters.
    Immediately after receipt of the NRC order, Philadelphia
Electric said, Senior Plant Management began making unannounced
control room visits during the night shift, adding this
activity will continue until the planned additional 24-hour
coverage operations are in place.
