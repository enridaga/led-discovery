Veteran politician Giulio Andreotti
abandoned his attempts to form a government, putting Italy on
course for early elections, political sources said.
    Christian Democrat Andreotti told President Francesco
Cossiga he was unable to reconstruct the five-party coalition
after two weeks of negotiations, they said.
