Central Bank President Jose Luis
Machinea said negotiations with creditor banks on Argentina's
30 billion dlr private sector foreign debt were difficult.
    "There is considerable divergence with the banks. We must
try to get them to lower the spreads," Machinea told Reuters.
    He said negotiations with the steering committee for the
country's creditor banks in New York would not end next week.
    Machinea leaves for New York tomorrow with Treasury
Secretary Mario Brodersohn to complete Argentina's team at
negotiations with the steering committee for a 2.15 biilion dlr
loan to see the country through 1987.
    Argentina is aiming at four pct growth in 1987 and has said
this target is not negotiable.
