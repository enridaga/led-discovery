Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> expects to achieve
its parent company sales estimate of 2,900 billion yen in the
year ending March 31, helped by high general-use ultra-large
computer sales and despite the higher-than-expected yen.
    Current profits are unlikely to reach the estimated 90
billion yen as the currency's rise has reduced the value of
foreign bond holdings, but the company will retain a nine yen
dividend for 1986/87, a spokesman said.
    Current profits in the year to end-March 1986 fell 38.2 pct
from a year before to 158.04 billion yen on sales of 3,003
billion, down 0.8 pct, mainly due to the yen's appreciation.
