Share prices plunged in early trade as an
opening foreign exchange record low of 143.75 yen to the dollar
and a weak stockmarket in New York withered investors'
confidence, brokers said.
    After 32 minutes' trade, the average plummetted 313.00 to
22,609.20. Yesterday the market gained 9.21 to a record close.
    Brokers said the dollar's fall against the yen prompted a
large selloff of export-related shares. But fears had spread
throughout the market, depressing almost all issues.
