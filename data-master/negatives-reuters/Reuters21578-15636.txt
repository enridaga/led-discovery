Kroger Co said members of the United Food
and Commercial Workers Union, which have been on strike against
its King Soopers Supermarkets division for the past two weeks,
will vote tonight on a new contract proposal.
    It said the union has removed pickets from King Soopers
stores pending the outcome of the vote.
