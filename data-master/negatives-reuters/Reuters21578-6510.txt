Hitachi Ltd's Maxell Corp of
America introduced a floppy disk with expanded storage
capacity.
    The company said the 5-1/4-inch disk has a storage capacity
of 3.2 megabytes unformatted, and is in response to user demand
for higher capacity media for newly introduced machines and
drives.
    Maxell said the disk will operate with the newly developed
YD-801 drive, to be produced by Y-E Data Inc, Tokyo, and
planned for introduction later this year in the U.S.
