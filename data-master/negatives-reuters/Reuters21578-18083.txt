USX Corp said it has authorized
the repurchase of up to 20 mln shares of common stock.
    "This action has been under study and consideration since
we announced our financial restructuring earlier this year,"
said chairman David Roderick.
    "It reflects the very strong financial position of the
corporation, and enables us to take advantage of current market
conditions," he said.
    The company said timing of the repurchase will be dictated
by market conditions.
