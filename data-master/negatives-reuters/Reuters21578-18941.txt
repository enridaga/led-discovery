Gencorp's RKO General said it has
asked the Federal Communication scommission to reverse an
administrative law judge's decision to revoke all 14 of the
company's broadcast licenses.
    RKO General said "the decision was based on allegations of
misconduct that are either in error or have no bearing on our
fitness as a broadcaster."
    It said the decision did not challenge the quality of our
broadcasting. Yet, if the decision is allowed to stank, it will
destroy our right to broadcast."
