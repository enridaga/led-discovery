A spokesman for General Public
Utilities Corp said the company would have a statement later
this morning.
    Trading in the company's stock was delayed at the opening
by the New York Stock Exchange, which indicated the company
would make an announcement.
    The spokesman would not elaborate on today's news.
    Yesterday, the company said power output at its Three Mile
Island unit one was cut to 81 pct of reactor power because of
mineral deposits on the non-nuclear side of two steam
generators.
