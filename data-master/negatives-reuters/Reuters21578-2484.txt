The Venezuelan government is close to
agreement with foreign banks to refinance 300 mln dlrs in
foreign debt owed by the Banco de los Trabajadores de Venezuela
(BTV), finance minister Manuel Azpurua said.
    He told reporters, Bankers Trust, which heads the BTV's
bank committee, is consulting other creditors on an eight year
refinancing plan with a margin of 3/8 pct over libor.
    He added there is a relending option for which the state
owned Banco Industrial de Venezuela will act as agent. BTV, 49
pct owned by the government and 51 pct by unions, was taken
over by trustees in November 1982 with severe liquidity
problems.
