The United Auto Workers denied a
published report it is expected to pick Ford Motor Co to be the
prime target in its upcoming contract talks with the auto
industry.
    A UAW spokesman called "premature" a press report that the
union picked Ford over General Motors Corp &lt;GM> as the lead
company in talks expected to begin in mid to late July.
    Earlier, the Detroit Free Press, quoting local union
officials, said Ford would probably be picked as the auto
company to set the pattern for a negotiated settlement with the
entire U.S. car industry.
    According to the report, the fact that Ford earned more
money last year than GM will cause the union to select Ford as
the company with which the union will negotiate the
pattern-setting settlement.
    The UAW traditionally picks one of the major car companies
in its national contract talks with the auto industry, which
occur every three years.
    GM was named the lead company in the last round of talks in
1984.
