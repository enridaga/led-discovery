renewal of five of its stations, clearing the way for the sale
of the company to &lt;Hallmark Cards Inc>.

stations on September 26, 1986, after which several parties had
filed applications with the FCC seeking to block the renewal of
the broadcast licenses and block the sale.

Angeles, KWEX-TV in San Antonio, WLTV in Miami, WXTV in New
York and KFTV in Fresno, Calif.
