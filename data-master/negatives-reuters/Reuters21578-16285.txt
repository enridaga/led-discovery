Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems
said it filed with the New York Public Service Commission
proposed retail rates to market mobile telephone services in
the metropolitan New York City area.
    The company expects the rates to go into effect July 1,
after a 60-day statutory period, pending regulatory approval.
    It said the approved price structure is the last regulatory
step before the company begins marketing cellular service and
equipment in northern New Jersey.
