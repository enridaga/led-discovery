The United Auto Workers has set a March
26 strike deadline at General Motors Corp's Pontiac, Mich.,
truck and bus plant, a UAW spokesman said.
    The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that the 9,000
UAW-represented workers at the facility will walk off the job
at noon (EST) next Thursday if an agreement is not reached by
that time.
    "We will be on strike. If the workers are still in there,
they will come out," the spokesman, Reginald McGhee, said.
    The union earlier said it today notified GM of its intent
to authorize a strike at the Pontiac facility.
    The UAW gave GM what it calls a "five-day letter," which
gives the company five days to come to an agreement before
workers go on strike. The letter was effective at noon today.
Weekend days are not included in the five-day period, McGhee
said.
    The spokesman could not say what the chances were for a
settlement. "At this point, it's too early to say" whether the
plant will be struck, McGhee said.
    The UAW earlier said the strike notification is expected to
"trigger an intensive effort to resolve disputed issues."
    Talks between the UAW local at the plant, Local 594, and GM
officials were continuing today over disputed contract issues,
including the main issue of whether the company can subcontract
jobs to non-union workers.
    McGhee said the two sides are also discussing health and
safety matters and relief time.
