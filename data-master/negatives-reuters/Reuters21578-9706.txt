U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said the Soviet Union continues to grow in military
strength and has tested its SS-18 intermediate-range missile.
    It was a "successful test so far as we know, and the next
one of course is the follow-on to the SS-20," Weinberger told
interviewers on the CNN television network.
    "They finished deploying the SS-20 some time last year. They
are all ready well advanced on its follow-on. They never stop.
That"s the lesson."
    "They continue to grow in all aspects: conventional, land,
sea, air and nuclear," he said of Soviet military strength.
