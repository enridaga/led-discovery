The government adopted an 8,829 billion
yen stop-gap budget for fiscal 1987 starting April 1 to
compensate for the delay in the passage through the Parliament
of the full 1987/88 budget.
    The provisional budget includes 1,862 billion yen in public
works spending to help stimulate the economy and meet overseas
demand for Japan to import more and reduce its huge trade
surplus, officials said.
    They said the stop-gap budget will be in effect for 50 days
through May 20 and is the largest ever.
    The budget includes 1,580 billion yen in new government
bond issues.
    Officials said the spending on public works accounts for
about two-sevenths of the 6,017 billion yen in public works
outlay set aside in the pending formal 1987/88 budget.
    The planned full budget totals 54,101 billion yen.
    The government had to work out the stop-gap budget because
budget debates have been delayed by an opposition boycott of
Parliamentary business in protest against a planned five pct
sales tax.
