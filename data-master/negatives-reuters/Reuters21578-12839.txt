Iraq said tonight its forces were
battling to dislodge Iranian troops from territory they gained
during a new three-pronged offensive on the war front near the
southern city of Basra.
    The third High Command communique issued during the day
said the Iranians launched a major overnight assault on the
fronts of three Iraqi divisions, the Qutaiba, Muthanna and
Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    It said the Iranian troops which attacked the Qutaiba front
were completely annihilated but the invading force managed to
gain some footholds on the other fronts.
    "Fierce fighting has been raging since dawn today and all
morning where our forces succeeded in dislodging the Iranians
from all the positions they gained at the Muthanna front and
the situation ended in Iraq's favour," the communique said.
    It said Iraqi forces were continuing counter-attacks to
drive the Iranians from the few positions they were still
holding on the front of the Mohammed al-Qassem forces.
    The precise locations of the three fronts were not given.
