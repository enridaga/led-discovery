Borden Inc said it plans to issue up to
250 mln dlrs of long-term debt securities in order to
capitalize on sharply lower interest rates.
    Proceeds will be used primarily to refinance existing
commercial paper.
    The company said the offering of long-term debt will be in
addition to its previously announced offering of a master
limited partnership interest relating to Borden's basic
chemicals and plastics operations.
