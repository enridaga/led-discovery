Moleculon Inc said it
successfully completed initial tests in animals of its
Poroplastic transdermal nicotine delivery system to help
smokers break the habit.
    Transdermal systems are designed to deliver drugs through
the skin in constant dosages.
    The company said it is discussing licensing and marketing
agreements for the product with a major international
pharmaceutical firm, but did not identify the firm. It also
said it retained Allen and Company, New York, as its financial
advisor.
