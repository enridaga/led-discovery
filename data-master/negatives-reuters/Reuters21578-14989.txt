A truckload of heavily-armed rebel
soldiers forced their way into Philippine army headquarters and
freed several men held prisoner in the camp since a January
revolt, military sources said.
    The sources told Reuters an estimated 100 rebels were
occupying the headquarters building at Fort Bonifacio and
forces loyal to President Aquino had surrounded the building
urging them to surrender.
    An independent radio station reported gunfire at the camp.
