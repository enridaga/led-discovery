Boeing Co. &lt;BA> is trying to find out
what caused an engine brace to snap on one of Japan Air Line's
747-SR jumbo jets, a spokesman for the airplane manufacturer
said.
    "We know about the problem and we have provided a service
advisory to operators of 747s," said the spokesman. "We are not
advising any massive inspections at this time."
    The advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that a
problem has occurred and under what circumstances, but it does
not recommend any action.
    "A 'service bulletin' would be sent out if there is
anything they should be concerned about," the spokesman said.
    A JAL spokesman in Toyko said inspectors making a routine
check found one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to
the wing of a 747-SR had snapped due to metal fatigue.
    The airlines said it had ordered an inspection of all 11 of
its 747-SR's. The plane is a full-sized jumbo jet that has been
modified slightly to handle short-haul routes in Japan, mainly
between Tokyo and Osaka.
    The jetliners have beefed-up landing gear to accommodate a
higher-than-normal number of landings and takeoffs.
    Boeing's spokesman said only JAL and All Nippon Airlines
use the 747-SR. JAL took delivery of its first 747-SR in 1973
and purchased two more last year. He said the braces had been
shipped to a Boeing plant near Seattle where they were being
inspected.
