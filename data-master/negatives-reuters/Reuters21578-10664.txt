A family court judge ruled
that Mary Beth Whitehead cannot have custody of Baby M, the
daughter she bore a childless couple in a surrogate agreement
that stirred international controversy.
    Judge Harvey Surkow ruled that the one-year old baby
belongs solely to William and Elizabeth Stern, who paid
Whitehead 10,000 dollars to bear Mr Stern's child.
