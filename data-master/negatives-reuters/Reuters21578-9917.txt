The Financial Times/Stock Exchange index
of Britain's 100 leading shares fell by its largest ever margin
in points terms during a single session, dropping 46.1 to close
at 2,002.5. The index earlier today touched a low of 1,993.7.
    Before today the largest one day points decline was a 35.8
point drop on February 9.
    The index fall was triggered by fears a trade war could
break out with Japan following news the U.S. Increased tariffs
on Japanese imports after the breakdown of a 1986 semiconductor
pact. Today's sharp sell off at the Wall Street opening gave
selling momentum to a market which was already at its lows.
