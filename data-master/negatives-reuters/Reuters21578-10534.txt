Immunex Corp said it received Food and
Drug Administration approval to begin human clinical testing of
a protein as a possible treatment for cancer.
    The company said the protein, granulocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor, stimulates production of white blood cells
essential to the body's immune function. It said it is
developing the compound with &lt;Behringwerke AG>, a subsidiary of
Hoechst AG.
    Immunex said the drug's potential applications include
restoration of white blood cell function, destruction of tumor
cells, and as an AIDS treatment.
