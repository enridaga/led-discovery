The Bundesbank noted with regret that
Paul Volcker will not be available for a further term as
Federal Reserve chairman, Bundesbank sources said.
    Cooperation with Volcker was always trusting and successful
for many years, the sources said.
    On the other hand the Bundesbank is confident that the good
cooperation between the Bundesbank and the Fed will continue
under the chairmanship of Alan Greenspan, the sources said.
