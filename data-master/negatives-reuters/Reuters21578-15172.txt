Iraq said its warplanes attacked two
large naval targets -- Baghdad's usual term for oil tankers or
merchant ships -- in the Gulf today.
    A military spokesman said the planes scored accurate and
effective hits in both attacks.
    There was no immediate confirmation of the raids from
independent shipping sources in the region.
    The spokesman said during one of the attacks, Iraqi planes
intercepted an Iranian F-4 Phantom and shot it down. All Iraqi
warplanes returned safely to base, he added.
