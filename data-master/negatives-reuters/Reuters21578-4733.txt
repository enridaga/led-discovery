expanding business needs, the official People's Daily reported.
    The state-owned bank's total assets reached 345 billion
yuan at end-1986, up from 260.5 billion at end-1985, it said.
    The bank handles almost all of China's foreign exchange
business and the settlement of international trade
transactions.
