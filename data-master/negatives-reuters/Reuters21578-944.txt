Caribbean Select Inc said it has
elected to redeem on April 10 all its Class A warrants and all
Class B warrants at 0.01 ct each.
    At the same time, it said its board has decided to reduce
the exercise price of the Class B warrants to 3.50 dlrs per
common share from four dlrs to encourage the exercise of the
warrants.  Each Class B warrant allows the purchase of one
common share.
    It said each Class A warrant is still exercisable into one
common share at two dlrs each.
