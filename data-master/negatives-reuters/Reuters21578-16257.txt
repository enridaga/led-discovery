Central Pennsylvania Financial Corp
said its earnings for the year ended March 31 have been
adjusted downward by 126,000 dlrs to 3,005,000 dlrs.
    The company said the adjustment is due to today's Federal
Home Loan Bank Board announcement that the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp has cancelled the secondary reserve payment
from all its members.
    It said the adjusted net income of 3,005,000 dlrs, or 2.34
dlrs a share, compares to the previously reported 3,131,000
dlrs, or 2.44 dlrs a share.
