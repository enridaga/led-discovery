Stanley Interiors Corp is raising 25
mln dlrs through an offering of convertible subordinated
debentures due 2012 with a seven pct coupon and par pricing,
said lead manager Salomon Brothers Inc.
    The debentures are convertible into the company's common
stock at 14.06 dlrs per share, representing a 25 pct premium
over the stock price when terms on the debt were set.
    Non-callable for two years, the issue is rated B-2 by
Moody's and B-minus by Standard and Poor's. First Albany and
Wheat First co-managed the deal, which was reduced from an
initial offering of 30 mln dlrs.
