Japan and Britain have signed a memorandum
on exchange of securities market information to protect
investors and promote the integrity of securities markets,
Finance Ministry officials said.
    As interaction between Japanese and U.K. Securities markets
grows, it is desirable for both countries to exchange
supervisory and investigatory information to assist each other
in securing compliance with their statutes, rules and
requirements, the memorandum said.
    The ministry's securities bureau has a similar arrangement
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
