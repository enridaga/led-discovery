Astrocom Corp said it added two new
products aimed at improving on-premise data network efficiency.
    Its ATDM/MS six-port time-division multiplexor is designed
to combine and send data from up to 18 remove terminals on a
single transmission link to the controller in the central
network.
    The other product, the Squeeziplexor 3074 coaxial
multiplexor, is a low-profile version of the company's
Squeeziplexor system that allows one coaxial cable to replace
up to 32 individual cables connecting terminals and printers to
the central controller.
