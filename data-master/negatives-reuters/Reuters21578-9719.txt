Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi said
confrontation would continue in Chad unless French forces leave
the country and rebel leaders share political power there.
    "Any anti-Libyan regime in N'djamena can rest assured that
it will never have a single comfortable night's sleep," he said
in a speech carried by Libyan television and monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
    Gaddafi repeated his stand that no Libyan forces are in
Chad, saying he stood by Chad rebel forces of GUNT -- the
Transitional Government of National Unity -- fighting the
forces of President Hissene Habre, supported logistically by
2,400 French troops.
    "As long as this movement (GUNT) continues to fight for the
liberation of Chad we will continue to stand by its side with
all force and firmness ... Whatever the battles, however long
the conflict and whatever the alliance between the
colonialists, the reactionaries and their agents," Gaddafi said.
