Capital spending in the U.K. Chemical
industry is expected to rise to 1.4 billion stg this year, a
three pct increase on the 1986 level after inflation, the
Chemical Industry Association said.
    A further increase to 1.52 billion stg is expected in 1988,
but there will be a decline to 1.38 billion in 1989, the
association found in its latest investment intentions survey.
    Even so, the estimated total fixed capital spending for the
1987-89 period of 4.3 billion is a real spending increase of
six pct on the previous three years, the report said.
Eighty-one firms took part in the survey.
