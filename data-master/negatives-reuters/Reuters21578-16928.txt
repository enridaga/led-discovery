National SemiConductor Corp,
which earlier reported a profitable fiscal fourth quarter after
a year ago loss, said it expects improved financial performance
during its new fiscal year.
    The company reported a profit of 8.1 mln dlrs in the
quarter ended May 31, after a loss of 7.1 mln dlrs in the year
ago period.
    The company said orders for its core businesses have
improved, adding "Our strong balance sheet and the improved
business environment should enable us to improve our financial
performance during our new fiscal year."
    The company said that during the fourth quarter both its
semiconductor group and its information systems group had
higher sales and improved operating performance than in the
prior quarter and the year-earlier quarter.
