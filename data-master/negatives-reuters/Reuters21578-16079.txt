Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding
welcomed President Reagan's decision to name economist Alan
Greenspan as successor to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker, who will not serve another term.
    "The minister feels the choice of Alan Greenspan is an
excellent one," said a spokesman for Ruding, who also chairs the
IMF policy making interim committee. He did not elaborate.
    But Ruding expressed regret over Volcker's departure saying
he had "great appreciation for the work he has done all these
years," the spokesman said.
