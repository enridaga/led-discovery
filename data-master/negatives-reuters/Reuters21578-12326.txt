President Reagan will shortly
nominate the head of the U.S. program for Third World
development, Peter McPherson, as second-ranking officer of the
Department of the Treasury, administration sources said.
    They said the White House was expected to announce
McPherson's nomination to succeed Richard Darman as deputy
Treasury scretary later this week.
    The nomination is subject to Senate approval.
    McPherson has headed the Agency for International
Development (AID) since 1981. As Treasury Secretary James
Baker's chief assistant, he would be expected to work closely
on international economic policy, including the major problems
of the Mexican and Brazilian debts.
    McPherson, a lawyer, worked in the White House under
President Gerald Ford, after serving as a corporate tax
specialist for the Internal Revenue Service.
    He also spent two years in Peru as a member of the Peace
Corps.
    Darman, who was considered to have played a central role in
achieving agreements among industrial countries on
international economic policy, will leave the Treasury on April
13 to join the Investment Banking Group of Shearson Lehman
Brothers.
