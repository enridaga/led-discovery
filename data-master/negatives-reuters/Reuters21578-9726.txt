South Africa's Environmental
Affairs Minister John Wiley died today in an apparent suicide
attempt, police said.
    His wife found him lying on his bed at home this morning
with a bullet wound in his head, police said. A pistol lay by
his side.
    The police said no crime was suspected and they were
treating it as an apparent suicide.
    The spokesman said Wiley's wife returned to the family home
near Cape Town to find the door locked. She found help to break
into the house and found her husband dead.
    Wiley, 60, had been member of parliament for Simonstown,
near Cape Town, since 1966, representing several parties.
    Local reporters said he had been fighting a very active
campaign to retain the seat for the National Party (NP) in the
May 6 whites-only general election.
    They said he won the seat comfortably for the NP in the
1981 poll, but was facing a strong challenge this year from
John Scott, candidate for the centrist Progressive Federal
Party.
