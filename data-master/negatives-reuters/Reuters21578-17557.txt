Apollo Computer Inc said the price cuts
announced earlier today on its Domain Series 3000 computer
workstations average 35 pct to 50 pct.
    An Apollo spokesman said the cuts bring prices to under
5,000 dlrs for some Series 3000 models.
    In addition to reducing prices, the company said it added
new monochrome and color models to the Series 3000 line that
improve its performance and graphics capabilities.
    The company made the price cuts along with the introduction
of a more powerful family of workstations, the Domain Series
4000.
   
    Industry analysts had expected Apollo to reprice the Series
3000 in response to aggressive price cuts made two weeks ago by
Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> on its competing
workstations.
    But the Apollo spokesman said the reductions had been
planned for some time. "We haven't just cut prices," he added,
noting that the company had improved the Series 3000 models.
    Analysts have said they also expect Sun Microsystems Inc
&lt;SUNW.O>, Apollo's biggest rival in the workstation market, to
cut prices and introduce new models. Sun has scheduled a new
conference on July eight.
