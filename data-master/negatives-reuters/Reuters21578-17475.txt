Fidelcor Inc said it will take a
one-time 30 mln dlr special provision in the second quarter for
possible losses in loans to developing countries.
    The corporation said it will be profitable in the quarter
despite the action that will reduce quarterly net income by 23
mln dlrs, or 37 cts a share on a fully diluted basis.
    For the year-ago second quarter, Fidelcor reported earnings
of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 95 cts a share.
