Noranda Inc said contract talks resumed
with about 1,600 unionized workers at its 63 pct-owned
Brunswick Mining and Smelter Corp lead-zinc mine and lead
smelter at Bathurst, New Brunswick.
    A Noranda official said talks involved both the mine and
smelter union locals, which are part of the United Steelworkers
of America.
    The mineworkers' contract expires July 1. They will vote on
June 22 either to authorize a strike or ratify a possible
contract offer. The smelter workers' pact expires July 21.
    The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and
206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pct
zinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000
tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead.
