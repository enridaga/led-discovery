Shr 22 cts vs not given
    Net 1.6 mln vs 1.4 mln
    Revs 35 mln vs 14 mln
    NOTE: 1985 results restated from originally reported loss
of 1.6 mln dlrs or 28 cts a share.
    1986 figures reflect reverse takeover accounting to include
12-month results of the Rose Group, but only three months for
Tele-Radio Systems Ltd and Ens Bio Logicals.
