United States Oil Co said Dr. V. di
Guevara Suardo Fabbri was appointed president and chief
exeuctive, effective October 31, replacing William Rueckert,
who will resign on that date.
    Rueckert told Reuters he resigned to puruse other business
activities.
    Last November, Fabbri bought a controlling interest in the
company and has since brought in his own management.
    The company said that three new directors have been elected
and that one present director resigned effective October 16.
