Greece and Turkey's NATO
allies called on both countries to avoid any action that could
aggravate an explosive situation in the Aegean and "avoid
recourse to force at all costs."
    After an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors , a
statement was issued saying: "the present situation damages the
interests of Greece and Turkey, and of the Alliance as a whole."
     Secretary-General Lord Carrington also offered himself as
a mediator in the dispute on the Western Alliance's southern
flank.
