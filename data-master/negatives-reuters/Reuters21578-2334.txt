The New York Stock Exchange said its
members overwhelmingly approved a rule change that elminates
the limits on fines imposed as a result of disciplinary
proceedings.
    The NYSE said the amendment to its constitution, already
approved by its board, must now be approved by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
    The NYSE said it currently limits penalties to a maximum of
25,000 dlrs per charge against individuals and 100,000 dlrs per
charge against firms.
