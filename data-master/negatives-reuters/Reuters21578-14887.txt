Employees of Morton Thiokol Inc
&lt;MTI.N> have gone to the FBI with allegations of fraud by the
firm in the manufacture of booster rockets blamed for the 1986
Challenger explosion, ABC News reported.
    According to the report, some Morton Thiokol employees went
to the FBI in Salt Lake City, Utah, with their allegations last
January 15.
    An FBI criminal investigation into Morton Thiokol began in
late January, although FBI officials have refused to confirm
whether the probe was related to the Challenger disaster.
    FBI spokesman Ray McElhaney refused to discuss the report
today, saying FBI officials could not comment about current 
investigations.
    The space shuttle Challenger exploded after takeoff Jan
28, 1986, when the temperature at the Florida launch site was
20 degrees below that specified for the O-rings that hold the
solid-rocket boosters together.
    The rings failed and all seven shuttle astronauts died in
the explosion.
    Morton Thiokol, based in Chicago, built the Challenger's
boosters in its Utah facility.
    The allegations by the employees follow similar charges by
former Morton-Thiokol engineer Roger Boisjoly, who has filed
two lawsuits alleging criminal fraud against his former
employer.
