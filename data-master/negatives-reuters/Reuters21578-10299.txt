A.H. Belo Corp said it will ask
shareholders at the May Six annual meeting to approve a change
of state of incorporation to Delaware from Texas.
    It said it wants to take advantage of Delaware's more
flexible corporation laws and laws allowing the limitation of
directors' liability.
    Belo said two thirds approval is required.
