A West German navy ship was accidentally
hit today by artillery shells from a Warsaw Pact vessel in the
Baltic Sea and three sailors were injured, the Defence Ministry
said.
    The ship, the Tender Neckar, was struck while watching
Warsaw Pact exercises in the Baltic Sea, a ministry spokesman
said.
    He could not say what condition the men were in or which
country owned the ship which fired the shots. The spokesman
said West Germany believed the incident was accidental.
