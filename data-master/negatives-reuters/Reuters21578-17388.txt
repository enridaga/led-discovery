Bahrain's 19 commercial banks have been
instructed by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) to return to a
six day working week with effect from July 4.
    A circular sent to the banks today reverses a shift in
early April to a five day week and follows three months of
controversy within the domestic banking sector over hours.
    A BMA spokesman said the circular, which does not affect
offshore banks, represented a "compromise solution" between
differing views within the industry and was drawn up following
the agency's own survey of banks, staff and customers.
    In April the BMA allowed commercial banks to operate a five
day week from Sunday to Thursday. Banks have since been closed
on Fridays, the Islamic weekend, and Saturdays.
    The new regulation will require banks to work from 7.30
A.M. To 12 noon from Saturday to Thursday inclusive. Banks may
open on these days during the afternoon between 3.30 and 5.30.
    The regulations apply to bank opening hours, not to staff
working hours, which continue to be decided by banks.
    Under the five day week introduced in early April, banks
have been obliged to open from 8 A.M. Until noon and from 3.30
to 5.30 P.M.
