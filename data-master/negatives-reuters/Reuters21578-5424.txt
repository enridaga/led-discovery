development and pilot and clinical production groups from its
Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, from Henley Group Inc &lt;HENG>
for 15.3 mln dlrs.
    Genetics said the purchase of the plant will allow a
fourfold expansion of its pilot and clinical production
facilities for biotechnology-based human pharmaceuticals.

equip the facility for process development activities and
clinical scale production.  Construction is to be completed by
