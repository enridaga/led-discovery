State-owned Philippine Airlines Ltd
(PAL) said it has agreed with Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd
&lt;CAPH.HKG> to an increase in seat allocations on the busy
Manila-Hong Kong route.
    A spokesman told Reuters a memorandum of understanding
would be signed later this week between the British and
Philippine governments to allow the current total of 32 flights
a week to be increased. "There are no immediate plans for more
flights but it gives us flexibility," he said.
    PAL said an agreement reached with British Airways would
allow each carrier to keep three London-Manila flights weekly.
