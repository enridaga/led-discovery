that an administrative law judge had recommended that small
package service between the United States and Tokyo be granted
to Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>.
    A final decision by the department is expected within 90
days.
    In addition, the department said the law judge recommended
that backup service be granted to &lt;Orion Air Inc>. The order,
if finally approved, would be for five years in the case of
