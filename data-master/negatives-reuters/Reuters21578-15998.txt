U.S. And Soviet negotiators have completed
the text of a draft treaty calling for the elimination of
medium-range missiles in Europe, a Soviet negotiator said.
    "We must say that as a result of the work done at the
current round the sides have drafted the first joint draft text
of the treaty on medium-range missiles," Alexei Obukhov, deputy
leader of the Soviet negotiating team, told reporters.
    He said there was still much work to be done and several
areas of disagreement remained to be resolved.
