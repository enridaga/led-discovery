    The death toll rose from a previously reported 85 as news

killed in Lwarai Mandi in North Waziristan Tribal Agency,
officials said.
    The death toll in Angur Adar in South Waziristan rose to 23
and the toll in Teri Mangal in Kurram Agency rose to 81. The
Soviet-backed Afghan government has not commented on the
