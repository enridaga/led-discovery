" [letter from Sir Alexander Dick to Johnson] I had yesterday the honour of receiving your book of your """"Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland"""", which you was so good as to send me, by the hands of our mutual friend, Mr. Boswell, of Auchinleck; for which I return you my most hearty thanks; and after carefully reading it over again, shall deposit in my little collection of choice books, next our worthy friend's """"Journey to Corsica"""". As there are many things to admire in both performances, I have often wished that no Travels or Journeys should be published but those undertaken by persons of integrity and capacity to judge well, and describe faithfully, and in good language, the situation, condition, and manners of the countries past through.'
