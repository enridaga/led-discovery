"I read a volume which was called """"The Guide to Domestic Happiness"""", but found that it had no direct bearing upon the case of a working man - all its reasonings, counsels, and encouragements being based on upon the supposition of the reader's being a person of substance and education. the only publication I met with which at all came up to my wishes was one called """"Letters on the Marriage State""""; but even this bore only in a distant way upon the case in question.'"
