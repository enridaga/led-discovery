"?Great was our delight, too, when chance opportunities came in the way of such of  us as could read. An opportunity of this kind arrived when a firm of printers in London brought out a penny Shakespeare ? a play of Shakespeare?s for a penny! Well do I remember this cheap treasure. It was my first introduction to the great bard. Gracious! How I devoured play after play as they came out. I was a poor errand boy at the time. When on my errands I used to steal odd moments to read my penny Shakespeare.?"
