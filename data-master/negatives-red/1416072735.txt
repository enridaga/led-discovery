"Very miserable.  'Like a poor Lunitick that Makes his Moan And for a time beguiles the Lookers-On He reasons well, his Eyes their Wildness lose And vows the keepers his wrong'd sense abuse.  But if you hitt the cause that hurts his Brain Then his Teeth gnash; he foams; he Shakes his Chain, His Eyeballs roll, and he is madagain'.  (Lee, 'Caesar Borgia')"
