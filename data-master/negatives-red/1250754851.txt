"H. J. Jackson discusses copious annotations made in 2-volume first-edition (1791) copy of James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson, which signed """"Scriblerus"""" (who Jackson identifies as Fulke Greville), commenting: """"[Scriblerus] evidently read the Life, or at least dipped into it, more than once: a summary note from the end of his first reading is dated November 1791, but other notes include dates in 1792 and 1797.""""
