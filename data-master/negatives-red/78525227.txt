"Have been reading the """"Quarterly Review"""" on Lyell's tour in North America. The """"Quarterly"""" rejoices, quite generously, in American Art, and """"Progress"""", and so forth - but is mainly solicitous that the Americans should - for their own sake, fo course - stay at peace. """"For"""", says the generous reviewer, """"As the future of America, to be a glorious future, must be a future of peace, so we would hope that it may be fruitful in all which embellishes and occupies and glorifies peace."""" - Most balmy language!'"
