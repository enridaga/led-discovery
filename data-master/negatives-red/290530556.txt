"It was Lilly's Latin Grammar. It called for uncommon perseverance to come at its contents, so much had it suffered from the use and abuse of schools... But I was desperate; nothing now could daunt me. I sewed, and pasted and repaired and covered the old book... and then conned and conjectured, and unweariedly considered its contents, that I might comprehend them.  My father finding me resolved, gave me all the assistance in his power, but my reliance was on my own persevering and unconquerable determination to succeed."
