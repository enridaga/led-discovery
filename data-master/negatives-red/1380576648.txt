"Passages transcribed in E. M. Forster's Commonplace Book (1941) include stanza 32 of Malherbe, 'Pour le Roi, allant chatier la Rebellion des Rochelois' (1628), followed by remark: 'If I admire this, do I like French poetry? I do admire it. And, mythology lost, what will become of poetry? Mythology gave a stiffening to the fabric.'"
