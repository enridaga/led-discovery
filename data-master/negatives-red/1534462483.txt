"George Smith, A Memoir (London, 1902): 'The MS. of """"Jane Eyre"""" was read by Mr Wiliams ... he brought it to me on a  Saturday, and said that he would like me to read it ... after breakfast on Sunday morning I took the MS. of """"Jane Eyre"""" to my little study, and began to read it.  The story quickly took me captive.  Before twelve o'clock my horse came to the door, but I could not put the book down ... Presently the servant came to tell me that luncheon was ready; I asked him to bring me a sandwich and a glass of wine, and still went on with """"Jane Eyre"""" ... before I went to bed that night I had finsihed reading the manuscript.'"
