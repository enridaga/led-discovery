"Mrs. Martin lent me Dr. Channing?s treatise ?On the importance & means of a national Literature?, & I ought to be grateful to her.  I have been reading it this morning.  It is a very admirable, & lucidly & energetically written production.  The style is less graceful than powerful.  Indeed it has so much strength, that the muscles are by necessity, rather too obvious & prominent.  But its writer is obviously & prominently an extraordinary man."
