"I usually when I had done with my french, read some book every night and having left the Corresponding Society I never went from home in the evening I always learned and read for three hours and sometimes longer, the books I now read were french; Helvetius, Rousseau and Voltaire. I never wanted books and could generally borrow those I most desired to peruse."
