Books, however, were very scarce.  The Bible and Bunyan were the principle; he committed many chapters of the former to memory, and accepted all Bunyan's allegory as bona fide history.  Afterwards, he obtained access to 'Robinson Crusoe', a few old Wesleyan magazines and some battle histories.  These constituted his sole reading, until he came up to London, at the age of fifteen, as an errand boy."""""
