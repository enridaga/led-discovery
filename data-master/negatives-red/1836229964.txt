"The Lord Mayor's Show. 'The boys always went ... They always brought home for me a little book, that opened out to nearly a yard of coloured pictures, displaying all the features of the Show. This was called 'A Penny Panorama of the Lord Mayor's Show', and the name pleased me so much that for days afterwards I would go about the house pretending to be a hawker, crying: """"Buy my Pamorama, my penny Panorama, My penny Panorama of the Lord Mayor's Show.""""'
