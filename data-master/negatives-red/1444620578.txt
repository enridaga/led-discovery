"If your old contributors had to yield the pas to such writers only as the author of the """"Battle of Dorking"""" we should have little to complain of.  It is wonderfully fine and powerful.  Is it Laurence Oliphant? I can't think of anybody else with such a power of realism and wonderful command of the subject.  It is vivid as Defoe.'"
