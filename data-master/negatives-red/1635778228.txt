"[Philip Inman] loved everything by Charlotte Bronte, partly for what she had to say about the class system: """"Characters like Jane Eyre and Lucy Snowe were humble individuals in the eyes of the world, with only their dogged determination and lack of 'frills' as weapons against the dash and arrogance of those haughty and wealthy rivals among whom their lot was cast"""". Yet he admired Jane Austen for an equal but opposite reason: """"The world of which she wrote, in which elegant gentlemen of fortune courted gentle, punctilliously correct ladies in refined drawing rooms, was a remote fairy-tale country to me. Some day, I thought, perhaps I would get to  know a world in which voices were always soft and modulated and in which lively and witty conversation was more important than 'brass'.""""'"
