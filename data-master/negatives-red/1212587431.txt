"Ellen Nussey's reminiscences of Patrick Bronte's sister-in-law Elizabeth Branwell (in 1871 account of her 1833 visit to Haworth Parsonage): 'In summer she spent part of the afternoon in reading aloud to Mr Bronte. In the winter evenings she must have enjoyed this; for she and Mr Bronte had often to finish their discussions on what she had read when we all met for tea.'"
