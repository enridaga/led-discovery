"I read some of Chrysostom's commentary on the Ephesians.  I am getting tired of this commentary.  Such underground dark passages before you get at anything worth standing to look at!  Very eloquent sometimes: but such a monotony & lengthiness! Sunday is not a reading day with me.  Driving to church, driving back again, driving to chapel, driving back again - & prayers three times at home besides!  All that fills up the day, except the few interstices between the intersections."
