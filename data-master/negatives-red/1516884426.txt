"I wanted to have sent you a translation of the Epigram Flahaut has introduced in her book. It is Johnson's, and inserted in Piozzi's anecdotes - but my father has lent, & lost (often synomymous terms) his copy of that work, & I cannot immediately think of anybody to apply to. There are no bookish people here - on the contrary, they seem to me to look with an evil eye on every reader of every production save a newspaper."
