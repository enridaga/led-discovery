"Passages transcribed in E. M. Forster's Commonplace Book for 1927 include Oscar Browning's reflections, quoted in H. E. Wortham's biography of him, on the potential of the human mind, and the chances governing realisation, or non-realisation of this ('I have been drawn to think rather of the tens who have failed than of the units who have succeeded, and of the ore that lies buried in our social strata rather than of the bright coins which circulate from hand to hand')."
