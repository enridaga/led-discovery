"Emrys Daniel Hughes, son of a Welsh miner, first treated Pilgrim's Progress as an illustrated adventure story. When he was jailed during the first World War for refusing conscription, he reread it and discovered a very different book: """"Lord Hategood could easily have been in the Government. I had talked with Mr Worldly Wiseman and had been in the Slough of Despond and knew all the jurymen who had been on the jury at the trial of Hopeful at Vanity Fair. And Vanity Fair would of course have been all for the War.""""'"
