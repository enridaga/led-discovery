"one day in Kirkwall my brother Johnnie, who had gone to work in a shop there, gave me three pennies to spend, and I went at once to the bookseller's which sold """"The Penny Poets"""" and bought """"As You Like It"""", """"The Earthly Paradise"""", and a selection of Matthew Arnold's poems. ...I did not get much out of the selection of Arnold's poems... """"As You Like It"""" delighted me, but it was """"The Earthly Paradise"""" that I read over and over again.'"
