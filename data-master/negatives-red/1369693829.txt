"I am much obliged by your present of The Monastery, which I have read, and which I must frankly confess I admire less than any of the others - much less. Such I think you will find the judgement of the public to be. The idea of painting ancient manners in a fictitious story and in well-known scenery is admirable, and the writer has admirable talents for it; but nothing is done without pains, and I doubt whether pains have been taken in The Monastery, - if they have, they have failed. It is quite childish to introduce supernatural agency; as much of the terrors and follies of supersition as you please, but no actual ghosts and hobgoblins. I recommend one novel every year, and more pains. So much money is worth getting; so much deserved fame is worth keeping, so much amusement we ought all to strive to continue for the public good. You will excuse my candour - you know I am your wellwisher. I was the first to praise Ivanhoe, as I shall be to praise the next, if I can do so conscientiously'."
