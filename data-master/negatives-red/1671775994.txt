"?To say the truth, my compliment is not so strong as it seems; for there is no English paper now wh. I can read without disgust. The Saturday, politically speaking, is intolerably wordy & pompous; the Spectator is Hutton; and the Pall Mall is Greenwood ? that is to say, a mere mass of petty rancour, always snarling in the attempt to be smart & as narrow-minded as if it was an ecclesiastical organ. My brother, I am thankful to say, does not write in it now & says he can?t read it. Really, it is hard to be without an organ; but even old Times, lying & trimming & idiotic as it is, is less offensive to me than these performances. The only paper wh. I am told has some go in it is The World & that is simply blackguard.?"
