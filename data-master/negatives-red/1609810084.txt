"Whenever I read in St Paul's Epistle on justification by faith alone, my good mistress would read in the Epistle of St James, such passages as say that a man is not justified  by faith alone, but by faith and works, which often embarrassed me not a little. However, I comforted  myself with the conceit of having more texts of Scripture on my side of the question than she had on her side.  As to St James, I was almost ready to conclude, that he was not quite orthodox, and so at last I did not much mind what he said.'"
