"[Father] had joined the PSA at the YMCA. That is: the Pleasant Sunday Afternoon at the Young Men's Christian Association; a religious service with plenty of tuneful hymns, usually a couple of singers who gave """"sacred"""" songs; and to which was attached a Book Club. By paying a few pence a week Father got all the books he could read; he was a slow reader, too. He got """"Valentine Vox, Ventriloquist"""", """"Sylvestre Sound"""", """"Somnambulist""""; """"Uncle Tom's Cabin"""", and many others. Dolly has some of them at this date, sixty years later.'"
