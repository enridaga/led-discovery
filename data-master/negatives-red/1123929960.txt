"Alethea Bigg. - """"I have read M.P. & heard it very much talked of, very much praised.  I like it myself & think it very good indeed, but as I never say what I do not think, I will add that although it is superior in a great many points in my opinion to the other two Works [Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice], I think it has not the Spirit of P & P., except perhaps the Price family at Portsmouth, & they are delightful in their way.'"
