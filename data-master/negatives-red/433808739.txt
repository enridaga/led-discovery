"Mary Berry to Mrs Cholmeley, 3 February 1799: 'I hope you have read the Irish debates on the Union.  I think you will have found in them much abuse, little eloquence, and very little argument [...] The famous Irish pamphlet in favor of the Union, called, """"Cease your Funning"""", which after much trouble I got to read, disappointed me; it is sharp and well-kept-up irony from beginning to end, on a pamphlet on the other side, by the Ld Lieut.'s secretary; but it is not very entertaining, and not at all instructive.'"
