"Charlotte Bronte to William Smith Williams, 12 April 1850: 'The perusal of Southey's """"Life"""" has lately afforded me much pleasure ... I have likewise read one of Miss Austen's works """"Emma"""" -- read it with interest and with just the degree of admiration which Miss Austen herself would have thought sensible or suitable -- anything like warmth or enthusiasm ... is utterly out of place in commending these works ...'   "
