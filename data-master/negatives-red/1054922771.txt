"[according to Thomas Campbell] he begged of me that when I returned to Ireland, I would endeavour to procure for him a poem of Dr Madden's called """"Boulter's Monument"""". The Reason (said he) why I wish for it, is this: when Dr Madden came to London, he submitted that work to my castigation; and I remember I blotted a great many lines, and might have blotted many more, without making the poem worse. However, the Doctor was very thankful, and very generous, for he gave me ten guineas, [italics] which was to me at that time a great sum [end italics]'."
