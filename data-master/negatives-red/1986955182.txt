"Dorothy Wordsworth to Mary Hutchinson, 1 February 1813: 'Willy [Wordsworth, the poet's son] is now beside me ... He has taken up a book, and there he reads fragments of a hundred little songs - about Cock Robin, pussy cat and all sorts of things.  he is very entertaining; but one half of the heart is sad while the other laughs at his strange fancies.'"
