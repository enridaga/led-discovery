"I remember [...] [Tennyson's] reading with admiration this passage from Maurice's Friendship of Books. """"If I do not give you extracts from any of Milton's specially controversial writings, it is not that I wish to pass them over because the conclusions in them are often directly opposed to mine, for I think that I have learnt most from those that are so.""""'"
