"Dined with Anzie Wylde at Old Queen Street. Some 'expert' business men have interested him in the floating of a company for exploiting the entire anatomy of sharks (New Zealand ones).  He was full of the scheme, which will, it is hoped, prove, by profits and products, that the shark is one of man's most useful friends. I spend a lot of time reading 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom' (lent me by T.E.L.) Note: One of eight copies which Lawrence had printed by the 'Oxford Times' for private circulation."
