"Erich had a little book which he greatly valued. In order to cheer my captivity he showed this book to me. When I saw the way Erich used to linger over its pages at night before going to sleep I thought that it was some pious work given him by his mother before he left the Fatherland. When he showed it to me I found that it was pornographic. The text was meaningless to me, as Erich regretfully acknowledged, but, he indicated, brightening considerably, the illustrations were indeed realistic.'"
