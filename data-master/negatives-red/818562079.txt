"Thursday 13 July 1939: 'A bad morning [...] 2 hours at M[ecklenburgh]S[quare].[...] A grim thought struck me: wh. of these rooms shall I die in? Which is going to be the scene of some -- oh no, I wont write out the tragedy that has to be acted there [...] So I read Pascal & Pater & wrote letters & cooked dinner & did my embroidery. But couldnt sleep sound.'"
