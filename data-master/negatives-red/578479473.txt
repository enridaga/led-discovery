"[Letter to Sibbella Maclean, dated August 18 1824] I should have marked, and doubtless, have done so in my little edition at home (got another directly), the very lines youmention. I have also marked the following, """"Celestil happiness! Where e'er she stoops / To visit earth, one shrine the goddess finds"""" [Night II, ll.516-17]"
