"Wilde's copy of """"The Bacchae of Euripides"""" edited by one of his Trinity tutors, R.Y. Tyrrell, has also survived. On the title-page of the famous play... Wilde wrote """"Oscar Wilde T.C.D. Trinity [i.e. summer term], 1872. Clearly intent on acquiring a """"minute and critical knowledge"""" of the text, Wilde underlines countless words and phrases which he then presumably looked up in his lexicon; he frequently glosses lines in the drama with notes such as """"C.f. Xenophanes"""", """"C.f. [line] 342""""'."
