"In February 1896, seven titles were added to his [Oscar Wilde's] store. These were: Dante's """"Divina commedia"""", accompanied by an Italian grammar and dictionary to help Wilde with the poem's medieval Italian; two massive folio volumes containing the entire surviving corpus of Greek and Latin poetry and drama; the equally weighty Liddell and Scott's """"Greek Lexicon"""", and Lewis and Short's """"Latin Dictionary"""". More Adey, the translator of Henrik Ibsen...procured the volumes and dispatched them to Reading.'"
