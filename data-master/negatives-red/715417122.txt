"We have a little French story in the house, called [underlined] Elizabeth [end underlining], much admired and praised: but """"somehow"""", I have taken it into my head that it is [underlined] too good [end underlining] for my palate, <for> because Mrs W - the strictest person in the world about Novels, put it into the hands of my Bone - and my bone yawned over it - andd when I asked her how she liked it, said - """"O very much - only there's hardly any love in it!"""" Whip Novels without love!'."
