"The circulating record of the Cardigan Book Society suggests that this reader read the work, as the """"Remarks"""" section of the record is filled in (although the remarks are illegible) and there is a marginal comment in the same hand by the title of the last article, """"Zero: A Story of Monte Carlo"""".  The annotation reads """"Praed"""" [probably therefore  identifying the article as being by Winthrop Macworth Praed]."
