"?I hope that you have read Carlyle in August Macmillan & that you appreciate him. Of course it is damned nonsense but nonsense of a genius & not without a certain point. We have a lot of effete things in this blessed old country & a good rush over Niagara will do us all good in the world? Only it is melancholy to see him begging the aristocracy to come & help poor England out of the slough. If that is it, we shall have to stick there, I fear, till doomsday.?"
