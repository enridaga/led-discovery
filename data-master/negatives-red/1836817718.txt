"Read Lady Vavasour's """"Last Tour, and First Work, or a visit to the Baths of Wildbad, & Rippoldsau"""". - It is only one Volume, & is very entertaining and often clever, & lively, with considerable general information. Campbell's Editorship of the """"Life of Frederick the Great"""" has also amused me much'."
