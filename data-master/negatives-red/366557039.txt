"Henry James to Alice James, 8 November (letter begun 7 November) 1869: """"I have of course no company but my own [in Rome], but in the intervals of sightseeing find a rare satisfaction in the long-denied perusal of a book.  I have been reading Stendhal -- a capital observer and a good deal of a thinker.  He really knows Italy."""""
