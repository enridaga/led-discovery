"?I bought the other day a copy of Aquinas & find him very good reading. Only to understand him one ought obviously to read a whole mass of contemporary stuff wh. would swamp me altogether. ? He is a kind of revelation to me ? but what interests one most is to find out how many things have been said over & over again for so many centuries.?"
