"Felicity Browne, mother of Felicia Browne, to Matthew Nicholson, 7 February 1812: 'I saw in the paper some time ago, that two thousand pounds would be given for the best translation of Lucian Bonaparte's poem of Charlemagne -- Could you enquire where information respecting this could be had? -- it is a work for which Felicia's perfect knowledge of the French tongue & poetical genius make her quite competent -- I read in the paper, of the fall of Ciudad Rodrigo [...] thank GOD the names of my sons are not in the fatal list'."
