"Read the articles Phoenicia and Carthage in Ancient Geography. Looked into Smith's """"Universal History"""" again for Carthaginian religion. Looked into Sismondi's """"Litterature du Midi"""", for Roman de Rose, and ran through the first chapter, about the formation of the Romance Languages. Read about the Thallogens and Acrogens in """"the Vegetable World"""". Drayton's Nymphidia - a charming poem. A few pages of his Polyolbion. Re-read Grote v-vii on Sicilian affairs down to rise of Dionysius'."
