"It was at this time that I read the remaining seven volumes of the """"Spectator""""; to which I added the """"Rambler"""", the """"Tatler"""", and some others of the """"British Essayists"""". I also read the poetical works of Milton, Addison, Goldsmith, Gray, Collins, Falconer, Pomfret, Akenside, Mrs. Rowe, with others which I cannot now clearly call to mind. I remember, however, to have read Gay's poems. These gave me more than usual satisfaction. I was much amused with his """"Trivia, or the Art of Walking London Streets"""" but I was especially pleased with his admirably burlesque """"pastorals"""". These just squared with my humour, for I had then, as I have ever had, an utter dislike to the sickening stuff that is called the pastoral poetry...I must not omit to mention the pleasure I derived from reading a poem called """"The Village Curate"""", which, I think, has fallen into unmerited oblivion.'
