"I do not know sufficient about Villiers de l‚ÄôIsle Adam to advise you.  His best known book is 'L‚ÄôEve Future'.  I have read half of it twice, but could never get to the end of it.  Axel (play) is another famous book of his but I have not read it.  His short stories are very renowned indeed.  Contes Cruels and Nouveaux Contes Cruels. I have read all these.  I should say that they were pretty wonderful fifty or sixty years ago , but what they would look like in a translation I cannot predict.  "
