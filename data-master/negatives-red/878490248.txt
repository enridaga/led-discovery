"Read """"Poems 1909-1925"""" by T.S. Eliot. I have never had any inclination to read Eliot's book but a whim prompted me to name it when Moll asked what book I'd like. I am afraid reading Eliot hasn't changed my opinion of him. His poetry is rooted in a pedantic intellectuality: a waste-land verily: a valley of dry bones without any blood: there is wit - but the wit is also dry; brittle - no Rabelsaisian sap: no human richness: only the false disillusionment of the young could model itself on this verse.'"
