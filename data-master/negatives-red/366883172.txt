"Is not your countryman Grant White a terrible bore? The question is prompted by the fact of me having just read a review of him in the Saturday. But my opinion is not formed upon the review but upon his just having sent me two books of his, one on Copyright & one called Washington Adams. As he was polite to me 20 years ago I ought to have acknowledged them; but after reading, I found it quite impossible to say anything civil. He seemed to me to be both silly & impertinent. But you need not tell me anything of him; for I guess I know the animal sufficiently.'"
