"Reader makes several references to the work: V.1, p.9, p.15, p.25, p.142; V.2 p.200. eg.: V.1 p.9 'Well, now I was very sure I would not smile this summer, nor yet read any book but the Bible and Night Thoughts*; even the Odyssey was to be rejected'.  *'The Night Thoughts, and the Odyssey, were favourite studies among these friends, to which they were wont to make many serious and playful allusions' [footnote, p. 9] from Letter II to Miss Harriet Reid of Glasgow, April 28 1773. eg. p.25 'Though my sorrows should be multiplied, as very likely they may, I shall have consolations peculiarly my own, that, like Milton?s sweet music, ?will breathe above, about, and underneath?. How literal this truth is ?. A little dress, a little Odyssey, a little breakfast, and then ? I shall behold the faces of my kindred' from Letter III To Miss Reid."
