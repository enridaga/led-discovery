"Jenny & James [the Austen's servants] are walked to Charmouth this afternoon; - I am glad to have such an amusement for him - as I am very anxious for his being at once quiet and happy. - He can read, & I must get him some books.  Unfortunately he has read the 1st vol. of Robinson Crusoe. We have the Pinckards Newspaper however, which I shall take care to lend him.'"
