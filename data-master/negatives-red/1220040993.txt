"?There were no free libraries, so the younger hands joined with me in starting a """"Literary Fund"""" of our own, towards which each paid three-halfpence a week. The papers and books bought for general reading were afterwards divided. In our little club the """"Cornhill Magazine"""", from its start under Thackeray?s editorship, was read and discussed; also Dickens?s successive productions. I call to mind many serious books, as well as """"Cassell?s Magazine"""" and the """"London Journal"""", in which appeared Miss Braddon?s great story of """"Henry Dunbar"""", then entitled """"The Outcasts"""".?"
