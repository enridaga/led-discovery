"""""One windfall came [to Hannah Mitchell] from a passing walker, who asked if the family liked reading poetry.  Although only familiar with verse in the local paper, Mitchell quickly answered in the affirmative ... The walker (whom years later Mitchell recognised as the model Manchester employer Hans Renold) left her his copy of Wordsworth's poems, which Mitchell read and memorized until her mother removed them since they 'wasted' her time."""""
