"The History of Pendennis (2 vols, 1849-50) by William Makepeace Thackeray was published by Bradbury and Evans in twenty-four numbers (twenty-three parts) from November 1848 to December 1850 [...] The edition the Brownings were reading, which had been lent to them by Charles Eliot Norton (see letter 2893 [in source]) was probably the one being published in Leipzig by Bernhard Tauchniz. Issued in three volumes from April 1849 to December 1850, the second volume appeared in March 1850'."
