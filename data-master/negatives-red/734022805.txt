"[letter from Boswell, to Johnson] It gives me much pleasure to hear that a republication of """"Isaac Walton's Lives"""" is intended. You have been in a mistake in thinking that Lord Hailes had it in view. I remember one morning, while he sat with you in my house, he said, that there should be a new edition of """"Walton's Lives""""; and you said that """"they should be benoted a little."""" This was all that passed on that subject. You must, therefore, inform Dr. Horne, that he may resume his plan. I enclose a note concerning it; and if Dr. Horne will write to me, all the attention that I can give shall be cheerfully bestowed, upon what I think a pious work, the preservation and elucidation of Walton, by whose writings I have been pleasingly edified'."
