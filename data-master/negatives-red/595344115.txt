"I am delighted and honoured by your gift of an inscribed copy [presumably of """"Voices of Tomorrow"""" but see additional comment]. It is with great pleasure that I discover in myself an intellectual (or perhaps instinctive) sympathy for what you say in your book with such force, clearness and conviction. In the article on myself what I see first is the generosity of your appreciation.'"
