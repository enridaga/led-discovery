"It was during all these years that he [Conrad] read. Men at sea read an inordinate amount.[...] A large percentage of the letters received by writers from readers come from sailors either in the King's or the merchant service.[...]. It was Conrad's great good luck to be spared the usual literature that attends on the upringing of the British writer. He read such dog-eared books as are found in the professional quarters of ships' crews. He read Mrs. Henry Wood, Miss Braddon &mdash; above all Miss Braddon! &mdash; the """"Family Herald"""", rarely even going as high as the late William Black or the pseudoliterary writers of his day.[...] Normally he would express the deepest gratitude to the writers of the """"Family Herald"""" &mdash; a compilation of monthly novelettes the grammar of which was very efficiently censored by its sub-editors &mdash; and above all to Miss Braddon.[...]. Long after this period of seamanship Conrad read """"The Orange Girl"""", a novel placed in the time of Charles II. He recognised in it, so he then said, all the qualities he had found in this novelist's work when he had been before the mast.'"
