"I have read these leaves of your thesis; and really I find them very far beyond my expectation, which had satisfied itself with ranking your Latin (I now discover) far too little above the usual Grinder Latin.  Some of these sentences are quite good.  The sense too so far as it extends in these few lines is clear and flowing; and I have no doubt, if the rest in any way correspond to it, your Essay will be very far above the average.'"
