"Henry James to William Dean Howells, 27 November 1882: """"I see in the last Academy that you have never seen the magazine [containing Howells's praise of Henry James; not clear whether Academy or just previously-mentioned Century is meant] and of which I should long since have sent you a copy did I not suppose that the publishers had the civility to do so."""""
