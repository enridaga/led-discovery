"Progress was so slight [in Charles Schreiber's recovery following disorder of lungs in spring 1883] that the doctors recommended a sea journey to South Africa. On October 26 [1883] they [Schreiber and his wife, Lady Charlotte] left England in the Hawarden Castle, and on November 14 anchored in Table Bay. Lady Charlotte found solace during an uneventful journey in Shakespeare and Walter Scott.'"
