"I should have read S.& H. [Shops and Houses] earlier, despite J. & P. , but I couldn‚Äôt get the book off Marguerite.  Conjugal unpleasantness became so acute on the point that I was obliged to buy a second copy.  I think this book shows marked development on the part of the author.  There are about 150 pp. as good as the very best few pages of """"On the Staircase"""", & some much better.'"
