"Mr B. Lefroy - thought that if there had been more Incident, it would be equal to any of the others.  -The Characters quite as well drawn & supported as in any, & from being more everyday ones, the more entertaining. - Did not like the Heroine so well as any of the others.  Miss Bates excellent, but rather too much of her. Mr & Mrs Elton admirable & John Knightley a sensible Man.'"
