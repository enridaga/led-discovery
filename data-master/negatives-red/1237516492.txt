"A poor day-labourer in the town ... had an old torn book which he lent my father, which was called """"Bunny's Resolution""""... And in the reading of this book (when I was about fifteen years of age) it pleased God to awaken my soul... And about that time it pleased God that a poor pedlar came to the door that had ballads and some good books; and my father bought of him Dr. Sib's """"Bruised Reed"""". This I also read."""""
