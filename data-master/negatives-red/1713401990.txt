""""" ... a tourist guide to Salisbury Cathedral, published about 1800 and acquired by the British Library in 1874, contains notes made by an unidentified annotator who supplemented the guide by registering changes in the cathedral since the time of printing, such as 'Both are now (1810) in the Nave,' for instance, adding statements made by authorities who contradict assertions in the text; and providing neat little sketches of architectural details.""""
