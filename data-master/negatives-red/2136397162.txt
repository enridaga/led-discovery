"""""It was in my fifteenth year that I became again, this time intelligently, aquainted with Shakespeare. I got hold of a single play, The Tempest, in a school edition, prepared I suppose, for one of the university examinations which were then being instituted in the provinces...This book was my own hoarded possession; the rest of Shakespeare's works were beyond my hopes. But gradually I contrived to borrow a volume here and a volume there. I completed The Merchant of Venice, read Cymbeline, Julius Caesar, and Much Ado; most of the others, I think, remained closed to me for a long time. But these were enough to steep my horizon with all the colours of sunrise."""""
