"I read her [Miss Murray] the legend of Steenie Steenson the other night, and we agreed it was in the author's very best manner. I felt disappointed, though, at Wandering Willie's not coming forward more effectually after that very interesting scene of using old times as a sort of telegraph. I thought he was to be a prime agent, and then I heard no more of him; that is to say, the aforesaid author grew tired and flung the cards into the bag as fast as he could. I know his provoking ways.'"
