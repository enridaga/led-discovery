"I was reading yesterday and to-day """"Sense and Sensibility"""", which I resumed at the second volume. The last volume greatly improves on the first, but I still think it one of the poorest of Miss Austen's novels - that is inferior to """"Mansfield Park"""" and """"Pride and Prejudice"""", which is all I have read.'"
