"Lady Aberdeen [a child in London in the late 1850s] ... learnt to read from the under-butler, sitting with him in the front hall ... But when the discovery of her new-found ability was made ...she was """"furnished with a Mavor's spelling book"""" ... and made to start ... letter by letter, rather than by recognising words -- """"under my mother's personal superintendence"""".'"
