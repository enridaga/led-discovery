"Mary Berry, Journal, 29 August 1807: 'In the evening read a good deal of the last Scotch Review [...] What they say of Mr. Hope [author of """"Household Furniture and Internal Decorations executed from Designs""""], though he lays himself open to ridicule, is ill-natured and often in bad taste. An excellent criticism upon Cobbett's weekly journal, exposing, in the clearest manner, his shameful inconsistencies [...] and holding up upon true Whig principles our real defects and real misconduct [...] only wishing them to be considered as they are, and not confounded with preposterous exaggeration in the minds of the people.  But alas!  the people read Cobbett, and will never read the Scotch Review.'"
