"Henry James to Thomas Sergeant Perry, from Cambridge, Mass., 20 September 1867: """"I read recently, by the way ... [George Sand's] Memoirs a compact little work in ten volumes.  It's all charming (if you are not too particular about the exact truth) but especially the two 1st volumes, containing a series of letters from her father, written during Napoleon's campaigns."""""
