"?the snow left off a bit after lunch & we strolled out for a walk? so after pounding a mile or two out & home along slushy snow-paths we came home rather disgusted & bought some queer earthenware animals at a shop & then I sat down in the hall & puzzled out a bit of Plato. It is first rate reading to take on a journey; because a small volume would last one month; & there is the pleasure of guessing at each sentence before I make something out of it.?"
