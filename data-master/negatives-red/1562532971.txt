"My dear boys, when I was your age, there were no such children's books as ther are now...Now, among those very stupid old-fashioned boy's books was one which taught me [to use my eyes]...It's name was Evenings at Home, and in it was a story called """"Eyes and no Eyes"""", a regular old-fashioned, prim, sententious story.'"
