"O! """"Esmond""""! That book marks its own year in one's life. I never did any justice to Thackeray before; and I cannot <italics>now</italics> read """"Vanity Fair"""".

I suppose you feel with the rest of us ; - that it is <italics>marvellously</italics> powerful, but grievously morbid and not a little coarse.'"
