"""""The Earl's Daughter"""" was also begun before my mother's death, and I read part of it to her, but she saw from the beginning that it was likely to be sad, and I think it rather oppressed her. """"Margaret Percival"""" I read to her entirely, and also a portion of """"Laneton Parsonage"""", and I remember being obliged to reassure her that Alice Lennox (in the latter tale) when taken ill would not die, she took such a vivid interest in the story - which was only completed after her death'."
