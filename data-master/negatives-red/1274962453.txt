"Can you tell me about """"Jane Eyre"""", - who wrote it? I am told I wrote the 1st vol: and I don't know how to disbelieve it myself, - though I am wholly ignorant of the authorship. I cannot help feeling that the author must know not only my books but myself very well. My own family suppose me in the secret, till I deny it. With much improbability of incident, it is surely a very able book (outside of what I could have done of it) and the way in which the heroine comes out without conceit or egotism is, to me, perfectly wonderful'."
