"In Seaham village lived a poet, """"an unfortunate child of Genius,"""" -- one Joseph Blacket, a cobbler's son, whom [Anne Isabella Milbanke's] parents actively befriended. Whether they took him seriously as a poet, or (like Byron) very much the reverse, Annabella [i.e. Anne Isabella] was impressed by his attempts. One of the early records is a copy of verses to her, """"on her presenting the author with a beautiful edition  of Cowper's Poems"""" -- just a year before Blacket's death in 1810, at twenty-three.' "
