"Three weeks ago, I finished M. Bailly's """"histoire de l'Astronomie Modern[e.]"""" His acquaintance with the science seems to have been more extensive than profound; his stile is elegant - perhaps somewhat too florid, and interspersed with metaphors which an English critic might be tempted sometimes to call conceited - I wish I were an Astronomer - Is it not an interesting reflection to consider, that a little creature such as man-tho' his eye can see the heaven but as it were for a moment - is able to delineate the aspects which it presented long ages before he came into being - and to predict the aspects which it will present when ages shall have gone by. The past the present & the future are before him.'"
