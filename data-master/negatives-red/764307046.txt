"Words of a gentleman, well known to Fry, desirous of seeing and judging for himself effects of the experiment in Newgate Gaol, visited Newgate, and wrote: 'I was conducted by a decently-dressed person, the newly appointed yards-woman, to the door of a ward, where, at the head of a long table sat a lady belonging to the Society of Friends. She was reading aloud to the prisoners, who were engaged in needle work around it ... They all rose on my entrance, curtsied respectfully, and then at a signal given resumed their seats and employments.'"
