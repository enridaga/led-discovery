"My natural disposition was very volatile, and my apprehension very quick; and as my faculties opened, I delighted much in books of a very contrary nature and tendency to those which had engaged my attention in my childhood. I had a near relation, who, notwithstanding his having been favoured in his youth, had slighted his soul's mercies, and pursued lying vanities. He kept house in the town; and through him, myself, and my sisters, had opportunities of obtaining plays and romances, which I read with avidity. I also spent much time at his house as to be introduced into amusements very inconsistent with the implicity of truth, and my former religious impressions; so that my state was indeed dangerous, and but for the interposition of Divine Providence, I had been left to pursue courses which must have terminated deplorably. I also read history, was fond of poetry, and had a taste for philosophy; so that I was in the way to embellish my understanding (as is the common phrase), and to become accomplished to shine in conversation; which might have tended to feed the vain proud nature, render me pleasing to those who were in it, and make me conspicuous in the world.'"
