"I received the copy of """"Adam Bede"""" which you were so kind as to send me quite safely; and I am very much obliged to you for it. - I thoroughly admire this writer's works - (I do not call him Mr Elliot, because I know that such is not his real name.) I was brought up in Warwickshire, and recognize the county in every description of natural scenery. I am thoroughly obliged to you for giving it to me; it is a book that it is a real pleasure to have, and if for every article in your Magazine, abusive of me, you will only be so kind as to give me one of the works of the author of """"Scenes from Clerical Life"""", I shall consider myself your debtor'. [Later on the same page, Gaskell says 'One of Mrs Poyser's speeches is as good as a fresh blow of sea-air; and yet {it} she is a true person, and no caricature']"
