"Wolfe was a great admirer of Gray's """"Elegy""""; and as he was going down the river with his officers, previous to the storming of Montreal, he read the poem to them to while away the time, for it was then a new thing, just published. When he had finished he turned to them and said, """"Gentlemen, I had rather have been the author of that poem, and have given utterance to the sentiments expressed in it, than I would enjoy all the honour which I believe awaits us in this expedition"""".'"
