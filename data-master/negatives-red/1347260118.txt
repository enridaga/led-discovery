"?In January 1860, appeared the Cornhill magazine, with Thackeray as its editor. The price was a shilling? As soon as I knew it was on sale, I walked to Beddington and came home the proud possessor of the first number. Thackeray?s """"Roundabout papers"""" and some of his stories I read with much gusto. Before the year was out there appeared in the Cornhill a series of remarkable papers by John Ruskin, """"Unto this last"""". These I read with avidity from beginning to end. Long and deep did I ponder over them. The style ? so simple, so beautiful, so telling ? captivated me??"
