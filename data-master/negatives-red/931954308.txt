"I went on with """"Persuasion"""", finished it, began """"Northanger Abbey"""", which I have now finished.  These two novels have sadly reduced my estimation of Miss Austen.  They are little more than galleries of disagreeables and the would-be heroes and heroines are scarcely out of the class of insignificants.  Yet I ought to be suspicious perhaps of my own declining judgement.'"
