"I was up early and round to the machine-gunners about their piano for to-night's concert ... After making all the arrangements for a practice this afternoon, carrying the piano over, etc., I went over on [horseback] to C.R.A. at Rance about a circulating library, for which we have been given the sum of 500 francs. It is difficult to know what to order, but I was lucky enough last night to find a catalogue from <i>The Times</i> of all kinds of cheap and pocket editions. But the price nowadays is awful! The little 7d. editions are now up to 1s. 9d., so we shan't get very many for our money. I left the catalogues with Burne for him to look over.'  "
