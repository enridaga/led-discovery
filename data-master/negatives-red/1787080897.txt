"A motor bicycle drew up at our door and a haggard dispatch rider stumbled in to put a scrap of paper into my hand. It was a page torn out of an army notebook with a scribbled message in pencil from a lieutenant addressed to his commanding officer; the date and time upon it belonged to the afternoon before. The writer was holding on with a handful of men at a point (he gave a rough map reference) but they were nearly surrounded ‚Äî could help be sent, very soon or it would come too late? The messenger had been trying ever since to find the CO and had failed; the message <i>must</i> be delivered to someone ‚Äî and now to me of all people! The message, I pointed out, was twelve hours old, but the dispatch rider seemed stupefied with his utter failure and weariness. He went dumbly away with his scrap of paper. And I tried to dismiss from my mind a tiny detail in a disastrous landscape ‚Äî a huddle of brown down there at the map reference, where, in all likelihood, a young officer and a dozen men would be lying together dead.'"
