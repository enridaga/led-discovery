"Rupert Brooke to Jacques Raverat, April 1909: """"'I have done no 'work' for ages:  and my tripos is in a few weeks ... Ths holidays I fled from my family for long ... in a hut by a waterfall on Dartmoor, a strange fat Johnian and I 'worked' for three weeks.  He read -- oh! Aristotle, I think!  And I read the Minority Report of the Poor Law Commission; and books on Metre (I'm a poet, you know!); and Shakespere!  It was a great time.'"""" "
