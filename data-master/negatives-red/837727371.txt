"After supper read part of Tournefort's """"Voyage into the Levant"""" wherein I find the following remark: They breed (says he) the finest goats in the world in the Champaign of Angora. They are of a dazzling white, and their hair, which is fine as silk, naturally curled in locks of 8 or 9 inches long, is worked up into the finest stuffs, especially camlet. But they don't suffer these fleeces to be exported because the country people get their living thereby. Their young are degenerate if carried far.'"
