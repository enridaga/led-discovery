"As for me I am reading Wells on history! I think it wickeder than I did: but it's an amazing piece of book-making. When he gets past clerical & medieval times he's quite sound from a Left point of view till he gets to Napoleon! But [underlined] how [end underlining] jealous he is of all great men from Pericles and J. Caesar to everyone else. You see him saying: """"No! I couldn't do what Alexander did. So I'll do for [underlined] his [end underlining] reputation!"""" And the joke of it is that he damns every one of them - Solomon, Mahomet, Alexander, Julius Caesar & the rest for being untrustworthy with women! I've never seen Satan so splendidly reprove sin.'"
