"I have cast up my reading account, and brought it to the end of the year 1835.  During the last thirteen months I have read Aeschylus twice; Sophocles twice; Euripides once; Pindar twice; Callimachus; Apollonius Rhodius; Quintus Calaber; Theocritus twice; Herodotus; Thucydides; almost all Xenophon?s works; almost all Plato; Aristotle s Politics, and a good deal of his Organon, besides dipping elsewhere in him; the whole of Plutarch s Lives; about half of Lucian; two or three books of Athenaeus; Plautus twice; Terence twice; Lucretius twice; Catullus; Tibullus; Propertius; Lucan; Statius; Silius Italicus; Livy; Velleius Paterculus; Sallust; Caesar; and, lastly, Cicero.  I have, indeed, still a little of Cicero left; but I shall finish him in a few days.  I am now deep in Aristophanes and Lucian.' "
