"?In his Sir Charles Grandison, the inherent vulgarity, egotism and prolixity of Richardson?s character breakout with a latitude unexampled and uncontrolled. His personages, forever listening to or repeating their own eulogy, forever covering their own selfishness with arrogant humility, preaching forever in a monotonous key of maudlin morality, bowing on hands, and asking the benison of aunts and grandmothers, are now as flat and faded as the figures in an ancient tapestry but, like them, compensate in some measure for the dullness of the design by the fidelity of the costume.?"
