"By the time I was seventeen, my passion for reading had become so intense that a few hours [study in the public library] in the evenings seemed totally insufficient ... I started to spend odd shillings in second-hand bookshops and to keep my pockets stuffed with a volume or two for the purpose of reading when I should have been working. Chief among these first purchases were the volumes of the Everyman's Library ... A handy size for the pocket, they introduced me to Emerson's essays, Marcus Aurelius, Coleridge's <i>Biographica Literaria</i>, Carlyle, and to other writers.'"
