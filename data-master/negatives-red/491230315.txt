"Many thanks for St Ronan, by far the best that has appeared for some time,?I mean the best of Sir Walter?s, and therefore, of course, better than all others. Every now and then there is some mistaken and over-charged humour?but much excellent delineation of character,?the story very well told, and the whole very interesting. Lady Binks, the old landlady, and Touchwood are all very good. Mrs Blower particularly so. So are MacTurk and Lady Penelope.  I wish he would give his people better names: Sir Bingo Binks is quite ridiculous. I was very glad to find Dryasdust and Meg Merrilies excluded; one was never good, and the other too often good. The curtain should have dropped on finding Clara?s glove. Some of the serious scenes with Clara and her brother are very fine,?the Knife scene masterly. In her light and gay moments Clara is very vulgar; but Sir Walter always fails in well bred men and women,?and yet, who has seen more of both? and who in the ordinary intercourse of Society is better bred? Upon the whole, I call this a very successful exhibition'."
