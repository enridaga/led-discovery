"I was much better pleased with it [""""Foscari""""] than I expected, though I can truly add that my expectations were somewhat highly raised.  The interest begins at once, and continues throughout, and there are a thousand little touches of great beauty, although (and this in a drama is perhaps the best praise) there is no one passage on which I can fix as possessing a distinct and paramount superiority... In your """"Foscari"""" I find also a much greater strength than is usual from a female pen, accompanied with many a lambent spark of genuine heartfelt feeling... which none but a woman could have given.'"
