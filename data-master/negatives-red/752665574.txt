"I have been steadily & delightedly reading Mitford's History.  First of all, he is an Historian after my own heart, and I really believe a perfectly upright & honest man [...] the merit of this history is great, in proving that bad as the world is now, even under Christian regulations, it is not nationally anywhere so bad as it was in Pagan Greece - except during the height and fury of the French Revolution - and still and ever perhaps inTurkey."
