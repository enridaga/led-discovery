"Charlotte Bronte to Elizabeth Gaskell, 20 September 1851: 'Of all the articles respecting which you question me -- I have seen none except that notable one in the """"Westminister"""" on the Emancipation of Women ... When I first read the paper -- I thought it the work of a powerful-minded -- clear-headed woman ... who longed for power and had never felt affection.'"
