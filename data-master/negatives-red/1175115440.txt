"Mary Berry, Journal, October 23 1821: 'Went on a visit to Sir John and Lady Oswald.  Sir John had given me a collection of his grandfather's letters to Ministers and several distinguished persons of his day, since the years 1742 and 1767 [...] The reading of these letters, which make two large MS. books, occupied me very agreeably all the morning.'"
