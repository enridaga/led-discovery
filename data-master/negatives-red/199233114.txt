"Piercy Mallory is an extraordinary work. In character it is inimitable not in original design but in amazing strength of colouring. In nature and interest it is defective but I cannot tell you the half I would say about it in this line. The Maga. is excellent. no dross. But I think I am still most delighted with old Tim of them all. He is uniformly the first I read and Wrestliana is the very thing for me.'"
