"Arthur became interested in """"humanity"""" when he discovered George Borrow's semi-autobiographical novel """"Lavengro"""" (1851), which contains the author's adventures among gypsies; as a result Arthur began studying Romany. For the remainder of his life he was absorbed by both the gypsies and their language, perhaps because of their rootlessness and wanderings'."
