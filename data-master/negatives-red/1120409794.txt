"In the evening we all went over to the Camerons.  Several Pre-Raphaelite artists were there to meet Tennyson; Hunt and Rossetti and one or two whose names I did not gather.  Lear was there also and sang a great many of his compositions to Tennyson's words.  They are mostly very pretty things but he has no voice, and, on the whole, it is rather painful to listen to him.  When they were all gone Tennyson read us his own Morte d'Arthur, and that really was a pleasure.  It is a poem I have always been fond of.'"
