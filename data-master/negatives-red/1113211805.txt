"I had a letter from Ly. -- on Tuesday that gave me great content, for I, like you, felt a little afraid that the Lady Augusta might give offence. However, her withers are altogether unwrung, and she speaks of """"Trevelyan"""" just as I could wish, enumerating all her bothers and businesses, but saying she cannot resist taking it up at odd times, """"it is so very, very interesting!!"""" She has not yet come to the end; however, this has quite dispelled my fears. For that matter, when we all read """"Emma"""" together at poor Bothwell - the duchess one - we could not help laughing a little more at the devotion of father and daughter to their respective apothecaries, and all the coddling that ensued from it, but we did not find that it struck the devotees in existence. People are so used to themselves! One of Foote's most comical farces represented to the life a certain Mr. Ap. Rees, whom, as old people told me, it did not in the least exaggerate. They swore to having heard him utter the very things the farce put in his mouth. But he himself never found it out. He was intimate with Foote, read the play, told him it was d- stupid and would not suceed, wondered it did, yet went to it and laughed for company, till some good-natured friend informed him he was the person ridiculed; then he went in a rage to the Lord Chamberlain and desired it might be suppressed'."
