"I am particularly glad to have, from you, your new book, with its inscription.  I thank you very much.  For years I have known a number of your friends, and of course I have been reading your books for a long time; so that I feel that somehow we ought to have been acquainted before this.  What pleases me particularly in a book like """"The New Pretexts"""" (I had already read a great deal of it in reviews etc.) is the proof it offers that an artist is interesting himself in the daily guerrilla of literature.'
