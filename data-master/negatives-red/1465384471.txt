"I sat up till two, as I did last night, to finish """"Pride and Prejudice"""".  This novel I consider as one of the most excellent of the works of our female novelists. Its merits lie in the characters, and in the perfectly colloquial style of the dialogue. Mrs. Bennet, the foolish mother, who cannot conceal her projects to get rid of her daughters, is capitally drawn.  There is a thick-headed servile parson, also a masterly sketch.  His stupid letters and her ridiculous speeches are as delightful as wit.  The two daughters are well contrasted - the gentle and candid Jane and the lively but prejudiced Elizabeth, are both portraits, and the development of the passion between Elizabeth and the proud Darcy, who at first hate each other, is executed with skill and effect.'"
