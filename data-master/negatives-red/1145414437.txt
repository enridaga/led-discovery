"Finished reading """"Anarcho-Syndicalism"""" by Rudolph Roeber. This is my introduction to Anarchism, and I find that there is something in its basic recognition of the living struggle of the people which essentially appeals to me. It has an element of humanness which seems lacking in Marx-Leninism, but at present I am not qualified to compare and contrast the two.'"
