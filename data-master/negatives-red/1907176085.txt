"As a collier [Joseph Keating]... heard a co-worker sigh, """"Heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate"""". Keating was stunned: """"You are quoting Pope"""". """"Ayh"""", replied his companion, """"me and Pope do agree very well"""". Keating had himself been reading Pope, Fielding, Smollett, Goldsmith and Richardson in poorly printed paperbacks. Later he was reassigned to a less demanding job at a riverside colliery pumping station, which allowed him time to tackle Swift, Sheridan, Byron, Keats, Shelley and Thackeray'."
