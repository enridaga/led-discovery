"Mary Berry to Mrs Cholmeley, 12 January 1799: 'Somerville's """"Anne"""" is, I think, more dry than his """"William,"""" but clear, distinct, impartial, and wonderfully informing; his chapters on the Union of Scotland are particularly so [goes on to note aspects of Scottish situation during Queen Anne's reign, including rebellious elements ('of none of which circumstances I had before any just idea') and to compare this with current situation in Ireland]'."
