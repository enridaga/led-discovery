"I have read """"Ronald"""" with great care and much pleasure I think it is the most [italics] spirited [end italics] poem Scott ever wrote - He has availed himself of his particular forte, a kind of easy elastick rapidity which never once flags from beginning to end. It is a pity that the tale should be again butched the two females are but a clog upon it, and no one natural occurrence connected with them takes place - I likewise expected some finer bursts of feeling with regard to Scottish independence - the coaxing apology to England is below any Scot to have uttered - But these are quite subordinate matters and can never materially affect the poem and I have not a doubt, tho' the public seem to be receiving it with select caution, that it will finally succeed to the author's highest anticipation - If it do not none of his ever deserved to do so which is enough for you and me'"
