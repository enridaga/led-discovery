"I have read through the 12 lessons of the Literary Correspondence College, & made a few corrections & suggestions, & I return them by parcel post.  They are devilish good.  But it is impossible to deny that they [italics] are [end italics] my book.  There is not, I think, a single sentence in all the lessons that is not my ipsissima verba.  And beyond the chapters on journalism, verse etc, there is nothing in my book which is not in these lessons.  In a word, the twelve lessons are simply my book split up and typewritten.'"
