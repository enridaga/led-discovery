"Byron to the Editor of Galingani's Messenger, 27 April 1819: 'Sir, -- In various numbers of your Journal -- I have seen mentioned a work entitled """"The Vampire"""" with the addition of my name as that of the Author. -- I am not the author and never heard of the work in question until now. In a more recent paper I perceive a formal annunciation of """"the Vampire"""" with the addition of an account of my """"residence in the Island of Mitylene"""" ... which [island] I have occasionaly sailed by ... but where I have never yet resided.'
