"Mary Berry to Anne Damer, from Tunbridge, 1811: 'I read a great deal every morning, and indeed often of an evening [...] I am more delighted with Mrs. Hutchinson [i.e. Lucy Hutchinson's """"Memoirs of Colonel Hutchinson""""] than with any book I have read for an age.  She was a really superior woman, both as to head and heart.  Her description and account of her husband's attachment to her is the truest, the most elevated and admirable picture of love and true affection from and to a superior mind that can be imagined.' "
