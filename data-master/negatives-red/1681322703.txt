"Byron to James Perry, editor of the Morning Chronicle, 5 October 1814: 'Sir -- I perceive in your paper this day the contradiction of a paragraph copied from the Durham paper announcing the intended marriage of Ld. B. with Miss M[ilbank]e. -- How the paragraph came into the Durham or the other papers I know not -- but as it is founded on fact -- I will be much obliged if you will inform me -- who instructed you to contradict this?'"
