"William Wordsworth to Lady Beaumont, 20 November 1811: 'Do you see the Courier newspaper at Dunmow?  I ask on account of a little poem upon the comet, which I have read in it to-day.  Though with several defects ... it has great merit, and is far superior to the run not merely of newspaper but of modern poetry in general.  I half suspect it to be Coleridge's ... I know of no other writer of the day who can so so well.  It consists of five stanzas, in the measure of the Fairy Queen.  It is to be found in last Saturday's paper, November 16th.  If you don't see the Courier, we will transcribe it for you.' "
