"Gratifying letter from John Fossett: """"Very many thanks for two instalments of diary.  Joan and I derived hours of pleasure from reading it aloud to each other.  How we laughted about the Mulberry Tree. We passed it over to the RAF and how they enjoyed it. It seemed like being at home again as we lived through your experiences.'"
