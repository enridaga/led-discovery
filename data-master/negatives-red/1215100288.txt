"I' wonder if you ever read Dickens?s [italics] Christmas Books [end italics] ? I don?t know that I would recommend you to read them, because they are too much perhaps. I have only read two of them yet, and I have cried my eyes out, and had a terrible fight not to sob. But O, dear God, they are [italics] good [end italics] &#8722; and, I feel so good after them, and would do anything, yet and shall do anything, to make it a little better for people. I want to go out and comfort someone; I shall never listen to the nonsense they tell one, about not giving money &#8722;I [italics] shall [end italics] give money; not that I haven?t done so always, but I shall do it with a high hand now. O what a jolly thing it is for a man to have written books like these books, and just [italics] filled [end italics] people?s hearts with pity.'"
