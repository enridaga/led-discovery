"[Betsey Wynne:] We read this evening """"Les Femmes Savantes"""" and """"Les Precieuses Ridicules"""" of the Theatre of Moliere. I thought I should die from laughing in hearing the latter piece which is as amusing as it is possible to be. [Eugenia Wynne] Mr de Regis read to us and made all the possible faces for Mascarille. I find that France has made a great loss when Moliere died. It is said that he died during an acting of """"Le Malade Imaginaire"""", one of his own pieces for in straining to make himself appear the more natural he burst a vein in his chest and died a few hours after. It is wearying that such a superior talent as that which was possessed by Moliere should not be immortal. Excellent author! better poet! Who has more glorified the amiable Thalia? What more can one desire?'."
