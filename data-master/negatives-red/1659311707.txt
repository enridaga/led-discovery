"Sir Uvedale Price to Mary Berry, 29 March 1814: 'Since I wrote to you last, I have read """"L'Allemagne,"""" not in the usual way of reading, [italics]car je ne commencais pas, par le commencement[end italics].  My neighbour Peploe, who has read it, called upon me just as I had received it.  He told me the first volume was highly entertaining; the second less so [...] the third very abstruse [...] He liked, however, particular parts [...] He told me, at the same time, that the subject of the third volume was distinct from those of the other two, being entirely on German philosophy.  Upon this information, Lady Caroline [Carpenter] and my daughter having eagerly seized on the first volume, I began with the third, in which I found so many new and striking thoughts and reflections that, in order to recollect and dwell upon them again, I marked them as I went on [...] I have now returned again to the first, and am reading the whole through [italics]de suite[end italics], and I find great pleasure in reading on without interruption, and great pleasure also in observing, [italics]en passant[end italics], the passages I had marked'."
