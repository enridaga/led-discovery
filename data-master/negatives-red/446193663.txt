"At one time I knew entire pages of """"Madame Bovary"""" by heart. But if """"Madame Bovary"""" is a masterpiece """"Salammb√¥"""" is close to a miracle. I well remember that when I was writing """"[The]N[igger]of [the] N[arcissus]"""", """"Salammb√¥"""" was my morning book.While taking coffee I would read a page or two at random--and there is hardly a page that isn't marvellous.'"
