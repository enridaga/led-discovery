"His """"Vanity of Human Wishes"""" has less of common life, but more of a philosophick dignity than his """"London"""". More readers, therefore, will be delighted with the pointed spirit of """"London"""", than with the profound reflection of """"The Vanity Of Human Wishes"""". Garrick, for instance, observed in his sprightly manner, with more vivacity than regard to just discrimination, as is usual with wits, """"When Johnson lived much with the Herveys, and saw a good deal of what was passing in life, he wrote his 'London', which is lively and easy. When he became more retired, he gave us his 'Vanity of Human Wishes', which is as hard as Greek. Had he gone on to imitate another satire, it would have been as hard as Hebrew"""".'"
