"Dorothy Wordsworth describes receiving only 'two last volumes' of 'Mr Clarkson's Book': 'we may yet have to wait a fortnight or three weeks for the other [received by William Wordsworth at a separate address (Basil Montagu's)] ... We have determined not to read the Book till we can begin at the beginning, so I have done little more than turn over the leaves ... I think it is a very well-looking Book, with enough of stuff in each page, not too large margins, and a good type.  As to the matter, it looks very nice, (I have heard you say that you can judge of a book in turning over the leaves) and I have read some very sweetly written bits.'"
