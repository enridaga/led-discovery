"I found a good deal of amusement in looking over the engravings in a Spanish volume, called, I think, """"The Visions of Don Quevedo"""". It was, of course, a book from which I could get but little information in the way of reading. The plates, however, told a tolerably clear story, and my host, who had learned something of the Spanish language, gave me such explanations as were necessary to my fully comprehending the meaning of the illustrations.'"
