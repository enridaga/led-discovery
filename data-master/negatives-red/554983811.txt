"I was soon able to make my way in a volume of tales by Herder, Lessing , and others.  My school prospered for I took care to attend to its duties assiduously; and yet kept firm hold of my studies, rising early in the morning, and, with my book in my hand, as of old, walked from our little home in St. Mary's Street, along the Sincil Dyke, and on to Canwick Common, whenever weather permitted me to do so."
