"We quite run over with Books.  She [JA's mother] has got Sir John Carr's Travels in Spain from Miss B. & I am reading a Society-Octavo, an Essay on the Military Police & Institutions of the British Empire, by Capt. Pasley of the Engineers, a book which I protested against at first, but which upon trial I find delightfully written & highly entertaining.  I am as much in love with the Author as I ever was with Clarkson or Buchanan, or even the two Mr Smiths of the city.  The first soldier I ever sighed for; but he does write with extraordinary force & spirit.'"
