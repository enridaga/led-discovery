"Finished reading A.C. Bradley's """"Shakespearean Tragedy"""", which has lain unread for 20 years: a work of profound penetration. Not only has it taught me much about Shakespeare; but its analysis of those values which underlie Shakespeare's tragic conception has in some measure confirmed my own convictions embodied in """"But the Earth Abideth"""".'"
