"In December 1810 a box of books arrived and the family began to read a novel which they """"liked very much"""". This book is """"Modern Philosophy"""", whose anti-heroine, """"Miss Biddy Botherin"""", who made them """"laugh a good deal"""", is a devotee of radical Godwinian philosophy, a satirical portrait probably combining elements of Mary Hays and Mary Wollstonecraft.' [Grove is resisting her then-fiance Shelley's philosophy and aesthetics]."
