"Byron to John Sheppard, who had sent him a prayer apparently written for him (Byron) by his (Sheppard's) late wife, 8 December 1821: """"I have received yr. letter ... the Extract which it contains has affected me ... it would imply a want of all feeling to have read it with indifference ... for whomever it was meant [this apparently uncertain] -- I have read it with all the pleasure  which can arise from so melancholy a topic."""""
