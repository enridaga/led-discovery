"Mr. Elphinston talked of a new book that was much admired, and asked Dr. Johnson if he had read it. Johnson. """"I have looked into it."""" """"What (said Elphinston), have you not read it through?"""" Johnson, offended at being thus pressed, and so obliged to own his cursory mode of reading, answered tartly, """"No, sir; do [italics] you [end italics] read books [italics] through [end italics]?""""'"
