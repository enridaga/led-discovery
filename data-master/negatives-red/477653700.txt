"You do not mention Madame Roland, therefore I am not sure whether you have read her; if you have only read her in the translation which talks of her uncle Bimont's dying of a fit of the gout translated to his chest, you have done her injustice. We think some of her Memoirs beautifully written and like Rousseau; she was a great woman and died heroically. I think if I had been Mons Roland I should not have shot myself for her sake.'"
