"I believe your Ladiship will be diverted with an Octavo book on the Writings and Genius of Pope; tho' you will not approve of everything in it. A little Vol. intitled, """"Christian Morals"""", by Sir Thomas Browne of Norwich, Author of """"Religio Medici"""", with his Life and Explanatory Notes, by S. Johnson, Author of the Rablers, will, I believe, amuse you. There is a third Book written by Mr G[reville], a Man of Fashion, intitled, """"Maxims, Characters"""" or some such Title. Among his Subjects, he takes to Task (to severe Task, some have thought) the Writings of your Humble Servt. Thus I wrote upon it to a Lady, who was unwilling I should see it, for fear it shd. vex me; a Fear several of my Friends had on the same Account; """"I have read Mr G[reville's] Censure of the Writings of a [italics] certain Author [ end italics]. I sincerely think there may be Justice in the most unfavourable Part of it.""""'"
