"I have just read DH Lawrence's """"Kangaroo"""". How I hated (in italics) it! Altho I think the Chapter about the War is well written, but it is so full of Spite, bitterness & nasty """"cur"""" like ( in italics) snarly feeling. Odd again, for I never saw that side of him. have you read his """"Letters""""?'"
