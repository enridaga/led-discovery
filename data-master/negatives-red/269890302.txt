"When at home I usually retired to my garret, where I employed myself in either reading or working... In reading I usually sat in the Oriental, or, to use a less pompous word, in the tailor's posture, and thus had no need of either chair or table... The books I read at this time related chiefly to North America. Among the chief of them were Ramsay's """"History of the American Revolution"""", Smith's """"Travels in Canada and the United States"""", and Parkinson's """"Travels in North America"""".'"
