"Leslie A. Marchand notes regarding 1812 letter in which Byron mentions sending a book (possibly Childe Harold's Pilgrimage) to Lady Caroline Lamb 'which [she] is not to look at till Mr. Lamb has first gone through it for there is one passage which I have doubts whether it would be proper for ladies to see': '... according to Caroline she had read a copy [of Childe Harold], loaned by [Samuel] Rogers, before she met Byron.'"
