"Lady Theresa Lewis's note to a reference in Mary Berry's journals to The Honourable Caroline Howe (who died in 1814, aged 93): 'She possessed an extraordinary force of mind, clearness of understading, and remarkable powers of thought and combination.  She retained these faculties unimpaired to the great age of eighty-five, by exercising them daily, both in the practice of mathematics and in reading the two dead languages, of which late in life she had made herself mistress.'"
