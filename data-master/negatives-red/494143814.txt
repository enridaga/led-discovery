"He [George Gissing] recommended [in letters to his siblings] books like Morris's """"Earthly Paradise"""", a poem """"abounding in the quaintest archaisms""""; Ruskin's """"Unto this last"""", which Gissing liked as a """"contribution to - or rather onslaught upon - Political Economy""""; Landor's """"Imaginary Conversations"""", for its """"perfect prose""""; and Scott's """"Redgauntlet"""", for the romantic situations of which he must """"try to find parallel kinds in modern life"""". Gissing kept up the habit throughout his life: he was always reading and always recommending books to his friends and family. In the early 1880s he read a lot of German, and to his brother, Algernon, particularly recommended Eckerman's """"Conversations with Goethe"""", """"a most delightful book"""". Meanwhile his sister, Margaret, was reading Schiller under his direction'."
