"Thank you for your letter and the """"Revue [des deux Mondes""""], which I  received two days ago. I have read """"La Madone [de Busowska]"""" and am pleased to have read it in French and in your adaptation, for I think it must be tiring indeed in Polish if [Ladislas] Lozinski - like the others - is in the habit of """"marking time"""" as you put it. Naturally I do not find there the """"relief"""", the distinct style one finds in """"Yaga"""", but I recognise with very great pleasure the language, style, indeed almost all the purely literary pleasure  the reading of """"Yaga"""" gave me. The fact is that, restored in appetite (if I may express myself so), I have just reread """"Yaga""""-which I like more than ever.'   "
