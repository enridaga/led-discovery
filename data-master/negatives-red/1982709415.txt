"""""If I were in the vein, I think I should exhort you above all to read George Sand, whose country stories seem to me perfect & have a certain affinity to yours. The last I read was the [Les] Maitres Sonneurs wh... I commend to you as wellnigh perfect. You could do something of the kind, though I won't flatter you by saying that I think you could equal her in her own line - I don't think anyone could. But the harmony & grace even if strictly inimitable are good to aim at."""""
