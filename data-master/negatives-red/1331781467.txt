"The Dr [Brewster] stopped to tell me that he had got a paper on Chemistry written (in French) by Berzelius, professor of that science in Stockholm - which was to be published in April:- would I translate it?  I answered in the affirmative; and next day went over to get the paper in question.  It consists of six long sheets, written in a cramp hand, & in a very diffuse [s]tile.  I have it more than half done.  The labour of writing it down is the principal one.  In other respects there is no difficulty.'"
