"I dreaded lest the Prof: should involve anything with M. Heger - I had heard her say it related to her Brussels life, - & I thought if he were again brought before the public, what would he think of me? [Gaskell goes on to say that her fears were not fulfilled] so on that ground there would be no objection to publishing it. I don't think it will add to her reputation, - the interest will arise from its being the work of so remarkable a mind. It is an autobiography of a man the English Professor at a Brussels school, - there are one or two remarkable portraits - the most charming woman  she ever drew, and a glimpse of that woman as a mother - very lovely; otherwise little or no story; & disfigured by more coarseness - & profanity in quoting texts of Scripture disagreeably than in any of her other works.'"
