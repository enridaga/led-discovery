"My dear Charlie, I‚Äôm a rogue and should have written to you months ago; but I have been both busy and worried. As to your paper, no, it won‚Äôt do: you ask an opinion, and I am not so silly as to think you are afraid to hear it. [‚Ä¶] Why will it not do? Well, first, it‚Äôs not well enough written; it‚Äôs off its feet here and there. [‚Ä¶] The point is this. It‚Äôs not <i>enough about anything</i>. It‚Äôs in the air, like a kite. In the last resort, experience, whether about life or a man‚Äôs own mind, is the only thing worth hearing, indeed is the only thing anyone can have to tell upon his own authority. [A lengthy passage follows, urging C.R. to give up theoretical writing for the moment and concentrate on observing his own, C.R.‚Äôs, firsthand experiences and conveying his own vivid, detailed impressions of them and thoughts about them in his own words, as Stevenson himself has learned to do by painful trial and error.]"
