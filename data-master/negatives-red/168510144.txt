"He [Owen] bought Monro's latest collection """"Strange Meetings"""" (1917), with its interesting title, and """"Georgian Poetry 1916-1917"""". This new volume of the anthology, published by the Bookshop in November, included work by Sassoon, Graves, Monro, Robert Nichols, John Masefield, W.W. Gibson, Walter de la Mare and John Drinkwater. Owen eventually possessed at least fifteen volumes by these Georgians and their original leader, Brooke; this was by far the largest representation of modern verse in his shelves, and most of it was bought and read in November-December 1917.'"
