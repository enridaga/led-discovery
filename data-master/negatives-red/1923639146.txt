"When I talked of our [the Scots'] advancement in literature, """"Sir, (said he,) you have learnt a little from us, and you think yourselves very great men. Hume would never have written History, had not Voltaire written it before him. He is an echo of Voltaire."""" Boswell """"But, Sir, we have Lord Kames."""" Johnson. """"You [italics] have [italics] Lord &#1050;ames. Keep him; ha, ha, ha! We don't envy you him. Do you ever see Dr. Robertson?"""" Boswell. """"Yes, Sir."""" Johnson. """"Does the dog talk of me ?"""" Boswell. """"Indeed, Sir, he does, and loves you."""" Thinking that I now had him in a corner, and being solicitous for the literary fame of my country, I pressed him for his opinion on the merit of Dr. Robertson's """"History of Scotland"""". But, to my surprise, he escaped.‚Äî"""" Sir, I love Robertson, and I won't talk of his book.""""'"
