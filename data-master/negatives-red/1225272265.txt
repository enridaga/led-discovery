"""""The words I didn't understand I just skipped over, yet managed to get a good idea of what the story was about"""", wrote James Murray, the son of a Scottish shoemaker. """"By the time I was ten or eleven years old I did not need to skip any words in any books because by then I had a good grounding in roots and derivations"""". Crusoe so aroused his appetite for literature that, when his school teacher asked the class to list all the books they had read, Murray rattled off titles by Ballantyne, Kingston and Dickens until """"I realised the eyes of everyone in the room were on me...""""'"
