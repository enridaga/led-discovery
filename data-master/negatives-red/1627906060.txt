"The British officers formed a circulating library, and it was always possible to get any number of the Tauchnitz books in English and in French. There was no lack of reading material, but there was a tendency for other people to borrow your book before you had finished with it, and if anyone lost a volume that he had brought out, he had nothing to exchange for another ... many books were also sent to officers from home, and generally arrived safely.'"
