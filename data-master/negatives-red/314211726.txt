"Pardon a word of unsolicited criticism about your venture.  I think the contents are pretty creditable, but I think that the material presentation leaves something to be desired.  The page is not good, and the type is entirely without distinction.  . . . Taken as a whole, the mere look of the review is extremely disappointing‚Äîeven to the sinister colour of the cover."
