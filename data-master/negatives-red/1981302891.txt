"The Lawrence is magnificent.  Pity he is falling more & more into the trick of repeating a word or a phrase.  It irritates the reader & enfeebles the sturff.  Also the connection between trees & human beings is not very strong.  But really this article is the goods.  The Tomlinson article is also magnificent.  Not better stuff than this is being done.  The K.M. story is excellently characteristic.  Mr. Joiner is good; it halts at the beginning.  . . .  I think the number is simply splendid‚Äîespecially for a first number. & you are to be seriously & gravely congratulated upon it.  "
