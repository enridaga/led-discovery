"In various letters to Osborne he mentions having received """"Tom Jones"""" which he did not care for; """"Jane Eyre"""" he thought a """"wonderful book""""; in a volume titled """"British Dramatists"""" he thought Webster's """"The Duchess of Malfi"""" """"the best by head and shoulders""""; Carlyle's """"Heroes and Hero Worship"""" he admired """"exceedingly"""" (he proceeded to write an essay of twenty-six notepaper pages on Carlyle); of Thackeray's """"Henry Esmond"""" he told Osborne that he thought it a """"great book"""", though he disliked its """"overelaboration"""": """"perhaps you may say it is merely an additional grace - but I think it stands rather in the way of true eloquence and geninely forceful tragedy, not that I deny there is both eloquence and tragedy in 'Esmond', but I think there might have been more and grander but for that elaborateness"""".'
