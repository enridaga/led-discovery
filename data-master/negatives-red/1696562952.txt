"I think very highly of both the books you have sent me but far most highly of Lights and Shadows in which there is a great deal of very powerful effect purity of sentiment and fine writing but with very little of real nature as it exists in the walks of Scottish life The feelings and language of the author are those of Romance Still it is a fine and beautiful work.'"
