"I have read the 'bright city' and rejoiced to find your criticism of it so agreeable to my own.  Milman is certainly a poet, but he takes a flight higher than he can sustain.  He paints too gorgeously and indistinctly, he also whines too much, he is sometimes even liable to cant.  I am astonished at your diffidence in judging him: it were well if he always found even critics by profession so well qualified.'"
