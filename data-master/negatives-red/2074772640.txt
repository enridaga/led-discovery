"The novels of John Galt were always much to my taste. I fancy I have read every book that came from his pen, including his """"Lives of players"""", and once every year I peruse """"Sir Andrew Wyllie""""; also that most realistic production, the """"Annals of the Parish"""": both books undeserving of the neglect which has befallen them.'"
