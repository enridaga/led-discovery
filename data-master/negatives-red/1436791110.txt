"Henry James to the Earl of Lovelace, 14 January 1906: 'I left home at Christmas for a few weeks' stay, which became a fortnight's absence, and, on my return a week ago, found the very handsome, remarkable and interesting volume [""""Astarte"""", Lovelace's account of his grandmother's marriage to Byron] which you had been so good as to send me.  I wished to take real possession of it before having the pleasure of thanking you, and have now done so by a very attentive, and in fact fascinated perusal.'"
