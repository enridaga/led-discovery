"William Wordsworth to Captain Charles Pasley, 28 March 1811: 'Now for your book.  I had expected it with great impatience, and desired a Friend to send it down to me immediately on its appearance, which he neglected to do.  On this account, I did not see it till a few days ago. I have read it through twice, with great care, and many parts three or four times over.'"
