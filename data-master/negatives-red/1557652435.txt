"Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal, 24 December 1802: 'William is now sitting by me, at 1/2 past 10 o'clock.  I have been beside him ever since tea running the heel of a stocking, repeating some of his own sonnets to him, listening to his own repeating, reading some of Milton's, and the Allegro and Penseroso.'"
