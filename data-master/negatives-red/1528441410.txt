"[Patrick McGill] read virtually nothing, not even the daily papers until, working on the rail line, he happened to pick up some poetry written on a page from an exercise book. Somehow it spoke to him and he began to read """"ravenously"""". He brought """"Sartor Resartus"""", """"Sesame and Lilies"""" and Montaigne's essays to work. """"Les Miserables"""" reduced him to tears, though he found """"Das Kapital"""" less affecting. Each payday he set aside a few shillings to buy secondhand books, which after a month's use were almost illegible with rust, grease and dirt....[eventually he] went on to become a popular novelist.'"
