"I read several chapters of Miss Berry's work, a Comparative View of the English and French Nations, since the time of Charles II to the present day. I think this work a most sterling performance, and one, from the nature of its subject, as well as the grave and masterly way in which she treats it, likely to do honour to her memory. I hear Miss Berry has been reproached with its being too grave; but I think the sober chastened style in which it is written suits the dignity of the matter. A lighter pen might have found [italics] de quoi [end italics] to have made a continuation of that most amusing and immoral work, the Memoires de Grammont; but where a deeper tone of thought induces a higher aim than mere wit and entertainment, surely she has chosen more appropriate means to attain her object'."
