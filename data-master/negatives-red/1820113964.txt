"[Letter from Jonathan Swift, Pilkington having sent him her verses on paper - printed in a London newspaper, attributed to another, and a poem for his birthday] 'I send you your Bit of News-paper with the Verses, than which I never saw better in their Kind; I have the same Opinion of those you were pleased to write upon me, as have also some particular Friends of Genius and Taste, to whom I ventured to communicate them, who universally agree with me.'"
