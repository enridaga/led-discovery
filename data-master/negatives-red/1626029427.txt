"Finished not only the whole of Synesius?s poems, but four odes of Gregory, contained in the same little volume.  And yet I really read nothing superficially.  There is a great deal in Synesius which is very fine.  He stands on a much higher step than Gregory does, as a poet; tho? occasional diffuseness is the fault of each.  I like the 7th. hymn extremely.  A slip of paper in the first leaf, tells me that in Mr. Boyd?s opinion the 1st. 5th. & 6th. are perhaps the finest, next to the 9th.  I wd. lay a very strong emphasis on perhaps.  The 9th. is, I agree with him, decidedly the finest."
