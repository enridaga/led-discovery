"I went to one of my clubs to have some tea, and look - but with little hope - for a novel really attractive to me after having finished """"Mrs Arthur"""", and then - a happy surprise, for I had never been prepared for it by any advertisement - I found awaiting me """"Carita""""! As far as I have gone I like it immensely.'"
