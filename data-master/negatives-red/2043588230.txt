"I sent about a fortnight ago, three of your papers to Austin Harrison [...] the present  editor of the E[nglish] R[eview]. [...] The """"[The]Headland of Minerva"""" and the """"Caves of [the]S[iren Land]"""" I just cut in half. The """"Upland[s] of Sorrento"""" I sent whole. I did this to give your prose a better chance  for they are everlastingly cramped for room in that Review. Of course I didn't touch the text.'"
