"[Harry] McShane began his education in Marxism by reading Justice and The Socialist, the respective organs of the Social Democratic Federation and the Socialist Labour Party. But the former, he found, preached a """"narrow stupid Marxism"""",while the latter printed page after grey page on the materialist conception of history. Even with A.P. Hazell's penny pamphlet, A Summary of Marx's 'Capital', it took him a full week to master the labour theory of value. Like most working-class readers he preferred Blatchford's Clarion, where an unideological socialism was leavened with breezy articles on literature, freethought and science'."
