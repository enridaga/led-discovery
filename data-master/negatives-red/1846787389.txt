"?In your last ? letter you spoke very highly of Ecce Homo. To say the truth I don?t agree in your estimate ? partly because the book seemed to me to be feeble rhetorically, but partly, it may be, from another cause. I cannot look upon theological dogmas with the same kind of indifference that you do. ? Now ?Ecce Homo? may be amiable & enthusiastic & all that; but in a theological point of view, it is to me hateful. It is a feeble attempt to make sentimental oratory do the work of logic, & to supersede all criticism by a sort of a priori gush of enthusiasm.? "
