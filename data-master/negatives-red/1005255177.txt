"??now, being able to read, I had almost continually the Testament in my hand. I had all the wondrous accounts in the Revelations, and my father, not a little pleased, would at times sit down, and in his way explain the meaning of the strange things about which I read. After I had gone through the Revelations, I began with the Gospel of Saint Matthew, and was deeply interested by the miracles, sufferings and death of our Lord. The New Testament was now my shiny book, and I read it all through and through, but more for the interest the marvellous passages excited, than from any religious impression which they caused.?"
