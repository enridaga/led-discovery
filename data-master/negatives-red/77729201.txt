"I have had a letter from Mrs Montague and, (which is still more extraordinary) I have answered it. What on earth did you say, to make her so good to me?  She could not have written more frankly and affectionately if I had been her own child.  I have never met with any thing like this from Woman before- I purpose loving Mrs Montague all my life; if I find her always the same as she has introduced herself to me.'"
