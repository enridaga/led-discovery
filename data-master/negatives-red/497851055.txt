"Harriet Martineau, recalling acquaintances of her youth: 'Mr. Hallam one day called, when, as it was the first day of the month, my table was spread with new periodicals, sent me by publishers.  I was not in the room when Mr. Hallam entered; and I found him with the """"Monthly Repository"""" in his hands, turning over the pages.  He pointed to the Editor's name (Mr. Fox) on the cover, and asked me some questions about him.  After turning over, and remarking upon a few others, he sat down for a chat.' "
