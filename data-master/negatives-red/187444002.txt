"Harriet Martineau to Elizabeth Pease, 27 February 1841: 'I have read the statements in """"Right and Wrong among the Abolitionists of the United States"""", with respect to the differences between the two antislavery societies in America, with a strong and painful interest [...] I am not more firmly persuaded of anything, than that those who [...] listen to one side only, or refuse to hear either, are doing the deepest injury in their power to the antislavery cause'."
