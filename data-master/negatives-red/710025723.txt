"[Marginalia in Keats's annotated copy of """"Paradise Lost"""", Book 3, Lines 51-9]: The management of this Poem is Apollonian. Satan first """"throws round his baleful eyes"""", then awakes his legions, he consults, he sets forward on his voyage - and just as he is getting to the end of it we see the Great God and our first parent, and that same satan all brought in one's vision - we have the invocation to light before we mount to heaven - we breathe more freely - we feel the great Author's consolations coming thick upon him at a time when he complains most - we are getting ripe for diversity - the immediate topic of the Poem opens with a grand Perspective of all concerned.'"
