"I am extremely obliged to you for the pacquet of Miss Bronte's letters which I found here on my return home, too late for Friday's post for me to acknowledge them. I have read them hastily over and I like the tone of them very much; it is curious how much the spirit in which she writes varies according to the correspondent whom she was addressing, I imagine. I like the series of letters which you have sent better than any other excepting one that I have seen. The subjects too are very interesting; how beautifully she speaks (for instance) of her wanderings on the moor after her sister's death.'"
