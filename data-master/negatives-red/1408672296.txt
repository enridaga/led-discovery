"[Marginalia in Keats's annotated copy of """"Paradise Lost"""", Book 4, lines 1-5] Keats underlines the lines: """"O for that warning voice, which he who saw/ The Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud,/ Then when the Dragon put to second rout,/ Came furious down to be revenged on men,"""". He writes: 'A friend of mine says this Book has the finest opening of any - the point of time is gigantically critical - the wax is melted, the seal is aobut to be applied - and Milton breaks out, """"O for that warning voice,"""" etc. There is moreover an opportunity for a Grandeur of Tenderness - the opportunity is not lost. Nothing can be higher - Nothing so more than delphic.'"
