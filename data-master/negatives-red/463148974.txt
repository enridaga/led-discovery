" [Letter from Boswell to Johnson] Your critical notes on the specimen of Lord Hailes's """"Annals of Scotland"""" are excellent. I agreed with you on every one of them. He himself objected only to the alteration of [italics] free [end italics] to [italics] brave [end italics], in the passage where he says that Edward """"departed with the glory dne to the conqueror of a free people"""". He says to call the Scots brave would only add to the glory of their conqueror. You will make allowance for the national zeal of our annalist. I now send a few more leaves of the """"Annals"""", which I hope you will peruse, and return with observations, as you did upon the former occasion. Lord Hailes writes to me thus: """"Mr. Boswell will be pleased to express the grateful sense which Sir David Dalrymple has of Dr. Johnson's attention to his little specimen"""".'"
