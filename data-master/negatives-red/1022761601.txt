"Mary Berry, Journal, 25 August 1810, on visit of the Princess of Wales to Strawberry Hill: 'The Princess was very lively, though the company was certainly not very amusing for her.  She remained long at table, then walked and sat in the garden, and afterwards looked at some books of engravings; and was sufficiently amused to remain till twelve o'clock'."
