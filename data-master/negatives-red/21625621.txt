"I have been reading """"Emma"""".  Everything Miss Austen writes is clever, but I desiderate something.  There is a want of [italics] body [close italics] to the story.  The action is frittered away in over-little things.  There are some beautiful things in it. Emma herself is the most interesting to me of all her heroines.  I feel kind to her whenever I think of her.  But Miss Austen has no romance - none at all.  What vile creatures her parsons are! she has not a dream of the high Catholic ethos. That other woman, Fairfax is a dolt - but I like Emma.'"
