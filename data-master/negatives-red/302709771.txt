"Detailed summary of notes on front inside cover, flyleaf, title page, half-title page, first page of text, and rear inside cover. Very heavily annotated, with marginalia in both English and German throughout. This book was also read by Mario Calderoni and his marginal annotations are also evident. Read by Vernon Lee in March 1913 and re-read in 1920."
