"A Lady of Norfolk, by a letter to my friend Dr. Burney, has favoured me with the following solution [to the question of why the St Kildans always got a cold when visited by outsiders]: """"Now for the explication of this seeming mystery, which is so very obvious as, for that reason, to have escaped the penetration of Dr. Johnson and his friend, as well as that of the author. Reading the book with my ingenions friend, the late Reverend Mr. Christian of Docking‚Äîafter ruminating a little, 'The cause, (says he,) is a natural one: The situation of St. Kilda renders a North-East wind indispensably necessary before a stranger can land. The wind, not the stranger, occasions an epidemick cold'.""""'"
