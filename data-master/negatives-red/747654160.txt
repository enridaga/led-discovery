"Sometimes I try if I can talk in that Jargon I us'd to hear but I cannot endure it & the remembrance of what you said puts all they say out--so that men hate me--today at Murrays I heard one read--& it made me sick so did the poem-it is Rogers's.  I wish I thought it pretty it affects to [simplicite villagoise?] & the lines about thrushes & love love love--or the manner in which it was read vex'd me--because I wish to admire it'."
