"At 3 1/4 down the old bank to the library. Miss Maria Browne there. Came up to me to say her sister had so bad a cold [...] she could not possibly stir out today [...] I walked slowly up Royston Rd [...] went up, found Miss Browne, not perhaps quite so unwell as I expected, sitting on the sopha reading the last canto of Childe Harold. Would not let her send for her mother till I had sat 40 minutes tete-a-tete with herself."
