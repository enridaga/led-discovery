"Now that we had gas I found it much easier and pleasanter to read. When I had read all my own periodicals I used to read Mother's literature. Sometimes she bought a novelette; the """"Heartsease Library"""" was one, a penny per week. She was in the public library, too. I read """"The Channings"""" by Mrs Henry Wood, and """"Lady Audley's Secret"""" by Miss Braddon, and others by these two who were my mother's favourite authors.'"
