"We have just finished the 1st of the 3 Books I had the pleasure of receiving yesterday; I read it aloud - & we are all very much amused, & like the work quite as well as ever. - I depend on getting through another book before dinner, but there is really a great deal of respectable reading in your 48 pages. I was an hour about it. - I have no doubt that 6 will make a very good sized volume.'"
