"I was very soon interrupted by a sergeant of the Royal Fusiliers, who brought me a message ... from their C.O. to ours. He stumbled over the pillow (the baggage end of my valise and very hard) and woke up the C.O. who did not seem to take much notice. Soon however he saw me light the men's lantern to read the message, and was all alive again as he always is when there is anything doing.'"
