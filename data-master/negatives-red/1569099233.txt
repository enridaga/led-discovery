"I entirely deprecate your opinion concerning Manwaring [sic--Mannering] or sooner the opinion you had borrowed for I am convinced if you had read it through or even half you would have admired it excessively--I judge by myself who never can get over ten pages of any Book[--]yesterday--I finished it--I liked it better than I did Waverly [sic]--the story is better told the Hero more interesting the Gypsies delightful the Characters very well drawn indeed--all good in short except the love & the Ladies which are flippant & vulgar as is the Fashion now'."
