"All the letters have been distributed; they have been here only two months. I get my six, two-and-a-half from Joan, two-and-a-half from Brenda and one from Pip, with dates from 2.11.42 to 29.1.43. A """"Post Early for Christmas"""" postmark on a letter of 1.12.42 strinkes and ironic note when I receive it on 23.12.43! The gist of the news in the letters is: there is no news of Nora or me.'"
