"Henry James to Thomas Sergeant Perry, from Cambridge, Mass., 15 August 1867: """"Here I have been ... all summer and here I expect to stay.  You may imagine that existence has not been thrilling or exciting.  I have seen no one and done nothing -- unless it be read; which I have done to some extent."""""
