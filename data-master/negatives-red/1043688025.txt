"Harriet Martineau to 'Mr Atkinson', 21 November 1847: 'I saw a sort of scared smile on Mrs. ----'s face the other day, when in talking about education, I said we had yet to see what could be done by a direct appeal to human nature.  She, liberal as she is, thinks we have such active bad tendencies [...] that we can do nothing without [...] Help.  Yet she, and Mrs. ---- too, devours my Household education papers, as if she had never met with anything true before on that subject.'"
