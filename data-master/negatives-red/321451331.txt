"In the year 1650, as I well remember, I was onenight reading in my bed (as it was my custom then to do, in some book or other) in the Anatomy of Melancholy: and coming to this passage of the author, that I have just now cited, viz of his having Jupiter in the sixth house, which made him a physician,I was really non-plust, and Planet-struck for that bout, and forced to lay aside my book, being unwilling to read what I could not understand. I then endeavoured to go to my rest, but in vain, my active genius was watchful, and constantly solicited me,even in my dreams, to enquire, and discover if I could, what Jupiter in the Sixth house meant.  . . .I had then. . . some small acquaintance with the learned Dr.  Nicholas Fisk. . .who presently gave me such satisfaction in the Point as I was thencapable of receiving."
