"The other afternoon, as I was lying dozing in a brown study after dinner, a lord's lackey knocked at the door and delivered me a little blue parcel, requiring for it a ntoe of delivery.  I opened it, and found two pretty stitched little books, and a letter from - Goethe!  I copy it from the fractur [Gothic script] hand it was written in, and send it for your edification.  The patriarchal style of it pleases me much.'"
