"Harriet Martineau to E. J. Furnival, 5 October 1851, thanking him for a copy of Tennyson's [italics]In Memoriam[end italics]: 'Like most other people (whom I have met with, at least), I shrank from a whole volume of published griefs; and the more, because I knew Arthur Hallam [...] I began to cut and read last night; and I stopped at last, by a virtuous effort, from the feeling that I ought not to be able to take in so much at once, -- that I ought to spread it out [...] I cannot honestly say that I had anything like so much pleasure from """"The Princess.""""  There are bits of wisdom and beauty [...] but the impression of the whole is more than odd; -- it is very disagreeable, to my feeling.  It does not follow that I am not glad to know it'."
