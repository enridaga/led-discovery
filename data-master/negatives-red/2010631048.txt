"For his carriage and deportment in his Family,  it was sober, grave, and very Religious. He there offered up the Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer, and praise continually: so that his House was a little Church. Thrice a day he had the Scriptures read, and after that the Psalm, or Chapter were ended, he used to ask all his children and servants what they remembred, and whatsoever Sentences they rehearsed, he would speak something out of them that might tend to their edification."
