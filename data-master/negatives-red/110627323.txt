"Comparing scripture with scripture.  Reading besides Self control [by Mary Brunton] which Henrietta has borrowed from Mrs. Martin.  It is formed on the model of Clarissa Harlowe; but the heroine is more immaculate than even Clarissa, & more happy finally! ? The book is well-written & interesting.  A combination of fortitude & delicacy always interests me in a particular manner."
