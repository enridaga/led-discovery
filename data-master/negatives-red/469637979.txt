"Passages in E. M. Forster's Commonplace Book (1944-45) include account of Ancient Egyptian burial customs, as discovered by later explorers, from Samuel Henley's Appendix to Edward Daniel Clarke, 'The Tomb of Alexander' (1805). Underneath, Forster notes: 'This is the first entry I have made since the death of my mother, today three months in her grave.'"
