"There was the """"Police News"""" and the """"Police Budget"""". I don't think these had any connection, officially, with the police, that was just their name. They specialised in depicting crime in pictures, and also the manly arts of boxing and wrestling. The most sensational crime of the previous week was always given on the front page; and if it was murder by knife or gunshot, there was always oceans of blood sloshed about the picture, and the dying man's face was horrific with his agony. These journals were printed on pink newsprint.'"
