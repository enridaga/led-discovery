"I have corrected all the proofs of The Old Wives Tale &mdash; 578pp. I am sure Tertia is wrong about those two chapters.  I deliberately lowered the tension in the last part of the book, in obedience to a theory which objects to violent climaxes as a close; and now I have done it, I don‚Äôt know that I am quite satisfied.  I know the public will consider the fourth part rather tame and flat, if not dull.  And I am not sure whether I don‚Äôt slightly share this view.  This is annoying.... I read Un Vie again (than which I meant to try and go one better) and was most decidedly disappointed in it. Lacking in skill.'"
