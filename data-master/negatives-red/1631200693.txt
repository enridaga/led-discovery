"Aucterderran, Fife: In common with the rest of Scotland, the vulgar are, for their station, literate, beyond all other nations. Puritanic and abstruse divinity come in for a sufficient share in their little stock of books; and it is perhaps peculiar to them, as a people, that they endeavour to form opinions by reading, as well as by frequent conversation, on some very metaphysical points connected with religion, and on the depper doctrines of Christianity. They likewise read, occasionally, a variety of other books unconnected with such subjects... Although the parish consists wholly of the poorer ranks of sociey, newspapers are very generally read and attended to'."
