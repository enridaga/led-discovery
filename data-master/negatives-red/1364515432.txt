"??the work of Mrs Hannah More called Coelebs in search of a wife, as not knowing well where to class it. It is too pure and too profound to be ranked with novels, and too sprightly and entertaining to be wholly given up to philosophy, theology or dialectics. Mrs More?s works form a class of themselves; it is enough, perhaps, to say Coelebs is one of them.?"
