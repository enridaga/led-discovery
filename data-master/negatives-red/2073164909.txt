"I was thoroughly charmed by the volumes of verse. I read them with the liveliest sympathy and sincere admiration. The study of Pierre Loti is very interesting. What's more I think nothing could be fairer. As for """"L'enseignement de Goethe"""" I am all the more inclined to accept it from your hand since I have never read a line of the Great Man. I don't know German and I quail before translations.'"
