"Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal, Monday 21 December 1801: 'When we were at Thomas Ashburner's on Sunday Peggy talked about the [drunken] Queen of Patterdale ... We sate snugly round the fire.  I read to them the Tale of Custance and the Syrian monarch, also some of the Prologues.  It is the Man of Lawe's tale.'"
