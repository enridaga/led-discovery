Morton Fullerton, 9 August 1901: 'You speak of your """"Cornhill"""" article as one always speaks and feels about one's potboilers; but that doesn't prevent me from having felt as I read it as if I were seated with you before that little [italics] cafe-glacier [end italics] that has the summer shade [...] and you were telling me, happily passive, things out of your abundance, and I could put my hand on your shoulder and wish the occasion would last.'
