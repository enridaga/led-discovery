"Have you read Frank Harris?s privately published Life & Confessions of Oscar Wilde?  It is a strange & powerful book, written by a man who is a curious mixture of impulses noble and ignoble.  I am just finishing it.  The best things I have read for ages are the Chekhov short stories in the new complete edition (2 vols out) published here by Chatto & Windus, translated by the eternal Constance Garnett.  These stories are unmatched.'"
