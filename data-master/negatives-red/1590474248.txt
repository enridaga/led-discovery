"In 1925 Ifan Edwards was driven by unemployment to read Das Kapital in the public library. """"It took him about four hundred pages of close print to come to the crux of his argument in the classic illustration of a labourer looking for a job in a factory, and, as he said, expecting nothing but a hiding"""", Edwards remembered. """"This little aside appealed to me very much, as I had had one or two hidings myself"""".'"
