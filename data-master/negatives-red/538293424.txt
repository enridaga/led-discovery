"?As spring and autumn were our only really busy seasons, I had occasionally , during other parts of the year, considerable leisure, which, if I could procure a book that I considered at all worth the reading, was spent with such a book of my desk, in the little recess of the packing room. Here, therefore, I had opportunities for reading many books of which I had only heard the names before, such as Robertson?s """"History of Scotland"""", Goldsmith?s """"History of England"""", Rollin?s """"Ancient History"""", Hume?s """"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"""", Anachaises? """"Travels in Greece""""; and many other works on travels, geography, and antiquities.?"
