"[A. Stanley] told me something I liked to hear, & so I shall tell it to you. In Moscow he had seen a good deal of a priest of the Greek Church, - a pure Muscovite - but a very intelligent man. Speaking of forms of religion in England this priest was so well acquainted with the position of dissenting ministers with regard to their congregations that A S was surprised, & enquired where & how he got his knowledge.
