"Percy Wall, jailed for defying draft notices in the First World War, was inspired in part by a copy of Queen Mab owned by his  father, a Marxist railway worker. But neither father nor son applied ideological tests to literature. In the prison library - with some guidance from a fellow conscientious objector who happened to be an important publishing executive - Percy discovered Emerson, Macaulay, Bacon, Shakespeare and Lambb. It was their style rather than their politics he found liberating: from them """"I learned self-expression and acquired or strengthened standards of literature"""".'"
