"So you are in correspondence with Mrs piozzi? Enviable Mortal! - Do you know I am, at this present writing, stark staring mad for love [of] her. I have been reading her Journey through France and Italy, and nothing that I ever luxuriously licked my lips over, ever delighted me half so much. The book is one huge mass of entertainment from beginning to end - And written in such an unaffected spirit of Christian charity for the errors of mankind - breathing such candour, chearfulness and good nature, that I quite adore her. She uses various quaint phrazes, very comical and expressive; but somewhat odd """"somehow"""" (as she says) till one gets accustomed to her style. The original poetry thinly scattered through the work, I do not admire. But a woman cannot have every excellence of heart and genius. She has enough to satisfy a more fastidious spirit than mine'."
