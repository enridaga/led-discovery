"On his arrival in Poland Conrad knew from our contemporary literature only """"Popioly"""" and """"Panna Mery"""". During his two-month stay he devoured almost all that was worth reading in fiction and drama. """"Devoured"""" is the right word, for he read with unusual, unbelievable speed. I was constantly bringing him new books; he used to get impatient when on finishing one, there was not another at hand. In every case his judgement was correct &mdash; in respect both of the book as a whole and of the particular style of each author. Wyspianski and Zeromski made the greatest impression on him. """"Oh, how I would like to translate it!"""" he said about """"Warszawianska"""".[...] His favorite books by Zeromski were """"Popioly"""" and """"Syzyfowy prace"""". I should mention Prus. The first work of Prus I gave Conrad was """"Emancypantki"""", one of my favorite books.[...] I warned him """"Perhaps the first volume will not be up to your expectations, but don't give up [...]"""" (In the case of """"Chlopi"""" I could not persuade him to read further volumes; """"I know already what's coming"""" he said.) [...] When he had finished the entire novel [""""Emancypatki""""], he remarked with amazement, """"Ma ch√®re, c'est mieux que Dickens!"""". [...] First I gave him """"Lalka """" to read, then """"Faraon"""". [...] Conrad kept asking for more books by Prus [...]. He read with passion """"Palac i rudera"""" and """"Powracajaca fala"""", books which I confess left me thoroughly bored.'"
