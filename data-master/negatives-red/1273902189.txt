"Macaulay's marginalia by the speech about Queen Mab in Romeo and Juliet: """"This speech, - full of matter, of thought, of fancy, as it is, - seems to me, like much of this play, to be not in Shakspeare's [sic] very best manner.  It is stuck on like one of Horace's 'purple patches'.  It does not seem to spring naturally out of the conversation.  This is a fault which, in his finest works, Shakspeare [sic] never commits."""""
