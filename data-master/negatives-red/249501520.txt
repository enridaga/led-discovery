"Cards, roulette, ping-pong and chess greatly assisted in passing the time. We also had quite a good camp library, the books mostly having been received from home. I have often heard it remarked that life there was one long queue, and it was not far wrong. Often one passed the morning waiting one's turn for the """"tin room,"""" or newly arrived parcels, while soon after lunch it was customary to see the more patient individuals already lining up chairs and settling down to their books, to wait for hot water which was sold at tea time.'"
