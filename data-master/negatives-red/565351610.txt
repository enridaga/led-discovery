"But happening to mention one day to my Editor that I thought """"Occult"""" stories would go down well just now, & that I had a lot of material for them in hand I was a little surprised to see him jump at the suggestion, & offer to buy the serial rights of eight stories at once.  So, deeming eight stories sold in advance to be better than a novel perhaps on my hands, I have shelved the latter for a time, & am to be seen daily reading a vast tome """"Myst?res des Sciences Occultes"""".  I tremble to consider the bad art which will be compressed into those stories!'"
