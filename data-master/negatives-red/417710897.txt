"I am staggering through Goethe as fast as I can - that is very slowly - Schiller was nothing to this - Goe[z] puzzled me so excessively that I thought it adviseable to let it alone for a little and try something else - I chose Stella as I had read it in french and with great difficulty I have got through it and part of Clavigo - I do not think I shall like Goethe much unless he improves greatly-'"
