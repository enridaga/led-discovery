"Thanks so much for your two letters & the copies of """"Flying"""" books ‚Äî very good. I am afraid I didn't think much of Boyd Cable's story """"Quick Work"""". The maniac of a pilot he describes as his hero would have been shot down at once! He did the very worst possible thing ‚Äî diving away from a Hun! ... I do wish people like Boyd Cable would not show their ignorance by trying to write about flying! The best article was """"Impressions of Leave"""" which was priceless. The story """"Eighteen"""" was unnecessarily lugubrious.'"
