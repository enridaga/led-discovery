"I wrote the following Ballad [abusing Mr Callaghan], and pacquetted Mr [italics]Taafe [end italics] with it [...] and threatened Mr [italics] Taafe [end italics], if he did not read it out, for the Amusement of the Company, he should be my next Subject for Satyr; but no body so earnestly insisted on seeing the Song as [italics] Callaghan [end italics] himself. To oblige him and entertain the Company, Mr [italics] Taafe [end italics] sung it to the Tune of [italics] Chevy Chace [end italics. The ballad is then reproduced] I have been credibly informed that this song made [italics] Callaghan [end italics] blush, which was more than any thing had ever done before. However he took a Copy of it, which he promised to publish; but finding he has not been as good as his Word, I must even be at the Expence of doing it my self'."
