"Dorothy Wordsworth to Catherine Clarkson, 10 January 1817, re visit to Mrs Threlkeld (very fond of C. Clarkson) at Halifax: 'I read her your last letter adding a few words for you, which were not there, of remembrance of her and her Daughter ... I hope my little trick ... was at the least an innocent one, and I flatter myself that, in the spirit ... what I made you say was just and true - indeed if I had not felt it to be so I should have been wounded instead of pleased by the pleasure which the dear good old lady expressed in hearing that she was remembered by you.'"
