"Charlotte Bronte, Biographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell, 1850:  'Currer Bell [ie Charlotte Bronte]'s book [The Professor] found acceptance nowhere ... he tried one publishing house more -- Messrs Smith and Elder.  Ere long ...there came a letter ... he took out of the envelope a letter of two pages.  He read it trembling.  It declined ... to publish that tale ... but it discussed its merits and demerits so courteously, so considerately ... that this very refusal cheered the author better than a vulgarly-expressed acceptance could have done.'"
