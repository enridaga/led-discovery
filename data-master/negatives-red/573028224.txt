"Fanny Kemble, 3 December 1832: 'After breakfast [on board steamboat] returned to my crib.  As I was removing """"Contarini Fleming"""" [a novel by Disraeli],in order to lie down, a lady said to me, """"Let me look at one of those books,"""" and without further word of question or acknowledgement, took it from my hand, and began reading [...] Arrived at the Delaware, we took boat again; and, as I was sitting very quietly reading """"Contarini Fleming"""", with the second volume lying on the stool by my feet, the same unceremonious lady who had [italics]borrowed[end italics] it before, snatched it up without addressing a single syllable to me, read as long as she pleased, and threw it down again in the same style before she went to dinner.'"
