" Your novel ['The Young Enchanted'] shows once more your most genuine and even devilish gift for narrative.  By God you can tell a story!  Also the first half of the book is full of charming things,  excellent bits of observation and fancy, new gleams of light on the world,  But, also by God, I will not hide from you my conviction that the book does not improve as it goes on . . . . The mere details of writing I think are better than in 'The Captives'."
