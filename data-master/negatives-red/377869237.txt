"Macaulay's marginalia in response to a note by Dr Johnson at the end of King Lear.  Johnson protested against the unpleasing character of a story, """"in which the wicked prosper, and the virtuous miscarry.""""  Macaulay responds: """"There is nothing like this last scene in the world.  Johnson talks nonsense.  Torn to pieces as Lear's heart had been, was he to live happily ever after, as the story-books say?  Wonderful as the whole play is, this last passage is the triumph of Shakspeare's [sic] genius.  Every character is perfectly supported."""""
