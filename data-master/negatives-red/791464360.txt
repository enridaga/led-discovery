"I think Zack [Gwendolen Keats] may be congratulated on the novel. It is an advance on the short stories--a promising advance. I've just finished reading it having waited for the last inst: [...] The French article [about the Dreyfus case] in the last number I dislike frankly as to tone. It is not """"Maga's"""" tone either; it does not give an impression of intelligence behind the words--it is not quite candid. [...] The navy article awfully interesting and the Fashon in fiction simply delightful.'"
