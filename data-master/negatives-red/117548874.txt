"[letter from Frederic Harrison to Mrs Ward] I am one of those to whom your book [""""The Case of Richard Meynell""""] specially appeals, as I know so much of the literature, the persons, the questions it dealt with. It has given me the most lively interest both as romance - as fine as anything since """"Adam Bede"""" - and also as controversy - as important as anything since """"Essays and Reviews"""". Meynell seems to me a far higher type than Elsmere, both as a man and as a book, and I am sure will have a greater permanent value'."
