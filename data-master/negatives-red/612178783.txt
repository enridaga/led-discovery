"Sunday 3 September 1939: 'This is I suppose certainly the last hour of peace. The time limit is out at 11. P[rime]M[inister] to broadcast at 11.15 [makes various brief observations] [...] I believe little exact notes are more interesting than reflections -- the only reflection is that this is bosh & stuffing compared with the reality of reading say Tawney [...] One's too tired, emotionally, to read a page. I tried Tawney last night -- cd'nt concentrate [...] Its now about 10.33.'"
