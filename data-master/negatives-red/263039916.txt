"Yesterday I had a letter from Murray in answer to one I had written in something of a determined stile for I had no idea of permitting him to start from the course after my son giving up his situation and profession merely because a contributor or two chose to suppose gratuitously that Lockhart was too imprudent for the situation.  My physic has wrought well for it brought a letter from Murray saying all was right (Footnote: Scott enclosed Murray's letter in one written to Lockhart the previous day.  Murray writes that 'There is nothing to apprehend'), that D'Israeli was sent to me not to Lockhart, and that I was only invited to write two confidential letters, and other incoherencies which intimate his fright has got into another quarter. It is interlined and franked by Barrow (Footnote: That interlineation reads 'No one has any ill will against Mr Lockhart!!!') which shows that all is well and that John's induction in to his office will be easy and pleasant.'"
