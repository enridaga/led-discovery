"Prelude MS W contains a fair copy of a verse translation of the tale of the travellers and the angel from Gower's Confessio Amantis ii 291-364 in D[orothy] W[ordsworth]'s hand, entitled """"Tale Imitated from Gower - Friend and Contemporary of Chaucer"""" ... It was not apparently copied from a printed source.'"
