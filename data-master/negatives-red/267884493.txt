"Sydney [Larkin's father] gave him free run of his library and his appetite for books grew enormously. """"Thanks to my father"""", he wrote later: """"our house contained not only the principal works of most main English writers in some form or other (admittedly there were exceptions, like Dickens), but also nearly-complete collections of authors my father favoured - Hardy, Bennett, Wilde, Butler and Shaw, and later on Lawrence, Huxley and Katherine Mansfield"""".'"
