"I have just read Miss Martineau's """"Sick Room"""". I cannot understand it. It is so sublime, and mystical that I frequently cannot guess at her meaning; all that I can find out is that in long chronical illnesses, a patient finds sources of amusement that do not at first occurr, but which have a tendency to engage the mind, and alleviate pain; all this however I could have conjectured without the assistance of an Octavo book'."
