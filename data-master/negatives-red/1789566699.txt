"You never no, [italics] never [end italics] - sent a more acceptable present than Cousin Stella & The Fool of Quality, - and that irrespective of their several merits. But books are books here [they are in rural Dumfriesshire and feel cut off from the world] I am sorry to say Meta lies at this present moment fast asleep with Cousin Stella in her hand; but that is the effect of bathing and an eight mile walk; not of the book itself. I know & like the Fool of Quality of old. I was brought up by old uncles & aunts, who had all old books, and very few new ones; and I used to delight in the Fool of Quality, & have hardly read it since.'"
