"Though I have constantly been a purchaser of the Ramblers from the first five that you were so kind as to present me with, yet I have not had time to read any farther than those first five, till within these two or three days past. But I can go no further than the thirteenth, now before me, till I have acquainted you, that I am inexpressibly pleased with them. I remember not a thing in the Spectators, in those Spectators that I read, for I never found time... to read them all, that half so much struck me; and yet I think of them highly.'"
