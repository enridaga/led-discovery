"I read C.C. ['Cat's Cradle'] very carefully in a fortnight: about 50 pp. a day.  It held me all right, though not quite so strongly as 'C'. As with 'C'., 'C. C.' is strongest & best in the last ยฌยบ or 1/3. . . . My boy, you may have made 70 corrections in the new edition, but there are plenty more to make.  . . ."
