"Dorothy Wordsworth to Catherine Clarkson: 'You had been strangely misinformed of the nature of the Edinburgh Review of William [Wordsworth]'s poems [ie his Poems in Two Volumes, 1807].  Luckily Lloyd takes it in, therefore I have seen it.  W[illia]m and M[ary Wordsworth] chanced to see it at Penrith ... the review is ... plainly so spiteful, that it can do no harm with any wise or feeling mind; and for me, I have not laughed so heartily this long time as I did at the reading of it.'"
