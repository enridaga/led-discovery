"Mary Berry, Journal, 10 September 1808, during stay at Bothwell Castle, seat of Lord Douglas: 'Lord and Lady Rosslyn arrived at four o'clock [...] Lord Rosslyn gave me a letter to read from Captain Adam to his father, praising the conduct of Ronald at Vimeira in the most satisfactory manner.  I went away to read it, which I did not do without tears.'"
