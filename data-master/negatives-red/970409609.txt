"Our lord of the """"cairn & the scaur"""" waste wilderness and hundred hills for many a league around is the Duke of Buccleuch the head of my clan a kind & benevolent landlord a warm and zealous friend and the husband of a lady comme il y'en a peu. They are both great admirers of Mr Crabbes poetry and would be happy to know him should he ever come to Scotland and venture into the Gothic halls of a Border Chief.'"
