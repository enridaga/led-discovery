"Went into the library to try to rationalize my mind about the deathwatch, - by reading the Cyclopaedia.  Feel very unwell today, & nervous.  Read the mysteries of Udolpho ? by way of quieting my imagination? & heard the boys read Homer & Zenophon - & read some of Victor Hugo?s & Lamartine?s poetry ? his last song of Childe Harold.  Miss Steers kindly sent a packet of French poetry to Mr. Boyd?s for me yesterday.  Le dernier chant wants the Byronic character (- an inevitable want for a French composition ? ) and is not quite equal even to Lamartine."
