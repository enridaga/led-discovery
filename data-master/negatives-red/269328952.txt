"?The """"Morning Star"""" was at that time the leading Radical daily in London ? almost the only Radical daily, indeed. It was my custom every morning (Sundays excepted, of course) to buy a copy at a news stall near the Horns Tavern at Kennington. My business was in Fleet Street. ? So orderly was the traffic throughout that route that I could, by keeping to the right, read my paper the whole way. And I had nothing left to read in it ? at least, nothing that I wanted to read ? when I reached Fleet Street, nearly an hour?s walk from Kennington.?"
