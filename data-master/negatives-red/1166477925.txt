"Dr. Newton, the Bishop of Bristol, having been mentioned, Johnson, recollecting the manner in which he had been censured by that Prelate, thus retaliated:-""""Tom knew he should be dead before what he has said of me would appear. He durst not have printed it while he was alive"""". DR. ADAMS. """"I believe his 'Dissertations on the Prophecies' is his great work"""". JOHNSON. """"Why, Sir, it is Tom's great work; but how far it is great, or how much of it is Tom's, are other questions. I fancy a considerable part of it was borrowed"""".' "
