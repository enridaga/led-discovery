"Harriet Martineau on Bible studies in early adulthood: 'I studied the Bible incessantly and immensely; both by daily reading of chapters [...] and by getting hold of all commentaries and works of elucidation that I could lay my hands on.  A work of Dr. Carpenter's, begun but never finished, called """"Notes and Observations on the Gospel History"""" [...] first put me on this track of study [...] It was while reading Mr. Kenrick's translation from the German of """"Helon's Pilgrimage to Jerusalem,"""" with which I was thoroughly bewitched, that I conceived [...] the audacious idea of giving a somewhat resembling account of the Jews and their country, under the immediate expectation of the Messiah, and even in his presence'."
