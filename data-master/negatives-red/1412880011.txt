"Mary Berry, Journal, Saturday 18 May 1811: 'I went with Joanna Baillie to Hampstead, to remain till Monday.  Dined before four, and went out upon the Heath.  Sat for above two hours in a delicious fine evening; afterwards read over together """"The Two Martius,"""" and criticised them, and likewise some of my other scraps, which I think Joanna liked less than I expected.'
