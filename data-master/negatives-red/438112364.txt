"[Marginalia in Keats's annotated copy of """"Paradise Lost"""", Book 4, lines 268-72] Keats underlines the lines: """"Not that fair field/ Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flowers,/ Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis/ Was gather'd, which cost Ceres all that pain/ To seek her through the world."""" He writes: 'There are two specimens of a very extraordinary beauty in the """"Paradise Lost""""; they are of a nature as far as I have read, unexampled elsewhere - they are entirely distinct from the brief pathos of Dante - and they are not to be found even in Shakespeare - these are according to the great prerogative of poetry better described in themselves than by a volume. The one is in the fol[lowing] - """"which cost Ceres all that pain"""" - the other is that ending """"Nor could the Muse defend her son"""" - they appear exclusively Miltonic without the shadow of another mind ancient or modern.'
