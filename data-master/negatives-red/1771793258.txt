"Some time since, all the world was astonished at the 2nd number of """"Blackwoods (formerly the Edinr) magazine"""" - The greater part of it is full of gall: but the most venomous article is the """"translation of a Chaldee manuscript"""" said to be found in the library of Paris -  It is written in the phrase of the Scriptures - [and gives] an allegorical account of the origin & end of the late """"Edinr magazine"""" - greatly to the [dis]paragement of Constable & the Editors - Most of the Authors of """"Edinr"""" are characterised with great acrimony - under the likeness of birds & beasts & creeping things -  """"Blackwood"""" is like to be beleaguered with prosecutions for it - two are already raised against him. Replies in the shape of """"explanations"""", """"letters to Drs M'Crie and Thomson"""" have been put forth - more are promised - and doubtless, rejoinders are in a state of preparation. Whatever may become of """"Blackwood"""" or his antagonists - the """"reading"""" or rather the talking """"public"""" is greatly beholden to the Author. He has kept its jaws moving these four weeks - and the sport is not finished yet'."
