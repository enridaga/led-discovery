"My  dear Caroline, I am very glad to have an opportunity of answering your agreable [sic] little Letter. You seem to be quite my own Neice [sic] in your feelings towards Mde de Genlis. I do not think I could even now, at my sedate time of Life, read """"Olimpe et Theophile"""" without being in a rage.  It really is too bad! Not allowing them to be happy together, when they are married.  Don't talk of it, pray.  I have just let your Aunt Frank the 1st vol. of Les Veilles du Chateau, for Mary Jane to read.'"
