"Some three weeks ago, a packet of Books arrived here, accompanied with a Letter addressed A l'Auteur de l'Article intitule, Caractere de notre Epoque, the whole perfectly uninjured, the Books complete according to the list sent with them.  Being actually the writer of that Paper, headed Signs of the Times, in the Edinburgh Review, there referred to, I cannot but cheerfully accept this present: by what route it came hither I shall perhaps learn by and by... Pursuant to your directions, I have looked over these Writings, with such leisure and composure as I could command; well purposing to investigate the matter farther, as I have opportunity.'"
