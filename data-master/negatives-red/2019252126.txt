"As my love of books became known, I was made free of such libraries as the neighbours possessed which led to me reading some curious and unsuitable matter, old-fashioned theological works, early Methodist magazines, cookery books and queer tales of murder and robbery. One such, entitled """"The Castle of Otranto"""", haunted my dreams for many a night. Our nearest neighbour who was more of a scholar than his rough exterior and taciturn manner suggested, lent me a """"History of England"""" which was a veritable godsend.'"
