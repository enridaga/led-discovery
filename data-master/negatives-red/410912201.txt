"I read Dr Wilkins of prayer, and in reading the Bible observed and wrote downe in a book notes for matter, method and expression; and although by such industrious wayes I had a gift of prayer, I knew that except the spirit of God helped my infirmityes . . . I could not pray in such a manner as to pleas God. I found it much better to use scripture phrase, on all occasions, th[a]n to trust to parts, and pray at random'."
