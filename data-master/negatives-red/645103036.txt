"I began the """"Poissons"""" regularly; pretty hard work; finished """"Kenilworth"""". I think Amy deserved her fate, she is unworthy of being one of Scott's heroines. The book wants both a hero and a heroine, for Tressilian, who is unsuccessful in almost all he does, is too unlucky. Leicester too vacillating. Raleigh and Elizabeth have more of the interest, or of claim to it at least.'"
