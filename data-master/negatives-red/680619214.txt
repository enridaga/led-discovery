"I delayed sending you my acknowledgement for the September issue [of Blackwood's Magazine] [...]The appreciation of Mrs Oliphant's work is just in the right note. It is justice--and discriminating justice--rendered to that serene talent. I think she wrote too much (perhaps it's envy; to me it's simply inconceivable) but she was ever  faithful to her artistic temperament--she always expressed herself. She was a better artist than George Elliot [sic] and, at her best immensely superior to any living woman novelist  I can call to mind.  Harris (an old friend of mine--in his work) can write more than a bit. Not to everyone is given to be so graphic and so easy at the same time. Besides his point of view is  most sympathetic to me. Blackmore is himself--of course. But Professor Saintsbury's paper interested me most--a bit of fundamental criticism  most cleverly expounded.'"
