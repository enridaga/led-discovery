"Horne Tooke is a dirty dog - he gives the derivation of such words! - There sits Mr Wilbraham two hours every morning in the library, sniggering and shaking his fat sides over such grave nastiness as is enough to make a modest soul like me blush or turn sick: and he always puts a little paper mark into the worst passages to show them to me when I go down. Was ever anything so impertinent & insulting! As if I loved dirt.'"
