"""""I go off tomorrow to Cumberland where I shall climb the British Mt Blanc & forget for a short time that there are such things as books to be written. I take 2 or 3 to read for alas I can't now quite reduce myself to the animal state as I used to in former days. I looked at something of Lowell's the other day & was amused to find that you have got a Saddleback and a great Haystack in America as well as in Cumberland."""""
