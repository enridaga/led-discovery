"This morning I received a copy of Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre (Travels), a sort of sequel to Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, which is at present stealing into what notice it can attain among you.  The Travels was written two years ago by Goethe, and promises so far as I can yet judge to be a very special work.  I am not without some serious thoughts of putting it into an English dress to follow its elder brother.'"
