"I am extremely gratified by the arrival of your book of Supermen. [...] your pages can give nothing but pleasure to a man who loves """"la litt√©rature critique"""" (not literary criticism). According to my habit when a fascinating book comes in my way (a sort of angel's visit) I've read it at once, wilfully and of malice prepense, neglecting my daily task to entertain the rare visitor.'  Hence follow eight lines of praise."
