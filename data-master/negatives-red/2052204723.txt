"[Johnson said] """"I see they have published a splendid edition of Akenside's works. One bad ode may be suffered; but a number of them together makes one sick."""" Boswell. """"Akenside's distinguished poem is his 'Pleasures of Imagination': but, for my part, I never could admire it so much as most people do."""" Johnson. """"Sir, I could not read it through."""" Boswell. """"I have read it through; but I do not find any great power in it"""".'"
