"My brother-in-law‚Äôs newspaper furnished an occasional opportunity to me, though no doubt, he considered that he could fill his twice-a-week journal without my help. He was, however, helpful in other ways. He was one of the subscribers to a Reading Club, and through him I had access to newspapers and magazines. The South Australian Institute was a treasure to the family. I recollect a newcomer being astonished at my sister Mary having read Macaulay‚Äôs ‚ÄúHistory.‚Äù :""""Why, it was only just out when I Left England,‚Äù said he. ‚ÄúWell, it did not take longer to come out than you did‚Äù, was her reply. We were all omnivorous readers, and the old-fashioned accomplishment of reading aloud was cultivated by both brothers and sisters. I was the only one who could translate French at sight, thanks to Miss Phin‚Äôs [Scottish schoolteacher] giving me so much of Racine and Moliere and other good French authors in my school days.‚Äô"
