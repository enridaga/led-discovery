"all the esays [in the """"Universal Visitor""""] marked with two [italics] asterisks [end italics] have been ascribed to him; but I am confident, from internal evidence, that of these, neither """"The Life of Chaucer"""", """"Reflections on the State of Portugal"""", nor an """"Essay on Architecture"""", were written by him. I am equally confident, upon the same evidence, that he wrote """"Further Thoughts on Agriculture""""; being the sequel of a very inferiour essay on the same subject, and which, though carried on as if by the same hand, is both in thinking and expression so far above it, as to leave no doubt of its true parent; and that he also wrote """"A Dissertation on the State of Literature and Authors"""", and """"A Dissertation on the Epitaphs Written by Pope"""".'"
