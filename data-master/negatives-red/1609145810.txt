"If you want to read an agreeable book, read Galownin's narrative of his confinement in and escape from Japan; and I think it may do very well for reading out, which I believe is your practice - a practice which I approve rather than follow: - and neglect it from mere want of virtue. I think also you may read De Foe's Life of Colonel Jack, - entertaining enough when his heroe is a scoundrel, but waxing dull as it gets moral. I never set you any difficult tasks in reading, but am as indulgent to you as I am to myself'."
