"A South Wales miner, raised in an orphanage, acknowledged that """"Robin Hood was our patron saint, or ideal. We sincerely believed in robbing the rich to help the poor"""". (Actually he stole from an old widow's tuck shop). """"Our real heroes were robbers like Jack Sheppard, Dick Turpin, and Charles Peace, whose 'Penny dreadful' biographies we knew by heart"""". Yet in later life, even as a Calvinistic Methodist minister, he did not condemn that genre: """"It introduced me to a romantic world when pennies were scarce and libraries seemed far beyond my reach. We read the badly printed booklets in all sorts of places, even in church; they gave us glimpses of freedom, abandon, and romance, heroism and defiance of fate... As a corrective to natural law-breaking propensities, the 'penny dreadful' always ended with the punishment of crime"""".'"
