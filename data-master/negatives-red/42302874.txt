"Passages transcribed into E. M. Forster, Commonplace Book (1937) include part of Le Morte D'Arthur, XX.3, opening: ' """"So upon Trinity Sunday at night King Arthur dreamed a womderful dream [...] that to him there seemed he sat upon a chaflet [platform] in a chair, and the chair was fast to a wheel """"'. Underneath, Forster notes: 'Copied, with modernised spelling, just as King George VI returned from his coronation to his palace.'"
