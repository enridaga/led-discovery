"[Marginalia in Keats's annotated copy of """"Paradise Lost"""" in Book 1, lines 527-67]: Keats underlines the lines from 'the glittering staff unfurl'd' to 'Of warriors old with order'd spear and shield'. He then writes: 'The light and shade - the sort of black brightness - the ebon diamonding - the ethiop Immortality - the sorrow, the pain, the sad-sweet Melody - the Phalanges of Spirits so depressed as to be """"uplifted beyond hope"""" - the short mitigation of Misery - the thousand Melancholies and Magnificences of this Page - leaves no room for anything to be said thereon but """"so it is"""".'"
