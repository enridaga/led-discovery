"Madam, I can hardly feel that I am addressing an entire stranger in the author of """"Our Village"""", and yet I know it is right and proper that I should apologize for the liberty I am taking. But really, after having accompanied you, as I have done again and again, in """"violeting,"""" and seeking for wood-sorrel ? after having been with you to call upon Mrs. Allen in """"the dell"""", and becoming thoroughly acquainted with May and Lizzie, I cannot but hope that you will kindly pardon my obtrusion, and that my name may be sufficiently known to you to plead my case.  There are writers whose works we cannot read without feeling as if we really had looked with them upon the scenes they bring before us, and as if such communion had almost given us a claim to something more than the mere intercourse between authors and """"gentle readers"""".  Will you allow me to say that your writings have this effect up me, and that you have taught me, in making me know and love your """"Village"""" so well, to wish for further knowledge also of her who has so vividly impressed its dingles and copses upon my imagination, and peopled them so cheerily with healthful and happy beings?'"
