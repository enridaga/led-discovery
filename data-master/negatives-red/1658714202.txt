"Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was simultaneously complemented and embarrassed by Pope's tribute in """"Epistle to Mr Gay"""". She sent a copy of the verses to her sister in Paris, but she explained she had """"stiffle'd"""" them in England... Lady Mary characteristically felt the impropriety as much as the flattery of Pope's admiration'."
