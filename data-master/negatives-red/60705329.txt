"For my private and sole use, seeing that my friends had no taste for poetry, I bought Mr. Pye's translation of Horace, and was well pleased with my purchase; for I found the old """"Roman poet"""" to be a very lively and shrewd companion. I also ventured to spend a guinea in the purchase of """"Kirke White's Remains"""": a large sum for one like myself to spend at one time in buying books; yet I had good reason to be satisfied; for the work was useful to me in the way of strengthening and confirming my habits of reading and observation.'
