"[from Bennet Langton's collection of 1780 Johnsoniana, passed to Boswell] 'One night at The Club he produced a translation of an Epitaph which Lord Elibank had written in English, for his Lady, and requested of Johnson to turn into Latin for him. Having read """"Domina de North et Gray"""", he said to Dyer, """"You see, Sir, what barbarisms we are compelled to make use of, when modern titles are to be specifically mentioned in Latin inscriptions."""" When he had read it once aloud, and there had been a general approbation expressed by the company, he addressed himself to Mr. Dyer in particular, and said, """"Sir, I beg to have your judgement, for I know your nicety."""" Dyer then very properly desired to read it over again; which having done, he pointed out an incongruity in one of the sentences.' "
