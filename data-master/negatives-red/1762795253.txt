"I went up the line to the 168 batteries and had a most excellent lunch with Hastings and Poole at B battery in a dug-out which the former has built in a trench there. They were shelling us now and again with short bursts of small shells which went just over and to the left. Hastings showed me the proofs of a poem called """"Regent Street"""" which has been taken by the <i>English Review</i>. It turned out a wet afternoon.'"
