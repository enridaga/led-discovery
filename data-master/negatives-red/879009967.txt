"Princess Charlotte wrote of reading as a """"great passion""""; in a poignant attempt to construct bourgeois domestic intimacy in the dysfunctional household of the divorced Prince Regent she discussed and exchanged books with her friend Margaret Mercer Elphinstone, including memoirs and recent history, Byron's poems, and novels including Gothic fiction and works by Anne Plumptre and Jane Austen. (The perceptive Charlotte especially enjoyed """"Sense and Sensibility"""" because she discerned in herself""""the same imprudence"""" as Marianne's).'"
