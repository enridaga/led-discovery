"In 1840 Miss Yonge was a bright attractive girl, at least ten years younger than myself and very like her own Ethel in """"The Daisy Chain"""". Great interest was expressed by her and her mother in Mrs Mozley (Cardinal Newman's sister), the author of a tale called the """"Fairy Bower"""", which had appeared shortly before. It was the precursor of the many tales, illustrative of the Oxford teaching, that were written at this period, and which were hailed with special satisfaction by young people, who turned fom the texts, and prayers, and hymns, which Mrs Sherwood had introduced into her stories, and yet needed something higher in tone than Miss Edgeworth's morality'."
