"[Wiliam Godwin] told me [Harriet Martineau] [...] that he wrote the first half of """"Caleb William"""" in three months, and then stopped for six, -- finishing it in three more.  This pause in the middle of a work so intense seems to me a remarkable incident.  I have often intended to read """"Caleb Williams"""" again, to try whether I could find the stopping place: but it has never fallen in my way, and I have not seen the book since my youth.'"
