"While walking to Hampstead, I strayed into a copse not far from my road, where I seated myself upon the trunk of a tree, and read, with no small pleasure, several of the papers contained in that highly entertaining book, """"Sturm's Reflections on the Works of God"""". As I read these, surrounded by many of the objects upon which they so pleasingly descant, I was enabled to look """"through nature up to nature's God""""; to hold, as it were, converse with that glorious and beneficient Being, and to recognise Him as a father and a friend.'"
