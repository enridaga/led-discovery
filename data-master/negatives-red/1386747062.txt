"Mary Berry to Anne Damer, October 1798: 'Do you know that I have been working as hard at Greek for this week past as you could possibly desire?  The parson who I mentioned in my last, stayed till yesterday.  He is a very good scholar, and much in the habit of teaching. He corrected a piece of Isocrates which I had done by myself, and then read on with me in the same oration, and whilst he was here I translated above two pages more, writing them down, I mean, and all the verbs and their parts in the opposite page'.
