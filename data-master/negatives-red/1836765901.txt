"He marked personal details in Colvin's biography of Keats, particularly when they seemed to coincide with his own, noticing that Keats's mind was """"naturally unapt for dogma"""", that Keats and Hunt were given to """"luxuriating"""" over """"deliciousness"""", and that Reynolds came from Shrewsbury and """"lacked health and energy"""". He involved himself similarly in the poems. """"Endymion"""" and 'Lamia' kept his pencil especially busy as he underlined rich vocabulary and marked lush descriptions, including that of the sleeping Adonis. A bookmarker in """"Endymion"""", embroidered with the text """"create in me a clean heart O God"""", seems to have prayed in vain among sensuous passages in which he evidently delighted, but perhaps guilt overcame him after reading 'Lamia', because four pages of erotic description have been carefully stuck together'."
