"Now I will quit these dreary subjects, and tell you of a few nice books for you to read & like - The 1st Vol. of Campbell's life of Frederic the Great. The others [underlined] I [end underlining] did not enjoy so much. They are chiefly about the seven year's [sic] war: but there are parts even of that, which interested me very much. - Then """"Stevenson's Central South America"""". That is not the full title, but I forget exactly how the book is called. - I suppose you know the Life of Lord Howe. I was delighted with it; and it is only in one volume. There, if you chuse to try any of the above, I think I have cut you out work enough to last a good while'."
