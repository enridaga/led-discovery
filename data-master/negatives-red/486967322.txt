"W.J. Brown was introduced to literature by """"Robinson Crusoe"""", """"She"""", """"The Last of the Mohicans"""", and """"Around the World in Eighty Days"""", and he never moved far beyond that level. He tried """"The Idiot"""" and """"The Brothers Karamazov"""", but found them too depressing, perhaps because his life was anything but Dostoevskian'."
