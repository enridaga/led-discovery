Hulme """"appears as the forerunner of a new attitude of mind, which should be the twentieth-century mind, if the twentieth-century is to have a mind of its own. Hulme is classical, reactionary, and evolutionary; he is the antipodes of the eclectic, tolerant, and democratic mind of the end of the last century.""""  "
