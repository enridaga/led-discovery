"The Mysterious Gentleman Farmer. 3 vols. by J.Cory [sic] There is nothing in this novel, or in the author's Satyrical View of London, that would induce me to waste my time again in perusal of any other of his works. This may probably be worth five guineas at the Minerva Press; the author may earn a little money; fame is out of the question in such caterpillar productions."
