"When in my early apprentice days I was first enabled to dip into the pages of """"Maga"""", its chief attraction was the later series of """"The Diary of a late physician"""". I greatly enjoyed the papers, and also, later on, the same author's story of """"Ten Thousand a Year"""". [when the journal came out] I would sit on the steps [of George Street] for nearly an hour engrossed by the perusal of some interesting portion of its pages, munching at the same time my dinner of bread-and-cheese. The pages of the copies of the magazine in my custody as collector were, of course, uncut, but having as many as eight or ten in my charge, I managed without it being discovered to cut open one leaf in each of the numbers in order to master the narrative.'"
