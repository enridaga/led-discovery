"I know not if there be a Goddess of Sloth - tho' considering that this of all our passions is the least turbulent and most victorious, it could not without partiality be left destitute - But if there be, she certainly looks on with an approving smile - when in a supine posture, I lie for hours with my eyes fixed upon the pages of Lady Morgan's France or the travels of Faujas St Fond - my mind seldom taking the pains even to execrate the imbecile materialism, the tawdry gossipping of the former, or to pity the infirm speculations and the already antiquated mineralogy of the latter.'"
