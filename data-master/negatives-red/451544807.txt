"Oct. 24. Tuesday. We visited the King's library.‚ÄîI saw the """"Speculum humanae Salvationis"""", rudely printed with ink, sometimes pale, sometimes black; part supposed to be with wooden types, and part with pages cut in boards.‚ÄîThe Bible, supposed to be older than that of Mentz, in 62 [1462]; it has no date, it is supposed to have been printed with wooden types.‚ÄîI am in doubt; the print is large and fair, in two folios.‚ÄîAnother book was shewn me, supposed to have been printed with wooden types;‚ÄîI think, """"Durandi Sanctuarium in 58 [1458]. This is inferred from the difference of form sometimes seen in the same letter, which might be struck with different puncheons.‚ÄîThe regular similitude of most letters proves better that they are metal.‚ÄîI saw nothing but the """"Speculum"""" which I had not seen, I think, before'."
