"I read the [italics] Subsidiary Notes [end italics] first. It was so interesting I could not leave it. I finished it at one long morning sitting - hardly stirring between breakfast and dinner. I cannot tell you how much I like it, and for such numbers of reasons. First, because you know of a varnish that is as good or better than black-lead for grates (only I wonder what it is). Next, because of the little sentences of real deep wisdom which from their depth and true foundation may be real helps in every direction and to every person; and for the quiet continual devout references to God which make the book a holy one'."
