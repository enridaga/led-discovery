"W[ordsworth] did not read it [Thomas Beddoes, Domiciliary Verses] until it was reprinted in the Annual Anthology (1799).  [Joseph] Cottle sent W[ordsworth] a copy ... in Aug. 1799, and on 2 Sept he wrote back: """"Pray give yourself no uneasiness about Dr Beddoes's verses [which parodied the Lyrical Ballads] ... it is a very harmless performance.""""'"
