"In early life, I have said, my attention was turned to politics. My first impressions were for universality. """"Cobbett's Register"""" and """"Wooler's Black Dwarf"""" were the first works I purchased and studied on political economy. It was my custom every Saturday evening, after my work was over, to go to the Market Place, and from a stall there, to purchase the breathings of those men of mind.'"
