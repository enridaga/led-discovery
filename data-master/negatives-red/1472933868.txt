" [Macaulay's marginalia in Plato's Gorgias]: """"This is not pure morality; but there is a good deal of weight in what Callicles says.  He is wrong in not perceiving that the real happiness, not only of the weak many, but of the able few, is promoted by virtue.  [...] When I read this dialogue as a lad at college, I wrote a trifling piece for Knight's Magazine, in which some Athenian characters were introduced, I made this Callicles the villain of the drama.  I now see that he was merely a fair specimen of the public men of Athens in that age.  Although his principles were those of aspiring and voluptuous men in unquiet times, his feelings seem to have been friendly and kind."""""
