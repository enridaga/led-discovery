"We received the Books a week ago ... We have all already to thank you for a great deal of delight which we have received from them.  In the first place my Brother and Sister have read the Life of Colonel Hutchinson, which is a most valuable and interesting Book. - My Brother speaks of it with unqualified approbation, and he intends to read it over again.'"
