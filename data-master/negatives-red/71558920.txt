"My dear Father and Mother, Your letters received with thanks. My book is being printed by Thorne, Stiff, and Payne, among other people. Is that not appropriate for a neuralgic author? The <i>pain</i> has decamped once more and gone to my shoulder blade where it hurts worse; but is out of the way of the lungs anyway. I had another worry with the doctor today; he gives me a clean bill; but says I must take care for a little [‚Ä¶]. What does my father mean by the """"references to the book""""? What book? and where? And how? And what am I to do with them? [‚Ä¶] Do explain about the """"references to the book"""" [‚Ä¶].'"
