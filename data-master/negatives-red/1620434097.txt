"Henry James to Hugh Walpole, 13 May 1910: 'I """"read,"""" in a manner, """"Maradick"""" -- [...] Your book has a great sense and love of life -- but seems to me very nearly as irreflectively juvenile as the Trojans [ie """"The Trojan Horse"""" (1909), Walpole's previous (and first) novel] [...] Also the whole thing is a monument to the abuse of voluminous dialogue [...] And yet it's all so loveable'.
