"[Harriet Grove] enjoyed novels and plays: in 1809-10, she read with pleasure in a family group a number of popular bestsellers (which in the period means largely novels by women), including Lady Morgan's """"The Novice of Saint Dominick"""", Agnes Maria Bennett's """"The Beggar Girl and her Benefactors"""", Edgeworth's """"Tales of Andrews"""", """"Sir Charles Grandison"""" and """"A Sentimental Journey""""'.
