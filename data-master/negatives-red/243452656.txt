"Andrew Lang, in Adventures Among Books, on being introduced to Dickens: 'I had minded my lessons, and satisfied my teachers -- I know I was reading Pinnock's """"History of Rome"""" for pleasure -- till ... I felt a """"call"""", and underwent a process which may be described as the opposite of """"conversion"""".  The call came from Dickens.  Pickwick was brought into the house ... I read """"Pickwick"""" in convulsions of mirth.  I dropped Pinnock's """"Rome"""" for good.'  "
