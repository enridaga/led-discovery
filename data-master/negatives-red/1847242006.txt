" 'I don‚Äôt think I have concealed from you my opinion that """"Fortitude"""" and """"The Duchess"""" [The Duchess of Wrexe] are not on a level with the other three. [Mr Perrin and Mr Traill (1911), The Dark Forest (1916) and The Green Mirror (1918)].  But this unlevelness does not worry me in the least.  It is constantly found in the greatest novelists, and is natural & inevitable.'"
