"Mary Berry, in reflections on reading (1798): 'When I read """"Paradise Lost,"""" I am no more able to conceive the powers of imagination and genius exerted by Milton in the composition of that poem, than I am able to conceive the intellect of Sir Isaac Newton in the demonstration of the phenomena of the universe.  Both seem to me beings more exalted above myself in the scale of intellectual perfection, than I am above the brute creation.'"
