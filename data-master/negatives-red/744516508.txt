"Mary Berry, Journal, 27 April 1791: 'Florence. -- Went to see the Laurentian Medicean Library [...] The librarian, a very civil Canonico Bandini, showed us the Virgil of the fourth century, which they call the oldest existing; it is very fairly written, but less easy to read than the one in the Vatican.  We saw, too, the Horace that belonged to Petrarch, with some notes in it by his own hand.  It is in large quarto, and not a beautiful manuscript from the number of notes and scoliastes interrupting and confusing the text.'"
