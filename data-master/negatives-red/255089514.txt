"Lady [-] lent me Mrs Grant's """"Superstitions of the Highlands"""", and I like what I have read of it; but, above all things, I admire Mr Jeffrey's review of it, and also a review of Ford's plays, in which latter there are some beautiful pieces of writing, especially in """"The Broken Heart"""". I am sorry they are disgraced with such coarseness. It does not do to tear off the drapery of a moral imagination, and expose our naked and shivering nature. But certainly those powerful pictures of the passions that were exhibitied in former days, make a good contrast to the tameness of modern performances. I do not like """"Love's [sic] Melancholy"""" at all. The character of Penthea in """"The Broken Heart"""" is very fine; but I could not see the advantages of making Calantha dance on when all her friends are dead'."
