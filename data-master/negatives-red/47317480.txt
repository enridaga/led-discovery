"I am very glad you have enjoyed the court of Hayti, much the best part of the book in my opinion. I only barred your reading it out of propriety and for fear the other Lady Louisa should be scandalized; pray tell her so. My own notions are that comical books rarely do harm, unless when they try to throw ridicule on sacred subjects; and, I am tempted to say, """"Have fixed principles deeply rooted, and then read what you please"""". I agree with her that Tardif de Courtrac, tho' always clever, is sometimes very tedious, especially in America, from one's indifference respecting the subject. For """"Ivanhoe"""", make yourself easy, I am its sincere partisan and Rebecca's devoted admirer. I would rather the templar had burst a blood vessel, because that is really often the effect of a conflict of violent passions and tho' they may bring on an apoplexy also , it is not apt to ensue so immediately'.
