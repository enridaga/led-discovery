"We talk of Waverly [sic] and Guy Mannering: Lady Jersey sent me the former [italics] as yours [end italics]. I vote with the Multitude, yet some pretend to know more & talk of revisals & amendments. I have a private Reason for my Opinion viz. my own Vanity. who but a friend would haved quoted me so often & once in a peculiar Manner? - I ask no Question! I ought not but I tell you what we say & think. Waverley may be best but Guy is most entertaining.'"
