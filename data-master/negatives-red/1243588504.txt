"Horace Walpole to Mary Berry, 24 September 1794, 'near one [pm]': 'The Churchills are here in the room while I write [...] just as I was going to begin my letter, the newspaper came in, and he and I have been reading it aloud to us paragraph by paragraph, half of which are full of bad news, of retreats of our army, of the capture of our Mediterranean fleet by the French, and [...] of the King of Prussia having been forced to raise the siege of Warsaw.'"
