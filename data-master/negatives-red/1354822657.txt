"Subsequently I recieved a curiously worded scroll addressed to """"Our trusty and well beloved Hannah Maria Mitchell."""" This document would hardly find favour with the advocates of Basic English - there are no stops or commas in it. It begins with """"Greeting. Know ye that we have assigned you and every one of you jointly and severally Our Justices to keep the peace in and throughout our city of Manchester in our County Palatine of Lancaster and to keep and cause to be kept all Ordinaces and Statues made for the good of our peace and for the Conservation of the same."""" Then followed the instructions - """"to chastise and punish all persons that offend against the form of these ordinaces. To cause to come before you or any of you all those who to anyone or more of Our People concerning their bodies or the firing of their houses have used threats to find sufficient security for the Peace if they shall refuse to find such Securtiy then them in our prisons until they shall find such security to cause to be safely kept."""" The scroll ends with the command - """"that you diligently apply yourselves to the keeping Our Peace Ordinance Statutes and all and signular other the premises and perform and fulfil the same in form aforesaid being therein what to Justice appertaineth according to the Laws and Customs of England.""""'"
