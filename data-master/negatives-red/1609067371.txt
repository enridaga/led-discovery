"In Byron's Journal (14 November 1813-19 April 1814), 22 November 1813: 'I remember the effect of the first Edinburgh Review [containing negative review of his work] on me.  I heard of it six weeks before, - read it the day of its denunciation, - dined and drank three bottles of claret ... was not easy, till I had vented my wrath and my rhyme, in the same pages aganst every thing and every body.'"
