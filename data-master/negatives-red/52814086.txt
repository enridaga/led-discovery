"A dead man, just reported to me lying close by. Went out and found (from his identity disc) he was No. 8863, B West, Suffolk Regiment. Lying with his overcoat tied over his face alongside a ruined farm. Died possibly from wounds. Horrid job, lifting his head to get at his identity disc. I buried him at dusk, and said the Lord's Prayer over him. Couldn't read any prayers as we couldn't have any light, and as it was three bullets came so close to us, might have been aimed at us.'"
