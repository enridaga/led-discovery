"Annabella was now reading Cowper's """"Iliad"""" and annotating evey second line; she was studying Alfieri with the family-solicitor's daughter; for relaxation condescending to """"Evelina"""". In """"Evelina"""" she was disappointed, like a good many more of its readers - more perhaps than make the confession. There was study of Southey, Wordsworth, and Coleridge as well, for everyone was reading them... Annabella waded through """"Madoc"""". She found some passages wearisome but was convinced that Southey would one day be ranked high """"among the ancient poets"""".'"
