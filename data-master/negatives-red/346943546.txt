"To King's funeral at noon [Alexander King-Clark, Knocker's brother-in-law, who had committed suicide]. R.I.P. he did his bit and I think it is for the best. Lunch at West Hall with Dad. Home for tea. Reading """"Our Admirable Betty"""". Quite good. Bed early. Elsie [Knocker's sister and King-Clark's widow] is splendid.'"
