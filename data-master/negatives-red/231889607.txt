"I must now mention some other books which about this time fell in my way. Among these an odd volume of the """"Spectator"""" deserves particular notice. Where it came from or to whom it belonged, I never knew: I discovered it in my Master's kitchen. On opening it I was struck by the seeming oddity of its contents. As the book promised to give me a little amusement, I forthwith set about reading it. I was at first a good deal mystified about its author, character and design, yet I was much gratified with it.'"
