"Mr Roscoe' to Mary Berry: 'I may almost be said to have past the last ten or twelve days in your society; for having been confined to the house by indisposition, my chief pleasure has been the perusal of Madame du Deffand's Letters with the notes, together with Lord Orford's corespondence, which, of all the books in our language, is the best calculated for the study of a convalescent [...] On the table before me lay the beginning of a letter intended to thank you for the four elegant volumes whch I some time since received, although I have scarcely since this interval of leisure, had time to look into them [goes on to discuss the work in detail].'
