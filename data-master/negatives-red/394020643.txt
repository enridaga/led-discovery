"Now [after 1890] he [Gissing] read books that seemed to have had a direct impact on his development, turning him away from working-class subjects (to which he never returned) and making him more interested in the nihilistic or purely intellectual attitudes of his characters than in those of them who had a Walter Egremont type of social conscience. Thus, he re-read Bourget, on [his friend] Bertz's recommendation looked at J.P. Jacobsen's """"Niels Lyhne"""" and """"Marie Grube"""", reread Turgenev's """"Fathers and Sons"""" (for the seventh time), reread Dostoevski, whom he recomended to his brother but disliked himself, once again mulled over Hardy's """"The Woodlanders"""" and """"The Mayor of Casterbridge"""" (he later said that """"Jude"""" was poor stuff by comparison with these), and began to ponder Ibsen, starting with """"Hedda Gabler"""".'"
