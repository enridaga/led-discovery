"The """"Edinburgh Review"""" will have praised """"Waverley"""" to your hearts content. I think however they left out one of the most affecting parts of the work, which is the return of W. to the Barons, and the conduct of the poor innocent David Gellatley. Surely there is no doubt but that Walter Scott is the principal Author of it. The learned here do not affect to speak of it as belonging to anyone else -- I read """"The Lord of the Isles"""" last night it being lent me for the Evening. There is some beautiful description indeed in it, particlarly to my fancy a barren scene in one of the Isles. I own I expected more from the two opening cantos than I afterwards found, and on the whole was disappointed. The story of the Page is so hackneyd, and there is nothing to redeem it but a greater power of holding the tongue than is commonly given to Women, and, as in every thing Walter Scott writes one can never feel great interest for the Lover, which one certainly ought to do, Malcolm Graeme in the """"Lady of the Lake"""", """"Waverley"""", and the Lover in """"Marmion"""", and now Ronald, altho' I expected a great deal from him from the opening. I am however in love with the description of Robert Bruce, I think it beautiful. It is very presumptuous in me thus to give my opinion, [particularly as I have this morning heard that Sir James Mackintosh says it is by far the best thing Walter Scott has done, but then he is puffer general particularly to Scotsmen.] ' [Words inside brackets crossed out in original]"
