"?A publication of a different description also fell in my way. Mr Hale was a reader of """"Cobbett?s Weekly Register"""", and as I constantly saw the tract lying on the desk at the beginning of the week, I at length read it, and found within its pages far more matter for reflection than, from its unattractive title and appearance, I had expected to find there. The nervous and unmistakeable English of that work there was so withstanding. I thenceforth became as constant a reader of Cobbett?s writings as was my master himself, and was soon, probably, a more ardent admirer of his doctrines than was my employer.?"
