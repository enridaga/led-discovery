"I had a treat in the shape of a number of the """"Singapore Free Press"""" 2 and a half columns about """"Mr Conrad at home and abroad"""". extremely laudatory but in fact telling me I don't know anything about it. Well I never did set up as an authority on Malaysia. I looked for a medium in which to express myself. I am inexact and ignorant no doubt (most of us are) but I don't think I sinned so recklessly. Curiously enough all the details about the little characteristic  acts and customs which they hold up as proof I have taken out (to be safe) from undoubted sources--dull,wise books.'"
