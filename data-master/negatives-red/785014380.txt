" [Johnson said of Goldsmith] """"Take him as a poet, his 'Traveller' is a very fine performance; ay, and so is his 'Deserted Village,' were it not sometimes too much the echo of his 'Traveller.' Whether, indeed, we take him as a poet,‚Äîas a comick writer,‚Äîor as an historian, he stands in the first class."""" Boswell. """"An historian! My dear sir, you surely will not rank his compilation of the Roman History with the works of other historians of this age ?"""" Johnson. """"Why, who are before him?"""" Boswell. """"Hume, ‚ÄîRobertson,‚ÄîLord Lyttelton."""" Johnson. (His antipathy to the Scotch beginning to rise). """"I have not read Hume; but, doubtless, Goldsmith's 'History' is better than the [italics] verbiage [end italics] of Robertson, or the foppery of Dalrymple."""" Boswell. """"Will you not admit the superiority of Robertson, in whose 'History' we find such penetration‚Äîsuch painting?"""" Johnson. """"Sir, you must consider how that penetration and that painting are employed. It is not history, it is imagination. He who describes what he never saw draws from fancy. Robertson paints minds as Sir Joshua paints faces in a history piece: he imagines an heroick countenance. You must look upon Robertson's work as romance, and try it by that standard. History it is not. Besides, sir, it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will hold. Goldsmith has done this in his 'History'. Now Robertson might have put twice as much into his book. Robertson is like a man who has packed gold in wool: the wool takes up more room than the gold. No, sir; I always thought Robertson would be crushed by his own weight,‚Äîwould be buried under his own ornaments. Goldsmith tells you shortly all you want to know: Robertson detains you a great deal too long. No man will read Robertson's cumbrous detail a second time; but Goldsmith's plain narrative will please again and again. I would say to Robertson what an old tutor of a college said to one of his pupils: 'Read over your compositions, and wherever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out.' Goldsmith's abridgement is better than that of Lucius Florus or Eutropius; and I will venture to say, that if you compare him with Vertot, in the same places of the Roman History, you will find that he excels Vertot.""""'"
