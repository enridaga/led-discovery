"""""I have hardly read a book except for strictly professional purposes for 3 months & more. One of the few I have read is Dixon's New America. I should like to know what you think of it. It has been a great success here having already passed six editions & being undeniably amusing. My own opinion about it is perhaps coloured by my opinion of Dixon, wh. I further believe to be almost the universal opinion? I think him an offensive snob. ? I think that his book is flashy & written entirely for effect & would probably give to most people a highly incorrect notion. Especially I fancy that he absurdly exaggerates the numbers & importance of Shakers, Junkers, &c&c &c even of Mormons ? but most of all the Spiritualists. Also, though his facts may be right, I should guess the colouring to be wrong. You may tell me what you think if you take the trouble to read the book; but I believe it will give to most English readers the impression that nearly all Americans believe in Spirittrapping, that most of them are either disbelievers in matrimony & hell ? or practisers of polygamy and that a large number live in queer phalansteries or other Socialist contrivances.?
