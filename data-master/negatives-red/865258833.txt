"He [Tennyson] would always talk of Thackeray's novels, Esmond, Pendennis, and The Newcomes as being """"delicious; they are so mature. But now the days are so full of false sentiment that, as Thackeray said, one cannot draw a man as he should be."""" He would read and re-read them as well as Walter Scott's and Miss Austen's novels. His comments on Walter Scott and Miss Austen were: """"Scott is the most chivalrous literary figure of this century and the author with the widest range since Shakespeare.  I think Old Mortality is his greatest novel. The realism and life-likeness of Miss Austen's Dramatis Personae come nearest to those of Shakespeare. Shakespeare however is a sun to which Jane Austen, tho' a bright and true little world, is but an asteroid.""""'"
