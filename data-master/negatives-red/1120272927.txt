"This """"new direction"""" [in literature], Larkin was beginning to realize, would depend on subtlety as well as candour - the sort of approach he was learning to associate with other writers he now re-read, or read for the first time. With Henry Green and Virginia Woolf (he admired """"The Waves""""); with Julian Hall, whose novel of public school life """"The Senior Commoner"""" he approved for its """"general atmosphere of not shoing one's feelings in public""""; and with Katherine Mansfield. """"I do admire her a great deal"""", he told Sutton, """"and feel very close to her in some things"""".'"
