"Humphry James is good. Is he very deep or very simple? And by the bye R. Bridges is a poet.  I'm damned if he ain't! There's more poesy in one page of """"Shorter Poems"""" than in the whole volume of Tennyson. This is my deliberate opinion. And what a descriptive power! The man hath wings--sees from on high.'"
