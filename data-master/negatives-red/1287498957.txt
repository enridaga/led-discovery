"In postscript to his letter of 3 July 1897 to Ellen Temple Hunter, Henry James tells anecdote about 'yesterday afternoon', in which, after having been 'reading the delightful letters of [...] Edward Fitzgerald (""""Omar Khayyam"""") and, just finishing a story in one of them about his relations with a boatman of Saxmundham,' he went for a walk along the Bournemouth coast where he met, and got into conversation with, a 'sea-faring man' who turned out to have come from Saxmundham, and whose brother had been the boatman Fitzgerald had written of (he goes on to mention the further coincidence of coming home to find a letter from Hunter dated from Saxmundham)."
