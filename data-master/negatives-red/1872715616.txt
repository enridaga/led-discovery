"Dear Mrs Oliphant, - It is with ceaseless admiration that I have read 'The Duke's Daughter'.  My remembrance of what you had told me respecting the origin of your inclination to undertake the narrative put me into the mood for studying it, if so one may speak, instead of too placidly 'reading' your delightful pages, and the effect of this special care was such as to make me think more - more even than ever before - of what - distinguished from 'fancy' - I should call that sound, healthy, that strong Imagination of yours which tells you, and lets you tell others, the very, very truth."
