"There is an old English and Latin book of poems by Barclay, called """"The Ship of Fools""""; at the end of which are a number of [italics] Eglogues [end italics]; so he writes it, from [italics] Egloga [end italics], which are probably the first in our language. If you cannot find the book I will get Mr Dodsley to send it to you'."
