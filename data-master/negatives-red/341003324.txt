"I have just finished Trelawney's Adventures of a Younger Brother. It is a book that excites whilst reading, and leaves behind it, many painful feelings. A true radical spirit runs thoughout it; - a contempt of all establishments, social, political, or religious; - a mad ferocity of disposition that causes the narrative to be filled with details of atrocious murders, so minutely described that ones flesh creeps upon ones bones whilst reading. Yet - to give even the devil his due, he has succeeded in drawing a female character of surpassing loveliness, purity, and tender faithfulness. He makes her an Arab however, that European women may take no pride to themselves from the favourable description he gives of her.'"
