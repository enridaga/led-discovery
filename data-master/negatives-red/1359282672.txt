"Sir, I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of a volume of poems which Messrs. Longman transmitted to me a few days since, and for which I am indebted to your politeness. I have been very much pleased with Miss Mitford's poems generally, and many passages I think excellent.  In particular I was delighted to see her muse busy in Northumberland, the scenery of which in many parts is well worthy of a poet.'"
