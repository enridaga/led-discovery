"I read Bailly's memoires d'un temoin de la revolution, with little comfort.  The book is not ill-written: but it grieved me to see the august historian of astronomy, the intimate of Kepler, Gallileo & Newton- """"thrown into tumult, raptur'd or alarm'd,"""" at the approbation or the blame of Parisian tradesmen - not to speak of the """"pouvres ouvriers"""" [poor workers], as he fondly names the dogs, du faubourg St Antoine."
