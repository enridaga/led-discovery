"Feeling low-spirited and headachy. Drank half a bottle of white wine at the reform and read 150 pages of Men like Gods by H. G. Wells. I can't understand Turner thinking the book bad. H.G's idea of Utopia(rather a garden-shrub world) isn't altogether my taste, but the fresh and hopeful vigour of the book roused my enthusiasm, and made me long to escape into a cleaner and more civilised future."
