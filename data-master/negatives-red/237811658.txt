"Early in December [1858] we removed, with our household, to """"The Priory"""" at Reigate, belonging to Earl Somers [...] we were glad to enjoy the repose and seclusion which the place afforded. A huge library, filled with old books, formed an attractive feature in """"The Priory,"""" and many a spare hour was passed by Grote in exploring its treasures, perched upon the steps of the lofty ladder, candle in hand.'"
