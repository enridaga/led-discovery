"Growing up in a family that read newspapers only for sport and scandal, Vernon Scannell knew all the great prize fighters by age thirteen, """"but I could not have named the Prime Minister of the day..."""" The history and geography he was taught at school were never related to contemporary events. Remarkably, Scannell had read widely about the last war: the poetry of Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, Edmund Blunden's """"Undertones of War"""", and Robert Graves's """"Goodbye to All That"""". The Penguin edition of """"A Farewell to Arms"""" so overwhelmed him that he tried to write his own Great War novel in a Hemingway style. But none of this translated into any awareness that another war might be on the way'."
