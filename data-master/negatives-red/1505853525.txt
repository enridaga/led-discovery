"?Of him [lodger ? a Wesleyan minister] I had the loan of a work which I had indeed previously read; but of which I was not tired, nor I believe ever should be. This was the ?Journal? of that great and good man, the Rev. J. Wesley. I have long regarded it as being equal in interest to Mr Boswell?s ?Life of Dr Johnson? although its contents are, of course, very dissimilar. I also read many of his other works in the course of the two years during which our lodgers remained with us. I may just observe that Mr Wesley?s style of writing is eminently concise and clear; well adapted to the capacity of the uneducated reader.? "
