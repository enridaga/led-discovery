"Charlotte Bronte to William Smith Williams, 10 January 1850: 'I have received and perused the """"Edinburgh Review"""" [containing negative review of """"Shirley"""" by her friend G. H. Lewes] -- it is very brutal and savage.  I am not angry with Lewes -- but I wish in future he would let me alone -- and not write again what makes me feel so cold and sick as I am feeling just now --' "
