"James Williams admitted that, growing up in rural Wales, """"I'd read anything rather than not read at all. I read a great deal of rubbish, and books that were too 'old', or too 'young' for me"""". He consumed the Gem, Magnet and Sexton Blake as well as the standard boys' authors (Henty, Ballantyne, Marryat, Fenimore Cooper, Twain) but also Dickens, Scott, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, even Prescott's """"The Conquest of Peru"""" and """"The Conquest of Mexico"""". He picked """"The Canterbury Tales"""" out of an odd pile of used books for sale, gradually puzzled out the Middle English, and eventually adopted Chaucer as his favourite poet'."
