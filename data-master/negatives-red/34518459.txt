"I return """"The Moon and Sixpence"""" and your criticism.  I agree with your criticism but I do not think that you have laid sufficient [? stress] on the positive qualities of the book.  Any how, I read it with interest, and I think the Tahiti chapters are really very good.  Also the man has a sardonic crude humour which pleaseth me.'"
