"Harriet Martineau, on her research for a story to be set in Ceylon: 'I gathered what I could from books, but really feared being obliged to give up a singularly good illustrative scene for want of the commonest facts concerning the social life of the Cingalese.  I found scarcely anything even in Maria Graham and Heber.  At this precise time, a friend happened to bring to my lodging [...] Sir Alexander Johnstone, who had just returned from governing Ceylon [...] Before we had known one another half an hour, I confided to him my difficulty.  He started of [...] and was soon at the door again, with his carriage full of books, prints and other illustrations [...] Among the volumes he left with me was a Columbo almanack, which furnished me with names, notices of customs, and other valuable matters.'"
