"He [Conrad] one or twice said that when he was going down Ratcliffe Highway [from the City to Limehouse, East End of London] he was jumped out at from a doorway by a gentleman who presented him with a copy of the English Bible. This was printed on rice paper. He used the leaves for rolling cigarettes, but before smoking always read the page. So, he said, he learnt English.' "
