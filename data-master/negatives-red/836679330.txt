"Each day there is a """"Budget"""" published, the work of the more literary and energetic of our members, chiefly consisting of the various """"officials"""" taken from the German papers, with leading articles on any special bits of news. There is also a monthly production with short stories and illustrations which is wonderfully good. The summer number is just out, and there is a hit at me under """"Things We Want to Know"""": whether """"Joy Riding in an aeroplane over imperfectly known country is not an overrated amusement?""""'"
