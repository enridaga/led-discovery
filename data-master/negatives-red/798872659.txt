"?For stories, anecdotes, for something lively and telling, I ransacked my father?s theological magazines, with but small success. Two books of his, however, I found greatly helpful. Todd?s """"Student?s Manual"""" and an odd volume on Channing?s works. The """"Manual"""" was a handy little book, full of useful links and suggestions on reading, writing and study. Still more hopeful and inspiring was Channing. That such an author should be in my father?s possession in those days was in itself remarkable? This volume of Channing, which so profited and delighted me, contained essays on Milton, Napoleon and F?nelon. These I read with attention; more than once I read them ? that on Milton many times over. The style took my fancy. Compared, indeed, with the great masters of English prose, the critic would no doubt detect failings not a few in Channing. But I was not a critic; and the clear, easy, simple words, the rhythmic phrases, pleased my ear, while the sentiments always pure, generous, lofty ? impressed me heart and understanding.?"
