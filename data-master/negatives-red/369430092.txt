"Thomas Burke on reading The Bookman as teenager, in Son of London (1947, 1948): """"'I lived through each month for it; after each issue I was looking impatiently for the next.  It was my only peep-hole into ...  the world where I was at home ... Its gossip, its reviews, its portraits ... its studies of the figures of English literature, and its publisher's advertisements, it was my Magic Lantern."""""
