He marks the the doctrine """"that we ought to be more afraid of wronging than of being wronged, and that the prime business of every man is, not to seem good, but to be good, in all his private and public dealings"""" with three pencil lines, and writes]: """"This just and noble conclusion atones for much fallacy in the reasoning by which Socrates arrived at it [...] it is impossible not to consider it [the Gorgias] as one of the greatest performances which have descended to us from that wonderful generation."""""
