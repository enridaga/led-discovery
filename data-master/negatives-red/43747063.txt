"?Amid these dark middle ages of novel literature, Miss Burney?s Evelina strikes us with the first gleam of ?rescued nature and reviving sense.? Her novels, all her novels, impress us with an indescribable sense of their nationality. They could not have been written by any but an Englishwoman. Her sense is English, her humour is English, her character is English, so inveterately, untranslatably English, as to be absolutely unintelligible to any but those who have deeply studied the English character.?"
