" [Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Plato's Republic]: """"Plato has been censured with great justice for his doctrine about the community of women and the exposure of children.  But nobody, as far as I remember, has done justice to him on one important point.  No ancient politician appears to have thought so highly of the capacity of women, and to have been inclined to make them so important."""""
