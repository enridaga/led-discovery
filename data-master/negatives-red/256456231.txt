" [Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Plato's Republic, by the passage where Plato recommends a broader patriotism]: """"This passage does Plato great honour.  Philhellenism is a step towards philanthropy.  There is an enlargement of mind in this work which I do not remember to have found in any earlier composition, and in very few ancient works, either earlier or later."""""
