"I have had put into my Hand the First Copy of Pope's Pastorals, with the gradual Alterations and Emendations marked in the Margin: that he should Attain to Perfection by repeated Touches, & slow Degrees, is not at all strange tho' 'tis curious; it is however odd enough that a Man should be so [italics] imbued [end italics] with the classicks as to write Love Verses from one Shepherd to another, because Virgil wote his Corydon & Alexis; The Third Pastoral runs all thro' with the name Thyrsis instead of Delia in the Book before me'."
