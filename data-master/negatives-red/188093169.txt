"In [""""Ciceronianus"""" (published 1577; delivered c.1575)] [...] Harvey says he has been for nearly twenty weeks in his Tusculan villa, i.e. at his father's house in Saffron Walden, assiduously studying not only the greatest of the old Roman writers, but renaissance writers such as Sturm, Manutius, Osorius, Sigonius and Buchanan.  He had given more time to Cicero than to all the rest put together, yet sometimes he had dropped Cicero on Friendship to take up Osorius on Glory'."
