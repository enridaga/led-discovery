"Read the Clementina part of """"Sir Charles Grandison"""". I have never met with anything which affected me so powerfully; at present I feel disposed to place this work above all other works of fiction I know. It is very, very grand, and has, I think, a greater practical effect on me for good than anything I ever read in my life.'"
