"Nietzsche is one of the very few philosophers who remain poets in the midst of their philosophising; perhaps he is the only one. His words are often as near to actual living as it is possible for words to be - they are very nearly made of flesh. Often, when reading Nietzsche, one feels as if one were on a high hill in a bright windy day; we are always aware of action, space and an atmosphere which is best rendered by the word """"caller"""". We may call Nietzsche's philosophy pantomimic - every word is a bold gesture, a moment in a noble dance.'"
