"A new officer has been censoring our letters the last two days. I fancy the C.O. gave orders that they were to be much more strict. He seems needlessly and brutally inquisitive, asking as he looks at the signatures, """"Who's this fellow?"""" """"Who's so-and-so?"""" """"What woman's this, your sweetheart?"""" and so on, reading through every word of the letters, and laying down his dictum, """"Nothing connected with your beliefs, peace, your position here, etc."""" &mdash; I hardly know what he expects one's friends to write about.'"
