"I have just read Dugald Stewart's """"Preliminary Dissertations"""". In the first place, it is totally clear of all his defects. No insane dread of misrepresentation; no discussion put off until another time, just at the moment it was expected, and would have been interesting; no unmanly timidity; less formality of style and cathedral pomp of sentence. The good, it would be trite to enumerate: - the love of human happiness and virtue, the ardour for the extension of knowledge, the command of fine language, happiness of allusion, varied and pleasing literature, tact, wisdom and moderation! Without these high qualities, we all know Stewart cannot write. I suspect he has misrepresented Horne Took, and his silence regarding Hartley is very censurable. I was amazingly pleased with his comparison of the universities to enormous hulks confined with mooring chains, everything flowing and progressing around them. Nothing can be more happy'."
