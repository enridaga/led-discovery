""""I should have imagined (replied Dr Adams) that Lord Chesterfield would have concealed it"""". """"Poh! (said Dodsley) do you think a letter from Johnson could hurt Lord Chesterfield? Not at all, Sir. It lay upon his table where any body might see it. He read it to me; said, 'this man has great powers', pointed out the severest passages, and observed how well they were expressed"""".'"
