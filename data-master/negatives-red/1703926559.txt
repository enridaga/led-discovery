"I doubt if you ought to call France & Flaubert """"dry"""". """"L‚ÄôEducation Sentimentale"""" ought to be read with ease.  Ditto """"Thais"""", & """"La Rotisserie"""".  Personally, though, I think France over-rated.  You ought to read """"Bubu de Montparnasse"""" of Charles Louis Philippe.  This is a great little novel, one of the finest modern French novels.  I think """"Coeur simple"""" is the best thing Flaubert ever wrote, except his correspondence, which is his best work, & ought to be read.  I tell you that Lytton Strachey‚Äôs """"Eminent Victorians"""" is a most juicy & devastating affair, I thoroughly enjoyed it.'"
