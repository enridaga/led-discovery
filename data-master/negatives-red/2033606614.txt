" [Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Plato's Protagoras]: """"Protagoras seems to deserve the character he gives himself.  Nothing can be more courteous and generous than his language.  Socrates shows abundance of talent and acuteness in this dialogue; but the more I read of his conversation, the less I wonder at the fierce hatred he provoked.  He evidently had an ill-natured pleasure in making men, - particularly men famed for wisdom and eloquence, - look like fools."""" [the comments continue at some length.]"
