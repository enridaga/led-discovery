"In 1835, [James] Edwards [Sewell, reader's brother] [...] had the curacy of Hursley.  Mr. Gilbert Heathcote held the living, and Ellen [reader's sister] and I were sent to Hursley [...] whilst Lucy [reader's friend] was ill.  We were at the old vicarage [...] [Mr. Heathcote's books] were very kindly left for our use, and I made an acquaintance with Sir Walter Scott's """"Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk"""", and read Shakespeare to Ellen, and led a quiet life, seeing no one.'"
