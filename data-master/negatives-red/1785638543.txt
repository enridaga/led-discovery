"Miss Bronte in one of her letters to you (Mama [italics] thinks [end italics] written in the year 1835,) gives you some advice as to what books to read. Mama wants to know how Miss Bronte can have become acquainted with the books that she mentions to you. From Keighley Mama knows she could get novels but where such standard works as Miss Bronte refers to in her letters were obtained is a puzzle to Mama. At Haworth Mama says she did not see many books except quite new ones that had been given to Miss Bronte since she became famous. If you would kindly let her know all you know.'"
