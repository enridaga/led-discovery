"Extracted by G. C. Moore Smith from J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps, """"Memoranda on the Tragedy of Hamlet""""(1879): 'There was once in existence a copy of Speght's edition of Chaucer, 1598, with manuscript notes by Gabriel Harvey, one of those notes being in the following terms: -- """"The younger sort take much delight in Shakespear's Venus and Adonis, but his Lucrece and his tragedy of Hamlet Prince of Denmark have it in them to please the wiser sort.""""'"
