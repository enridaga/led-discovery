"[Having written an ode in the manner of Horace, she showed it to her husband who had also written one and] 'who, contrary to my Expectation (for I imagin'd he would be pleas'd), was very angry, and told me the Dean had made me mad, that the Lines were nonsense, and that a Needle became a Woman's Hand better than a Pen and Ink. So to bring him into Temper I prais'd his Ode highly, and threw my own into the Fire'. [the ode is reprinted on pp49-50]"
