"at ten o'clock yesterday evening little Jem Parsons (the cabin boy), and his friend the black terrier, came on deck, and sat themselves on a gun-carriage, to read by the light of the moon.  I looked at the boy's book, (the terrier, I suppose, read over the other's shoulder,) and found that it was """"The Sorrows of Werter"""". I asked who had lent him such a book, and whether it amused him?  He said that it had been made a present to him, and so he had read it almost through, for he had got to Werter's dying; though, to be sure, he did not understand it all, nor like very much what he understood; for he thought the man a great fool for killing himself for love.  I told him I thought that every man a great fool who killed himself for love or for any thing else: but he had no books but """"The Sorrows of Werter""""? - oh dear yes, he said, he had a great many more; but he had got """"The Adventures of a Louse"""", which was a very curious book, indeed; and he had got besides """"The Recess"""", and """"Valentine and Orson"""", and """"Roslin Castle"""", and a book of Prayers, just like the Bible; but he could not but say that he liked """"The Adventures of a Louse"""" the best of any of them.'"
