". . .  I send you a book which I picked up as a bargain in the catalogue of a second-hand bookseller,  You will see that under the headings of the different countries it gives on each double page a complete conspectus of all important events which happened during a given period.  I consider it a work which is absolutely invaluable to the novelist who deals, however indirectly or briefly, with any past period, And I have used it constantly ever since I bought a copy of the original publication about twelve years ago.'
