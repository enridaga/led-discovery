"I have also read the Modern Philosophers, which in spight [sic] of a little vulgarity & too much sameness, I like extremely.  Julia's character is beautiful & tho' Harriet Orwell gives one rather too much the idea of a blushing maid with a workbag, & I cannot fancy anything very romantic in the way of love--with an apothecary, yet her character is, I think, extremely well drawn & I like Bridgetina very much.'"
