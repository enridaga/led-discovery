"When looking at Hacker's """"Annunciation"""" I was especially attracted by the water-pot, and said as much in my letter to L-. Afterwards, from Jung, I learned how much symbolism has gathered about the """"vas"""". I learned from Jung also why I chose the whale as a symbol in """"Stanzas on Time"""" and in the bairn-rhyme """"The Whale"""". Sunch an illuminating explanation of one;s own intuitive choosing is startling.'"
