"[Editorial commentary on Macaulay's reading]: """"His manuscript notes extend through the long range of Greek authors from Hesiod to Athenaeus, and of Latin authors from Cato the Censor,  - through Livy, and Sallust, and Tacitus, and Aulus Gellius, and Suetonius, -down to the very latest Augustan histories."""""
