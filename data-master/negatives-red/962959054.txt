"It is a considerable time since I saw Leslie's review of La Place'[s] essay on chances - and remarked with considerable surprise - the bold avowall of his sentiments on Hume's doctrine - """"The Christian Instructor"""" attacks him with considerable asperity - and, I think, success. Hume's essays, I have not read - and therefore cannot condemn - The evidence of testimony, too, no doubt has its limits -  But as far as I can judge, all that is urged either by La Place or His reviewer - does not at all affect Christianity.'
