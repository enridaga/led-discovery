"Henry James to H. G. Wells, 29 January 1900: 'It was very graceful of you to send me your book -- I mean the particular masterpiece entitled """"The Time Machine"""", after I had so ungracefully  sought it at your hands [...] You are very magnificent [...] I re-write you, much, as I read -- which is the highest tribute my damned impertinence can pay an author.'"
