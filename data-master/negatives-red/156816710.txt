"?Another book, by the way, worth a glance is a collection of old S. T. Coleridge?s letters. I have had to write the beggar?s life & have a rather morbid familiarity with his history wh. makes me appreciate better than some people his amazing wriggling & self-reproaches & astonishing pouring out of unctuous twaddlings. After all Carlyle?s portrait of him has done the thing unsurpassably well & it is impossible to add much to it. But there are some delicious bits in this.?"
