"I had read every line of several volumes of the 'Home Magazine' -especially a grotesque serial called 'The Wallypug of Why', an enjoyable fantasy about the plots of a cathedral gargoyle: also bits from the 'Children's Encyclopaedia', 'Hereward the Wake', comics and 'Marriage on Two Hundred a Year', one of the popular handbooks of the period."
