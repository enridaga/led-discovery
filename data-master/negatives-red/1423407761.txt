"Mr Donaldson has seen my will too with your name written in it in great letters.  No matter!  why should I be ashamed of shewing an affection which I am not ashamed to feel- But we will talk over all these things when we meet- It will take all your indulgence to excuse this breathless letter- God bless you my darling.'"
