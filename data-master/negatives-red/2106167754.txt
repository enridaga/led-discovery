"With the same amusement [of secret knowledge about Scott's authorship] I now sit by the fire, sucking in the sagacious remarks I hear. Says one, who has a favourite relation that writes - what nobody reads - """"I am clear this is not by the author of """"Waverley""""; it is too good. """"Waverley"""" was certainly Scott's: now Scott could not write this, it is above him, and there is not that constant description of scenery that makes him so tiresome"""".'"
