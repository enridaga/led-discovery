"""""The young [John] Rogers had 'read every day,' he recalled ... He learned his catechism by heart ... wrote down the sermons and learned those too ... memorized morning and evening prayers 'out of a book, for I knew no better yet.'  All this reading threw Rogers into despair over his prospects of salvation ... Distraught, he 'took the Bible,' turned to the relevant pages, and 'read them over and over and over again.'"""""
