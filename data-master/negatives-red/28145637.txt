"A much greater man than Rousseau says, """"The only remedy for the infectious disease of Fanaticism, is a philosophical temper, which spreading through society, at length softens manners, and obviates the excesses of the distemper; for whenever it get ground, the best way is to fly from it and stay till the air is purified. The laws and religion are no preservative against this mental pestilence; religion so far from being a salutary aliment in these cases, in infected brains becomes poison"""" (Lackington continues to quote 2 further paragraphs)."
