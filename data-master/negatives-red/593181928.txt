Federico notes anecdote in Kent Carr's 1901 biography of Marie Corelli, in which it is reported that New Zealand and Australian soliders in South Africa during the Boer War 'came across a stray copy of The Soul of Lilith on the veld and tore out each page after it was read to pass along to the next man in the troop.'"
