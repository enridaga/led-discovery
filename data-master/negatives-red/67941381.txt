"Later on I found at the bottom of a cupboard some of volumes -Addison's """"Spectator"""", Pope's """"Homer"""", and a few other things. My grandmother -who also devoured books in great gulps -gave me a """"Robinson Crusoe"""", and lent me volumes containing four """"Waverley Novels"""" apiece. Much about the same time my father got bound up a set of Dickens's novels he had bought in weekly parts. They were in the popular quarto edition with drawings by Fred Barnard, John Mahony and others. These were a real treasure -and all the more so as my father was an ardent Dickens """"fan"""" who rather despised Scott as a """"romantic"""" and a """"Tory"""". His mother (born in 1815, so old enough to have read the """"Waverley Novels"""" when they were still comparatively new things) rather sniffed at Dickens, and definitely preferred both Scott and Thackeray. She gave me """"Vanity Fair"""" as an antidote to """"David Copperfield"""" and added a Shakespeare, and a bundle of """"paperback"""" editions -Fielding, Smollett, Fennimore Cooper and Captain Marryatt.'"
