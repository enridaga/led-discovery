"Thanks for the book. You know what I think of it in so far as I have been able to express it. I did not do it very well. There is a singular fascination about this last volume of the trilogy. I've been dropping into it ever since it came and I am as far as ever from discovering a particularly precise  formula of my admiration.'"
