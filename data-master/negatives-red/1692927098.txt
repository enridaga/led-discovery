"Many thanks for the two copies, especially the grand format, of Crane's biography. Both sizes are very attractively got up. I very well like your fount and the spacing of the lines. I am going to drop a few lines to Mr Beer to congratulate him on his achievement. It is a live book, more so than any biography I ever read.'"
