"I finish reading """"The Escaping Club"""" by A.J. Evans; it is very interesting, but what a contrast to our lot and treatment. He got so many food parcels from home, plus what he could buy (his pay from the Germans was 100 marks a month), that he never touched the German rations. And when they got dried fish they threw it away.'"
