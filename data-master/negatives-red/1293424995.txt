"William Wordsworth to R. P. Gillies, 22 December 1814: 'Mr. Hogg's Badlew (I suppose it to be his) I could not get through.  There are two pretty passages; the flight of the deer, and the falling of the child from the rock of Stirling, though both are a little outre.  But the story is coarsely conceived, and in my judgement, as coarsely executed ... the versification harsh and uncouth.' "
