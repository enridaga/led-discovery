"What a fine Book is """"Law's Serious Call""""! written with such force of Thinking, such purity of Style, & such penetration into human Nature; the Characters too so neatly, nay so highly finished: yet nobody reads it I think, from the Notion of its being a Religious work most probably. Johnson has however studied it hard I am sure, & many of the Ramblers apparently took their Rise from that little Volume, as the Nile flows majestically from a Source dificult to be discovered or even discerned.'"
