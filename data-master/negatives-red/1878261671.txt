"Bookbinder Frederick Rogers read Faust """"through from beginning to end, not because I was able at sixteen to appreciate Goethe, but because I was interested in the Devil"""". Moving on to Don Quixote, """"I did not realise its greatness till long after; but its stories of adventure and its romance and humour appealed to me strongly enough"""".'"
