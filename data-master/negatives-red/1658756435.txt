"[Alice Foley] read some Morris and less Marx, but for her a liberal education for the proletariat was not merely a means of achieving socialism: it was socialism in fact. At night school she staged a personal revolution by writing a paper on Romeo and Juliet and thriling to the """"new romantic world"""" of Jane Eyre. She joined a Socialist Sunday School where 'Hiawatha' was recited for its """"prophetic idealism"""", and a foundry hammerman intoned Keats's 'Eve of St Agnes and 'Ode on a Grecian Urn'."
