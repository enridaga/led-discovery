"Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal, Thursday 11 February, 1802: 'We made up a good fire after dinner, and William brought his Mattress out, and lay down on the floor. I read to him the life of Ben Jonson, and some short poems of his, which were too interesting for him, and would not let him go to sleep.  I had begun with Fletcher, but he was too dull for me.'"
