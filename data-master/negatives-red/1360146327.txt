"It was in my fifteenth year that I became again, this time intelligently, aquainted with Shakespeare. I got hold of a single play, """"The Tempest"""", in a school edition, prepared, I suppose, for one of the university examinations which were then being instituted in the provinces. This I read through and through, not disdaining the help of the notes, and revelling in the glossary. I studied """"The Tempest"""" as I had hitherto studied no classic work, and it filled my whole being with music and romance. This book was my own hoarded possession; the rest of Shakespeare's works were beyond my hopes.'"
