"My dear sir [...] Your daughter's very amiable and interesting book is quite a refreshment to my spirit, wearied on the one hand by labour and on the other by pain; for it would be in vain to tell you how I have occupied my mind on the before-mentioned theme, and this was the very volume to lead me sweetly and softly from myself to many charming scenes, conducted by the hand of virtue and genius.  Where all are amiable, it is hard to select, but the poem addressed to yourself (page 70), and that part of the """"Epistle to a Friend"""" which contains the subject beginning with the line, """"How true the wish, how pure the glow,"""" to the end of the passage, went nearest to my affections.'"
