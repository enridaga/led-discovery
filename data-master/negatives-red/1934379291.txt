"At breakfast, my parcel of books from Eaton came up the road.  Fresh from the carrier.  Unpacked it eagerly, & read the title pages of Barnes?s Euripides, Marcus Antoninus, Callimachus, the Anthologia, Epictetus, Isocrates, & Da Vinci?s Painting.  The last I had sent for, for Eliza Cliffe, but the externals are so shabby that I have a mind to send it back again.  Finished my dream about Udolpho; - & began Destiny, a novel by the author of the Inheritance [Susan Ferrier] which Miss Peyton lent me.  I liked the Inheritance so much that my desires respecting this book were ?all alive?.  I forgot to say that I don?t like the conclusion of the Mysteries.  It is ?long drawn out? & not ?in linked sweetness?.  Read some of the Alcestis.  Mr. Boyd wishes me to read it; & I wished so too."
