"I am amusing myself with Miss Austin's [sic] novels.  She has great power and discrimination in delineating common-place people; and her writings are a capital picture of real life, with all the little wheels and machinery laid bare like a patent clock.  But she explains and fills out too much.  Those who have not power to fill up gaps and bridge over chasms as they read, must therefore take particular delight in such minuteness of detail.  It is a kind of Bowditch's Laplace in the romantic astronomy.  But readers of lively imagination naturally prefer the original with its unexplained steps, which they so readily supply.'"
