"In the evening read the last volume of """"Emma"""", a novel evincing great good sense, and an acute observation of human life, but it is not interesting.  One cares little for Harriet, the kind-hearted girl who falls in love with three men in a year, and yet hers is the best conceived character after all.  Emma, the heroine, is little more than a clever woman who does foolish things - makes mistakes for others, and is at last caught unawares herself.  We hear rather too much about fools: the kind-hearted but weak father, the silly chattering Miss Bates, who gabbles in the style of polite conversation, and the vulgar impertinence of the Eltons.'"
