"Letters bring Lady M. W. M[ontagu] into my head, which I now do not confess in public ever to have read, for they are deemed so naughty by all the world, that one must keep up one's reputation for modesty, and try to blush whenever they are mentioned.

But how the discreet Lady Louisa S[tuart]t could sanction this, I cannot guess'. [he then comments at length on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]"
