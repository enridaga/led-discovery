"It occurred to me lately to read Dante again &, as I required a crib very constantly I took yours & by its help went through the whole. It suggested to me innumerable speculations upon which I should have liked to ask your questions? I should have liked to know, to suggest only one question, what Dante himself really believed? That is, of course, unanswerable; but I should like to get a little nearer to an answer at all conceivable to me.'"
