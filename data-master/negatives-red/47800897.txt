"My instinct first led me to Dharmsala [sic], for many years the home of my uncle Robert Shaw who [...] was the first Englishman to push his way way right through the Himalayas to the plains of Turkestan beyond. Here [in his house] I found [...] books [...] and maps and old manuscripts. I was among the relics of an explorer,at the very house in which he had planned his explorations[...]. I pored over the old books and maps, and talked for hours with the old servants, till the spirit of exploration gradually entered my soul, and I rushed off on a preliminary tour on foot in the direction of Tibet, and planned a great journey into that country for the following year.'"
