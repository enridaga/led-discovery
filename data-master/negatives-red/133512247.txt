"I allude to my old friend, and your acquaintance, the Ettrick Shepherd (for I will not mention him by the unpoetical name of Mr James Hogg) who is now, you will perceive by the enclosure, venturing upon the public with a collection of ballads. Some of them, if I (myself a ballad-monger) may be permitted to judge, have a very uncommon share of poetical merit'. [Walter Scott goes on to tell Charlotte Bury that he is attempting to raise a subscription for Hogg and he hopes she will use her influence to gain subscribers]."
