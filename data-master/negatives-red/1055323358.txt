"When I reached home someone had dropped a letter in the box telling me to come over on Sunday between eleven and twelve because she would be at home then. I went, we went for lunch, went to the Student Movement House and read magazines and talked about them between for and eight, and then six of us met in her room and read Pirandello's Six characters in search of an author ... That is the sort of thing that is happening day after day. That is, of course, if you want it. If you want to go dancing you can ... But if you want to live the intellectual life Bloomsbury is the place."
