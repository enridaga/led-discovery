"I had a long conversation in the tram yesterday with an old maid who had just come back from Florence & talked about pictures, & when I said that I thought Giotto was more decorative than Holbein she... quoted my own """"Holbein"""" against me, without knowing my name... But I think she had a shrewd suspicion that I was... Maurice Hewlett. For she said that someone in the Hotel Montfleuris had pointed me out as """"writing"""" & immediately began to rave about [underlined] """"Little Novels from Italy"""" [end underlining]. So I got off at the next stopping place - at little Africa.'"
