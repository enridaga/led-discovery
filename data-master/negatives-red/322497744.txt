"Early examples of [Gabriel Harvey's] marginalia in [the fields of cosmology and astronomy] are found in the large 1527 folio containing Sacrobosco's """"Textus de Sphaera"""", Bonetus's """"Annuli ... super astrologiam"""" [...] and Euclid's first book of geometry translated into Latin by Boethius.  On the title-page is Harvey's signature and the date """"1580"""", which seems to have been the period for many of his annotations in this volume.'"
