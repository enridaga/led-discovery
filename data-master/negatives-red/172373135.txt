"Much is being said and written now-a-days about the influence of books on the formation of character; let me therefore mention that my prime favourites while at Tait's were """"Cobbett's advice to young men"""", and Charles Knight's """"Pursuit of knowledge under difficulties""""; which I read over and over again with great zest, and, I hope, much benefit. As a matter of course, I also read """"Tait's Magazine"""" regularly, making myself familiar with its contents even before publication; the elaborate reviews of many of the best books of the period affording me the opportunity of picking up a considerable amount of useful information. Curiously enough, the reading of the """"Waverley novels"""" was to me a task of difficulty; and I am ashamed to say that I have only read few of them, """"Guy Mannering"""", """"The Heart of Midlothian"""", """"The Bride of Lammermoor"""" and """"St Ronan's Well"""". """"Waverley"""", although attempted more than once, failed to attract.'"
