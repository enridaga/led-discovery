"""""Do you think Job's birthday was the 29th of February 'As for that night let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined to the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.' [....] 'Where wast though when I laid the foundations of the earth? ... Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?' And so on to the end:'Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty answer him? He that reproveth God, let him answer it.'"""""
