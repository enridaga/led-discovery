"[Letter from Boswell to Johnson] Lord Hailes writes to me [...] """"I am singularly obliged to Dr. Johnson for accurate and useful criticisms. Had he given some strictures on the general plan of the work, it would have added much to his favours"""". He is charmed with your verses on Inchkenneth, says they are very elegant, but bids me tell you he doubts whether """" [italics] Legitimat faciunt pectora pura preces [end italics]"""" be according to the rubrick ; but that is your concern; for, you know, he is a Presbyterian.'"
