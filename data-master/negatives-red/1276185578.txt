"When we speak of calculi - I brought home [some f]ew mathematical books, which I must tell you of - Bossuts """"history [of] mathematics"""", Woods """"optics"""", Cunn's """"Euclid"""" and Newton's """"principia"""" constitute my [stock] of this sort - I got Lucans """"Pharsalia"""" also, and some little extracts of Fenelons """"dialogues des morts"""". If there are any of these (except Newton for which you would be [obliged] to wait awhile) that you wish to see - they are ready for you. I had read Bossut before - and have not done much at him of late. Neither have I read any quantity of Wood yet, having been nibbling at the """"Principia"""" (which with all my struggling, I come but ill at understanding - indeed in some places I don't understand it at all) ever since I came home. Of Lucan I have not read above seven lines.' "
