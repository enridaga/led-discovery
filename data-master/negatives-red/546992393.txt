"Macaulay's marginalia in his copy of Hamlet, by the lines 'Dost thou hear?/ Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,/ And could of men distinguish, her election/ Hath sealed thee for herself, - ' : """"An exquisitely beautiful scene. It always moved me more than any other in the play.  There is something very striking in the way in which Hamlet, a man of a gentle nature, quick in speculation, morbidly sluggish in action, unfit to struggle with the real evils of life, and finding himself plunged into the midst of them, - delights to repose on the strong mind of a man who had been severely tried, and who had learned stoicism from experience.  There is wonderful truth in this."""""
