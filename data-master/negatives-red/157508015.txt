"[Mary] Jones particularly admired Pope's letters. In August 1735, not long after the publication of """"Letters of Mr Pope and Several Eminent Persons"""", she wrote Martha Lovelace that """"I've at last had the inexpressible Pleasure of reading Mr Pope's Letters; and am so well satisfied with 'em, that I shall read all future Letters (Except Miss Lovelace's) with a great deal less Pleasure for their sake. In his other Productions I have always admir'd the Author, but now I love the Man"""".'"
