"In the course of the ensuing spring (1821), I read Mr. Washington Irving's """"Sketch-Book"""". I thought it very beautiful, and only wished that he had more fully carried his fine imaginative powers beyond """"this visible diurnal sphere"""". By the way, I must observe a similar defect exists in Akenside's """"Pleasures of the Imagination""""; a poem which in every other respect gives me very great satisfaction. I also read some volumes of the """"London Magazine"""", which I thought to be a very cleverly conducted publication.'"
