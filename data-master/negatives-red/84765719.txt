"What a pity it is that Mr B[entham] carries this oddity of language [which AR has just been joking about] into his works. It makes them unreadible [sic] and of much less use than they otherwise would be. He has just published a singular Book the title of which is """"Bentham on Codification"""", a great deal very excellent, Sir Samuel says, but most injudicious and injurious to the good cause, not only from throwing a ridicule on it, but also from going so much too far, for it is scarcely attempted to be disguised that Republicanism is his great object'."
