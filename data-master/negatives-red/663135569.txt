"[Byron] was reading an article by [Erasmus] Darwin on Diseased Volition (a semi-anticipation of Freud) and pointed out to her [Anne Isabella, his wife] a passage upon the patient's making a mystery of the diseased association, """"which if he could be persuaded to divulge, the effect would cease."""" Acting upon this hint from Darwin, and from him, she led him on to speak of his infirmity [i.e. his club foot]. He came to talk familiarly of his """"little foot"""" (as he called it) and said that some allowance must surely be made to him on the Day of Judgment, that he had often wanted to revenge himself on Heaven for it.'"
