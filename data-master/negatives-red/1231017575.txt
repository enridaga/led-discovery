"The shock last night when Ian was cold and unenthusiastic about the first bit of the book which I'd managed to write. I burnt it. I... hoped he would stop me... He explained how tired he was and unreceptive... that there were good things and it was only too short-circuited. He was right too. I want to start again today but I am stuck... I wrote to please him and he wasn't pleased.'"
