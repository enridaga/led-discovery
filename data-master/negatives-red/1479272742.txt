"Upon one of the interminable book-stalls, or rather book-walls, which displayed their leafy barrens along the quays of the Seine, I picked up a Cobbett's French Grammar for a franc, and a pocket dictionary for another. A fellow lodger lent me a Testament and a Telemaque; and to these materials I applied dogedly from six in the morning til dinnertime. I read the Grammar through first, and then made an abridgement of it on a small pack of plain cards... By these means ... I made rapid progress.'"
