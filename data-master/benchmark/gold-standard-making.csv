A full orchestra, and a large mixed choir of perhaps one hundred and twenty voices, with solo-singers, constituted the musical department for the occasion. The best speakers were employed for the declamation; and the living pictures were under the immediate direction of a committee of the painters of Dusseldorf. The hour arrived, but vain was the attempt to commence. Bacchus had been there, and had obtained such a sway over the sons of Apollo, that music’s voice could not be heard. The orchestra did indeed play, or appeared to play an overture, but not even the loudest passages could be heard, for the vocal shoutings quite overpowered trumpets, trombones, and drums. The speakers, in appropriate costume, came on the stage, but their voices were lost in loud shoutings, and they quickly gave up the contest and retreated. Various attempts were made for nearly an hour to command silence, and obtain a hearing, but in vain.

It was not a public performance, and was without rehearsal. Mr. Hauser was so kind as to allow us to choose what Oratorio should be sung, mentioning Elijah, St. Paul, the Creation, Seasons, and others; we chose Elijah, and it was put down before the choir accordingly, and, by them, quite satisfactorily rendered.

Consequently, there was a fulness, richness, and maturity of voice, and a blending in the chorus; neither of which can be obtained in choirs where boys sing the Soprano.

The music is mostly solo, though some fine chorus effects are produced, especially in a funeral scene, the “burial of a miller’s daughter.” It is, throughout, highly scientific or learned, and of course difficult. A very fine musician, Mr. Richter, teacher of harmony and instrumentation in the conservatory, who was sitting beside me, said, “Robert Schumann is truly a great composer, but his music must be studied, and heard more than once, to be appreciated; we cannot understand it at the first hearing.” His opera, “Genoveva,” failed — it is too learned, and is now seldom performed. He writes for the musicians rather than for the people.",MASONB.txt,"Dr. Eeed's manner is that of a tender parent ; it contrasted strongly with that of the young man we heard in the morning. He was sometimes extravagant in his language, and his manner seems to be adapted rather to drive than to invite, encourage, and lead one along ; there was a severity about it, forbidding, more apt to be found in a young man having great confidence in what he has learned in the seminary, than in one who seems to depend less upon the knowledge which he acquired at school than upon the wisdom which he has derived from experience.

Good music is undoubtedly appreciated by a greater part, comparatively, of the people here, than in America; but if one may judge from appearances at this festival, the majority still prefer a good laugh to good music, and mere comic acting to classic song. We spoke to a German gentleman sitting near, and expressed our disappointment that such rapturous applause should be given to music so unworthy. “Ah!” said he, “that is German way.”",MASONB.txt,"There was another custom which we observed here, that we have not seen elsewhere. Very soon after the people began to assemble for public worship, an elder took his stand in front of the pulpit and commenced reading the Scriptures aloud. This he continued for perhaps fifteen minutes, while the people were assembling, or until the minister had arrived and was quite ready to commence the service. So that the reading of the Scriptures publicly, was treated with less appearance of rever- . ence than are our organ voluntaries in New England ; since it is not the general custom with us to commence the voluntary until after the minister has taken his place in the pulpit. But it seemed strange to see the public reading of the Scriptures employ the coming in of the people, the walking, talking, and other noises of disturbance, and at the same time to see the men with heads covered, or hats on, in tjie house of Qod.

There are two societies meeting in Exeter Hall; the Sacred Harmonic Society, under the direction of Mr. Costa, and the one before mentioned. There were about one hundred and fifty members of the choir present at the meeting of the London Sacred Harmonic Society, with an accompaniment of about twenty stringed instruments. A new Anthem, by Dr. Elvey, of Windsor, was sung, and also Mozart’s Twelfth Mass. The performance was decidedly poor — vastly inferior to the German choruses which we have recently described. The time was tolerably well kept, but tune was far enough from accuracy. The same feeling about for the pitch, and uncertainty of tone, was observable in the more difficult modulations, which is so common with our untrained New England choirs; with this difference, however, that we occasionally stop to correct a badly-intoned passage, whereas here it was passed over as if unobserved, or as if such a dissonant performance had become a matter of habit. There was, too, an absence of all those things that go to make up a good choral performance, as Forte and Piano, Sforzando, Syncopated accent, distinctness and clearness of vocal utterance, &amp;c. The leader would occasionally sing out at the top of his voice, “Piano,” but he did not seem to expect that attention would be given to what he said, and kept on, under a press of sail, until another opportunity should occur for calling out with like result. This was, indeed, a rehearsal; but if a choir is permitted to sing thus in rehearsal, will they not form habits that will prevent improvement, and will not the public performances be of the same general character? The violins were badly played. One could hardly help coming to the conclusion that they were mostly beginners, assembled for practice. It would not be surprising to hear as bad, or even a worse, rehearsal, on the Western Continent; but, in Europe there should be, at least, a correct performance of the technicals of music, if not something belonging to the higher department of appropriate expression.",GRONOW.txt,"On the 10th of November 1813, while the light companies of the Cold- stream and 3d Guards were skirmishing in front of Irun, the present Sir Wyndham Anstruther, then an officer in the Coldstream Guards, was severely wounded by a musket-ball just below the knee ; and had he not received the most unceasing attention from the surgeon, Mr Eose, he would in all probability have lost his leg. When the army commanded by the Duke of Wellington advanced, in the early part of the spring of 1814, Mr Eose recommended Mr Anstruther to return to England on sick leave ; and he was placed, on his arrival, under the care of the celebrated surgeon, Sir Everard Home, by whose skill he completely recovered, but was not able to join the British army before it had reached Paris after the battle of Waterloo. Mr Anstruther remained several months in Paris, and in the early part of 1816, after dining one clay with Mr Boulton, an old friend, who had hired a country-house at St Maur, two leagues beyond Vincennes, was returning to towi. in a small carriage upon two wheels, called a coucou, commonly used in those days, and which travelled at the rate of about five miles an hour. Having placed himself on the front seat outside with the driver, after a time they got into con- versation, and thinking, from his appearance, that he looked like an old soldier, Mr Anstruther inquired whether he had served ; to which the coachman answered in the affirmative, mentioning the number of his regiment aDd the battles in which he had taken part , and he added that he was afraid he had killed an English officer in front of Iran, on the banks of the Bidassoa.

Bach wrote such difficult harmonies as none but a choir, and a pro[f]essional choir too, can sing well. Yet editors not knowing these circumstances have introduced these difficult harmonies into tune books designed for Congregational use. Congregations might as well undertake to sing Beethoven's Mass No. 2, as these chorals, with all sorts of complicated and difficult harmony parts. Oh that two things in relation to psalmody might be understood! 1st. That Congregational singing cannot be good unless the tunes are very plain and easy; and 2d.

Public performances by some one of them are very frequent; so frequent indeed, that we can find time for only now and then one. The first for the season was by the ""Sacred Harmonic Society,"" under Mr. Costa, and consisted of a selection from ""Samson,"" by Handel, Mendelssohn's ""Christus,"" ""The Last Judgment,"" by Spohr. The death of the illustrious Duke gave a tinge to all the earlier concerts, and the ""Dead March"" in Saul was in constant requisition. On the present occasion, the selection from ""Samson"" consisted of the air, ""Ye Sons of Israel,"" ""Dead March,"" and chorus, ""Glorious hero, may thy grave Peace and honor ever have."" The ""Christus"" by Mendelssohn, seems to be very popular, both among the singers and hearers. The chorale, ""As bright the Star of Morning gleams,"" one of the best German chorales, and one that is very often heard in their churches, is brought in with fine effect after the chorus, ""There shall a Star of Jacob come forth."" Mendelssohn is always great in such choruses as ""He stirreth up the Jews,"" ""Crucify Him,"" and others in which he depends mostly upon orchestral effect, and in which he carries out his ideas of imitation or description with all the powers of modem instrumentation. Spohr's oratorio was well given, the Gresham Professor himself being judge; for we had the honor of a seat by his side, and of listening to his remarks during the perormance. Mr. Taylor was the first to bring out Spohr in England. ""Die letzten Dinge,"" or ""The Last Things,"" (which is a much better title for the oratorio than the one it now bears,) was composed about twenty-five years ago. It accidently came into the hands of Prof. Taylor, who translated the words, and first brought it out at the Norwich Festival in 1830. Since then it has been a standard oratorio, and is often performed. Prof. Taylor says: ""It at once seized the public attention, and commanded the admiration of the most distinguished professors of every school. Its influences upon the feelings of an audience has been attested by expressions more decided and unequivocal than I ever remember to have witnessed. I speak not of the admiration which the musician derives from such a display of the power and the resources of his art, but of the homage which nature, though musically untutored, involuntarily yet willingly pays to genius. The throbbing heart, the moistening eye, the quivering lip, here bespeak the triumph of the composer."" The solo parts were sustained by Mrs. Endersohn, Miss Williams, Mr. Lockey and Mr. Phillips.

It became our duty to provide the guard for the Emperor of Russia, and a dinner was provided for us similar to that which is given at St James's. Prior to dinner being Served, our Adjutant informed the Colonel that there were four Russian general officers in our custody. It naturally struck us that something very horrible had occurred to have caused the disgrace of men of such high rank. It fell to the lot of Captain Vernon, son of the late Archbishop of York, to call upon those unfortunate officers to invite them to dinner — an invitation which they cheerfully accepted. During the first course, curiosity seized the gallant Captain; for, in proposing the health of one of our prisoners, he begged the Eussian would inform us of the cause of their disgrace. The reply was, the Emperor was not satisfied with the manner in which their men had marched past at the review; whereupon Vernon filled his glass up to the brim, and drank, "" Confusion to all tyrants, and — Vive Napoleon ! "" The Eussian generals appeared thun- derstruck, and observed, that if they drank the toast proposed it would cost them their heads. Nothing more was heard of the Eussian generals until two days after, when we, (the officers of the guard,) were summoned before the Duke of Wellington, to explain what it all meant. The Duke having heard us, said he hoped that for the future we would abstain from alluding to Bonaparte, for as Louis XVIII. had been proclaimed the King of France, any allusion to the fallen hero would be both impolitic and mischievous; adding that he would make a point of presenting himself at the Emperor of Russia's hotel, and explaining the occurrence. The Emperor Alexander in Paris. — The Emperor Alexander of Russia was fond of telling an anecdote of a circumstance which occurred to himself and the King of Prussia whilst in Paris, in 1815. They had lounged together to the Palais Royal, which in those days was surrounded by a number of narrow streets and alleys, and in return- ing to the Tuileries, they found that they were in a labyrinth, from which it was difficult to extricate themselves. The Emperor, after a time, accosted a well-dressed man who wore the cross of St Louis, and asked the nearest route to the Tuileries. The answer was, "" I am going there myself, and will readily accompany you. Will you do me the hon- our of informing me whom I am conducting ] "" The Czar replied, "" I am the Emperor of Russia."" The gentleman received the information with an incredulous smile. "" And who is your companion % "" said he. "" This is the King of Prussia. But whom am I to thank for this politeness % "" The Parisian, thinking that he would be a match for this waggish stranger, replied, "" Oh, I am the Emperor of China.""

MASONB.txt,1448281888079,98877:102290,272,581,347,"A rich programme was presented this evening. The concert opened with an overture which is a great favorite here, and often played in public, though I have not heard it in America,— “Iphigene in Aulis,” by Gluck. It is a charming overture, and any one’s musical reputation might safely rest on the production of a single piece like this. Its subjects are at once natural and beautiful, and they are always treated in a most masterly manner; with elaborateness it is always intelligible, and with copiousness it is never diffuse. There is no departing from the main topic of discourse, no wandering in the mazes of thick darkness, or searching for ideas, but the leading thoughts are kept ever before the mind, presented now in this form, and now in that. Its analogies are perfect, its contrasts are striking, and its light and shade are applied with the hand of a Raphael or a Turner. It is full of pleasing melody, yet always subject to the laws of good taste, and manifesting both genius and science; it is in the performance, perhaps, equally satisfactory both to the musician and to the mere unstudied lover of song. The second piece was an extract (first and second movements) of Cherubini’s Requiem, written for male voices. This, which is one of Cherubini’s great works, was written under circumstances somewhat exciting, as I remember to have heard years ago. On some funeral occasion when a Requiem was desired, that which he had previously written was rejected, because composed for a mixed choir; this caused him to put forth his energies, in the production of a mass for men’s voices only. The music throughout is of a very high character, though it would not much interest those who desire musical gratification only from pretty tunes or pleasant voices. The first movement, “Requiem aeternam” with its accompaniment of violoncellos and double basses, is plaintive and sad, and tells only of sorrow, penitence and grief. In the “Dies irae,” the full powers of the orchestra are brought into requisition; and uniting, as was the case on the present occasion, with sixty well-trained and fearless men’s voices, the effect was awfully grand and commanding. The majestic movements, the severely dissonant harmonies, the wailings of the strings, the frightful appeals of the instruments of blast and percussion, and the cryings out of the voices, all combined to produce an effect which was, at times, truly terrific and overwhelming. The nineteen stanzas, however, have furnished an opportunity for musical contrasts which have been well introduced, affording variety and relief. The third piece was the very unique but, to the musician, highly interesting ""Concert fur 2 claviere (c moll) Von J. S. Bach."" Following the Requiem, it was like a delightful calm after a storm, enabling one to realize where he was, to breathe easily again, and put on a cheerful countenance. Several part-songs were then sung by the “Mannerchor” without accompaniment. The second part consisted of the “Sinfonie in C minor, by L. Von Beethoven” What a symphonie this is! We have often heard it, and it is well known in America. We will not attempt a description; we listened with intense interest to the whole of it, hardly daring to breathe in the piano and not having the power to do so in the forte passages. Is it strange then, that, whether “in the body or out of the body” at its close, we should not be able to tell?",GRONOW.txt,"A gentleman present, disgusted at such braggart insolence, quietly walked up to this fire-eater, and addressed him thus : "" As you are such a dangerous customer, perhaps you will accommodate me, by being punctual at the entrance of the Bois de Boulogne, near the Porte Maillot, at mid-day to-morrow : earlier I cannot get there, but depend upon my arriving in due time with swords and pistols."" The duellist began to demur, saying he did not know what right a stranger had to take up the cudgels of M. de F ; to which the gentleman replied, "" I have done so because I am anxious to rid society of a dangerous fellow like yourself, and would recommend you before you go to bed to make your will. I will undertake to order your coffin and pay your funeral expenses."" He then gave the waiter a note of 1000 francs, with the injunction that his orders should be executed before eleven the following day. This had the desired effect of intimidating the bully, who left Paris the following day, and never more was heard of or seen in public. An Insult Rightly Redressed.— Soon after the restoration of the Bourbons, several duels took place for the most frivolous causes. Duels were fought in the daytime, and even by night. The officers of the Swiss Guards were constantly measuring swords with the officers of the old Garde Imperiale. Upon one occasion a Frenchman, determined to insult a Swiss officer, who, in the uniform of his regiment was quietly taking his ice at Tortoni's, addressed him thus : "" I would not serve my country for the sake of money, as you do. We Frenchmen think only of honour."" To which the other promptly retorted, "" You are right ; for we both of us serve for what we do not possess."" A duel was the consequence ; they fought with swords under a lamp in the Eue Taitbout, and the Frenchman was run through the body ; but luckily the wound, though dangerous, did not prove fatal. ",,,

The Chevalier Neukomm was there, and in the course of the evening, being in conversation with that distinguished man, I asked him the question, ""Who is the greatest living pianist?” “I think he is,” replied the Chevalier, pointing to Moscheles.",GRONOW.txt,"In his rencontre with Fayot, the General was severely wounded in the hand, and ever after Fayot hunted his antagonist from one end of France to the other, determined to put an end to the ""assassin,"" as he was called; but the Eevolution of 1830 came, and all was chaos. Fayot's father was guillotined in the south of France in 1793. His mother, after the severe loss she had sustained in the death of her husband, whom she adored, brought up her son at Avignon, telling him, as he grew up to be a man, to take every opportunity of avenging the death of his father. Upon the restoration of the Bourbons, Fayot came to Paris, where, by his singular manners and dress, he laid himself open to remark and ridicule. ",,,

It was well done on both occasions, but was much the most effective in the “Sing Academie.” The choir was in excellent order, and consisted of about two hundred vocalists; the solo singing, though not by great artists, was all in good style and keeping, and the orchestra were fully adequate to the work they had to do. The recitatives were accompanied by the pianoforte, and the songs and choruses by the orchestra. There was no organ on either occasion, and I find that it is not common to unite the organ with a choir performance. If an orchestra play an overture, they are not supposed to need the support of an organ, and if a choir sing a vocal motette, they are supposed to be able to sing it independent of instrumental aid; so that the organ is seldom heard, except when it is telling its own story, or sustaining and leading along the great congregation in the choral songs.Every seat was occupied; indeed it was necessary to secure tickets a day or two previous to the performance. The king was there, and both the sovereign and the people seemed to enter into the spirit of the music. The house was perfectly still, and there was not the slightest indication of applause; not because the music was not well executed, but because the usual method of manifesting approbation seemed to be inappropriate to the solemn state of feeling existing. It seemed indeed to be an occasion of deep solemnity ; all the members of the choir, male and female, were dressed in black, so that an appeal was made, through the eye as well as the ear, to the religious sympathies in view of the sufferings of the Son of God. I shall not attempt any analysis of the “Tod Jesu.” With the exception of one chorus, and Luther’s chorale, it is, I believe, quite unknown in America[…]",GRONOW.txt,"In the daytime he was usually dressed in a green coat, white waistcoat and neckcloth, leather pantaloons, and Hessian boots, with his hat on one side. He visited London in 1814, where he bought a tilbury and horse, which he brought to Paris, and in this gig he paraded every day up and down the Boulevards, from the Rue Laffitte to the Place de la Madeleine. His evenings were generally passed either at Tortoni's or Silve's, the respective rendezvous of the Bonapartists and Bourbons. In one or other of these cafes Fayot was sure to be found. He publicly gave out that he was ready to measure swords with any one who dared to insinuate anything against the royal family, — a threat sure to bring upon him serious rencontres ; but nothing intimidated him. It was reported at the time, and generally believed, that he had, in the short period of two years, fought thirty duels without having been seriously wounded. Upon one occasion Fayot repaired to the Theatre Francais to see ""Germanicus;"" party spirit then ran high, and any allusion complimentary to the fallen Emperor was received by the Bonapartists with applause. Fayot loudly hissed, and a great uproar arose, when Fayot entered the breach by proclaiming himself the champion of Legitimacy. The consequence was that cards flew about the pit ; Fayot carefully picked them up, and placed them in his hat. After the play had terminated he repaired to Tortoni's, where he wrote his address upon several pieces of paper, which he distributed all over the Boulevards, stating that he was to be found every morning between the hours of eleven and twelve at the well in the Bois de Boulogne, near Auteuil. Strange to say, after all this row at the theatre, only one antagonist was forthcoming. On the second day, at the hour appointed, a gentleman arrived with his seconds, who found Fayot in his tilbury, ready for the fight. The name of his antagonist was a Monsieur Harispe, the son of the distinguished Basque General. Pistols were chosen, and at the first discharge Fayot shot his adversary in the knee; then, taking off his hat, he left the ground and proceeded to Paris in his tilbury to breakfast at Tortoni's, where a great many persons had congregated to know the result of this terrible duel.",,,

There are no carvings, paintings, crosses, statues, or anything ornamental; not even a leather cushion can be found, or the smallest piece of drapery about the pulpit or elsewhere. There is neither organ, choir nor any instrument of music. The seats in the centre of the main floor are of plain, hard boards, unpainted; this part of the house is occupied exclusively by women. The men are mostly in the gallery, which is divided into separate stalls, each for one person. Each stall has a seat swung on hinges, that turns back after the fashion of the old New England swinging seats of a hundred years ago. The men on going into the church did not sit down, but each one took his stand in one of the stalls, waiting for the commencement of the service. Some took off their hats, others continued to wear them. When the bell ceased, the minister stepped up to the railing near the pulpit, and gave out the pitch by sounding the four principal tones of the scale to the syllable la, (1, 3, 5,8,) and immediately the large assembly began to sing. The singing was slow, very slow; I have never before heard a tune sung so slowly as on this occasion. In singing a tune - ""The Old Hundredth,” for example, —I am persuaded that the Rev. Mr. Havergal’s congregation would get through the tune by the time this Zurich assembly would get through the first line. The hymn-book used here, includes, also, the tunes, printed in four parts, and, although the tenor and the alto were not to be heard, yet many of the men made a bold attack upon the bass, which they made to tremble with uncertainty, if not with fear. The trebles in one line sought to attain the pitch of E; they reached a little higher than Eb, but yet fell short of their aim, and this caused the sinking of the pitch, so that at the end of two stanzas it was something like a tone below its starting point. It was well that but two stanzas were sung; for a new pitch would have been necessary if the number had been much greater. Here, then, is a specimen of congregational singing without a choir or organ.",GRONOW.txt,"The Ee volution of 1830 drove Fayot away from Paris, and he retired to his native Avignon, where he lived much respected by the principal inhabitants of that quaint town.

Warren stood six feet four inches in height, and was an extremely powerful man. He was always in hot water with his comrades, and had fought duels with several of them, aud his face and body shewed marks of sabre cuts ; indeed, fighting and drinking were his delights. I never saw a man so violent when he had finished his bottle of champagne and a few glasses of brandy : he became quite outrageous. He usually breakfasted, when off duty, at Tortoni's, upon beefsteaks and broiled kidneys ; and any one to whom he bore a grudge who entered the room at that moment was sure to be roughly handled. It happened that Monsieur , a distinguished painter, had returned to Paris from England, where he had played a shameful and disgusting part. The painter had been employed by the celebrated Mr Hope of Duchess Street to paint the portrait of his wife, Mrs Hope, afterwards Lady Beresford. When the painting was finished, Mr Hope objected to pay for it, stating that it was a daub. The enraged painter, determined to be revenged, took the portrait home with him, and in a few days returned it with the addition of a beast representing Mr Hope in the presence of his beautiful wife. A trial was the consequence, and the painter was cast in damages. After this untoward event, London proved too hot for the Frenchman, and he returned to Paris, where his imprudence in speaking in no measured terms of the English got him into a scrape which cost him his life.

A principal point of attraction is always found in the Symphony, and on this occasion it was not a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Mendelssohn, but an original manuscript composition of a member of the Orchestra, Ferd. Hermann, that was performed. Herr Hermann directed his own Symphony. It did not meet with a very warm reception, though sufficiently so to afford good encouragement to the author and his friends. There is always so much caution and incredulity, and sometimes suspicion, envy and jealousy abroad, that the path to fame, even to true merit, is rough and beset with difficulties. Our author, we suppose, could not complain of the manner in which his work was received, and probably a young composer does not often obtain greater approbation. There were undoubtedly fine points in the Symphony, indicating talent, taste and judgment. Its themes were concise and clear, and there seemed to be a considerable degree of the effusion of genuine feeling, without dry detail, commonplace thoughts, or tedious repetitions. The instrumentation was quite well balanced, though the Oboe was, perhaps, somewhat too prominent in the melodic passages; a greater variety of coloring in this respect might be an improvement. The thoughts were easy, natural and chaste, but yet never so striking as to call forth a rapturous or involuntary exclamation of delight or applause. The interest too was well sustained through the four movements, and although we suppose that the critics will not allow to this Symphony a higher place than mediocrity, yet the young author may be well contented with the award bestowed, return to his study, and try again. Signor Stigelli, a Tenor, from the Royal Italian Opera, London, sang with approbation; Carl Deichmann, a Violinist, from Hanover, played with entire success, a Concerto, by Vieux Temps; an aria by Julius Rietz, (Conductor,) was charmingly sung by Miss Mayer, coming seemingly fresh from the heart, on the tones of a sweet voice.

Instances of his dashing and headlong courage in the Peninsula caught the eye of one of our celebrated general officers, the Honourable Sir William Stewart, who commanded the division commonly known by the name of "" The Fighting Division,"" and he placed Gabriel upon his staff. Upon one occasion, in the Pyrenees, Sir William was not a little surprised to find that his aide-de-camp was non est inventus ; and upon asking his nephew, Lord Charles Churchill, what had be- come of him, he was answered thus : — "" Oh, Gabriel having heard the roaring of cannon to our right, has galloped off to enjoy the fun.""

MASONB.txt,1448311811907,157566:161100,309,615,625,"I attended service there [St Peter's Church, Leipzig] this afternoon. At the precise hour the organ prelude commenced; it continued two minutes, and the first Lied immediately followed. There was no introit, or introductory motette as in the Nicolai and Thomas churches. The choir consisted of three boys and two men; and beside these, the organist, another person walking about in the organ loft, and myself, there was but one person present — a goodly old lady; so that when the service commenced, the congregation in fact consisted of but one woman. It reminded me of the clergyman who, when he had no one present but the clerk, took the liberty to alter the prescribed form of the service, reading not “Dearly beloved brethren” but “Dearly beloved Roger.” Here was an occasion then, when the singing was indeed congregational. The members of the choir were all singing, the old lady appeared to sing, and I joined the general chorus. The organ was full and made up for any deficiency of vocal power. I observed that in some stanzas the voices commenced without the organ, and sung three or four syllables, when they were joined by the full organ; though in some other stanzas the voices and organ were simultaneous in their commencement. This, however, can have nothing to do with that which we sometimes call expression or the adaptation of the tune to the different stanzas of the hymn, for no attention whatever is paid to this subject here; there is no variation of soft and loud, but every stanza is loud, and is apparently sung and played without the slightest reference to the principle above mentioned. Indeed the principle of adaptation (as generally understood by us in the United States), seems not to belong to the Congregational style of singing. The minister, who was not present at the commencement of the service, came in during the singing of the last stanza, faced the cross upon the altar for a few moments, and then turning towards the people (by this time numbering perhaps between twenty or thirty), he commenced the responsive chanting service. His first sentence is confined to about half a dozen words, which are given in the tones three and five of the scale; this being responded to by the choir, the minister chants quite a long sentence, after which the choir respond Amen. The response closed upon five of the scale, ascending to it by the sharp four — thus five, three, sharp four, five. After this the minister read about two minutes — the people rising. This was followed by the organ, and another hymn. The minister retired the moment he had finished reading (prayer) and was not present during the singing that followed; but at the close of the hymn, as before, he came in and read a scriptural lesson; again he retired, and again the organ announced another choral. By this time some fifty or sixty persons had assembled, and they succeeded in raising quite a chorus. At the close of the last stanza the minister appeared, not at the altar, but in the pulpit, and after half a dozen words of prayer, commenced his sermon. And now the choir, three boys and two men, took their turn in going out; as the minister seemed to have nothing to do with their part of the service, so, I suppose, they were alike relieved when he began to preach.

Cards were exchanged, and on the following morning the parties met in the Bois de Boulogne. La Susse's adversary won the toss, and took his aim with great coolness, but luckily without effect. La Susse then fired, when the German fell. The seconds hastened to render every assistance in their power ; but judge of their astonishment when, instead of finding the German mortally wounded, as they expected, they only found a bullet indented against a well-padded cuirass. La Susse, after looking attentively with his glass in his eye at what was passing, desired his antagonist to rise, as he would have another shot at him ; upon which the cuirassed hero rose, and received a well-merited and well-applied kick, without making the slightest resistance, and then walked off the ground as if he had accomplished some wonderful achievement. This extraordinary duel took place in 1816, and was the subject of much conversation for a leno-th of time in the fashionable circles in Paris. At the commencement of the Crimean war, the Admiral was named commander-in-chief of the French fleet ; and when off the Piraeus, had gone on shore to pass a few days up the country with some friends, when unexpected orders came for the different vessels under his command to weigh anchor, and to proceed to a new destination immediately. The Admiral, bent on his amusements, was not to be found for three days ; and on this becoming known to the Emperor, he was immediately superseded, and Admiral Parseval Deschenes named in his place. Poor La Susse never recovered from this dreadful blow, and considered himself ever after as a disgraced and dishonoured man. He lingered on for a few months, and may be said to have died of a broken heart.

About a fortnight afterwards, General Mouton again paid a visit to the Tuileries in the same hackney coach. On looking out, the Em- peror's countenance clouded over, and he looked greatly displeased as he recognised the obnoxious vehicle. "" Did you not receive an order for 300,000 francs % "" he inquired of the general. "" Yes, sire,"" replied Mouton, "" and I am truly grateful for the gift ; but if your Majesty insists upon my spending it, I would rather return the money."" ",,,

The exercises commenced by a few measures as a voluntary, or rather prelude, and the “giving out” the tune on the organ, after which all the congregation united in a single stanza sung to the old tune called “Tallis’s Evening Hymn.” The hymn was not read nor named, but it appeared to be a common thing for the worship to commence in the use of a stanza well known, always the same, and to the same tune. It was a hearty commencement, for every one seemed to join with full voice. The service was read by the curate. The chanting was done by the whole congregation, and the responding was between the occupants of the lower floor and those of the gallery — but the song was universal — men, women and children uniting harmonious voices. The Venite and the Te Deum were chanted responsively; the psalms were not chanted but, read in the usual manner. Two metrical hymns were sung during the service. The tunes were both of the old ecclesiastical class, and were in the same rhythmic form as St. Ann’s, York, &amp;c. appear in the Cantica Laudis. The first and last words of each line being long, and all the rest short. They were sung by all the people, and in very quick time; as fast as propriety would allow the enunciation of the words. They were sung somewhat quicker than the writer has taught this class of tunes in musical conventions and singing classes in America. Let the tune Uxbridge, for example, be sung in quick time, somewhat quicker than usual, and the crotchets will give the time of the minims in the above-named class of tunes. There were one or two organ interludes introduced in a psalm of five stanzas; but these were very short, not more than about two measures, or the length of the last line of a common metre tune. “These tunes would be popular in America,” said the lady who was with me, who, though not a singer, has been accustomed for many years to give close attention to the Psalmody, and to hear criticisms and remarks concerning it. And indeed, they are as far from being dull and heavy as need be; I doubt not that many good people, with us, would think it almost irreverent to sing a hymn through with such rapidity.

The singing is entirely Congregational, and is led by a precentor, who occupies a secondary pulpit in front of that of the minister, and who, in addition to his singing duties, reads the notices. He gives out the hymn, proclaiming its number, and also at the same time gives the name of the tune; then he reads a stanza which is immediately sung by all the people, and in like manner the succeeding stanzas are read and sung. It is not easy to see why the stanza is read before it is sung, since all the people have hymn-books, and many of them also tune books. The singing of the psalms was as good as may be expected where choir tunes are used for congregational purpose. The tunes here were altogether too difficult for the people’s use; difficult in rhythmics and difficult in melodics. The attempt too, to sing in parts, was not in all cases productive of the greatest good; for example: We stood by the side of a young man who was furnished with a tune book containing only the bass part. In the first tune we sung out the bass with as much voice as we could conveniently command, but with the second tune we were unacquainted, and could not therefore join in the exercise. This was observed by the young man, who drew near and held out his bass part, thus enabling us to sing. But he, while he was looking carefully first at his hymn book and then to his tune book, so as to be sure and be right, was, with his bass part before him, singing all the way the treble part, two octaves below the pitch! How a little knowledge may expose one’s ignorance! The general effect of the singing was, notwithstanding these drawbacks, very good, vastly better than some of the attempts at musical display which we have witnessed in churches in England and on the Continent; and if it was not musically attractive, it was religiously edifying, and served to revive the affections and lift them upwards.

I remember on one occasion being present when a party of staff officers were trying to find a ford for the passage of a deep and rapid stream by a part of the army ; most of the horses refused the water, when the reverend gentleman pushed forward, saying, "" I daresay my nag will take it,"" and he was in a few minutes over on the other side and back again. Mr Frith went by the name of "" the fighting parson "" in his division, and was an admirable and excellent specimen of the Church militant. His Majesty being very infirm, could only shew himself to his people in a carriage ; he could not mount a horse, and had great difficulty in walking a few steps. He was very fond of having all the news of Paris, and had numerous visitors during the day, who related to him everything that happened. An ambassador of long-standing, the Bailli de Ferrette, used to be a frequent attendant at the Tuileries, and upon one occasion the King said to the Bailli, "" What news have you for me to-day 1"" ""None worth communicating to your Majesty/' said M. de Ferrette, ""unless it is that the people in Paris are beginning to. murmur because their King is not able to ride and review his soldiers as other sovereigns have done from time immemorial."" His Majesty replied, ""Oh, I suppose they want a monarch who can ride well. Perhaps I had better abdicate in favour of Franconi."" ",,,

The congregation consisted of at least some twelve hundred persons. The exercises commenced by an organ voluntary of about four or five minutes, at the close of which the whole congregation joined in the old choral everywhere heard in Germany, the first line of which is 1, 5 3, 1 5, 6 6, 5, &amp;c., in the key of E flat major. Two stanzas were sung, each taking four minutes. At the close of the second stanza, the organist, continuing to play, changed gradually his key to A minor, closing an intermediate voluntary of about three minutes, diminishing to pianissimo so as to hush the house to perfect silence; then, after a moment’s pause, the people joined again to the lead of the organ, in the fine old choral beginning as follows: e, a g, f e, d—, e—, &amp;c. Four stanzas were sung of three minutes each. Here, then, were two hymns sung in connection; which, with the organ prelude and interlude occupied full half-an-hour in the performance. Men’s voices predominated, marking in strength the bold outlines of the tune; while female voices were heard and seemed to come in echoing, enriching, beautifying, and rendering that charming and lovely which otherwise would have been too severely grand and majestic. The organ was firm and steady, leading along the whole combined chorus with the utmost certainty, and giving full confidence to all the voices.",GRONOW.txt,"After our corps d'armee, under the command of Sir John Hope, had crossed the Adour, we were ordered to advance as close as possible under the walls of the town.

This gun did us great injury, and I was witness to a very gallant act of some of the infantry of the German Legion, which effectually stopped any further loss. Captain Wilding, who commanded a company of Hanoverians, suddenly dashed out of a burial-ground to the left of the road, rushed upon the gunners, bayoneted them, and brought the gun in triumph into our lines, amidst the loud cheers of our soldiers. In this gallant exploit Captain Wilding was badly wounded in the leg, and. was obliged to return to England for his recovery ; but prior to his removal he had. the satisfaction to see, in general orders, the approval, by the Commander-in-chief, of his gallant bearing in the capture of the gun.

He is a very popular preacher, and has a large and flourishing congregation. Not indeed like the great German congregations where we often see two or three thousand people assembled on a Sabbath mornings but there were not less, we think, than a thousand persons present at the Bloomsbury chapel last Sunday. The church is furnished with a very good-sized organ, though its tones are harsh, and especially so are the stops of small pipes, as mixture or cornet. There is no choir, but the singing is by the people, and seems to be very general. There was a chorus of many voices; a chorus not of musical attraction, but of religious edification - excellent and appropriate. Chanting had been introduced into this congregation, and is practised by the whole collected assembly with much success. We do not hesitate to say that the chanting by all the people in Rev. Mr. Brock's church is much superior to any of the cathedral choir chanting which we have heard. The chant itself was, indeed, unfavorable to the best results, being the well-known Dr. Dupuis in A; but notwithstanding the tune-like character of the chant, the effect was truly good, and seemed to furnish a most satisfactory answer to those objectors to chanting, who say that it is impossible for a large congregation to chant together. The words were, in general, deliberately and well delivered, and with a good degree of simultaneousness on the part of the congregation. Chanting is practised in public worship in many dissenting churches in London, and in other parts of the kingdom. Indeed, although it was introduced at an earlier period into our New England churches than here, yet it seems to have spread more here, and to have taken deeper root. One reason for this may be, that here it is made a republican thing; it is in the hands of the people, and they like it. The metrical psalms were also quite well sung, and the great importance of an organ in Congregational singing was made very apparent. A custom in giving out the hymn and tune is singular. The minister first gives out the number of the hymn, and immediately afterwards the organist plays over the tune. After this the minister, who stands in the pulpit during the playing, reads the hymn, and then the singing follows. Mr. Brock has made a much-needed reform in relation to the public prayer. He has broken up the ever-so-long prayer, and instead of it has two shorter prayers. Rev. Mr. Binney of the Weigh House chapel has done the same. The devotional exercises occupied an hour, and the sermon that followed about forty minutes, after which the meeting was dismissed by the usual benediction.

Louis XVIII. and Sosthenes de la Rochefoucauld. — A few days after the King's arrival in Paris in 1814, Sosthenes de la Rochefoucauld collected together a mob in the Place Vend6me, with the intention of hurling from its pedestal the statue of the Emperor, endeavouring at the same time to pull down the pillar, which all the world has seen and admired. Hundreds of ropes were held by the mob, who pulled away with all their might for several hours ; but, night coming on, they were obliged to desist from their fruitless attempts. The King, having been told of this outrageous conduct, sent for Rochefoucauld and asked him whether he had acted in the manner reported of him. The Duke pleaded guilty, upon which the King said, "" You are playing the enemy's game ; it is by such means I shall be made unpopular. For the future, bear in mind that Louis XVIII. is King of France, and not King of the Vandals.""

He spoke English perfectly, was quiet in manner, and a most chivalrous, high-minded, and honourable man.

He held his fiddle, but would not easily yield to their entreaties. They were asking him to play. At last he raised his Cremona to his chin and began to improvise.

The audience was hushed, attentive, a little awed, but intensely appreciative. I did not play myself. No one had heard me play there, so no one expected me to play then; and I might have lost my character as general manager and president had I contributed to the programme in a musical capacity. I confess the old war-horse within me began to chafe and paw the ground, impatient for action, when the players got well to work. I seemed to feel that my real place was at their side. I had been too lately weaned, but I kept my feelings to myself. I believe in music as I believe in pictures for the masses. It draws people together, oils the wheels of the social system, and very much facilitates the intercourse between a pastor and his flock. Music is better than penny readings or lectures for this purpose, chiefly because penny readings, as a rule, are so badly and stupidly conducted. For one person who can attract attention by his reading or lecturing there are a dozen who can excite interest among the poorer classes by singing and playing; and professional musicians are, as a rule, very kind and liberal in giving their services if only a fit occasion presents itself.

Someone might have lifted it up for him ; but no, he carries it him- self and hoists it lovingly on to the platform. He seems familiar with its ways, and will allow no one to help him. Why, there are SAINTON, HILL, PIATTI, and COOPER, all coming on without their fiddles. They seem vastly interested in this ungainly couple - the man and the big bass. He has no music.

Many circumstances have been brought to my mind lately with regard to Sheridan, who had been one of my predecessors, by my witnessing a wild drama that has been brought on the French stage, under the title of "" L'Homme de Eien/' which purports to be a biography of that distinguished man. Those who have seen how Mrs Siddons, Edmund Kean, and Dean Swift have been rendered ridiculous by the incredible ignorance of dramatic authors in France about everything English, and of every circumstance of the lives of those they purport to represent, would not be surprised at the liberties they have taken with the great orator, wit, and dramatist. I heard from some very old men amongst my constituents the singular history of the canvass of Sheridan for this immaculate borough. His reputation had already reached the town, but the defects which unfortunately also rendered him conspicuous were then unknown. He was reported to possess, besides, unbounded influence with the Government, and to have the entire management of Drury Lane Theatre. His voters, being fully convinced that they ought to receive a quid pro quo for their "" most sweet voices,"" every one had a favour to ask. One had a son who had great dramatic talent, another was an admirable scene-painter, others had cousins and nephews who w T ould make excellent door-keepers, lamp-lighters, check-takers, or box-openers ; there were tailors, coiffeurs, and decorators, who could dress with inimitable effect the dramatis personce. Sheridan listened with his usual bland smile to every request, and complied with them all ; each individual being furnished with a letter to the stage-manager of Drury Lane, they all started off for the metropolis, full of eager expectation. On their arrival they were favourably received, and each person obtained the situation that he had desired. When letters from London announcing the fulfilment of Sheridan's promises reached the hungry constituents of Stafford, a fresh batch of aspirants for office posted off, and all were equally successful ; the consequence was that, on the day of election, the favourite was returned with every demonstration of admiration and confidence.

I readily agreed, and from that time I became solo violinist at the Cambridge Musical Society, and played a solo at nearly every concert in the Town Hall for the next three years. I confess to some nervousness on my first public appearance at a University Concert. It was a grand night. STERNDALE BENNETT, our new professor of music, himself conducted his ""May Queen” and I think MR. COLERIDGE, an enthusiastic amateur and old musical star at the University, since very well known in London, sang. I had selected as my cheval de bataille, RODE'S air in G with variations, and to my own surprise, when my turn came to go on, I was quite shaky. The hall was crammed, the Master of Trinity sat in the front row with other heads of colleges and their families. I tuned in the ante-room. Someone offered me a glass of wine. I had never resorted to stimulants before playing, but I rashly drank it; it was in my head at once; STERNDALE BENNETT conducted me to the platform. I was a total stranger to the company a freshman in my second month only. My fingers felt limp and unrestrained, my head was half swimming. The crowd looked like a mist. I played with exaggerated expression. I tore the passion to tatters. I trampled on the time. I felt the excess of sentiment was bad, and specially abhorrent to STERNDALE BENNETT, who followed my vagaries like a lamb, bless him for ever! But the thing took. The style was new; at least it was unconventional and probably daring, for I really hardly knew what I was about. The Air was listened to in dead silence, half out of curiosity no doubt; but a burst of applause followed the last die-away notes. I plunged into the variations; I felt my execution slovenly and beneath my usual mark; but I was more than once interrupted by applause, and at the close of the next cantabile movement of extreme beauty, which I played better a sort of meditation on the original air the enthusiasm rose to fever pitch; men stood up in the distant gallery and waved their caps, and I remained holding my violin, unable to proceed with the last rapid variation. When silence was restored I played this atrociously; I hardly played it at all, it was quite wild. STERNDALE BENNETT, seeing that it was all up with me that night, hurried and banged it through anyhow; but the critical faculty of the room was gone, so was my head; I had won by a toss, and although then, and often afterwards, owing to neglect of practice, I was frequently not up to my own mark, my position as solo violinist at the University Concerts was never disputed up to the time that I took my degree.",GRONOW.txt,"Scarcely, however, had the member of Parliament left the town than innumerable reproaches were heaped upon his head ; it was found that upon application for the payment of the salaries clue to the different persons employed there was no money in the treasury.

Great was the indignation excited amongst Sheridan's constituents on finding that they had placed their political interests in the hands of such a man, and a deputation of three persons was despatched to London to remonstrate with him. They went at a fixed hour to the residence of the great man, where they found a large crowd of his creditors assembled, many of them apparently bent on saying some very disagreeable truths. After waiting for some time, the folding-doors were thrown open, and out stepped the delinquent, in the first style of fashion. Looking around him with a fascinating smile, he addressed a few words to each of his would-be tormentors in succession ; each one in his turn was delighted, and quite incapable of making unpleasant observations. They saw before them the man whose speech they had just read in the Times and Courier, which had proclaimed him in their leading articles the first orator of the age ; and they had seen in the Morning Post a paragraph describing the irresistible wit which had convulsed Brookes's with laughter, and which concluded by pronouncing the honourable member an ornament to British society. On this occasion, Sheridan soon observed that the deputation from Stafford was an angry one ; so lie walked quietly up to each individual, and put some questions to him relating to his domestic concerns. He had not forgotten anybody or any circumstance. He asked one of his constituents if Mrs Grundy's preserves and jams, which she was making when last he saw her, had proved of first-rate quality ; whether Miss Grundy the elder continued to charm the world with playing Stiebett's "" Storm "" on the piano; if Miss Grundy the younger still took lessons from Mr Town in velvet-painting ; and whether Dr Squill had successfully vaccinated Master Tommy. To each the great man had something to say which seemed calculated to soothe the irritation of the hearer, and to prevent him from uttering a word of blame. Each man saw before him the most fascinating individual in the kingdom fixing upon him his dark flashing eye, and addressing him in persuasive accents, with the blandest smile.

He had established a fine orchestral and choral force, and gave concerts of first-class importance every week at Manchester and in many of the great Northern towns. He was an excellent conductor, without any tricks or oddities. As a conductor of choral music he was just as successful as with the orchestra, which is not always the case. He did not train the choir, that being done for him by a chorus-master of splendid energy and resource, Charles Hecht. The choir worshipped Hallé, the Lancashire lads and lasses coming entirely under his sway. I think he was never nonplussed but once. This was during one of the many performances of Berlioz's ""Faust"" (a work that Hallé had really restored to life, at least in England). In the well known Serenade for Mephistopheles there is a dramatic and dangerous part for the choir, who have to come in with a sudden satirical ""Ha !"" in the course of the song. An enthusiastic tenor in the choir was always very alert and on the spot to those who watched him, as I often did. But on this occasion he was a little too alert, and just a moment before the whole choir should enter, he came in alone with a loud nasal ""Ha !"" The effect was fearful, the choir could hardly go on, the audience were convulsed, and Hallé well he would have killed the man, I am sure, if he could, and he tried to do so with his eye. I never saw that tenor again, some say he emigrated.",PILGRIM.txt,"THE Canterbury Pilgrims, many years ago, probably passed through the streets or in the immediate neighbourhood of the old City of Rochester as they wended their way to and from the Shrine of Thomas a Becket. Their journeys lay through a diversified and beautiful country, and though toilsome could not have been without many happy days. Through the streets of the same old City of Rochester, nearly seventy years ago, I used to pass to and fro to attend to my duties at the Cathedral, starting on the Pilgrimage recorded in the following pages. My journey has been a long one, my experiences very diversified. I have had as companions, like the Canterbury Pilgrims, a varied Company of all Professions and Ranks of Men. My life's work has been attended with many joys and some sorrows, yet my days have not been really toilsome, and I have indeed been happy in my opportunities. The notes of my life which I have been tempted to put on record contain nothing very remarkable, of that I am quite conscious. But the duties which have fallen to me in connection with many important functions at the Abbey will be of some little interest to my friends at least.

As already mentioned, when living at Windsor I had made a musical setting of ""Christmas Bells,"" a poem from ""In Memoriam,"" and this being sung in the Abbey at Christmas-time had attracted the attention of a friend of Lord Tennyson, Mr. Baillie-Hamilton. He had also heard privately a performance of a setting of mine of Tennyson's humorous poem, ""The Goose."" Through Mr. Baillie-Hamilton's introduction, I got to know the Hon. Hallam Tennyson, and it was decided that the two settings should be performed at an evening party at the house of Lord Tennyson in Eaton Square. I took a portion of the Abbey choir with me, and we sang these two compositions before a large company. ""The Goose,"" with its humorous words, and, I think, fairly humorous music, seemed to please the audience very much. Indeed, I know it gave satisfaction to the Poet in one point.There is a verse in the poem describing the old owner of the goose getting prosperous with the results of her poultry-keeping, and the lines run : And feeding high and living soft Grew plump and able-bodied, Until the grave churchwarden doffed, The parson smirked and nodded. This is set in a mock sentimental way, and it produced considerable merriment, the Poet saying in my hearing, evidently with some satisfaction, ""That 's the poem the critics said showed I had no sense of humour."" It seemed to me that he had for the first time been quite easy in his mind on this subject. Another observation which I must record also came from the Poet in connection with this song. Mr. Frederick Locker, who was one of the guests, and himself a poet of no mean order, congratulated me before Tennyson on the way in which I had set the words, saying: ""I hope that your name will go down to posterity associated with the poem and its author."" ""In fact,"" added Tennyson, ""the current of my poetry will be Bridged"".",PILGRIM.txt,"I cling tenaciously to every remembrance of my childhood days at Rochester. For me the change from the Midlands to the ancient city on the Medway was a delightful experience. The neighbourhood of Rochester was then quite rural and very picturesque with its numerous hop-gardens and cherry orchards. It was a custom at my home for the children to be taken to the hop-gardens during the hop-picking season, to spend a happy day. The hop-pickers in those days were mostly poor people from Rochester, many of whom my parents knew. The migrant crowds from London were not then a feature. We would take up our station with, I suppose, the capriciousness of children, beside the bin at which some poor woman would be picking, and devote ourselves to what was for us the delightful game of picking hops. By this means we amused ourselves, and added to her earnings. The days spent in those gardens have a treasured corner in my memory. But possibly we enjoyed ourselves even more in the cherry orchards than in the hop-gardens. Our excursions were generally made to an orchard owned by a friend at Gillingham (then a village, now a large town), one or more fellow choristers making up our party. It was all a fruit-growing country, stretching from here to Faversham. The delight of us boys at being allowed to climb ladders into the very heart of the trees, and eat as many cherries as we could (and sometimes, I fear, more than were good for us), may be imagined. Those black-hearts and bigaroons are a luscious memory. I recollect we resolved artful boys that we were to throw the stones, if possible, into the next field so that our host would not know how many we consumed. The subtlety of this little trick has been in my mind more than once in later years, when I have been shooting grouse and probably expending a great many more cartridges than was justified by the few birds there were to show for so much ammunition. On several occasions I have been tempted to resort to a furtive strategy, and hide my failure by distributing the empty cartridge-cases as remotely as possible in the heather!",,,

I had the honour of rehearsing these two distinguished pupils, and they each accepted a Book of the Music from me as a reward for their keen attention to their studies ! The Processional anthem ""I was glad"" made a splendid effect, the Westminster boys' ""Vivats"" coming in with superb effect. And they had an extra chance also, for in consequence of His Majesty the King not entering the Choir until some time after Her Majesty the Queen, the ""Vivats"" had to be repeated. It was here that the value of Dr. Borland's system of signals, already referred to, was fully revealed, and my precaution in adopting them amply vindicated. The signals to the choir and band worked admirably, and I must add that Dr. Alcock (now organist of Salisbury Cathedral) at the organ extemporised so effectively that the whole affair, which might have proved an awkward moment if not a catastrophe, passed off as if it had been rehearsed as a part of the programme. Sir Walter Pariatt sat on the conductor's platform with me, taking his share in conducting the orchestral music and directing the performance of his own anthem. Concerning my Homage anthem no cut was necessary. The aged Archbishop Temple was a little slower over the ""Homage"" than we had anticipated, the music in its entirety being required to accompany this picturesque function. A striking feature of the ceremony was the Procession of the Regalia, which formed an early and interesting item in the day's proceedings. The Abbey clergy charged to bear the regal symbols from the Jerusalem Chamber into the Church were accompanied in procession by the choir. Traversing the Cloisters, singing the hymn ""Rejoice to day with one accord,"" to the grand old tune ""Ein' feste Burg,"" a pause was made for a short service in Edward the Confessor's Chapel, and another pause near the Chapel of Henry VII., while Tallis's Litany was sung as above described; then, supported by two trumpets and three trombones, the procession was resumed, to the strains of ""O God, our help in ages past."" At the last verse, as the singers comprising the choirs of the Abbey and the Chapel Royal neared the great West door, the hymn was taken up by the Coronation choir and the vast congregation, producing an unrehearsed climax of overwhelming majesty that will never be forgotten by those present.",PILGRIM.txt,"While speaking of the school, I may as well tell a final story of those old days. At a later period of my school life we were removed to yet another room, in a house inhabited by the school-master in the Precincts. It was a rambling old place, with an enormous roomy cellar. The master was about to punish a boy his own son for some misdemeanour, when the young gentle- man suddenly slipped out of the door, across the hall, and out into the yard at the back. His father, after a moment's surprise, followed him cane in hand, and arrived in the yard just in time to see the culprit dis- appear into the capacious cellar. He felt perfectly certain that his bird was trapped, and followed without undue haste. After a time he reappeared in the school, and to our surprise said, "" Have you seen Willie ? "" "" He went out into the yard, Sir,"" we replied. "" Oh, yes,"" said the master, "" and into the cellar, but I have thoroughly searched and he has most unaccountably disappeared."" I do not remember when the boy reappeared, but his method of escape, somewhat original, was as follows : The master, not long before, had purchased a barrel of apples, which was placed in the cellar. The barrel and its contents had been discovered by his children, and the apples consumed. The empty barrel, well-known to the runaway, he quickly turned over, and as his father, cane in hand, prowled around, the boy within it watched him, with some anxiety, through the bung-hole. Our schoolmaster used the cane pretty freely, and he had one refinement of punishment which was very original, which he would resort to if a boy's fault was very heinous. In his eyes the most serious faults were prevarication and falsehood. One boy was particularly prone to these (I will not give his name, but he became a very good member of society all the same). This boy seemed always to be undergoing verbal reproof for his infirmity, and if in the service there occurred one of the Psalms referring to lies such as the 58th, "" The ungodly are froward . . . they go astray, and speak lies;"" or the loist, ""There shall no deceitful person dwell in My house "" the master would say to the boy : "" Master , did not your conscience prick you ? "" , and the boy always answered "" Yes, Sir."" The method I have referred to, and to which such admonitions were the prelude, was to send the delinquent down the High Street to purchase a good, stout cane with which he was to receive chastisement when he returned ! This occurred more than once in the experience of the same boy who never failed to bring back the cane, so that if he lacked the grace of truth, he certainly did not fail in fidelity. ",,,

I had alighted in Dean's Yard, and was searching in my pocket for the fare, when suddenly he exclaimed, ""Well, Sir Frederick, how did the concert go off?"" I was rather taken aback by this unexpected query, and for a moment hardly knew what to reply. In point of fact, the particular concert was one of a special character. We had given a selection of Wagner, including ""The Last Supper,"" a very difficult work which had not been done in London for, I think, some twenty-five years indeed, very few choral societies had been able to tackle it. Pulling myself together, I said to the expectant cabby, ""Oh, I think pretty fair."" My friend at once replied, ""Well,for myself I don't understand Wagner [pronouncing it in familiar English], he is too abstruse and athematical for me."" This amused me very much, and after a little more conversation I said, ""Well, you know who I am. If you like to look out for me I shall be glad to employ you to take me to and from the rehearsals."" He thanked me, and said he would not forget. True to his word he turned up on the next occasion of a rehearsal. Afterwards I employed him often. He constantly came to the rehearsals, and also to the concerts, and on not a few occasions honoured me by adversely criticising my conducting. For example, he said, after a performance of ""Messiah,"" ""It was very good, Sir Frederick, very good : but what makes you take the 'Hallelujah Chorus' so fast?"" ""Fast,"" said I, ""I didn't take it fast."" ""Oh, yes, you did,"" he observed, shaking his head, adding, as he drove off, ""It may gain in brilliancy by your method, but it loses in majesty.

Our most pleasant fishing excursion was to Cooling Castle, with its beautiful I2th century gatehouse, still in an almost perfect state of preservation. The tale of its defence in 1554 by the then Lord of Cobham, against Wyatt's rebellion, was an interesting one to us boys. It was about seven miles from Rochester, and the moat contained roach and carp. We generally made up a party of five or six boys, rewarding the kind residents of the Castle by singing a part-song or two. Maas and I often went to the village of Snodland, where there was a good trout stream. It was in this stream I landed my first trout. I confess it was not with a fly, but the more humble worm ! Other fishing excursions were made to Farleigh, a delightful place above Maidstone, where we would sit all day beside the Medway throwing in huge lumps of ground-bait, and gentles, pulling out as a rule a very good basket of perch and roach. I believe I brought more zest to this sport than is now the case in my sometimes toilsome efforts to land the lordly salmon. Poor Maas loved fishing till the last, and it was a cold caught on a fishing excursion that brought on the illness that terminated fatally in 1886.

The Tchaikovsky number, in C minor, was accompanied by organ only; but in the other items the organ was supplemented by brass and drums. The service commenced with the penitential verses of Psalm 51, as set by Sir John Stainer. These were sung in procession, by priest and choir alternately. An instrumental interlude followed, viz., Beethoven's "" Trois equals"" for four trombones, which, played in the Triforium, had a magnificent effect. Handel's fine anthem, ""The ways of Zion do mourn,"" and Goss's ""The souls of the righteous,"" which I had specially arranged for this service, were sung. The hymn, "" O God, our help in ages past,"" sung very slowly by choir and congregation (except verses five and six, which were sung very softly by choir alone), provided an inspiring moment. Gibbons' Amen the same that had been rendered at King Edward's Coronation completed the service, and I played the Dead March in ""Saul,"" accompanied by brass and drums.

Before being very long at the Abbey it fell to my lot to play the Dead March in ""Saul."" I played it as I had heard Hopkins and other musicians play it, but to my surprise found that the Dean was much disappointed by my performance. I took the opportunity of seeing him and asking him what was wrong. He said it did not sound like the Dead March in ""Saul"" which he had been accustomed to from Turle, nor at all like the Dead March as played by Dr. Buck, of Norwich, which he had heard some thirty years before. I could not help replying that I did not suppose it did sound like Dr. Buck's performance, as I had never heard that Dr. Buck was a capable organist, although an admirable teacher of boys, but promised to take the opportunity of asking Turle what his particular version was. This I did, and soon found that it included the introduction of some remarkable drum effects, which I had somewhat modified.then told the Dean that if he would come and hear me, I would play it again. He came into the Nave one evening, when I gave him a supply of drums far exceeding whatTurle had done (I must admit for that occasion only), and he wrote me a note saying he was quite satisfied. Since then I have played the Dead March many times, and fancy I am somewhat celebrated for my drum effects, although these, I am afraid, are not approved by some of my brother organists.",PILGRIM.txt,"Another little witticism of Sydney Smith's in connection with Goss was told to me by the latter.

A dinner was given to some of the Cathedral body in the Chapter House of St. Paul's, Goss, as assistant-organist, being among the guests. He was somewhat anxious concerning the view Sydney Smith took as to his fitness for the post, but his mind was set at ease by a remark of the witty Canon, who with nice acumen was serving a salmon. Turning to Goss, he politely asked him did he prefer "" thick or thin.""

The concerts were then held in Tottenham Street, and their Majesties and the Royal Family were constant attendants ; but, although it was difficult to become a subscriber, the room was always crowded. I was lucky enough to meet with the approbation of Mr. Bates, in the recitative of "" Deeper and deeper still;"" my next song was the laughing one. Mr. Harrison, my predecessor at those concerts, was a charming singer : his singing "" Oft on a plat of rising ground ;"" his "" Lord remember David ;"" and "" O come let us worship and fall down,"" breathed pure religion. No Divine from the pulpit, though gifted with the greatest eloquence, could have inspired his auditors with a more perfect sense of duty to their Maker than Harrison did by his melodious tones and chaste style ; indeed, it was faultless ; but in the animate songs of Handel he was very deficient. I heard him sing the laughing song, without moving a muscle ; and determined, though it was a great risk, to sing it my own way, and the effect produced justified the experiment: instead of singing it with the serious tameness of Harrison, I laughed all through it, as I conceived it ought to be sung, and as must have been the intention of the composer : the infection ran ; and their Majesties, and the whole audience, as well as the orchestra, were in a roar of laughter ; and a signal was given from the royal box to repeat it, and I sang it again with increased effect. Mr. Bates assured me, that if I had rehearsed it in the morning, as I sang it at night, he would have prohibited my experiment. I sang it five times in the course of that season by special desire.",REMKEL1.txt,"One of them had been a captain of Calabrian banditti, previous to which, he had been the hero of the pickpockets on the Largo di Castello at Naples. He told us many of his exploits, and something of his education. When a boy, he had been placed at a school, where his trade was regularly taught. A large figure, made of straw, was placed in the middle of a room, about which were arranged watches, trinkets, pocket handkerchiefs, &c. &c. The master of the school (and a very great master of arts he was), stood by and gave instructions. No one was allowed to be an adept, or fit to take the field, till he could rob the figure without being observed, or deranging a single straw. They recounted many anecdotes ; the following one of the celebrated Gabrielli, though well known, I cannot refrain from repeating, as she had, in consequence, remained several days in the very room we then occupied. Gabrielli, though beautiful, generous, and rich, had a most capricious temper. She was the idol of the Palermitans ; notwithstanding^ one evening, on which a new opera was to have been performed, as they were going to begin, the house being crowded, and the Viceroy and court present, she sent word she had a head-ache, and could not perform. Every endeavour of the manager and her friends to induce her to fulfil her duty, only rendered her the more obstinate ; and even the threat of a dungeon, from the Viceroy, had no effect ; at length, after exhausting every other method to restore her to reason, a guard seized and conducted her to prison. She told the captain of the guard, with the greatest sang froid, "" Your Viceroy may make me cry, but he shall not make me sing. 1 ' After remaining two days in confinement, she was released.",,,

His sister, nearly his own age, kept his house for him. She was reckoned a deep blue, and very well versed in all the arts and sciences: The great poet Metastasio had lived sixty year in her brother's house, upon the most friendly terms, and died in it. The colleges of Bologna and Pavia gave her the title of Dottoressa ; and deputations came from both those places, with her diploma. When I was admitted to her conversaziones and musical parties, she was in the vale of years, yet still possessed the gaiety and vivacity of a girl, and was polite and affable to all. Mozart was an almost constant attendant at her parties, and I have heard him play duets on the piano-forte with her, of his own composition.

It is said that this mountain discharges a greater quantity of lava than either Etna or Vesuvius, and never ceases roaring ! On the third morning, I was roused by a dreadful noise on deck; when I went up, all was uproar ; at last the captain told me we , were pursued by a Turkish galera ; the crew, instead of working the vessel and endeavouring to escape, were on their knees, each praying to his patron saint ! some one of which, however, was propitious, for a stout breeze springing up, we got close in shore, and lost sight of the terrible galera.

<em> en masque</em> ; the nobility and ladies in their most slendid equipages, all masqued, throwing sugar-plums to the motley groupe below, which was composed of mountebanks, pulcinellas, cardinals, harlequins, &amp;c. with music, dancing, singing. In short, I was in a delirium of pleasure ! Every evening, we visited the theatres : - there are two for serious operas, the Aliberti and the Argentina, where the best performers are always found; indeed, should the manager attempt to introduce any thing inferior, woe be to him ! and, as these theatres are only allowed to be open during the carnival, he is obliged to pay enormous salaries to procure the first singers ; for the Romans will have the best or none. There are also two theatres for comic operas, La Capranica and La Valle. The Romans assume that they are the most sapient critics in the world ; they are, certainly, the most severe ones : they have no medium, all is delight or disgust. If asked whether a performance or a piece has been successful, the answer, if favourable, is, "" è andato al settimo cielo,"" - "" it has ascended to the seventh heaven."""" If it has failed, they say, "" è andato al' abbisso del inferno,"" - "" it has sunk to the abyss of hell."" The severest critics are the Abbes, who sit in the first row of the pit, each armed with a lighted wax taper in one hand, and a book of the opera in the other ; and should any poor devil of a singer miss a word, they call out "" bravo, bestia,"" "" bravo, you beast !"" It is customary for the composer of an opera, to preside at the piano-forte the first three nights of its performance, and a precious time he has of it in Rome. Should any passage in the music strike the audience as similar to one of another composer, they cry, "" Bravo, il ladro,"" "" bravo, you thief; or, "" bravo, Paesiello ! bravo, Sacchini !"" if they suppose the passage stolen from them, "" the curse of God light on him who first put a pen into your hand to write music !"" This I heard said, in the Teatro Aliberti, to the celebrated com-poser Gazzaniga, who was obliged to sit patiently at the piano-forte to hear the flattering commenda-tion. Cimarosa, who was their idol as a composer, was once so unfortunate as to make use of a movement in a comic opera, at the Teatro della Valle, which reminded them of one of his own, in an opera composed by him for the preceding carnival. An Abbe started up, and said, "" Bravo, Cimarosa ! you are welcome from Naples ; by your music of to-night, it is clear you have neither left your trunk behind you, nor your old music ; you are an excellent cook in hashing up old dishes !"" Poggi, the most celebrated buffo singer of his day, always dreaded appearing before those stony-hearted critics ; however, tempted by a large sum, he accepted an engagement at the Teatro della Valle. He arrived in Rome some weeks previous to his engagement, hoping to make friends, and form a party in his favour ; he procured introductions to the most severe and scurrilous, and thinking to find the way to their hearts through their mouths, gave them splendid dinners daily. One of them, an Abbe, he selected from the rest, as his bosom friend and confidante ; he fed, clothed, and supplied him with money ; he confided to him his terrors at appearing before an audience so fastidious as the Romans. The Abbe assured him, that he had nothing to fear, as his opinion was looked up to by the whole bench of critics ; and when he approved, none dare dissent. The awful night for poor Poggi at length arrived ; his ficlus Achates took his usual seat, in his little locked-up chair in the pit. It was agreed between them, that he was to convey to Poggi, by signs, the feeling of the audience towards him; if they approved, the Abbe was to nod his head; if the contrary, to shake it. When Poggi had sung his first song, the Abbe nodded, and cried, "" Bravo ! bravissimo"" but in the second act, Poggi became hoarse, and imperfect ; the audience gave a gentle hiss, which disconcerted the affrighted singer, and made him worse : on this, his friend became outrageous, and standing up on his chair, after putting out his wax-light, and closing his book, he looked Poggi in the face, and exclaimed, "" Signer Poggi, I am the mouth of truth, and thus declare, that you are decidedly the worst singer that ever appeared in Rome ! I also declare, that you ought to be hooted off the stage for your impudence, in imposing on my simple and credulous good nature, as you have done."" This produced roars of laughter, and poor Poggi retired, never to appear again, without even exclaiming, "" Et tu, Brute,"" which he might most appropriately have applied to his guardian crony. A circumstance something like this took place at the Teatro Argentina. A tenor singer of the name of Gabrielli, brother of the great female singer of that name, was engaged there. Before he had got through five bars of his first song, the critics began to hiss and hoot, (and very deservedly so, for he was execrable), saying, "" Get away, you cursed raven "" Get off, you Goat !"" On which he came forward and addressed the audience very mildly, "" You fancy you are mortifying me, by hooting me ; you are grossly deceived ; on the contrary, I applaud your judgment, for I solemnly declare to you, that I never appeared on any stage without receiving the same treatment, and sometimes much worse !"" This appeal, though it produced a momentary laugh, could not procure a second appearance for the poor fellow.",GRONOW.txt,"No one can describe the splendour and excitement of the early days of Crockey. A supper of the most exquisite kind, prepared by the famous Ude, and accompanied by the best wines in the world, together with every luxury of the season, was furnished gratis. The members of the club included all the celebrities of England, from the Duke of Wellington to the youngest Ensign of the Guards ; and at the gay and festive board, which was constantly replenished from midnight to early dawn, the most brilliant sallies of wit, the most agreeable conversation, the most interesting anecdotes, interspersed with grave political discussions and acute logical reasoning on every conceivable subject, proceeded from the soldiers, scholars, statesmen, poets, and men of pleasure, who, when the "" house was up "" and balls and parties at an end, delighted to finish their evening with a little supper and a good deal of hazard at old Crockey's. The tone of the club was excellent. A most gentlemanlike feeling prevailed, and none of the rudeness, familiarity, and ill- breeding which disgrace some of the minor clubs of the present day, would have been tolerated for a moment. Though not many years have elapsed since the time of which I write, the supper-table had a very different appearance from what it would present did the club now exist. Beards were completely unknown, and the rare mustachios were only worn by officers of the Household Brigade or hussar regiments. Stiff white neckcloths, blue coats and brass buttons, rather short-waisted white waistcoats, and tremendously embroidered shirt-fronts with gorgeous studs of great value, were considered the right thing. A late deservedly popular Colonel in the Guards used to give Storr and Mortimer £25 a year to furnish him with a new set of studs every Saturday night during the London season. The great foreign diplomatists, Prince Talleyrand, Count Pozzo di Borgo, General Alava, the Duke of Palmella, Prince Esterhazy, the French, Prussian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Austrian ambassadors, and all persons of distinction and eminence who arrived in England, belonged to Crockford's as a matter of course ; but many rued the day when they became members of that fascinating but dangerous coterie. The gi-eat Duke himself, always rather a friend of the dandies, did not disdain to appear now and then at this charming club ; whilst the late Lord Eaglan, Lord Anglesey, Sir Hussey Vivian, and many more of our Peninsula and Waterloo heroes, were constant visitors. The two great novelists of the day, who have since become great statesmen, Disraeli and Bulwer Lytton, displayed at that brilliant supper-table the one his sable, the other his auburn curls ; there Horace Twiss made proof of an appetite, and Edward Montague of a thirst, which astonished all beholders; whilst the bitter jests of Sir Joseph Copley, Colonel Armstrong, and John Wilson Croker, and the brilliant wit of Alvanley, were the delight of all present, and their bons mots were the next day retailed all over England. In the play-room might be heard the clear ringing voice of that agreeable reprobate, Tom Duncombe, as he cheerfully called, ""Seven,"" and the powerful hand of the vigorous Sefton in throwing for a ten. There might be noted the scientific dribbling of a four by ""Kino-"" Allen, the tremendous backing of nines and fives by Ball Hughes and Auriol, the enormous stakes played for by Lords Lichfield and Chesterfield, George Payne, Sir St Vincent Cotton, D'Orsay, and George Anson, and, above all, the gentlemanly bearing and calm and unmoved demeanour, under losses or gains, of all the men of that generation. The old fishmonger himself, seated snug and sly at his desk in the corner of the room, watchful as the dragon that guarded the golden apples of the Hesperides, would only give credit to sure and approved signatures. Who that ever entered that dangerous little room can ever forget the large green table with the croupiers, Page, Darking, and Bacon, with their suave manners, sleek appearance, stiff white neckcloths, and the almost miraculous quickness and dexterity with which they swept away the money of the unfortunate punters when the fatal cry of "" Deuce ace,"" "" Aces,"" or "" Sixes out,"" was heard in answer to the caster's bold cry of "" Seven,"" or "" Nine,"" or "" Five 's the main."" nodes ccenceque detim ! but the brightest medal has its reverse, and after all the wit and gaiety and excitement of the night, how disagreeable the waking up, and how very unpleasant the sight of the little card, with its numerous figures marked down on the debtor side in the fine bold hand of Mr Page. Alas, poor Crockey's ! shorn of its former glory, has become a sort of refuge for the destitute, a cheap dining-house. How are the mighty fallen ! Irish buckeens, spring captains, ""welcners"" from Newmarket, and suspicious-looking foreigners, may be seen swaggering, after dinner, through the marble halls and up that gorgeous stair case where once the chivalry of England loved to congregate ; and those who remember Crockford's in all its glory, cast, as they pass, a look of unavailing regret at its clingy walls, with many a sigh to the memory of the pleasant days they passed there, and the gay companions and noble gentlemen who have long since gone to their last home.

He always received me with kindness and hospitality. He was remarkably fond of punch, of which beverage I have seen him take copious draughts. He was also fond of billiards, and had an excellent billiard table in his house. Many and many a game have I played with him, but always came off second best. He gave Sunday concerts, at which I never was missing. He was kind-hearted, and always ready to oblige ; but so very particular, when he played, that if the slightest noise were made, he instantly left off. He one day made me sit down to the piano, and gave credit to my first master, who had taught me to place my hand well on the instrument. He conferred on me what I considered a high compliment. I had composed a little melody to Metastasio's canzonetta, "" Grazie agl' inganni tuoi,"" which was a great favourite wherever I sang it. It was very simple, but had the good fortune to please Mozart. He took it and composed variations upon it, which were truly beautiful ; and had the further kindness and condescension to play them wherever he had an opportunity. Thinking that the air thus rendered remarkable might be acceptable to some of my musical readers, I have subjoined it. Encouraged by his flattering approbation, I attempted several little airs, which I shewed him, and which he kindly approved of; so much indeed, that I determined to devote myself to the study of counterpoint, and consulted with him, by whom I ought to be instructed. He said, "" My good lad, you ask my advice, and I will give it you candidly ; had you studied composition when you were at Naples, and when your mind was not devoted to other pursuits, you would perhaps have done wisely; but now that your profession of the stage must, and ought, to occupy all your attention, it would be an unwise measure to enter into a dry study.

The battle is real, and contested with the most inveterate obstinacy, many of the combatants being desperately wounded, and sometimes killed. Surely this barbarous custom is unworthy a civilized nation. Previous to the exhibition of this extraordinary spectacle, Viganoni took me to see the baths, which are considered extremely efficacious in pulmonary complaints. They are admirably constructed, and are visited by invalids from all parts of Europe, amongst whom are many English. While there, a man was pointed out to me, whose head was shaved, and who wore the dress of a galleyslave, sweeping the baths. He did the most laborious work by day, and at night was chained on board a Tuscan galley, which lay in the Arno. This man was the well-known Giuseppe Afrissa, who had visited and been received at all the courts of Europe; and at Vienna, had been in such favour with the Emperor Francis I. and his Empress, Maria Theresa, that he sat at their table, and was appointed Master of the Revels at Schoenbrunn and all the royal palaces ! He was banished from Vienna for some disgraceful act, but not before he had contrived to lose at the gaming-table every shilling of a large fortune, which he had originally acquired there. He returned to Turin, his native place, where he joined with four notorious swindlers, who travelled into various countries, committing forgeries. In England and Holland they were particularly successful. At length Afrissa was arrested in his career at Pisa, by a Dutch merchant, on whom he had committed a forgery to an immense amount; he was tried, and condemned to hard labour as a galley- slave for life. When seized, he w r as in company with one of his associates, a Genoese, who instantly took a small phial from his pocket and swallowed the contents. He died in great agonies.

The first performance was "" The Messiah, which I was to open on the Thursday morning. I was to quit town on the Tuesday, but on Monday night I received an order not on any account to leave London, for Mr. Sheridan had sent a peremptory message to have Richard Coeur de Lion performed ; and against his decree there was no appeal. John Palmer, the excellent comedian, was with me when I received the message ; he said to me, "" My valued friend, Richard will be over by eleven o'clock ; if you choose to have a carriage and four horses at the door, you will get with ease to Norwich by twelve, on Thursday, in time to open "" the Messiah. Norwich is the city that first cherished me, and where I married my beloved wife; how I should like to accompany you, if you would give me a seat in your chaise. I said it would make me very happy to have the pleasure of his company. He told me he was perfectly acquainted with every inn on the road, and would write immediately to those where we were to change horses, to have relays prepared for us, that we might not meet with any delay on the road. I was much pleased with the promised arrangement, and wrote to Madame Mara that I should be at Norwich on Thursday in time, requesting her to secure two beds at the Hotel where she was ; one for my friend Palmer, and one for myself. On Wednesday evening, as I was dressing for Richard, my friend Palmer came to me, with the countenance of Joseph Surface, and sighing, said, "" My best of friends, this is the most awful period of my life; I cannot leave town; my beloved wife, the partner of my sorrows and my joys, is just confined."" I said, under such circumstances, of course I could not expect him to leave Mrs. Palmer, but I hoped there would be no mistake about the horses, which were ordered to be ready at each post ; he sat down, and deliberately wrote down the names of all the places where he had ordered them to be in readiness. About eleven o'clock, having merely taken off my Richard's dress, I got into the carriage ; and accompanied by a Scotchman, who was my valet and hair-dresser, rattled off full speed to Epping, where we were first to change, at the inn marked down by my excellent friend ; we knocked and bellowed for Mr. Palmer's horses ; at last out came the ostler ; Mr. Palmer had no horses there ; he had not sent any orders ; nor did they even know who Mr Palmer was. I never in the course of my life experienced a greater disappointment ; in short, all the way down I had to wait for horses, as Palmer had not written to any one of the inns ; however, the road was excellent, and by paying the boys well, I got on at a capital pace without the smallest accident. It was market-day at Norwich, and as I drove in, the good folks stared and wondered to see me getting my hair dressed in the carriage; however, I reached the church-door just as the overture to "" the Messiah,"" was on the point of commencing. I took my seat in the orchestra, opened the "" Oratorio,"" and never was in better voice, although naturally much fatigued. We had two more morning performances in the church, and three evening performances in the grand assembly room. At the conclusion of the festival I returned to town, and when I charged Palmer with neglect and deception, he swore that he had ordered all the horses exactly as he had stated. I thought it of no use to be at variance with him, and pretended to believe him.",REMKEL1.txt,"During July and August, I was on the pave, without an engagement ; but I had youth, health, and high spirits, with certain zecchinos remaining in my pocket to give them play : add to these, that I had very good friends in Florence ; Lord Cowper's house was always open to me, as was that of our Ambassador; and the Polish Prince, Poniatowski, a fine young man, who spoke English fluently, invited me to his concerts and dinners, and gave me frequent marks of his esteem. There was also a Mr. Faulkner, who was very kind to me, and who feasted the Florentines sumptuously. Florence is a delightful place to live in ; the climate is pure, the country charming, and the city magnificent. In my time, the Trinita Bridge (the most beautiful bridge in the world, built entirely of white marble, and adorned with four fine statues, representing the Seasons,) was the constant place of resort for serenaders of all descriptions. Every square, street, indeed every corner of this superb city, is filled with statuary, architecture, and paintings, by Michael Angelo, Bandinelli, Benvenuto Cellini, &c. &c. In the fifteenth century, a rich merchant called Pitti, built the fine palace which still bears his name ; but overwhelmed by the expense, he became a bankrupt, and the palace was purchased by the Medici family. It has continued ever since the residence of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. The Dominican church was richly hung with striped silk, red and yellow. The monks of the convent had in it an apothecary's shop, in which they made up medicines of the best quality, and sold them at a very cheap rate : they also sold all kinds of perfumery. The church of St. Marc is a very fine structure ; the remains of the celebrated Politian are buried there. The Casano Wood, something resembling our Hyde Park, is a delightful ride, where the nobility drove their own carriages ; on the holidays particularly, the whole population of Florence assembled there ; and there II Commandatore Pazzi, a nobleman of immense fortune, used to exhibit his coachmanship, driving his phaeton with six cream-coloured horses, which he managed with great dexterity. The Baboli Gardens were much frequented in the evening, and were very beautiful. The peasantry of the environs of Florence are considered rich, and all, in a greater or less degree, gifted with a talent for poetry. No young man would dare to approach his mistress if he were not able to declare his passion in verse, or improvvisare on her beauties ! During my idle time, I went with a large party to Forligani, about twenty-five miles from Florence, in the Upper Val di Arno, to witness the grand festival, in honour of Santa Massinina. It is a curious fact, that for months, sixteen or seventeen thousand of the peasantry are kept in training to represent the story of David and Goliath. They form two grand armies, the Philistines and the Israelites. Their kings, princes, &c. are all dressed magnificently in ancient costume, with ancient martial instruments, &c. on both sides. The programme was very clearly made out, and well executed. The whole of the challenge, David's acceptance of it, his breaking his adversary's head with a stone, and then cutting it off with his own sword, were all performed in very excellent pantomime. After the general battle and route of the Philistines, the Israelites return, and place David in a triumphal car ; his prisoners following, amidst the clang of martial instruments, and the shouts of between twenty and thirty thousand people.

I went, first, to the grand opera, and was delighted with the magnificence of the scenery, decorations, and dresses, and, above all, with their choruses ; in that department they decidedly bear away the palm from every other country the orchestra was most minutely attended to, and more numerous than even that of San Carlo at Naples : but the principal singers (God save them) made a shriek louder than I thought any human beings capable of producing. The opera was Gluck's Iphigenia, which we had performed at Vienna ; but for decorations and effect, Paris beat us out of the field. The chorus and procession, where Pylades and Orestes in chains, were dragged on by Gardel, Vestris, and a host of first-rate dancers, were beyond any thing I could have conceived. I went the next night to the same theatre, and saw the first representation of the grand serious opera of ""Oedipe a Colon ;"" the music by Sacchini, was delightful and enchanting. I there heard, for the first time, the celebrated bass singer, Cheron, who played the part of Oedipe, and sang in a delightful style ; it was quite different from the performance of the night before, indeed I could scarcely imagine myself in the same theatre. I saw, too, the opera of Phedra, and had great pleasure in seeing Madame St. Auberti perform the part of Phedra ; she was a great actress, and when she sang in a demi voice, was quite charming. This unfortunate lady and accomplished actress subsequently married, and with her husband, the Count d'Entraigues, was robbed and murdered by their servant when in England. In this opera I felt much gratified by hearing Monsieur Lais, possessing a fine baritone voice, with much taste and expression ; but his greatest praise, in my opinion, was, that he was very unlike a French singer. The next theatre I visited, was the Francais. Their great tragedians, at the time, were on leave of absence in the provinces ; I had not, therefore, an opportunity of seeing a tragedy, but I was amply compensated by their excellent comedians ; their comic acting is always natural. I saw Mole act the part of Duretete, in Farquhar's Inconstant, admirably. Fleury was inimitable in Le Pupile (the guardian) ; and Madame Contare in Susan, Beaumarchais' Marriage of Figaro, exquisite. Dugazzon was a fine low comedian ; indeed, I thought all the actors good ; but my favourite theatre of all was the Theatre Italien, in the Rue Favart, where French comic operas were performed ; the orchestra was very good, and the actors and singers equally so, a Mademoiselle Renard had a most delightful voice, and was a sweet singer. I saw there "" Richard Coeur de Lion,"" and enjoyed its charming music. I thought it always Gretry's masterpiece. Clairval, the original Blondel, gave the air of "" O Richard ! O mon Roi !"" with great expression. His acting in the scene when he heard the voice of Richard from the prison, was electrifying : his joy, his surprise, at having found his king, the trembling of his voice, his scrambling up the tree to let Richard hear his voice, and the expression altogether, made an impression on me that never can be effaced ; and while I remained at Paris, I never missed going to see him. Monsieur Philippe played Richard remarkably well, and gave the bravura air, "" L'univers que j'ai perdu,"" with great skill and animation.",GRONOW.txt,"AYho in this ponderous old man would have recognised the gallant youth who, as Ensign in the Guards, led on his men with incredible energy and activity across the ravine at Talavera ; where, if the great Duke had not sent the 48th Begiment to their assistance, very little more would have been heard of "" King "" Allen and his merry men 1 But one of the most famous dandies of his day was not fated thus to perish ; and he was preserved for thirty years after the great battle, to swagger down Bond Street or lounge on the sunny side of Pall Mall, to become an arbiter elegant iarum amongst the tailors, and a Maecenas at the opera and play. To render the ""King"" perfectly happy, one little item was wanting — money. His estates, if he ever had any, had long passed from him, and he had much difficulty in making the two ends meet. When, for economy's sake, he was obliged to retire for a short time to Dublin, he had a very large door in Merrion Square, with an almost equally large brass plate, on which his name was engraved in letters of vast size ; but it was very much doubted whether there was any house behind it. He was a great diner out ; and one spiteful old lady, whom he had irritated by some uncivil remarks, told him that his title was as good as board wages to him. Strange to say, this mauvais sujet was a great friend of the late Sir Eobert Peel, when Chief Secretary for Ireland ; and on one occasion, when they were proceeding in an open carriage to dine with a friend a few miles from Dublin, in passing through a village, they had the misfortune to drive over the oldest inhabitant, an ancient beldam, who was generally stationed on the bridge. A large mob gathered round the carriage ; and as Peel and the Tory Government were very unpopular at the period to which I refer, the mob began to grow abusive, and cast very threatening and ominous looks at the occupants of the barouche ; when* the ""King,"" with a coolness and self-possession worthy of Brummel, rose up, displaying an acre of white waistcoat, and called out, ""Now, postboy, go on, and don't drive over any more old women."" The mob, awe-struck by ""King"" Allen's majestic deportment, retired, and ""the industrious and idle apprentices "" went on their way rejoicing. The "" King "" was not a very good-natured person ; and as he had a strong, inclination to, and some talent for, sarcasm, he made himself many enemies. To give an idea of his "" style."" When the statue of George III. was erected in front of Eansom's banking-house, Mr Williams, one of the partners, commonly known by the name of "" Swell Bill,"" petitioned the Woods and Forests to remove that work of art, as it collected a crowd of little boys, who were peculiarly facetious on the subject of the pigtail of that obstinate but domestic monarch, and otherwise obstructed business. Lord Allen, meetin o-Williams at White's, said, ""I should have thought the erection of the statue rather an advantage to you, because, while you are standing idle at your own shop door, it would prevent you seeing the crowds hurrying to the respectable establishment of Messrs Coutts & Co., close by in the Strand."" The "" King "" did not possess much wit, but no one could say more disagreeable things at the most disagreeable moment. I remember his setting down the late Lady N , daughter-in-law of a celebrated legal functionary of that name, in rather an amusing manner. She was a vulgar Irish grazier's daughter, extremely plain, and clipped the King's English in a vain attempt to conceal a mellifluous King's County brogue. After passing many years in Rutland Square, Dublin, she suddenly found herself a Countess, with a large income. Her first step after this accession of dignity and fortune was to start for London, where she affected to have passed her life. ",,,

There were two immense orchestras erected in the church ; and all good professors, vocal and instrumental, were engaged to perform upon these occasions. The Archbishop prays, or appears to pray, while the Te Deum is sung. He then displays a phial, which contains the congealed blood of St. Gennaro ; towards this he holds up a large wax taper, that the people may perceive it is congealed. The miracle consists, as every body knows, in this blood dissolving before the congregation, and is supposed to be performed by the saint himself.

Favar was first ballet-inaster, Soderini went on the stage, after the rehearsal, and said to him, "" Allow me, my dear Sir, to introduce myself to you ; you are the dearest friend I have on earth, let me thank you a thousand times for the happiness you have conferred on me by coming amongst us; command me in any way, for whatever I do for you, I can never sufficiently repay you !""

A few special words must be given to this occasion. Already Fornasari had ceased to hold the supreme position which had been hastily and generally granted him during the previous season, and though he was still enthusiastically received by the general public, a few ""carpings and cavillings"" began to be heard. Doubts timorously indeed were whispered here and there, and it became gradually evident that Fornasari was not exactly the ""conquering hero"" which previous trumpetings had so loudly proclaimed him. In spite of his efforts on this occasion, backed by the advantage of Lablache's name and the singing of Persiani, in spite of the catching melodies, the vigorous chorusses and the dramatic style of Herold, ""Zampa"" failed in establishing itself upon the Anglo-Italian boards. After a very few nights, on which it was lustily applauded, it wholly disappeared from the bills. However, in behalf of the fame of Herold, it should be mentioned that a considerable portion of the frequenters of Her Majesty's Theatre only admitted at this period, as acceptable on its boards, the Italian school, pur et simple, and looked with coldness and mistrust on any names, how's ever accredited, which revealed a French, a German, or, still worse, an English origin.

Horses were immediately ordered, and I set off in hot haste for Paris. The journey was effected with a rapidity which in those days sounded almost marvellous; for railways were not, and the government mail absorbed the available posting resources of the road. Deeply shocked and afflicted as I was by the intelligence I had just received, and engrossing as were the thoughts it brought in its train, I had but one feeling constantly in my mind during my hurried journey — namely, that I should now be enabled to give up all connexion with the theatre, and return to my strictly professional career. For some years previously, when once I conceived that I had placed the interests of the opera on a sound financial basis, I had desired to detach myself from occupations which interfered with other and more solid pursuits ; I had been . withheld from putting this desire into practice, solely by the entreaties of Laporte, who protested, that, without my aid as coadjutor, the theatre would relapse into its former state of confusion, and that he himself would be obliged, thus deserted, to throw up all, or expect only ruin and disaster. But the time of freedom had at last arrived. The affairs of the opera would absorb and distract me no more. Thus I argued. How little do we know of our future, is the most trite of familiar remarks.

""LaFavorita,"" although not entirely new to England, having been already performed at London both in French and English, was new to the Italian boards; and in its Italian form had all the interest of a novelty. Perhaps, thus given as it was with singers far superior to any heard in it in this country, and with a far more correct and powerful ensemble, the opera gained in popular favour rather than lost, through the familiarity of opera-goers with its melodies. Apart from the unwonted interest attached by all the friends and habitues of the long-cherished establishment, to the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre in face of the new opposition, considerable sensation was excited by the first appearance on the Anglo-Italian stage of Signor Gardoni. Much had been said of the strange adventures that had befallen the handsome and gentlemanlike young tenor during his brief musical career. His first appearance on the stage raised a battery of opera-glasses from every part of the house; a murmur of gratified expectation followed. The success of Gardoni on this occasion was undoubted. Both his principal solos, sung in the purest taste and with perfect feeling, were encored with enthusiasm. The attraction of his performance was felt by all. Voice, style, and expression were there. His talent as an actor was alone disputed; for these were already days when a singer, however great his merit as a vocalist, was expected (and justly, on the lyrical stage) to be a histrionic artist also. It became the fashion among some dilettanti to say that Gardoni was no actor. Still, even as an actor he was pleasing. His manner, his bearing, his feeling, his conception of parts were blameless. He lacked only one element — power; he was not capable of bursts of passion.",REOPER.txt,"My first communication to my friends announced, that I intended to break off altogether my connexion with the affairs of the opera.

This communication was followed by earnest solicitations to the same effect from various other quarters. The assignees, as holders of the property, urged me in every way to undertake the concern, on the ground that I was the man most deeply versed in all the complicated affairs of the establishment, and most cognisant of the intricacies of its management. The temptation was great ; but I still hesitated. Not only my earnest desire to devote all my time once more to my profession held me back — there was another consideration that with equal force, probably, deterred me from giving my immediate consent. I could not shut out from my mind the bitter and harassing annoyances to which Laporte had been subjected by certain of the artistes, comprising Grisi, Persiani, Tamburini, and others, composing the so-called vieille garde. The dread of finding myself in a similar position of humiliation and distress was among the gravest of my objections. But the man, not less than the woman, who deliberates, is lost. I wavered, and was eventually persuaded to take the burthen of the management on myself.

On the contrary, an expectation of fresh disappointment hung over the minds of all. Under these circumstances, Baucarde may be said to have taken the town by surprise. According to a current story, young Baucarde had been originally employed in the palace kitchen of the Grand Duke of Tuscany; and, like the celebrated composer Lully, he first attracted the attention of his superiors by his talents for cookery. His manifest vocal advantages caused him to be placed in a position to acquire a sound musical education, and thus to become one of the most agreeable tenors of his time. Nothing was expected, yet great results were achieved. With a charmingly sweet, bnt still robust voice of wonderful extension; with a style wherein the use of the falsetto was at once sparingly and judiciously employed, this young artist won easily upon a public accustomed to give a preference to natural gifts over the display of skill.

After dinner, the weather being warm the party strolled in the garden attached to the Embassy — Catalani and Jenny Lind talking much together. In the evening, some little embarrassment arose about asking Jenny Lind to sing, because, as no one ever refuses a request made by the representative of majesty, the Marchioness considerately forbore to place the young Swede in a position of difficulty. But Catalani, who was burning vsdth curiosity to hear Jenny Lind sing, perceived that there was some hesitation, went up to the ""Nightingale,"" and asked her with grace and earnestness to oblige the company with a song, adding, ""C'est la vieille Catalani qui desire vous entendre chanter, avant de mourir !"" Such an appeal from such a person, overcame all Jenny's habitual dislike to sing in private society. She sat down to the piano, and after a few bars of prelude, gave her incomparable ""Non credea mirarti,"" playing the accompaniment herself. Now, the salon at the Embassy was exceedingly ill-adapted for vocal display, being crowded with stuffed sofas, chairs, and other heavy furniture, curtains inclusive. Jenny Lind's beautiful voice was consequently heard under sensible disadvantage; moreover, she had to sing in a sitting posture instead of standing up. Nevertheless, the many obvious merits of her style, taste, and execution enchanted the Italian ear of Catalani, who sat on the ottoman in the centre of the room, enjoying the rare treat, rocking her body to and fro with delight and sympathy, and murmuring (loud enough to be overheard by Mrs. G, who sat by her side), ""Ah! la bella cosa che la musica, quando si fa di quella maniera !"" — and again, ""Ah ! la carissima ! quanto bellissima !""

I had learned at the same time to oppose to these evil elements of anarchy a policy of silence and reserve, and I determined rigidly to abstain from all direct interference in matters not immediately belonging to my own functions. This policy, while it gained for me among the artists the soubriquet oi ""L' Homme Mysterieux"" enabled me to exercise the influence which inscrutal)ility and mystery often do command, especially with the demonstrative and impatient foreigner.

To resume my narrative. Terms Tvere arranged with the assignees of Mr. Chambers for the rental of the theatre until the sale could be completed. The necessary capital was forthcoming, and the season of 1842 opened under my sole direction. Before entering, however, into the history of my management, it might be well to set in a clearer light the real position which a director of the opera must occupy in England. It has been already observed, that no assistance is afforded to our theatres by Government. Any one designing to enter upon the management of one, especially of the Italian Opera, has to provide capital, to make advances, and to defray his expenses beforehand, trusting to overtake all by a successful season, or rather by a series of such. The man himself should possess the sort of talent and knowledge adapted to the enterprise, and ought like-wise to be endowed with fortitude, hopefulness, patience, and .power of self-controul, coupled with strong health and ability to endure fatigue. Now, supposing a courageous and competent person to present himself in the position of a director, uniting the requisites sketched above, with what feelings do we find him regarded by the theatrical section of the public? The answer will suggest itself to most of those who have had experience of the habits of London society. ",,,
REOPER.txt,1438779843654,505464:507513,174,348,278,"Whilst Madame Sontag — whose return to London, as well as that of the other principal artists, was a matter of public notoriety — was yet singing in Paris, I had recourse to Madame Parodi, one of the objects of interest in the previous season. She was to appear as the chief ""star"" of the pre-Easter period, and considerable excitement was awakened in musical circles by the announcement that Pasta's favourite pupil would sustain the character of Medea, one of the parts of that great singer that were most strongly stamped upon the memory of a former generation of opera-goers. So, with the ""Medea"" of Mayer, and Mademoiselle Parodi as the enchantress, the theatre once more opened its doors. That I had been judicious in producing this opera, as a lure to curiosity, was attested by the result. But it never could have been expected to occupy a permanent position on the boards of Her Majesty's Theatre. The music of Mayer was of the ante-Rossinian school, and was consequently entitled to the respect of the old opera- goers, who in their early days had looked upon Rossini as a mere tune-maker. But it was not one of the best specimens of the early period of the present century, and it had owed its reputation to the correctness of its cold classicality, and, on the Anglo-Italian stage, to the powerful acting of Pasta. To modern ears it seemed tedious and almost commonplace — at all events, deficient in the dramatic warmth of later composers. The ""mantle"" of Pasta however, even to the literal acceptation of the word, had descended to her pupil; Parodi's performance created a lively interest, stamped, as it was, with the traditions of the great vocal Siddons of the Italian stage. It was powerful, impressive, and, of its kind, brilliant. The ""cast"" included Beletti and Calzolari — both sure, steady, and satisfactory singers of another school; Madame Giuliani; and, lastly, a new tenor, Micheli, who made his first appearance as Giasone, but failed utterly to obtain a favourable verdict from the critical audience of ""Her Majesty's.""",REOPER.txt,"From the noble Patron and Patroness down to the subscribing Bookseller ; from the wealthy Citizen down to the Modiste — all frequenters, or would-be frequenters of the opera, entertain a common sentiment of hostility towards "" the manager."" Most of them grudge giving their money. Each seeks to obtain his amusement by the least possible outlay. Admissions ""gratis"" are sought with importunity by those who can set forth the slightest claim to the favour. Artists themselves show no consideration for the director's purse, but clamour for boxes and tickets for friends without limit. Such is the wide-spreading feeling among the opera-going public, on the opening of a new season. No one thinks of the outlay : but everyone calculates the gains. Who ever expresses pleasure at the thought that the manager is making a profit ? He is, to speak openly, the "" common enemy"" in the eyes of both public and artists. The latter feel injured if he reaps the harvest of their labours, and think he ought to pay them higher ; the public feel displeasure at the prices required for admission, and argue, that, if the theatre ""pays,"" the tariff ought to be lower. Lastly, the difficulties of the director, when they become notorious, excite no compassion. A few rich noblemen tender a certain amount of support, on the understood condition of being allowed to influence the administration ; and when, induced by these flattering hopes of friendly assistance, tlie manager parts with his independence, he becomes powerless to recover his losses, and finally meets his ruin at the hands of the aristocratic ally, who relentlessly presses for repayment out of an empty treasury.

The Sontag once more trod those boards which had been the scene of her early triumphs. The sympathy her reappearance had created was evidenced by the enthusiastic, and it may be said, affectionate reception with which she was greeted by an overcrowded house. The cheering was universal, genuine, unusually prolonged. That she herself should be at first deeply affected, even to tears, at a greeting so heart-felt and spontaneous, was well conceivable. The revival of old memories, at those exciting and once familiar sounds, joined to the thought of the causes which had placed her in that arena, must have moved her pro- foundly. A glance at the box where sate the husband and children for whose sake this great and noble sacrifice had been made, gave her the necessary courage. Sontag subdued her emotion. In a few minutes she was once more the artist, and the artist alone. That a halo of interest was thrown around the high-placed lady, who had descended from her pedestal, and quitted the pride and charm of her social and domestic life to resume professional duties, long since laid aside, was perfectly intelligible. But it was not as the heroine of a romance of real life that Sontag reappeared; not as the Countess, who from well-appreciated motives had reassumed the dramatic mantle. It was as the artist alone that she had come to earn the suffrages of the public — as the artist alone that she desired to be judged. It was to sound judgment, and not to mere curiosity and sympathy, however legitimately awakened, that she appealed. And in that judgment she found her reward. Her return to the stage was one long triumph. All had felt that it must be a marvel, if, after more than twenty years, this gifted prima donna could return with her powers unimpaired. Yet the marvel was here — an unquestionable fact. Her voice was ""as fresh, pure, and beautiful as ever."" Madame Sontag brought back an artistic skill, matured and perfected by the continued study which, since her retirement, had been to her a labour of love. The beauty, which had exercised so great a fascination over an elder generation, was, strange to say, but little changed. It was remodelled rather than effaced, whilst the figure seemed almost untouched by time. The pleasing contour of the face, the beaming and expressive eye, and, above all, the winning smile which formerly had stolen away so many hearts, were all there. Men declared that with the most clear and searching of opera- glasses they could not give her more than five-and-twenty. She was, in truth, a living marvel! And, more strange than all, the Sontag who had been deemed by a former' generation somewhat deficient as an actress (although the most exquisite of soprano singers), was discovered to have warmth, animation, expression, even power, as a dramatic artist! The fascination of her histrionic talent came to be as great as that of her faultless execution. The public is said to be a ""wayward"" creature; but, on the contrary, it is extremely difficult to be moved from prepossessions once formed for good or for evil. Whatever change may supervene in an artist, the public is loath to admit a change into its own formed opinions. Sontag left the stage with the reputation of being ""no actress."" On her return, it was almost impossible to persuade this public, wedded to traditions, that she was (what really was the case) one of the most finished and exquisite histrionic artists.",REOPER.txt,"Indeed, when the enormous expenditure involved in the carrying on of the theatre, its high rent, the heavy rate of insurance against fire, the army of functionaries in its pay, the wear and tear of the "" properties,"" the losses by non-payment of boxes, the vast sums absorbed by the artists — singers, dancers, and orchestra — are all taken into consideration, it is easy to imagine how large must be the receipts which should balance such outgoings. And be it always borne in mind, that in the case of Italian Opera, the season, properly so called, lasts no more than four or five months out of the twelve. The principal source whence a director derives support, encouragement, and satisfaction in his career, apart from pecuniary profit, is to be found in the character and behaviour of some of the more distinguished artists, with whom the reputation of the opera has been intimately associated. Very many of the great names, which have illustrated the period of my management, are set down on the list of my attached friends and well- wishers. Having called attention to the circumstances that might utterly discourage any one disposed to enter upon the position of an opera manager, it will be a more pleasing task to mention the advantages and accidental aids which fell to my lot in addition to the personal qualifications which are emxmerated above, and which, I flatter myself, I brought to the services of my enterprize. One of these advantages I must especially mention : the professional education which I had gone through, enabling me to comprehend many legal intricacies which, to a "" layman"" (as one may say) would have been a hopeless puzzle. Again a distinct view of liabilities, contingencies, risks, and, on the other hand, of prospective privileges and advantages, was brought more clearly within the scope of my vision than was possible in the case of previous managers. To show that I was not a merely nominal lawyer, but had been sincere in the pursuit of my profession, I may state that, about the time of M. Laporte's death, I published a treatise on ''Parliamentary Practice,"" which became the standard work on the subject, and which, by shewing, in juxtaposition, the clashing rules of the two Houses with respect to private bills, led to their assimilation. I may add, that my respected friend and tutor, Mr. Basil Montagu, dedicated to me a work which he published on the "" Law of Election."" Not to dwell longer upon this point, I will now turn to the social position which I already occupied, and to the friendly consideration shewn towards me by persons of high standing in this country, as well as by distinguished foreigners. Noblemen were not backward in tendering support, and also pecuniary assistance (if such were needed), when it became a question whether I would or would not venture upon the step of taking the opera. And many of the leading men of fashion encouraged me to take it, prompted by the partiality felt for me as the zealous co-adjutor of poor Laporte — now no more. When at length I braced up my courage to the venture, the nobility, headed by a distinguished connoisseur belonging to their order, realized, by rallying round me, the promise which had encouraged my decision. Not only was a liberal "" subscription "" entered into for boxes and stalls for the season of 1842, by the aristocracy and gentry, but the list was graced with the namesof Her Majesty Queen Victoria, theQueen Dowager, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, besides those of many foreign diplomatists and visitors.

I hold the opinion, however, not only that it was, and still is, a superb embodiment, but that it did a great deal to restore to the character the musical and histrionic value which it had gradually been losing in inverse ratio to the ever-growing prominence of the central figure of the opera. For this reason I quote some lines that I penned anent M. de Reszke's impersonation at the time: He showed us that it was as easy for one great artist to revive the importance and enhance the interest of a good role as for twenty mediocrities to drag it down to the level of their own talent. It goes without saying that the Polish tenor copied nobody's Don Jose in particular. He knew the traditions of the character, just as he learned those of Sir Walter von Stolzing by visiting Bayreuth. He read his Merimee and carefully studied his libretto; but like an artist of individuality and resource, he also thought the part out for himself. The result, curiously enough, was a conception more closely resembling Campanini's than any we have seen since. It was free from the melodramatic exaggeration into which other tenors had fallen. Take, as an instance, the last act. M. de Reszke did not make himself up like a starved ghost, neither did he rush about like a savage animal in a cage. He looked the picture of despair, and he made his piteous appeal to Carmen with the tone of a man who is yearning for love, not for an excuse to commit murder. When at last driven to extremities, he did not gloat over his revenge nor chase his victim from corner to corner as a cat might chase a mouse. He simply stood at the entrance to the bull-ring, and when Carmen made her attempt to escape, he seized his dagger as by a sudden impulse and stabbed her as she was endeavoring to pass him. An instant later he was leaning over her lifeless body in tears, horror-stricken at the deed he had committed. This surely was the true reading of the episode. Nor was it the only scene upon which M. Jean de Reszke, with rare artistic insight, contrived to throw a new and consistent light.

By birth a Spaniard, and hailing from Pampeluna (the town in which Sarasate was born), Giuliano Gayarre had studied and won his early successes in Italy. He was an exponent of the new quasi-nasal Thirty Years of school of tenor singers, which already had Tamagno for one of its leading protagonists.

The fame of Leoncavallo's sensational opera had preceded it, and the public expected something remarkable. They were not disappointed. I have rarely seen an audience so breathless with excitement over the development of an opera plot. The effect of the little tragedy was augmented by the burning intensity of De Lucia, whose portrayal of the hapless Canio's anguish and suffering was a triumph of realism. His touching soliloquy at the end of the first act was delivered with an abandonment of feeling that completely carried away his auditors. Very fine, too, was Ancona's rendering of the already famous Prologue; deliciously pure and sweet was Melba's vocalization in the haUateUa for Nedda; excellent were the new-comers Richard Green and Bonnard as Silvio and Peppe; while Mancinelli's conducting left not a point undiscerned throughout.

Incapacity and indifference reached their climax with the disgraceful and humiliating scene that occurred at Her Majesty's Theatre on the night of March 6, 1886. Some unknown person, evidently without experience as a manager, had there started a season of Italian opera with a company of incompetent artists. On the fourth night it completely collapsed under circumstances unprecedented in the annals of opera in a great city.

At length, in response to deafening calls, the stage-manager came forward and announced that it was impossible to proceed. The stage-carpenters had refused to set the next scene, and the opera could not, therefore, go on. A howl of derision and anger greeted this statement; but the audience, having made up its mind to the worst, was preparing, amid a fearful din, to depart, when the curtain rose once more and a whole army of stage assistants came down to the footlights with outstretched arms and aprons, as though to implore the charity of the house. The gestures were understood, and, with one accord, the remaining occupants of the gallery and upper tiers began flinging a shower of coppers and small silver coins down on to the stage, uttering the while all sorts of satirical and uncomplimentary epithets.

They soon learned to neglect a strict observation of the Sabbath and got knowledge of several songs and bad things, which before they had no notion of. The civil behavior which made them admired when at home by all which saw them, was, in great measure, lost; and a clownish accent and many rude ways were learned which were not reformed without some difficulty. “When the house was rebuilt, and the children all brought home, we entered upon a strict reform; and then was begun the custom of singing Psalms at beginning and leaving school, morning and evening. Then also that of a general retirement at five o’clock was entered upon; when the oldest took the youngest that could speak, and the second the next, to whom they read the Psalms for the day and a chapter in the New Testament; as, in the morning, they were directed to read the Psalms and a chapter in the Old: after which they went to their private prayers, before they got their breakfast, or came into the family.

Nordica’s sister (Mrs. Walker) and Mr. Amherst Webber, the talented English maestro at piano who had recently acted as accompanist to the brothers in their Wagnerian studies. After supper the conversation turned upon Bayreuth, and allusion was made to a certain half-promise given by Jean de Reszke to Frau Cosima, that he would one day sing Tristan and Walther, or perhaps even Siegfried, at the festival. I remarked that, after what I had heard that night, I entertained no doubts concerning the adequate quality of his accent. This only elicited a further request that I would stay in New York until I had heard how it sounded in “Tristan”. Then the distinguished tenor turned to Mme. Nordica and proposed that, as I was evidently not to be made to alter my determination, the best thing they could do would be to “bring the mountain to Mohammed"" and sing some “Tristan” to me there and then; and that between one and two in the morning, and after a heavy opera like “Lohengrin""! Surely it was not possible. But surprise and incredulity quickly changed to delight. For, without an instant's hesitation, Mme. Nordica consented ; Mr. Webber went to the piano and played a few introductory bars; and, almost before I could realize what was being done, the two gifted artists were warbling the wondrous love scene from Wagner's immortal music-drama. They did not spare themselves, either, these generous friends. They sang with full voice; they went through not only the scene with which they had started, but the duet of the first act as well; and, from beginning to end, the exquisite beauty of their phrasing, the blending of their voices in perfect intonation and unity of color, the significance of their supreme dramatic interpretation, constituted at once a marvel and a revelation. It was a strange experience, sitting at the supper-table (for none of us but Mr. Webber had moved from our seats) while for an hour or more those two famous singers reveled in the enjoyment of their self-imposed task— undertaken for the sole purpose of conferring pleasure upon an old friend. The picture of that night remains vividly imprinted upon my mind, even as its vocal spell lives fresh and fragrant among my most treasured memories.",WESLEY.txt,"Nay, surely “all the gentlemen in these parts” will not lie against their own conscience! I rode hence to a friend’s house, some miles off, and found the sleep of a laboring man is sweet. I was informed there were many here also who had an earnest desire to hear “this preaching,” but they did not dare; Sir V n having solemnly declared, nay, and that in the face of the whole congregation as they were coming out of the church, “If any man of this parish dares hear these fellows, he shall not come to my Christmas feast!” Saturday, 6.—I rode with Mr. Shepherd to Gwennap. Here also we found the people in the utmost consternation. Word was brought that a great company of tinners, made drunk on purpose, were coming to do terrible things.",,,

The solo vocalists comprised what the new critic of the “Times” Dr. Francis Hueffer, was then fond of describing as the “representative English quartet”— Albani, Patey, Edward Lloyd, and Santley; nor have I forgotten how exquisitely William H. Cummings (now principal of the Guildhall School of Music, London) delivered the touching phrase allotted to the Penitent Thief. But, as a matter of fact, Gounod, with his sympathetic voix de compositeur, was singing more or less all through the rehearsal, wisely exercising his rare faculty for impressing his exact ideas upon the interpreters of his music. And what beautiful music it was! What a tremendous effect it created at Birmingham.",WESLEY.txt,"They filled the house at once and proposed setting it on fire. But one of them, happening to remember that his own house was next, with much ado persuaded them not to do it.  Hearing one of them cry out, “They are gone over the grounds,” I thought the advice was good; so we went over the grounds to the farther end of the town where Abraham Jenkins waited and undertook to guide us to Oakhill.

What they all agreed in was 1) that when they went away, as they termed it, it was always at the time they were fullest of the love of God; 2) that it came upon them in a moment, without any previous notice and took away all their senses and strength; 3) that there were some exceptions, but in general, from that moment, they were in another world, knowing nothing of what was done or said by all that were round about them. About five in the afternoon I heard them singing hymns. Soon after, Mr. B. came up and told me Alice Miller (fifteen years old) had fallen into a trance. I went down immediately and found her sitting on a stool and leaning against the wall, with her eyes open and fixed upward. I made a motion as if going to strike, but they continued immovable. Her face showed an unspeakable mixture of reverence and love, while silent tears stole down her cheeks. Her lips were a little open, and sometimes moved; but not enough to cause any sound. I do not know whether I ever saw a human face look so beautiful; sometimes it was covered with a smile, as from joy, mixing with love and reverence; but the tears fell still though not so fast. Her pulse was quite regular. In about half an hour I observed her countenance change into the form of fear, pity, and distress; then she burst into a flood of tears and cried out, ""Dear Lord; they will be damned! They will all be damned!"" But in about five minutes her smiles returned, and only love and joy appeared in her face. About half an hour after six, I observed distress take place again; and soon after she wept bitterly and cried out, ""Dear Lord, they will go to hell! The world will go to hell!"" Soon after, she said, ""Cry aloud! Spare not!"" And in a few moments her look was composed again and spoke a mixture of reverence, joy, and love. Then she said aloud, ""Give God the glory."" About seven her senses returned. I asked, ""Where have you been?""--""I have been with my Saviour."" ""In heaven, or on earth?""--""I cannot tell; but I was in glory."" ""Why then did you cry?""--""Not for myself, but for the world; for I saw they were on the brink of hell."" ""Whom did you desire to give the glory to God?""--""Ministers that cry aloud to the world; else they will be proud; and then God will leave them, and they will lose their own souls."" ",WESLEY.txt,"I fear God hath still a controversy with this land, because it is defiled with blood. Sunday, 10 (Easter day).—Never was such a congregation seen before at the sacrament in Athlone. I preached at three. Abundance of Papists flocked to hear; so that the priest, seeing his command did not avail, came in person at six and drove them away before him like a flock of sheep. Tuesday, 12.—I rode to Clara, where I was quickly informed that there was to begin in an hour’s time a famous cockfight, to which almost all the country was coming from every side. Hoping to engage some part of them in a better employ, I began preaching in the street, as soon as possible. One or two hundred stopped, and listened a while, and pulled off their hats, and forgot their diversion. The congregation at Tullamore in the evening was larger than ever before, and deep attention sat on every face. Toward the latter end of the sermon, there began a violent storm of hail. I desired the people to cover their heads; but the greater part of them would not; nor did anyone go away till I concluded my discourse. Friday, 15.—I rode to Edinderry. Abundance of people were quickly gathered together. Having been disturbed in the night by Mr. Swindells, who lay with me and had a kind of apoplectic fit, I was not at all well about noon when I began to preach, in a large walk, on one side of the town; the sun shone hot upon my head, which had been aching all the day; but I forgot this before I had spoken long; and when I had finished my discourse, I left all my weariness and pain behind and rode on in perfect health to Dublin.",,,

This evening three of our brethren came and offered to carry me thither if I could procure the mayor’s boat, which, they said, was the best sailer of any in the town. I sent, and he lent it me immediately. So the next morning, Tuesday, 13, John Nelson, Mr. Shepherd, and I, with three men and a pilot, sailed from St. Ives. It seemed strange to me to attempt going in a fisher-boat, fifteen leagues upon the main ocean, especially when the waves began to swell and hang over our heads. But I called to my companions, and we joined together in singing lustily and with a good courage: When passing through the watery deep, I ask in faith His promised aid; The waves an awful distance keep, And shrink from my devoted head; Fearless their violence I dare: They cannot harm—for God is there.",WESLEY.txt,"Here we found everything we wanted except sleep, of which we were deprived by a company of drunken sea captains, who kept possession of the room beneath us till between two and three in the morning.

In the meantime it began to rain hard, though the wind was extremely high. Finding none would come over, we went to a little church which stood near, for shelter.

She went gladly. The woman's husband hearing her stir between three and four began cursing and swearing bitterly.

Mr. Skelton replied, ""Sir, there was none this morning."" He answered, ""There was. Are there not churches and meetinghouses enough? I will have no more mobs or riots."" Mr. Skelton replied, ""Sir, neither Mr. Wesley nor they that heard him made either mobs or riots."" He replied plainly, ""I will have no more preaching; and if Mr. Wesley attempts to preach, I am prepared for him."" I began preaching in our own house soon after five. Mr. Mayor meantime was walking in the 'Change, and giving orders to the town drummers and to his sergeants--doubtless to go down and keep the peace! They accordingly came down to the house, with an innumerable mob attending them. They continued drumming, and I continued preaching till I had finished my discourse. When I came out, the mob immediately closed me in. Observing one of the sergeants standing by, I desired him to keep the King's peace; but he replied, ""Sir, I have no orders to do that."" As soon as I came into the street, the rabble threw whatever came to hand; but all went by me or flew over my head; nor do I remember that one thing touched me.

But many of the congregation were more roughly handled, particularly Mr. Jones, who was covered with dirt and escaped with his life almost by miracle.

I hope this also is a token for good. In conversing with many, I was surprised to find that all Ireland is in perfect safety. None here has any more apprehension of an invasion than of being swallowed up in the sea, everyone being absolutely assured that the French dare not attempt any such thing. I bought one or two books at Mr. Smith’s, on the Blind Quay. I wanted change for a guinea, but he could not give it; so I borrowed some silver of my companion. The next evening a young gentleman came from Mr. Smith’s to tell me I had left a guinea on his counter. Such an instance of honesty I have rarely met with, either in Bristol or London. I rode to Tullamore, where one of the society, Edward Willis, gave me a very surprising account of himself, he said: “When I was about twenty years old, I went to Waterford for business. After a few weeks I resolved to leave it and packed up my things, in order to set out the next morning. This was Sunday, but my landlord pressed me much not to go till the next day. In the afternoon we walked out together and went into the river. After a while, leaving him near the shore, I struck out into the deep. I soon heard a cry and, turning, saw him rising and sinking in the channel of the river. I swam back with all speed and, seeing him sink again, dived down after him. When I was near the bottom, he clasped his arm round my neck and held me so fast that I could not rise. “Seeing death before me, all my sins came into my mind and I faintly called for mercy. In a while my senses went away and I thought I was in a place full of light and glory, with abundance of people. While I was thus, he who held me died, and I floated up to the top of the water. I then immediately came to myself and swam to the shore, where several stood who had seen us sink and said they never knew such a deliverance before; for I had been under water full twenty minutes. It made me more serious for two or three months. Then I returned to all my sins. “But in the midst of all, I had a voice following me everywhere, ‘When an able minister of the gospel comes, it will be well with thee!’ Some years after I entered into the army; our troop lay at Phillipstown, when Mr. W. came. I was much affected by his preaching, but not so as to leave my sins. The voice followed me still, and when Mr. J. W. came, before I saw him I had an unspeakable conviction that he was the man I looked for. Soon after I found peace with God, and it was well with me indeed.”",,,
