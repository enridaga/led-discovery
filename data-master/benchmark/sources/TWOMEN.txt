Ml r DE/kR HUGH, 
I ara very glad I asked you to let me see the proofs 
again, for the sight bas ruade it clear to me that a f-ormal 
pref-ace f-rom a respectable Head Master would bc somcthing 
oY an outrage. I can't imagine anything more alien fiom 
the spirit of the New House than a solemn  apprecia- 
tion ', and no one could know better than Southwell and 
White how repugnant I should lïnd the task. 
On the other hand, they could not mind my writing you 
a lctter about them : if-there is one thing which this book 
makes plain it is that in a ]etter there is nothing which 
ma)" not be lït]y said when one is sure of one's correspon- 
dent, and they would, I think, appreciate the fiction by 
which I am supposed to disclose to you a lot o£ things 
about them which you know already far better than I. 
For the chaacteristic which stands out in my mind is 
the amaz[ng power whieh both oç them lad of  making 
believe 'mot rather of-making words and events and books 
and circumstaaces generally serve their own particular 
mood. The language which they imposed on the New 
House is an illustration of it, and Southwell's power of 



vi 

giving an air of momentous gravit} to the most trivial 
occasions is impossible to forget. No Masters' meeting 
can ever be quite the saine to me when he isn't there to 
address us on one of the subjects which he ruade his own» 
though his harangue used (}ou will remember) to begin 
with a confession that he was hot quite sure on which side 
it was that he fclt so strongly. Thc importance of trifles, 
the stores of humour to be unearthed from the common- 
places of lif% the infinite issues depending on a word or a 
phrase» until it was displaced flore its undeserved pre- 
eminence by another equally unexpected, these are some of 
the lessons which their daily lire displayed. They b.ad, in 
a word» the truly  poetic' faculty, though it did hot find 
expression in the consecrated form of verse. Southwell's 
lines on page 6 9 and his astonishing achievement in 
making his form into a nursery of English versifiers show, 
perhaps, wlat he might have done, and of course I have no 
means of knowing what secrets White told to lais violin ; 
but however it may have been expressed» the power was 
there : and if any critical reader complains that the instances 
I have given suggest rather the fancifulness of children than 
the inspiration of the author» I should answer that poets 
and children have the greatest qualities in common, and 
that when to their common powers of imagination they 
add the grace of humility they form the chosen citizens of 
the Kingdom of God. 
Any one who happened to read this letter without the 
book which it introduces might fancy that they dominated 



vii 

our Society at Shrewsbury by sheer force of personality and 
insistence on their own lines of thought ; but to read their 
letters is assuredly to realize that we loved them for those 
very qualities of humility and unselfislmess which shone out 
so supremely in the end. And here I touch on things too 
sacred for speech: I can only say in ail sincerity that 1 
know of none among ail my friends to whom the sacrifice 
was greater or by whom it was made in a more noble 
spirit. 
They vould resent any attempt to draw a moral, but l 
think they would not mind my saying that their lires and 
death brought additional honour to one ofthe noblest of pro- 
fessions, for they ]oved the lire and work of a scl:oolmaster 
as only born schoolmasters can. And there is one thing 
I know they would wish me to say, and that is that the lire 
of our Society fiom which they went was for those few 
years a nearly tk.at of a happy farnily as any which the 
wole annals or" schoolmastering can show. The New 
House, the Staircase, the Rehoboarnite Mcetings, Kitch's 
room with its interminable discussions and uncovenanted 
meals,--these are things which can never be forgotten 
while one of us remains to bless the naine of Shrewsbury : 
it never can happen again, but let us thank Heaven for the 
happiness we knew and for the fi'iends from whom we 
]earnt so much. 

Yours ever, 

C. A. ALINGTON.

CHAPTER I 

SHREWSBURY 

SEVTEMBER 1.910 TO MtRCH I9I " 

EVELYN SOUTHWELL and M/tLCOLM WHITE came together 
as masters to Shrewsbury in t9to; they left together in 
x 9 x 5 ; and they both were killed in the battle ofthe Somme. 
For those who knew them both it is impossible to consider 
them apart; the memory of them is single. To their 
contemloraries and to each other they were known as « the 
Men '. « Man, it's rime to go into school.' « Yes, Man." 
And so, in this account of their Shrewsbury life, they will 
be spoken of as ' the Men '. 

The following is an account of their first four terms, 
written by one who lived with them during that rime :m 
It is interesting to recall the impressions which they 
ruade on their arrivalo White had visited Shrewsbury 
before ; he came with experience of teaching at King's 
College Choir School and afterwards at Marlborough 
College, and with a reputation as a singer and violin- 
player: a reputation which was entirely justified by his 
performances. At first he made no very distinct impres- 
sion, probably because of his shyness, and he did not seem 
at once to tale very kindlyto Shrewsbur : he was constantly 
recalling witt regret the rime he had spent at Marlborough, 
|155 



2 Shrewsbury, 1 91 o--I 9 1 5 
but this phase did not last long: Shrewsbury soon became 
to him the object of reverence which it remained until the 
end. But several terres passed before he was valued at his 
true worth, partly owing to his shyness and partl), owing 
to his modesty ; the latter quality remained to the end as 
one of his most striking characteristics ; it was so perfectly 
genuine. He was an excellent violinist, and he must have 
known it, and the saine may be said of his powers as a 
singer, },et his skill in these directions was never obtruded, 
nor concealed b), an), false modesty. If asked to play, he 
would pla),, and his « That's rather joll),, isn't it ?" at the 
end of the piece suggested that, quite unafFectedl),, he con- 
sidered that the gratitude of the listeners was due entirel), 
to the composer; in fact he seemed to join in the gratitude 
and to regard himself as one of the listeners. 
His keen sense of humour did not appear at once. 
was of the  modern "t),pe which is best illustrated in litera- 
ture by the work of  A. A. M. ' in Punch ; though in some 
respects perhaps R. L. Stevenson was the forerunner of the 
t),pe. At any rate, White's love for The H/'rong Box was 
infectious, and quotations from that classic constantl), 
accompanied our meals. 
Southwell's arrival was somewhat different ; before his 
coming in Ma), I9Io he was known to no one in Shrewsbur), 
--apart from the Head Master--except as a first-class oars- 
man. He arrived almost straight from a long visit to Paris, 
and seemed at first very French ; his !ove of French litera- 
ture and the French nation (c those adorable people" he 
called them in at least one letter from the Front) remained 
constantl), with him. He came about eight o'clock in 
the evening of the day before school work began, and when 
some of the arrangements were being explained to him that 
night he caused some surprise b), inquiring about trains to 



Shrewsbury  9  o- 9  )" 3 
Liverpool ; he wanted to go to see an Oxford friend who 
was leaving for America. 
On his first morning the news arrived of King Edward's 
death.  Southwell» the King is dead!' greeted him 
through his bedroom door belote he was up.  No» really ? ' 
came back the answer in a tone of complete and absolute 
boredom and lack of interest» soon followed by remarks 
of interest and real concern. « No really ? ' spoken in 
a non-committal tone of voic G was often his answer to a 
remark either when the subject did not interest him or 
when he was really thinking of something else; in the 
latter case he generally shewed his interest very soon 
after. 
On another occasion after being very late on Saturday 
night, he ,cent to bed at a quarter to eleven on Sunday 
night; by a quarter-past elevcn he was sound asleep and 
was awakened by,  Southwell» the fire-engine is coming 
over Kingsland Bridge ; shall we go up to the school to see 
if any of the boys are burning ? ' « No»' he answered ; but 
within a few seconds he had collected himself» and rive 
minutes later was round at the School Hous% where there 
was a tir G happily a small one. 
At Shrewsbury he had his first experience ofteaching and 
his enthusiasm was extraordinary. Few meals passed without 
his explaining exactly what he had been teaching and how 
and who had done well and who badly ; this soon became 
a source of amusement, in which he fully shared. 
Another tact that is worth mentioning is the way in 
which a remarkable friendship grew up between these two 
men. It was not entirely due to common interests in 
lire or a similar outlook; it seems rather to have grown 
gradually, each man finding that the tastes of the other 
interested him and were worth acquiring. For instance, 
B  



4 Shrewsbury» 1 9 IO--I 9 I J" 
Southwell's idea of music at tle time was musical comedy 
White introducedhim to Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and 
Brahms, and there was an amusing discussion one night 
when Southwell complained bitterly that no one had 
told him of these men belote ', whilst he was wasting his 
rime at Oxford with musical comedy music. But with his 
extraordinary powers he went into the subject thoroughly» 
as his notes on the St. irlatthevo Passion shew ; and inci- 
dentally his piano-playing improved in the most remark- 
able way. 
Both men had one charactmistic in common--absolute 
tb, oroughness in whatever they undertook ; though it was 
shewn in different ways. When a new subject, or duty, 
arose about which they were ignorant, if it were unimpor- 
tant and uninteresting they probably would bave nothing 
to do with it. But if it were interesting and important 
(or even interesting without being important) then there 
was no stopping until it was completely understood. With 
White this would mean a kind of nervous restlessness, 
asking questions, diflïdence in his own powers of compre- 
hension and execution. Southwell, on the other hand, 
was very quiet, mastered the facts, would never say that 
he understood anything until he had completely mastercd 
it ; in this way, to thoe who did not know him, he might 
sometimes seem slow ; when suddenly he would shew that 
he had grasped the whole thing and understood every point. 
But in either case, if either of them undertook to do a thing 
which seemed to them of any importance, it would certainly 
be well done. 

What follows is an account of their lire from September 
9   onwards :-- 
Their first home was a bouse called  Broadlands' an 



Shrewsbury I  I O--I  I }" }" 
untidlz , comtbrtable p!ace high above the river with a view 
of the twin spires and Haughmond in the distance ; and 
there were dalzs when lzou smelt the autumn mist that 
rose from the Severn and la t, wreathed about the town 
and the tbur poplars, so that--as White said--one longed 
for Corot to have painted it. The ramshackle state of 
the house and garden» which was given over as a iungle 
to the car, was a perpetual source of satistkction to the 
Men. And there was the cons«rvatorlr which had no flowers 
and the lift which sank monthl t, to the basement with a 
shattered freight of crockert, , and Southwell would sa),  We 
shall have to have a man up about it'. The hoase was 
never taken seriouslt, i during one argumentative meal 
White--unable to make himself heard--wrote up on the 
wall of tl;e dining-com in chalk,  You owe me £.: OE: g', 
and the inscription rcmained till we left the hous«. 
It was a home of manlz interests, some fleeting, others 
permanent. The life of the scl:ool was always of absorbing 
interest to both, but never incompatible with astounding 
activities at home. « Some Iambic composition is indi- 
cated' Southwell said (both men adored Tte ,'ro,g Box); 
and he sat up into the small hours wrestling with a volun- 
tarlz coplz  which for a week on end remaincd the central 
f-act of his leisure hours. Or the household would be 
comp«lled to read Racine aloud, though Southwell alone 
would fully understand it. He had been for some months 
at the Sorbonn% end returned with a passion for ail things 
French, so that tbr a time Phèdre and The Beloved Vagabond 
alone would satis(y him. White was for ever full of 
musical schemes and tunes ; he was discovered alone in 
his room, with a full score of the Fifth Symphony on the 
mantelpiece, conducting with the poker an imaginary 
orchestra, which was reproduced by every manner of sound. 



6 Shrewsbury  9  o-  9  Y 
On Saturday evenings he played sonatas on the violin at 
which he was expert Southwell accornpanying hirn on the 
piano ; Bach Beethoven and Corelli would usurp meal- 
rimes ; and on Sunday afternoons the folding-doors between 
a sitting-room and the dining-room were opened and on 
one occasion as rnany as forty koys carne to tea, and lay 
about the floor reading or listening to sonatas and a string 
quartet. The car was an intirnate rnernber of the house- 
hold and from Southwell's unswerving devotion to it was 
known as  The Groove' ; when the first kittens arrived 
White burst into school and announced to Southwell in a 
whisper»  Man» the worst bas occurrcd : there is more than 
one cat in the house'. 
Both rnen were expert oars ; Southwell had rowed twice 
for Oxford and coached the School Eight for their first 
appearance at Henley in 913- It was typical ofthe arnaz- 
ing contrasts in his character that irnrnersed in a fugue of 
Bach he should discover that he was overdue for the river 
and after an hour's absorption in the science of rowing 
return irnmediately with zest to the piano. In both their 
rninds there was a strain of science as well as art. White 
was a clear teacher of Geography and Tactics ; and there 
was one Sunday when, in a sLx-hour discussion on the nature 
of the Universe Southwell illustrated rnetaphysical argu- 
ments by diagrarnrnatic arrangement of the tire-irons. It 
was long after rnidnight when the discussion ended and no 
one was satisfied with the result. And there was a day 
when Southwell» having invited a guest to lunch at one» 
arrived frorn his forrn-roorn at three» having wrestled since 
i z.3o with a geometrical problem of which the prelirninary 
data were erroneous. It was characteristic of him that 
this was a voluntary labour entirely outside the range of his 
work, undertaken for his own amusement. 



Shrewsbury, 19 x o-x 9 x.r 
Both men held stronglï the affection and respect of 
the school. White had that perfcct control of boys which 
enabled him to bring the atmosphere of a Christmas party 
into form ; he would teach sitting among the boys or 
standhg on the window-sill and swinging from a cord ; his 
persistent good retaper ruade him see the humour of all that 
occurred ; he could race a boy into school without loss of 
dignity ; yet no member of the staff was more laboriously 
conscientious over the preparation of his work ; and he 
undervalued neither critical power nor imagination» neither 
science nor Poetry. Southwell was unique as a teacher ; 
his own accounts of his work were so self-depreciatory, and 
often so comic that we never really knew what went on ; 
but no boy who had been in his fbrm ever forgot it. He 
probably spoke more freely and naturally to his form 
even than to his friends. He read Poetry to them which 
few can do with success ; and there was no doubt of his 
success here. It was this that indirectly inspired the poems 
which were written for him every week» some of which 
were eventually published under the title of « V. B' when 
he was in France. Few of those who bave read the book 
will deny that it is a remarkable result ; for the poems 
were writteri by average boys of sixteen» anti his detailed 
criticism was small ; they were the indirect outcome of his 
enthusiasm. Of his own delight in his boys' work his own 
words from the preface of the book are witness :N 
« There are going to be lines in your book x which bave 
meant more to me than their writers ever knewmthough 
Heaven knows I used to express my gratitude heatedly 
enough. I forger how much I told you about the beginning 
of the thing. It all started two years ago with those three 
terrific poets» who set a fashion bound to be followed and 
 The book was edited for him by a ffiend. 



8 Shrewsbury x 9 x o- 9  )" 
without w?om my little snowball could never bave come 
together. Sometimes I longed to print every line in my 
album; but that was absurd» and surely the poets whom 
want of space excludes from print will not think themselves 
or their works excluded from my memory.' 
Sunday mornings were great days» for then the poems 
arrîved» and he would read them aloud to us» rejoicing in 
the poetry and revelling in the comic or grotesque ;  side- 
steppingliterature' he would say ofgrislypassages that ruade 
you shrink. He was a great phrasemaker and a toaster of 
improbable quotations ; a passage from Three 2rien in a 
Boat might illustrate a point in Virgil or Xenophon: he 
had the humorous appreciation of a scho!ar fbr irrelevant 
detail ;  Aeneas is fourth cousin three rimes removed to 
Agamemnon; I think it is important' was a note sent 
round to us one morning from his form-room. Ail his 
scholarship took a picturesque form ; problems of grammar 
he illustrated by diagrams on the blackboard, and it has 
been hard for some of us to avoid plagiarism. But of the 
spirit of the form his own pupils alone can adequately 
speak; the R)urth Eclogue is still remembered by the 
gestures with which lae declaimcd it ; for he would read it 
to his form whenever Christmas drew near with the 
enthusiasm of a religious rite ; and when one of his boys 
was asked about the form» he said :  Mr. Southwell walks 
round the room reading Homer to us with tears in his eyes." 
And tlaat he was himself a scholar» is seen from this trans- 
lation of Canon Beeching's poem»  Prayers ' :--

Both men had keen athletic interests. Southwell had 
charge of the schoo] rowing for ur year% and it ruade great 
progress under his coaching. He was also an energetic 
fives-player though the following corr¢spondence from their 
form-rooms seems to tell another tale : 
« What you want» you know is fo phy after IOE. Then 
I should (Deducta est...) play too- (nê clr di) (in te). 
« Do play aIter .

 No Courts, and less of it altogether, please.

White was very versatile; besides his work and his 
music, he found rime for football, cricket, rives, and rowing ; 
few things gave him such pleasure as the occasion when a 
house-four which he had coached won the challenge oars ' in 
the Lent term of 94 ; their rate had exercised him for days 
and nights beforehand and threw him wLolly into the 
atmosphere of the Cambridge faces. Tlere was no game 
or sport that he touched in which he did hot shine, if" not 
brilliantly, at least successfully. He was an efficient otcer 
in the O.T.C. He was a keen fisherman and skater, and 
from the days when, as an undergraduate, he performed

incredible feats of roof-climbing over his colleg% a daring 
cragsman. 
The}' used their holida}'s characteristically. Southwell 
was generally at home content with books and music.

first was written at a rime when he was leaving his home

Mr. Ivor Atkins has written what follows about him :-- 
 It was in the summer of 19Iz that I first met Evelyn 
Southwell, and well I remember the impression he made 
upon me. He had already about him a certain quiet strength 
and a seriousness and a sincerity which to a great extent 
ruade it easier to bridge over the years which lay between 
us. However this may be, there quickly sprang up a 
complete sympathy in musical matters, and his visits to

had a deep and abidingenthusiasm for music. In these all-too- 
few visits there was always much to talk of. He must bave 
shewn a missioner's zeal in making good music known to 
the boys of Shrewsbury School, for he brought me glowing 
accounts» from time to tire% of the success which came to 
those who co-operated with him in the work of introducing 
chamber music to them. The steady growth in attendance 
of the boys at these little music-meetings was a joy to him» 
and the fact that the best music easily won a way to their 
hearts was to him a sufficient reward. 
c His enthusiasm for music, and, perhaps» especially his 
measureless admiration for Bach» made him very attractive 
to me» and this attractiveness was only heightened by his 
quietness and modesty. He was at the rime studying the 
piano» in which I was able to give him some help» and it was 
a great delight to me to watch him working at the forty-eight 
preludes and fugues. Though his playing was wanting on 
the technical side he more than ruade up for it by his insight 
and sense of interpretation  and in discussing them with 
me I was very early struck by his knowledg% and b t, the 
clearness of his musical faculties. 
« It was his habit to find his way to the organ-loft at 
Worcester soon after his arrival in vacation tim% and I 
round increasing pleasure in these visits. His coming was 
always the occasion for some of the greatest of Bach's organ 
works to be drawn upon» and though» as I bave said» he 
had a considerable knowledge of Bach» he had had few 
opportunities up to this time, I should imagine» of hearing 
the larger organ works. This was especially true of the 
Choral Preludes. His joy in a great work was splendid, 
and I shall never forget his reception of the Fuga opra 
)Vlagificat. He shared with another, whose ries to the 
Cathedral were similar to his own» and who to% has ruade

the great sacrifice, a power of appreciation which was 
nothing less than an inspiration to others. It was a 
privilege to have known Evelyn Southwell, and though he 
came into out musical lire in Worcester for but a short 
rime, in that rime he brought into it sympathy and a high- 
souled appreciation, which were of" more value than he 
probably knew and he leaves a memory which I, for one, 
shall long cherish.' 

Such is a picture of Southwell's holidays. White went 
farther afield ; to the Nant Ffrancon pass in North Wales, 
which was a second home to him ; to Scotland for fishing ; 
even to the Alps, tbr skating and skiing : and there were 
stories of how he travelled in a domino mask or played 
Dvok on his violin to a ring of open-mouthed peasants 
in a station restaurant on the Swiss frontier. And beyond 
ail this, there was the military training demanded of him 
as an officer. Some of lais letters follow :--

This was Southwcll's attitude to thc New House. White 
regretted the absence of machiner), in the hall ; the sort 
with a icatheln, undulating ber that whirrs ceaselcssly and 
goes ' p-lonk ' as he said. Both men always regarded 
engineering as a sorrowful mystery. The new bouse

surroundings. 
Men with such a fceling for words and phrases wcre clearl), 
enamoured of books. Neither was in a truc sense ' widely 
rcad' perhaps ; but both had the rater gift of remembering 
intimately and in detail the books of which they were fond ; 
and when once an author, were he Shakespeare or Jerome K. 
Jerome, was admitted a classic of the house, quotations 
from him wcrc permanent. Southwcll's shelves in parti-

But there wcre favourites in common to both ; Richard II»

Papers (on which Southwell was almost infalliblc), thc Song 
of Taliesin from thc dlabinogion The Ratée B.eI» Sait- 
l#ater Ballads» and a,/Shropshiri Lad; Lamb's Essa),s werc 
cspecia]ly dear to White, and Southwell read The Pirate 
cvery Christmas. Pcrhaps the most quoted and bcst-lovcd 
book of ail was The Path to Rome" Charles Amieson 
Blake was an accepted membcr of the household» as xvas 
Michacl Finsbury. Of the Classics, Virgil was the spccial 
favourite. On the wholc, ;hite had thc botter lnemory 
for subject-matter, Southwell for dctail  but this is hot to 
limit an exclusive province for eithcr. For both quotcd 
frcely" « Not what I need (said the 13abc) but vhat I want ; ' 
« Why, thcn, I xviil bave somc of that excellent bccr ;' 
 Positively thc last appcarancc of thc Grcat Vance" (the 
latter Southwell would quote to his form on the final exit, 
it may be, of Polyphemus). Thesc are phrases that recur to

They both spoke strongly in approval or disapproval of 
books that they liked or disliked, with feats of exaggeration 
that were humorous, but ncvc,- intolerant. For ail that, 
Southwcll, who had an infinite patience with tiresome 
conversationalists and was generous to a fault, could bc

readily than books ; },et even in his litcrary antipathies he 
never Iost balance: whatever is meant by the  Artistic 
Tempcrament', creative or critîcal» ît shone clcar in him ; 
so clear, indeed, that hs obvious sanity over ali things vrai 
anti human was thc more remarkab!e. Though his pre- 
fcrence was tbr imaginative writing, he shcwcd remarkable 
grip of ail argument, for all his pretencc that he could hot 
follow thc plot of KidnaI)ped. His standard in grasping 
the mcaning of an autl:or was so l;igh that, wherc othcrs 
might claim to bave arrived he scemcd to himsclf hardi}' 
to bave set foot ut'on the way. Once fascinatcd by an 
autb.or, ho was only content when ho had searched for his 
inncrmost mcanhg and thrown light on cvcry obscu,ity. 
He would cvolve long gencalogies to clcar up a point, but 
he was nevcr a pedant. Though he was, by his own con- 
fession, an amateur in music, his dctailcd analysis of parts 
of Bach's St. Wlattkew Passion is tronged wJth idcas ; and 
thcre was one Saturday in terre rime whcn wc had a break- 
down after rnotoring to a Foint tweive mlles from Shrews- 
bury and six from any station ; after six hours' unavailing 
effort, we acccpted the inevitable at midnight ; and at 1.3o 
Southwcll was still reading himself to seep, on the floor or 
an inn-parlour, with an article on harmony in an encyco- 
pacdia chosen at random from the shelves. He was seldom 
heard to talk of politics, andstrangely cnoughwith 
few exceptions, such as thc ' Mona Lisa ', pictures had littlc 
interest for him ; charact_ristically ho devoted his rime 
almost exclusively to other çorms of art which appealcd to 
him more. White said of him that, had ho not bcen a 
schoolmaster, he would bave been known as a critic ; and it 
is probably true. Yet imagination was the reigning quality 
:ven of his criticism  that is clearly seen flore these notes 
of his, taken from his copy of the .4eneid :

is with music that he is more csp¢cially associated. He 
felt the debt which he owed to Southwell for literal- t, in- 
terest» and Southwcll was as grateful to him for what he 
had learnt of music. It was the claims oçthe Cambridge 
Musical Club which» as he said with amused regret» left 
him at the end or" a Cambridge terre with nothing but an 
undigcsted spccch of Ciccro to his credit. Yet he was far 
froln blind to the beauty of the Classics» and had been one 
of many who were alive to the inspiration of \ralter 
Headlam. At King's he was a voluntar member of the 
choir tbr sevcral gcars. Till Shrewsbur t, won the tirst 
place in his heart» Cambridge was to him the home of 
that ruade lit best worth living. He left it with a know- 
ledge of men» and a mind awake to innumerable interests. 
Not least of its gifts to him was the power to take part in 
a string quartct» often at first sight, with confidence and 
skill. Iîle had a grcat memory for tuns» and could 
remember without hesitation a passage whici he had 
once heard» and that some years before. Man t, will re- 
member his solo from the .Ieiteriger» sung at a school 
concert» followed soon afterwards by a difficult sonata of 
leethoven for the violin. He was devoted to Purcell and 
the English ¢omposers of Madrigas ; and perhaps his 
gleatest musical achievement was that, largel through 
his connexion with the \Vorkers' Idueational Association, 
he organiscd fort t, Feople from the town» wl:om he con-

At the New House the time s]ipped happily by-" there 
was the work of school hours every day of living intcrest 
to both» nnd in the evening we would « sit round" (to use 
Southwell's phrase) and (with Southwell himself often 
as]cep in a chair) discuss books theories or th¢ day's events 
or there would be boys to tea and one would look into 
Southwell's room and find a silent ring engrossed in books 
belote a winter tire ; thcre was the £amous night on which 
a dog barked persistently in  gardcn a/ong the road and

aloe belote brcakfast, recalling the days of Putney. And 
on summcr aft«rnoons there was crick«t fo watch, or we 
sat in the garden by the half-grown priver hedge ; « and if 
it doesn't grow quickly ', $outhwell would say,  we shall be 
overlooked by a long-nccked man in a straw bat.' 
Expcditions wcre ficquent; sometimes "up river' ; some- 
rimes (in winter) to thc town, from which $outhwell would 
return with twcnty collar-studs and an early edition of 
Ossian ; sometimes to% f-artl:er afield often in company 
with boys to the Breidden hills or Ludlow or Church 
Stretto% to climb Caradoc. Southwell oft«n went by him- 
self on the spur of the moment, and visited the Long Mynd 
or lost himsclf on the uplands of Cltm Foresto Or White 
would be taken in Gcorge Fletcher's side-car and togcthcr 
they would scramblc on the rocks of the 8tiper-stoncs. To 
both Southwell and White the proccssion of the seasons 
was a pagcant; the winter terre was always the most 
welcome» but all times ofyear had their glamour and mystery. 
They appreciatcd the fi reside and the hills alike, the  Friendly 
Town' and the « Open Road " November winds and days 
of heat in summcr whcn it xvas almost too hot to row ; and 
all with an affection tbat was far stronger than mire liking. 

' How well 1 know what I mean to do 
When the long dark autumn-evenings corne,' 

White quoted in a letter; and it was a happiness common 
to them both. 
Behind all their tastes and interests, Skrewsbury was the 
dominant fact ; to the school they were devoted with a 
rare measure of unselfishness. To strangers they were 
reserved, and however freely they might speak to friends, 
this reserve was a permanent feature of their characters. 
Words meant much to them, nor did they laugh freely at a 



3 2 Shrewsbury» r 9  o-r 91  
joke unless thcy wcre amused ; their reticence never ruade 
othcrs feel awkward, ),et their approval was a compliment. 
Unr«al enthusiasm and bad taste ruade them unhappy» 
and they coincd a new word,  spinal ",  for the feeling, 
yet their scnse of humour invariably prevailed» and left 
thcm generous and kindly. They were readilyadaptable to 
new places and surroundings, though the power of self- 
adaptation came to White by eoEort and to Southwell by 
nature ; but thcre was no circle which after a month did 
hot receive both with open arms. White felt himself a 
stranger fbr a rime at Shrewsbury ; he was drawn by so 
many inccntivcs and was the slave of so many visions, that 
thc settled Iabit ofsurrcnder toits atmosphere came slowly 
and he was beset with doubts as to his ultimate work. 
Thesc uncetainties gradually faded, andby the rime that 
he lcfttbe place and its lire la), close to the centre of his 
al{ctions ; he felt happy in his work, and one of his col- 
leagues darcd call him thc ideal schoolmaster'. It was 
high praise, but at lcast shews that Ahite was hOt far from 
finding his life's work. Southwell» with equal humility, 
was yet lbnd of Shrewsbury from the day of his arrival, and 
his happincss was inctious. Throughout, it was the one 
rcal pivot of his intcrtsts. Religion was to both a thing 
of wonder, hot to bc cxpressed in direct speech, defying 
analysis, but vital. Lit? remained to them a mysterious 
web, shot with tears and folly and that laughter which 
marks a « gross cousinship with the most high, and feeds a 
swing of merrimcnt in the soul of a sane man'. Their 

 This word, which occurs fi'equently in their letters, was a 
word used 11 the household to express the uncomfortable feeling 
in the small of the back» produced by embarrassing recitations» 
etc. But its context in each case will best explain its meaning.

humour was of that rich sort which does hot paraphrase 
itself, but confideutly assumes its cquivalent in others ; yet 
it was never cynical, and never tar removed from sympathy. 
It is for thes% among other gifts, that their memory is 
treasured. 

At the beginning of August 191 + the Shrewury Corps 
went to camp as usual» and \Vhite was with the contingent. 
On the outbreak of war camp was broken up, and for a 
timc it secmed possible that he migbt be called up as a 
Territorial Officer. But in the course of a few wccks it 
was decided by the War Office that only such officers of 
the O.T.C. as cotfld b,e spared from the schools werc to 
go ; and White was nceded at Shrewsbury. In view of ff.e 
courage with which ho faced ail risks later on» it is perhaps 
not unf:air to quote flore onc of his letters words which 
show lais first, instinctive attitude to foreign service; 
indeed they emphasise the high quality ofthe courage which 
could overcome his doubts, and enable him to say later, 
' The only thing I ara reaily afraid of, is that I shall be 
afraid '.

In Scptembcr, with another Shrewsbury officcr, he helped 
with the training ofa battalion oftbe K.S.L.I. at Blackdown, 
having charge of a Company of z$o recruits, and stayed there 
till thc beginning of October, when terre began at Shrews- 
bury. 
XVe were all of us glad to bc back to definite work after 
thc suspense and inactivity of the long hol[day. That 
Michaelmas term there was much to be done, for whi]e 
work and gaines continued unaltered, exccpt in quantity, 
thcrc was a whole new province of mi]itary work ; new 
lecturcs to be giron, field-days to be planned, and squads 
of senior boys to be trained for service. Sevcral masters 
left the school at the start, to join battalions. White 
was left in command of a Company, and Southwell, who 
had hitherto had no connexion with the Corps, joined as 
a pfivate. In man), ways the life of the household was un- 
changed, but what had before been leisure hours were largely 
given over to military work, and the days were seldom long 
enough for all that had to be donc. Southwe]l round 
ceaseless amusement in the thought of himself in this new 
part, and was for ever drawing ludicrous pictures of the 
character of the «practical man', and pretending that 
military science was beyond his grasp. Towards the end 
of the term he strained himself on a field-day, and an 
operation was necessarï. He put up with this cheerfully, 
and shewed amazing equanimity, and afterwards looked 
back almost with pleasurc on the time spent in the nursing- 
D "-

home. \Vl;en he was convalescent many fictitious or 
ncglcctcd bottles of medicine were sent down to him from 
the New Housc ; for it had always been his habit to forger 
his tonics for a week avd make up for his omission by 
a comprehensive dose at the end. His cheerfulncss was so 
inffctious that his visitors became hilarious and almost 
endangered tb.e spced ofhis r¢covery. The Christmas holi- 
days were spent by him in convalescence, while White at 
F.ome helped with the training of Bantam battalions, with 
intcrvals of relaxation, as on the occasion whendressed 
in fill uniformhe met a visitor on Birkenhead platform 
with a demand to pull a Christmas cracker on the spot. 
During the Lent termtheir last at Shrewsburycame 
thc news of George Fletcher's death in the trenches. In lais 
own words from an inscription he was still « Novac Domus 
socius '. And though for some terres he had been at Eton 
and then at the Front» it was impossible not to think of him 
as a member of the household. This is part of aletter 
written by him ri-oto the Front shortly belote his death : 
' 1 bave now had dinnerIrish Stew, Beer Sardines on 
Toast» Marmalade. Also the sun is streaming in with 
some rcal warmth and I ara feeling hearty. I will there- 
fore makc some general remarks on the subject of rar. 
' There may be some excitement in it, but that takes the 
form of a fearful strain on the nerves without any of the 
exhilaration one usually associates with danger. Perhaps 
a day attack can be exhilarating: in fact the only rime 
! bave been pleasurably excited was when the enemy 
attacked us b), day and we knocked them down. Our 
attack is yet to corne. The fact remains that war is a bore 
and we are ail fed up with it. 
« Death ; one becomes a fatalist on this subject and looks 
firward resignedly to the prospect of extinction: « That 



Shrewsbury, I 9 I O--I 9 1 j" 3 7 
moving Fingcr writcs, and having writ» Movcs on . . ." 
And again another poct saith, 
And there are several other writers whose remarks are to 
the point on the subject» not the least being those of thc 
Labour Party of Galilee. 
« Fear and Courage ; I think it was a man called Socratcs 
who said that Courage was a right knowlcdge of such 
things as are to be feared : and to a considerable extent, 
ho was right. When you know how little damage a 
high explosive shell does to you compared with the noise 
it makes, you don't fear him so much. But Socrates is 
only partly right. I know what a foel a shell is and 
what a fool a bullet is and yet I ara terrified of both. 
But a more insinuating and demoralising fear which 
seizcs man is an entirely illogical unreasong fear of the 
eucmy as such; imagining m to possess surhuman 
qualities when he knows he is very human. Hence the 
great thing is» and will be, to make men realise that the 
enemy is much more afraid of you tn you are of him. 
Hate is non-existentat a events on our side, I 
think on the enemy's too. He too is capable of ing 
jovial in his enmity towards us» and will signal misses 
or bull's-eyes when we plug his loop-holes. 
 Atrocities; I haven't seen any. AH first-hand evi- 
denceeven that gained on the Retreatgoes to prove 
that the German soldier as a whole is capable of gentle- 
manly and chivalrous behaviour and of s he has given 
numerous examples. 
«The Future  in front of us there is a ridge on which 
we can see three rows of trenches» barbed» barricaded» and 
cunngly dug. These we shall have to deal with aRer his

first line. They probably have several hundreds of tl:ese 
behind those we see. In October the Germans» with 
unheard-of courage» determination, and force, tried to 
break through a single line of ours and tailed.--rell, 
what abaht it ?" 
At the end of the lcttr was a passage exhorting both 
the Men to join 8attalions. Southwell himself said later 
that it was George Fletcher's death as much as anything 
which prevailed upon him to go i and White shews 
his feeling in this letter :-- 

To C. R. L. FLETCHEIt. Tbe Ne'w House. 
,3Iar. E6, 1915. 
The news which ),ou sent us on Wedncsdaï was to tne 
the most terrib!e blow the War bas sent me. G¢orge was 
absolutely, the most splendid character I know; such a 
perfect honesty and directness in conversation, such a fresh 
and genuine temperament, ruade him the companion one 
would bave chosen for an), circumstances. I am tclling 
ïou things },ou already know, but I can't help trying to put 
him into words, in ever] sense of his loss and out great 
sorrow. It was a great dal/in out life Eere when he joined 
us at the New Housc. That was my happiest terre here. 
His personalit]¢ lies stamped on ail the little institutions of 
out life, and his naine is mentioned almost every rime we 
sit down together. He was and is out d'Artagnan. As 
I sa)" that, it strikes me what a long way that comparison 
will go .... 
I ara leaving to take a regular commission this terre. If 
1 go out to Flanders, I hope I ma), catch some of his spirit 
and shew one hundredth part of his courage. 
Match was spent in doubts and questionings ; South- 



Shrewsbury,  9  c- 9  r 3 9 
well first decided» then White. Tlere wcre many character- 
istic details towards tbe end. On his return from a 
visit to the War Office, White--a loyer of  A. A. M.'-- 
telegraphed from Birmingham station: People Iere lire 
extreme simplicity chietly upot products of farms.' One 
night, too, foIIowing upon a long field-day spent in 
colallaand of" his Company, he proposcd and carlicd in thc 
School Debating Society a motion that ' The Classics aie 
the invention of Dr. Kennedy', with its corollary that 
ail archaeological remains were thc work of a tourist 
agency. By a brilliant speech he matie his argument 
plausible to almost the entire house. 
At the end there was a reminiscence of the earlicst da)s 
at Broadlands on an evening (described by one of the per- 
formers 11 the following letter afterwards)when quartcts 
were played in the Abbey Church : 
'White is simply splendidhe fairly revelled in the 
Tschaikowsky Trio. The last timc he played with us, the 
string QEartets, Dvok in C fiat and Schumann in A, 
were done in the Abbey hereand no concert room could 
compete with that building. We filaished ttp at my bouse 
with the Dohnnyi P. F. QEintet and the big posthumous 
D mi. String QEartet of Schubert'sthe room was hot, 
we played in shirt-sleeves» and the small audience sat 
chiefly on the floor. We have r.othing now but the 
recollection» but that is great.' 

And so tl;ey left Shrewsbury, leaving a gap that was felt 
by masters and boys alike. After White's death, one of 
his friends at Shrewsbury wrote of him : 
'Malcolm was quite by himself, the most lovabIe and 
sympathctic and splendid ofmen, and he seemed to combine 
so many of the good points one bas known in oter friends, 



4o Shrewsbury 1 9 IO--I 9 I J" 
in a wonderful way» which one feels would make it impos- 
sible for anyone else to be to his friends what he bas been. 
When I think that he ma}, be dead» it depresses me 
dreadfully» for he was the one person to whom ont always 
felt one could talk about important things that matter and 
find a sympathetic hearer» just in the saine way as he was 
the best possible of pcople with whom to cnjoy all the 
trivial moments of lire." 
And another said :-- 
' I think you know what he was to us--his music and 
his turns, and behind all that his wonderful unselfishness 
and idealism which seemed to grow every day» and always 
seemed to me to acco,mt for his humility and nervousness 
about whether he would do what was best.' 
This is part ot  a letter written to White from Shrewsbury 
during the Summer terre of 95 :-- 
' 1 miss ]Cou and the other Man very much this terre. 
One misses all that sitting round in Phiz's room with 
the other Man sitting deep in a chair» and altcrnating 
between sleep and fits of exploding and unrestraincd laugh- 
ter over his form or « the use of the globes '" or something 
like that» and terrific arguments going on. I wish you 
were both here. "Fhe other Man seems to be ver}, happy 
with the  3th R.B. I had a letter from him this morning 
enclosing one about the Bedford race. He has got an 
amazing faculty o1: being tremendously engrossed in ont 
thing at a rime»ma most enviable quality I think ; and he 
writes as if he'd never done anything or likcd anything 
better than bivouacking on Salisbury Plain. It is very 
wonderful.' 
And» aer Southwell's death» one of his brmer pupils 
said in a letter :-- 
'Unfortunatelï I was never in his form but he took me 



Shrewsbury, x 9  o- 9  " 4 x

hours were the most delightful hours I havc evcr spcnt in

count the number of hours until the next one. 1 fear I ara 
hot a loyer of books, and it was simply thc pcrsonality of 
your son which ruade those hours so dclightful. I don't 
think I have evcr got to like a master in so short a rime as

l'r was an unkind stroke of luck that prev«nted thc two 
Men ti'om joining the saine 13attalion. They ruade ef}brts 
to do so, but there was not room. White had a trying 
pcriod of waiting before he could find work ; but it was not 
long before Southwell was gazetted. On April z+ hc joined 
the i3th Battalion of the Rifle Brigade at Pcrham Down. 
Thtre was one memorable week of Brigade training, 
rccorded in his diary. Then» for more tl-an two months, 
in thc course of which \Vhite and he were at Shrewsbury 
togethcr for one week-end (July IO-Z), he was at work at 
Windmill Hill Camp near Ludgershall. He was happyin 
his work. One of his former pupils later an officcr in the 
Riflc Brigade, says in a Ietter : « I suppose we can't drag 
Mr. Southwell away from his military duties» which he 
scems to love. I can just sec him strctching out his arm 
quitc straight and stitT» palm of tl-e hand turncd upwards 
fingcrs pointing up, so as to llatke a cup of his hand saying 
« It's that» it's that. Very fine man"; or when some un- 
happy private drops his rifle, « Oh not a good man. You 
stand there with a taace like a plate of whoggy porridgc, likc 
some great owl." '... A pleasant reminiscence of V. e.

almost fcels, to meet the watcr. For, as you no doubt know, 
the Plain is likc South Africa in summer rather and thc 
streams arc almost dricd up. Still we do keep a strip of 
grcen in a vallcy one toile off with one inch exactly of brook 
in the middle of it, which is enough to throw up thc colour 
of the foot of the valley for a long way against the brown 
grass all round. This morning we went and dug trenchcs 
in it, which was rathcr a dcsecration and frightfully foolish,

with their distinctive (rather a good word, tbat ; it laoics 
as if I could te]l any cavalry from infantry by tbeir dust,.

swinging round the dorner, a toile or two away from our

and the remarkable poems about' The Procession' they 2 
wrote, and all that. 
Well, you all seem to be going very strong there. 1 
suppose you do ail exist really ; but sometimes I have to 
thmk horribly hard, to believe it. As I told somebody the 
other day, I believed it hard all one afternoon when I went 
over to Marlborough ; but of course the letters which reach 
me with the Shrewsbury post-mark, though I must say 
people are awfully good to me and I greet their letters with 
t«rrific delight, do sometimes seem to corne from another 
world altogether ! 
Now then, we can't have this sort of thing. If I'm going

To-day has been rather fuu in alazyway. I took on the 
Orderly Oce job for some one who wanted a Sunday off, 
so I was stuck in camp, first boiling in the biggest heat 
we've had, and then getting thoroughly wet ail of a sudden 
while dismissing the Old Guard. It is rather good fun 
after a har week» a week-end in camp» and l've put in all 
of them up to date except one, when I tan oer to near 
Salisbury once. Good place, that ; and I must try and ste 
the town itself quictly one day. 
I ara becoming rather like a cabbage here. Ont goes 
on very happily, living a healthy animal existence, and the 
importance attached fo one's food on bivouacs after a long 
march is rather scandalous. 
I could make a gd range-card of priceless memories on 
this landscape tween lines N.W. and N.E. S.W. lies the 
sweting match to Bulford Range, and S. is Perham Downs 
Camp, which is all buts and therefore a beastly insult to 
the country-side. But I cannot think of whzt I regard as 
' My Section' of our prospect without a thriI1. 
It is now Sunday aernoon, July 3rd ; not very good 
therefore» for you should have had this before. Tell Kitch

poetry is in my experience too. Equally of course I refer 
facts to poetry rather than the other way. This is obscure 
and I will explain. Now R. L. S. in a lovely» lovely passage 
(' Apology for ldlers ' in Virginibus p»erisque--you gave it me, 
you remember) says : « Books are all very well in their way» 
but they are a mighty bloodless substitute for Iife." Now 
if I believe that» it is because I have seen it .in a book ; 
and that I think is rather my attitude to pretty well 
everything. So that so far from agreeing with R. L. S. I 
seem more than ever in a position to contradict him. Man 7 
that is rather where we do corne in 7 you know" I believe 
that everybody 7 who has his little finger in this pie 7 really

Out of the eight or so they had to pick one to wind up 
camp, return tents» receive l:ospital-discharged men, finish 
up accounts» and generall}' run a fatigue part}, to clean up 
the place and pass an  exam.' by the Sanitary Inspcctor-- 
we did this with some success--and I was picked for the 
job. So long as it hasn't thrown me back more than a 
fortnight or so I shan't mind so much--though as you can 
guess it wasn't exactly tunny to sce thc rail of the Division 
disappear on thc da}, of embarkation, round the corner to 
the station--because l've Icarnt more about the adminis- 
tration of the Army in two weeks than in ail thc preceding 
months. This is some consolation» and as a marrer of 
fact I can't pretend in the least that I didn't rather enjo¥ 
the fortnight in which I was in sole command of about 
twenty-five mena small handful» but an independent show. 
The worst days I ever knew were belote that, when (after 
being told within a month ofjoining and again later» that 
I was going out) I just heard that it was ail what the Army 
calls a  wash-out ", and so I'd got to stay behind. 
There is still a great deal to do (I've just started learning 
German--rather late, but l'm getting on), so I must wind 
up this lengthy explanation ofmy very curious movements. 
I suppose it is needless to repeat to you what I said in a 
letter to Shrewsbury hot so long ago that I have for all 
these months seen everytbi»g in terres of Shrewsbury. I 
bave seen a bill» perhaps ; and I reflect that it would not do 
for the folk around the Wrekin» even though it did bave a 
Roman Camp at the top. Or a path from the bcd of the 
Avon» up towards Sidbury, and I remember that the track

Or I bave been with «B' Company on Church Parade every 
Sunday for months» and the wrench was an almost physical 
one with which I had to tear myself away fiom the belief 
that I was in Chapel» and had been there every minute of 
the service. 
Or lastly, there was that last Sunday night of the terre. 
¥ou wcre going, and my Battalion were going» in the same 
week. I started for a rather lonely wa]k, thercfore, and the 
farthcr I wcnt thc more the 37 th Division shouted. They 
shouted for three hours pretty well each night for the last 
week. 
This time they just sang the simple refrain which 
goes 
Here we are ! here we are ! here we are again 
Hullo ! Hullo ] 
Hulo ! Hullo ! Hulloh-oh ] (Repeat.) 
This song went forjust z½ hours without change : it wcnt 
on louder and louder, like a plot to break the hearts of the 
 stay-behinds'. It was about the rime when you would be 
giving your final address»  probably all extra good one (I 
was not disappointed: but how you could read the poem 
through without a break I cannot imagine" I would not 
trust myself with a rcitation of that beautiful thing in 
public for a fortune per lineS. 
So I went oI, not sorry on tl;e whole to be alon% and 
blundered along towards the Artillery Camp, until finally)ou 
came out of Chape], and I came back over the hill.

letter such as this, from the meanest of your son's brother-

have it gilt-edged. I suppose when the War is over it will 
be known better what extraordinary things that peninsula 
bas seen done by those very brave men. Meanwhile, even 
without knowing your son, I was more moved than I could

high standard to follow.

I heard from my father this morning the news which, I 
suppose, is sure to bring you many letters from people far 
more worthy to send them than l. And ),et somehow I 
feel that being the most insignificant of his brother-officers 
does give me the right to ask if" I may just add a short 
message of sincerest sympathy. I don't know whether itis 
very sentimental and toolish or not; perhaps itis, but I 
never can rid myself» when I hear such news as that of 
Hugh's death in action» of the strange desire, not only to 
sympathise with those he leaves behind, but to get up and 
cheer! Was it really ill-timed, I was asking only last 
week-end, in my organist colleague at Shrewsbury to play 
no less a thing, when Lord Roberts died, than the c Halle- 
lujah Chorus ' ? Cerainly I feel myself that the thing was 
rightly looked at then, and I bave never doubted it since. 
Itis a terrible thing, and also a very glorious one, for later 
comers to see the 'monumentum aere perennius' of their 
friends' examples grow higher and more inimitable day 
after day: one feels one would like to button-hole them, 
where they watch their successors, and plead ' Don't forget 
the standard is a little higher, since you went away '.

Well, this camp is magnificent for everybody. The mcn

so many Battalions last winter)» near the _ea air and the

walked there yesterday evening and fell much in love with it. 

DIARY 

THE FIRST PARADE. 
2qpril z+, Saturday. 
Ceremonial, as usual on Saturday morning. A fairly 
easy job for the platoon commander» as he has practically 
nothing to do. Indeed I wonder whether I gave a com- 
mand per hour beyond an occasional 'Make Way' when 
we turned about, dclivered probably in tb, e half-grutk half- 
deprecating voice of the new subaltern. We did not carry 
swords ; in fact, hardly any of us possess such things so 
that even that was an ordeal saved, for we have no idea 
yet of the salure with the sword. It resolved itself for me 
into a kind of painless nightmare of shouting. 
I pass on now to the ceremonial of the following Satur- 
day ; for though it has no terrors, the keenest barrack-square 
enthusiast would hardly think it a very thrilling subject on 
which to stay for long. The main points of interest were 
few and obvious. First, I suppose, cornes the realisation 
which one gets, and which one would hardly believe till

is a tremendous test of tircd mon. At this date the men 
were undoubtedly getting a bit stale, and I hope before we 
go out they will get a good test: boasting little or no 
knovledge of soldiering» 1 claire a little competence in the 
art of recognising a tired man. 
It is, however, ai1 very well to run dovn the men who 
run these things» but there's a something about them ..., 
as William Bent Pitman would say. I agree with A. C. P. M. 
that the bugles immediately behind one (whcre I seldom 
get them) are apt to be ratler tiresome, but they do l:elp

about, though I ara glad to think some of my men got 
a little sleep, as I recommended. As for me, I ruade 
myself scandalously fresh for the night's march by going 
straight to bed and sleeping for two hours. Following 
that came a strolI with Fraser, and this was one of the 
great scenes. 
Hungerforcl Church is right on the edge of the Kennet 
and Avon Canal ; and its perpendicular towcr rising over 
the green with the water beyond, and west of that the set- 
ting sun, and an old lock or two farther on E., and finally 
the bridge, ruade pictures which I could hardly leave. 
This was one scene and yet it was tobe eqmlled again 
and again &fore the \VonderfuI \çeek was over. 
 . . The Night 3larch. The R.B. was to go on ahead and 
' B' Coy. to piquet the village of Froxfield. This we made 
rather a mess of and I leave it. \Ve then proceeded to 
match rather wearily for some miles mainly uph]ll towards 
Savernake Forest. We did hot go through much of it, 
and there followed an attack through the Forest, which 
I would hot put down at all (obeying my own rule)if 
the miserable futility of that one hour was hot rather 
amusing when seen through the glorious haze of the 
following forty-eight hours. 
\Ve formed close column of platoons, I remember and 
blundered along through the wood at about 3-% v«h«n it was 
dark ; and finally, after hearing various shots put round us 
with great equanirnity» we were l-alted and lay doevn ill 
frost-covered opening while the dawn came. After a long 
time we moved off, and it was nct, I think, until this point 
that I began to feeI intolerably well and hearty. 
came quickly through the rest of the wood, and only then

I realised, looking under tl:e trees across the harebclls 
that Oberon had been there ail night. 
Vilcot Vicarage. This was where I was billeted. All 
this period round me with nothing but a tremendous sense 
of relief, partly at the end ofthe march and partly at hearing 
I was wcll billeted, no doubt. And so I was feeling very 
well all the time. Then the food for thc men vas very late 
in arriving ; and in fact this foo2 question spoilt the week 
rather for the men 1 fear. I procured a few biscuits for 
some of my men, which was all I could find in the village 
at the rime, and those few of thcm seemcd grateful ; but 
it was rather maddcning to fecl that nothing could be done 
for the men for so long while my own future existence for 
twenty-four hours (as we then thought) was so scandalously 
assured ofcomfort. Finally, after lying about in the meadow 
beyond the farm tbr some rime with some of the men all 
of us being by now rather clmer I cleared off to my 
Vicarage and had a large breakfast. Mr. and Mrs. Hoyland 
were extraordinoErily good to us--Mackworth Bamford» 
and mewthe whole rime. The morning was naturally 
blank but I shall not easily forger the sudden transition 
from the long march to the garden behind the Vicarag% 
where we lay about undcr the hedge and Iooked sleepily 
over the long s low water-meadows and watched the con- 
soling Eng!ish mist wrapping itself round the English trees. 
No soldiering ever troubled the serenity ofthat little land- 
scape, nor the old church tower behind ; for the whole of 
that valley has just accepted very quietly the memory of the 
men who died for it in year after year before we ever saw 
it, and every one, I felt was another perfectly present, and 
therefore entirely hidden and unsuspected guarantee of that 
incredible reace. 
It is so hard to choose one's pictures ; I have written 



62 E.H.L.S. May I9I )" 
ten pages already in this hour which is half a dozen too 
many at least. Anyhow I nust omit our Outpost Scheme 
for Officers in the afternoon, where we went and planted 
imaginary piquets a]ong tbe canal for toiles, and wherc I 
enlarged a map of our little section of the bridge. 
Tea in the Vicarage garden, and then a vast letter to 
Maurice Brown, followed by a mild ecclesiastical talk with 
the Vicar. Ail this was good, and so was the evening .... 
So next day we said good-bye effusively on leaving for our 
rearguard action towards Manningford Bruce. And then 
came another great moment ; when we had been gone an 
hour we heard that we should hot bivouac that night but 
retur» to illets .... I suppose there have been more de- 
lighted men than we three for the following minutes ; but 
I should ]ike to have met them. The rearguard action that 
day was followed by a discourse from the Brigadier, and in 
the calm of the Vicar's study--we returned to his arms in 
the garden almost with a shout ofdelight--[ noted various 
lessons we were told to ponder. Nothing shall induce me 
to rewrite them here. But the  Wood Bridge' over tFe 
Avon, which flies past as usual, waving its reeds like tongues 
of tire, was defended by No. 7 platoon with remarkab2e 
placidity ; and it would be rash to forger the hour or so 
which we spent there. 
It was during this evening that I walked part of the way 
with Leggatt towards his (D) billets at Sharlcott, and so 
back over the fields: and it was there that I went with 
opening eyes down an English lane .... 
The next day was what Belloc would call « A day without 
salta trudge'. The attack done between Pewsey and 
Ludgershall did hot find us in the fight at all, and we did hot 
g¢t instruction on it with maps as I should lave liked (and 
boped for daily, on such occasions); but none of us will 



E. H. L.S. May 191 )- 6 3 

soon forget the trudgc up tLe big Pewsey hill : how the men 
did growl ! The wbo]e day was very hot» and the bugles 
finished us off by bringing us one toile into camp full tilt 
from the Collingbourne Road. 
But itis not of these happenings that I want to writ% 
only my pen is so cursedly obstinate. Itis of those few 
memories that I want remindingmthe Savernake wood 
country at dawn» the stars over the night march» the water 
of the Avon, the church by the canal, the rive minutes in 
the lan% the dear Vicar and out return to his home, the 
bugles as we entered Pewsey from Wilcot on the last 
morning, the morning in the « Ebenezer' school,--\Vilcot 
above all» above all Wilcot: those are the things which 
mark the Wonderful Week» and which in any future 
inconveniences (such as I must be excused for expecting) 
I hope and pray for courage to remember. 

AN EVENING IN EaRLY MAY. 
This evening I strolled into the church at Ludgershall, 
the little church that lies over the way from my first billet» 
beyond the railway bridge. On entering I was immediately 
confronted with a coat of arms on the north wall. I take 
no omens whatever in this little business» which is perhaps 
curious. So it was only with a certain rather numbed calm- 
ness that I read its Motto, 
 _Moriendo livo "» 
and turned round saying to myself»  That no doubt will 
do very well' : and then opposite me on the souh wall from 
another coa came ou the promise, 
 Resurgam ". 
« And hat too ' I said»  will suit me admirably.'

SIDBURY CAMP. 
Thursday evening, 2lay z 7. 
It was a rather easy day, and therefore it was that I took 
it upon myself to walk and run to the top of Sidbury Hill. 
Itis not easy to pass the smallest bridge» I think, in any 
country ; but I resisted the temptation to stay on the little 
bridge over the Bourne, with the whitest may-blossom in all 
England at its side, and two long strips of the deepest green 
along its banks, the envy of the brown thirsty Plain for 
toiles arou nd .... 
Well, I might have known they would have been there. 
Of course they had struggled to the top, 
The Roman line, the Roman order, 
of »vhom John Masefield sang on Malvern Hill. From no- 
where else would they sooner catch sight of my ancestors 
panting in skins and strange dyes across the plain ; and 
here ifanywhere they seem to bave decided to do the thing 
well. For the ditch (it is theirs, I suppose) is very deep and 
regular, and I for one was glad I had hot to attack over it. 
But I was not really thinking war that evening, for my head 
was full of mcmories of the Shropshire hills, and of 
those other Romans who with all their troubles 
Are ashes under Uricon. 
And so with reverence upon my head I clambered down 
into the lowest part of the fosse, and reminding myself 
' This is a marrer which demands a "certain pr¢cision" '» 
I straightened my cap, put on my gloves, and tbund from 
the sun a line as nearly S.E. as I could make it ; and so 
facing Italy, our new ally, and standing strictly at attention» 
I saluted the Roman Soldier.

To-day is a holiday for us and several others in  B' Coy.» 
by intimation of De Laesso% while various odd jobs are

So I take the glorious opportunity to go for a solitary

bounds' again to-day (aftcr a short attack of measles or 
somcthing), obviously for my most particu!ar consolation. 
First to thc rigbt at thc cross-roads, to tbe Hungcrford 
Road : a direct inspiration in itself surcly, for it is the road 
to the Wond.erfid 'Week, and rccalls tbe first Day of the 
Pack. But I stop on the railway bridge, for that line goes 
off; round thc corner to thc right» to Marlborough and 
another memory. A mystcrious enginc is puffing up the 
line round the corner, as they uscd to whcn I watched thcir 
dreadfully enchanting advancc from Warminster to thc 
Bapton lcvel crossing. Ah, thcre over my left shouldcr 
cornes the Ioth R.F» with full band. Ail's wcll ; thcy arc 
going straight down to Collingbourne .... Thcy have 
stopped playing now, precisely at the fourth telegraph post 
from the cross-roads; but their voices corne up the hill; 
they are good men, the i oth .... So I go on up thc 
hill. Here is the top; and I wish I could go on along it 
tbr miles but this is not Sh:opshire» and thc road dips to 
the right as fast as it climbed. To my left front four two- 
horsc plougbs cross and recross the field ; again this is hot 
Shropshire, for they thread the valley instead of marking 
the skyline. The rain has washed the country into green 
and white and gold ; it has rained slightly for three days, 
for the first time since May t tth, and the piles of thick 
dust are quiet at last: I had thought the thing impos- 
sible .... ' Rcmember now,' I round myself now singing  
I do not precisely know why .... 
But I have reached the bottom of the va!lcy now, and 
turned to the left down the road to N. Collingbourne 
Ducis; and I bave bcen hcre beforc. For it was here that 
I came weeks ago, one great evening when I eut my dinner 
to walk ri-oto Co!lingbournc Wood to C. Ducis, when I 
had lain on the eastern edge of the vallcy and looked up 
F  



68 E.H.L.S. June , ,  
towards N.W. and the Shropshire hilIs. That was also 
taï first entrï into C. D. church where I hung for long, 
buried deep with it behind the chestnuts .... 
Voices from the bouses at the edge of the village, fift), 
yards away at thc bend in the road. Just here I smelt wet 
ha)'» and like thc clder blossom be),ond the bill it sent me 
tbr a moment back to Lichfield. So I passed down the 
village from the N. and into the church gain. There 
are no scrvices on week-days here» for I ruade a scandalous 
inquir)' in the registr), in the vestrï. But I sta)'cd there a 
long time .... This was what I bave wanted for weeks, 
« An ,our for peace and for forgetting "» and I round it. 
I do not remember anything quite so definite since the days 
of Lichfield Chapcl," when I was hardl)' less old at x t than 
I ara now. Of course I took the Notre-Dame Seat, half- 
way up on the right and against a pillar; but hardlï in 
Paris» I think» was it that so greatly 
The deep peace burned by me alive. 
It was St. Peter's Da)r» b)' the wa)'» and the lessons were» to 
say the leas% not insignificant. 
Vell» « out of the little chapel I burst "» as the)' sa),, and 
found it raining steadily but almost invisiblï. Sidbur), 
Camp through a Scotch mist was really rather more fun 
that I had bargained for; so I have seen Holïrood Palace, 
almost completely hidden in August at a few hundred )'ards. 
And so home» and this walk has been a great cure for 
anything like depression» which I was faintly beginning to 
feel before I went away on Friday. Now I ara» I believe, 
completelï recovered.

Sports were ruined, and when I had been rather f.dthfully 
reprimanded at Orderl)' Room in the morning. It was 
quite worth while going m)" round, that evening, all alone 
in the downpour and a leaking Burbeiry. Qite worth 
while clambering up that slope, though for somc reason 
I was so occupied with cacophonous encores of 
Who so besct him round 
(we had it at Shrewsbury the previous Sunday)that t-or a 
toile or so I hardly realised where I was. Then suddenly 
l became aware of the top of the bill, and began to make 
phrases, as I watched it in the wind, about the sheepish, 
irrcsolute demeanour of the stripling corn. It was on that 
evening, too, that I got into tlae hollow to the east of C. D. 
and excited myself to a great state of dclight by loud and 
much-varied dec!amations of John Masefield's ' Sea-Fever' 
(' I must down '). 
I suppose it was two days later that I discovered the 
dingle which leads through the corn to C. D. from the hill, a 
shorter and equally delightful way ; marked, and I think 
wrote to Ross about the blue flints on the black plougb, 
like cut glass on a marble tablethey are to be seen on the 
right as you descend that lane  saw the wind playing at 
bill-country with tl:e grass at the top of the roadit is

roundings. A good chance : everything is standing still for 
my admiration. Thc horses of the ioth R.F. arc motion- 
less as usual on the side of the hill ; they hardly flick 
their tails» those lean woodert Sabbatarians. Nobody 
troubles his head now about the dreary bayonet-gibbets on 
thc left skyline near the wood» nor about the rather silly- 
looking wire entanglcments to their right. Except perhaps 
the sentry over what I keep calling the Watcr-Tower :x I 
dare say he holds strong vicws on other men's Sundays  at 
any rate the flash of his bayonet this morning (during thc 
 Benedictus'» I remember)» when he turned his corner» 
looked as if he had decided to tolerate no competition. 
Not much movement in our lines» nor from the oth and 
* 3 th facing me ; and I expect the 6oth are equally sleepy in 
the hollow. An occasional car strolls over the green ; and 
as 1 write some casy crickters saunter out to their gara,'. 
On the near brow of the hill across the road a few sheep 
proclaim the Downs ; to tleir right is the Everley Road» so 
easy of marching; and I can just see the cross-roads» wlere 
the 1'4. Road runs up towards Collingbourne» shaking 
our little worries off its heels .... 
And so the rime passes» until I go my rounds in hall an 
hour. A lazy transport wagon rolls by ; a dazed-looking 
passenger, train puits up the line; the green flags wave 
sleepily in the cooling breeze wl-ich is just arriving from the 
South ; the great s!opes ahead of me call  N. \Vest» N.

We have just corne back from what is almost certainly the 
last Church Parade in England ofthe i i ith Brigade. Thcre 
was a Celebration this morning, in the big C. E. tcnt for 
the first time» at which I date say sixt)' attended. The 
week belote in the little tent there were six. The 
service was hot quite the best, as we had hOt the brass band 
of the  oth but only their fifes ; and these, besidcs sounding 
a little shrill and unstately played Far too slowly. 
However there we stood, singing the saine chants, 
making what we could of « Onward Christian So/diers ' and 
« Fight the good Fight" and ç Praise to the Holiest ". It 
was hot well done, but it did hot really matter. I had only 
to look round and the Plain at an), rate was in Sunday 
mood. All as before ; the old hill, and the Water-Tower 
and the still sentry watching over it ; over the l oth's tents 
hung the memoryof the 1Xlorthern Val% and to the south-east 
the grey summer over Kimpton andCholderton ; and to our 
left the great white clouds came tramping up like all the 
armies of heaven in palpable dust, swooping up with a crï 
of triumph» over our old familiar hill from the little, loved 
western river.

for a lonely walk to the bill on the Hungerford Road. It 
would be about the time of C. A. A.'s final address in Chapcl

olxe. And when I saw it in The Salopian, as I wrote to him 
later, I was hOt disappointed. 
They would be nearly at its beginning when l turncd

songs faded quite away. Therc werc some scorcs of cyes 
that were none too dry in that Chapcl» and 1 rcmembercd 
that they must not be stared at while thcy came down thc

there ; for there is a kind ofsadness that rcaches highcr than

was finished and we rose; and as 1 said in my lcttcr to

never, on evacuating any otLer camp, be likely to forget ; and 
that is that thc whole Battalion must be turned on to fatigue 
dut}" just before going. An hour's hard work with ,ooo 
men--I can hardly imagine the glory ofit without emotion ! 
Why, they would have left the whole place as ckan as 
a board. As it is, I should ne'¢r have got through without 
help. 
Well» but 1 ara going tco fast, for I forgot to mention 
my flying visit to the station on Tl:ursday, which was ail 
1 had rime tbr. The first halt B & C wcnt off from hcre 
at 6.zo; rather typically early, for the train did hOt go 
till 8.zo. I, exp,cting to be back by 7.0, marched with 
Barnford at the head of No. 8 and saw thcm into thc train ; 
but tl:ough I stayed lng ¢nough to shake them ail by thc 
hand, I could hot wait to see them ofF. 
Vhen I did get back I round D & A just ready to march 
off to the station. The Division was still shouting, as it 
had done for a wcck ; and the colossal enthusiasm ail round 
was ïather in strong contrast to the mechanical, dumb con- 
tent into which, after a few hours of really hard labour, 
I soon found myself dropping. For near]y forty-eight lours 
I hardly realiscd that [ was going to be Icft almost alone with 
the Plain, while my Battalion were whir/ed away to Flanders. 
Indeed, till this rr.orning I have hardly remembered that 
there is a war over the water : for I have seen no papcr til 
to-day since Wednesday ; and 1 now find that Warsaw is 
about to rail .... There is food br tl:ought in that .... 
Somc of the small incidents that followed I described 
in a letter to Bamford covering the razors for No. 8 platoon.

real ride was flooding in far out in mid-stream. 
Clough would have had some pretty things to say about 
that ; but I had other business on hand. It was not those 
half-dozen fishing boats that caught my eye» though they 
looked happy enough as they drifted in with the tide too 
sleepy to care whether the wind would help them along. 
iNTor the strange dark promise of the great city proclaimed 
by the clustering chimneys a little further to the north-

CHAPTER III 

ApRI. ro OCTOBEtt 9t5 
WHE¢ Southwell first went to the Plain, \Vhite was still 
at home impatient tbr definite work. For two months he 
made e0rts in many quarters to find the place which he 
wanted and which was due to him in view of his experience 
in the O.T.C. On May 3  he eventually joined the 6th 
Battalion (Special Reserve) ofthe Rifle Brigade at Sheerness, 
with Lieutenant's rank. Though he round it harder than 
Southwell to adapt himself without regrets to the new lire, 
his influence was great» as his fellow-oflïcers well knew. 
His sense of humour won him friends, and he was always 
human. But he did not surrender the many interests that 
had been his belote he entered the R egiment. He could 
stock the shelves of his Mess with volumes of Tolstoy and 
Galsworthy yet no one resented this as academic ; it was 
accepted as natural and won him respect. One of the 
officers said of him later : « I can imagine no one who was 
better form, better company,or better anything, than White.' 
And another of his friends there writes of him :  What 
everybody liked about him so much was that, although he 
was considerably older than many of us, he was always free 
and easy with us.' At one time he was imitating the 
Battalion Sergt.-Major, at another the Paddinon Express 
entering Birmingham Station. He would leap the settees 
in the Mess ; and his adventures on his motor-bicycle, 



M.G.W. April 9 " 8 
which (for the first rime in his lire) he had just bought, 
delighted every one.  He kncw nothing about the bike,' 
the letter goes on, ' and I think rather prided himself on 
the f-act. If ever, when we were out together, something 
happened and « the thing '" wouldn't g% we could only push 
it along the road--l've done several mlles with him !---or 
fling it into the nearest ditch .... He was so wondcrfully 
simple in his tastes. He used to find endless enjoymcnt 
in going over to Hollingbourne of a Sunday, having a good 
lunch with excellent beer» and a walk after with his « pijp '" 1 
in his mouth.--I remember» when I took him to the Sheer- 
ness Theatre» how he was bored to tears. He said what 
he really enjoyed was a good blood and thunder drama. 
So when Tbe Rosary came down I took him again. He 
was highly delighted with parts of it because the tragic 
acting was so ludicrous. Of course his violin-playing was 
ripping. The fellow nex.t door to us had a gramophone» 
and he had Bach's Concerto for two violins. The Man 
would tune his violin carefully and play to the gramophone.' 
Another friend of his says- « Do you know that from the 
day I arrived to the day he went to France he gave up 
almost everything to make things pleasant t'or me ? He 
had been in the Battalion then for a good many months 
and had a lot of friends» and yct he always was ready to go 
for walks or bicycle-rides or anything with me. I know 
that he was fond of me» but above and beyond that lay his 
inherent unselfishness to please others." 
The rest of the story of his lire there follows in his own 
words.

My Company have nearly all been to the Front and 
wounded» and are now convalescent and doing light duty. 
I feel almost ashamed to pretend to command men who 
bave been at the Front» but of course we do very little work 
and my chier job is signing cheques and passes» and paying 
the men, and general administration» at which l'm very bad. 
I feel like that, having hOt long awakened from three 
hours" deep sleep having had the saine number of houm 
last night» owing to having to walk round visiting the 
guards .o to 3.%the farthest limitofwhichwas a coast-guard 
overlooking the sea from clips. It was mysterious coming 
suddenly on a view ofthe se% grey and vague in an uncertain 
dawn. 
This isn't really at all a bad place but the Isle of Sheppey 
is rather smellg and low-lying at times (well, it's always 
low-lying). I hope to get out for a walk in mid Kent 
when I get a little time. The sea front and the destroyers 
are fun. 
I had to go to Church Parade this morning at 9.ze. It 
was good having the free use of one's lungs in the hymns  
the men make a terrific noise. We had the band to play 
us there and back with music comedg and the regimental 
match» a splendid thing» which l've known for a long time.

AIl about myself. I came here ten days ago and ara 
moderately happy. I ara in command of a convalescent 
Company, men back from the 3rd and +tla Bris. There is 
little work connected with it, as the men are on light duty. 
The wo:-k is all that of administration, signing cheques, 
failing to understand documents and signing them etc., 
and condemning men to various punishments at 9.o a.m. 
in my Company office. I ara beginning to understand a 
little about this very slowly. The N.C.O.'s are inaudible 
and allusive in connection with everything I don't under- 
stand. (Do you know, a luggage label is A. F. zosa 
tact.) I ara bullied by my C.S.M. and C.Q<_.M.S. and 
hopelessly in their power. West is my only subaltern. 
l've been orderly ocer and ara at present Captain of the 
weekrather strenuous» especially as the guards we provide, 
find, or famish, are all over the island of Sheppey, and in- 
specting them at night mea;s a cool walk of two hours, 
.o to 3.° a.m. 
1 don't suppose I shall get to the Front for a long time. 
One has to go through a good deal firste.g. I bave to 
do a fortnight's musketry, firing chiefly myself, when the 
Range-Finder course is over. Seems rather absurd. 
Then I expect I shall go over to Q.eenboro' for definite 
Hcld Training, when a Captain is available to command 
my 'F' Coy. The N.C.O.'s here are very fine and give 
me an idea of the greatness ofthe R.B.

how am I to see the Corps drill ? Can't you have a parade 
on Saturday instead of Tuesday or Friday when I come? 
Can't it be worked somehow ? 
]t's possible I may be shunted from here on a special job

DIARY 

)Tu»e "-9, I916" 
This little diary is really the result of a desire to express 
myself to my friends. There are so many impressions 
which I have had and so many emotions which I bave felt, 
that the first instinct was to get them down on paper. If 
any one reads this, they wiil take it as an attempt at talk,

when there were hot people to express oneselfto who would 
bave been like]y to respond. But, though the War bas 
bmught me many impressions and ruade me want to talk 
to some one, it bas ruade me incapable of expression, and 
sometimes, in this diary, what was really emotion may be 
taken tbr sentiment. Well, it is not. Still--you wi]l all 
understand.

Moved to Eastchurch for digging, in command of ' H ' 
Coy. This is a good place, after Shecrness. Fecl as if I was 
in England. The camp is high up, and there are big trees, 
a bit of friendly sloping down, and a church clock close by. 
No compulsion to belong to any organised Mess, and if I 
cooked my own food over a tire near my tent, I don't think 
any one would object. .Also a large and wonderful Tudor 
House with a story about Henry VIII and Arme Boleyn 
connected with it. Here lie the 5th R.B. 1 think I shall

At the trenches, Adam and I had dinner from the cook-

beer out of a bottle is a poor drhal« This is a good village. 
There is an old church» and a very old man, a great noise 
in the evening» and a Post Office selling everything-- 
alarm clocks, indiarubber balls, and ail things to eat--and 
smelling of everything. A pleasing event was the pursuit

his small sisters. I watcbed it with much joy especially 
the apFearance of the mother of the party, serious but 
relieved that ' it was no worse , and shouting cautions in 
no way connected with the frogs. I sympathise with A. C. 
Benson in his abrption in small things of that kind. I

West Townshend» and Middlebrook visited us from 
Sheerness this evening. It was good of them and very

due to the bad news flore Russia. Also wanted to talk to 
some one about everything. Ail very we]l saying there is 
no « class' in England or that it is hOt advisable to try and 
remove class distinction» when I feel that the Tommies 
under me are an entirely diffhrent kind of beings .... I read 
Sabire Lad ald Browning "s Last Duche« that amazing 
thing. I find I have a kind of emotional indigestion these 
days, when I read poetry. Every word has such terrific 
force and is so overloaded with meaning that I can hardly 
get on. 
Rained and we returned to camp early. Read a very 
good « After the War" pamphlet» Chariot of

Church Parade and Bathing Parade with the ride full up 
and sandy beach at Leysdown--very good. On return 
found a lot of letters for me, including one from A. E. K. 
about Shrewsbury people for the R.B. eing booked for the 
th Batt. I got excited and more fussy than l've been 
since I began the military life» and dashed offto Minster 
to see a Captain ofthe th Batt., and then to Sheerness to 
sec Col. Dawson, and dined there and wrote scores ofletters, 
most ofthem excited and illegible. Biked back and got to 
Eastchurch about .o a.m. 

A gorgeous clear day still and hot, suggestive of August» 
and ruade one regret the passing ofthe real summer, which 
is June. At sunset a cloud to the north-west looked like a 
blue hill against the gold light» and in an instant I was 
many toiles away--cool night air the trees shivering in the 
middle of the Common,' and the Stiper-stones. 
Tuesday» yuly z7. 
Have just been to a camp concert. There was a one- 
stringed violin with a trumpet attached a very funny rifle- 
man comedian» and a lady-reciter--a typical reciter with 
a pale iory complexion» dark eyebrows rather tired look, 
and a clear-cut dental enunciation. It was rather good to 
feel spinal again. There is so little room for spinality in 
the Army. Still the lady was rather relentless--five recita- 
tions in two appearances» and we missed having the funny 
rifleman again. One rifleman sang a rather doleful and 
unintelligible song with a rousing chorus to the words And

Term ended at Shrewsbury to-day--always» or nearly 
always» rather a sad event for me» and more so this terre. 
For Shrewsbury alive and always tobe pictured at certain 
hours has been a very solid fact in my lire since I came here. 
Also there is a kind of strength in the knowledge of a 
number offriends congregated like that. So I feei the end 
of term almost as keenly as I have felt it when one woke 
early in the morning of First Day» tired and aching after 
a week oflate nights over papers to hear the clamorous 
procession ofcabs» the slamming of doors and the jettison 
of portmanteaux. 
A wonderfully bright and very hot day. I dined at 
Sheerness Mess and rode a bicycle back in the moonlight,

trying a ramshackle thing with a view to purchas% but l've

After regimental sports» started for Capel Curig by night. 
One of the attractions of night-journeys is that it is a kind

On Monday a great walk over Pen Helig and the 
Carnedds. There are many things which make the 
Carnedds almost the best range in Wales»the steep view 
down on to the plain of Anglesey, the changing outline of 
Tryfaen and the Glyders and the endless ranges of hills to

with thc Battalion to the trenches was October  5- Thesc 
trenches wcre in front of Ypres» and it was in this district 
that he remained, whetber in trenches in rescrv% or 
in billets, until Fcbruary. On November zo he caught a 
chill on a frosty night» while on duty in thc trenches; as 
a result» he was in hospital until December $. He was» 
however» in the trenches once moe on December 9- 
During this month thcre were rumours that his Battalion 
was to be transferrcd from France to the East but on 
December OE6 ho wrote that this was cancellcd. 
He had a narrow cscape on the night ofJanuary ç 
while wiring in front ofthe line. His Companycommander 
heard the click of- German machine-gun» and warned him 
just in timc to savc his lire. From January 9 to --6 ho 
was home on leave, and was at Shrcwsbury on the zznd. 
\Vhite met him in London on his rcturn to France. At 
he beginning ofFebruary he had tcmporary command ofhis 
Company» during its commander's absence on leave; and it 
was soon after this that White first came to France.

When the grandson of Mr. Gladstone wrote to his

that these were very true words» and it will surely be enough

whole appearance quite difl;erent from that of men who've 
hOt been up. It was a very, very young Corporal, and 
there was a deuce of a bombardment on, and the Sergt.- 
Major met him: «What are you doing?' «Oh! just 
issuing rations, Sergt.-Major.' That is not particularly 
remarkable, no doubt, and that is just why it is worth 
quoting, as being so frightthlly typical. WeIl, there wasn't 
any risk as far as I was concerned on that occasion» and it 
was only whcn we got back that somebody said, ' By Gad, 
we've been under tire ; what fun !'

That aftcrnooa two of us got one and a half hours' notice 
to get up to the trenches ' for instruction' with another 
8attalion : and actually during those one and a half hours 
in came your parcel ! 
Wc had a glofious rime there ; we were heavily shelled, 
coupled with almost complete safety; and what more in- 
teresting experience could you wish ? SafoEy, because our 
front line was too cloee to theirs to be aimed at, but 
out support trenches (and in fact the back of my dug- 
out, onlyby ?agments--occionally, in rhe front line) 
got hit. Yet only one casualty as their shells mostly fell 
between us and them. It went on for two hours and was 
called 'fairly intense ', i.e. nothing like that before an attack. 
Digging a new trench at sixty yards from the Bosches under 
flares and (bad) rifle shots was less of an arm-chair show, 
rather  
I wod like you to think that my thirty-s hours there

But you must go to the front line trenches to pro-e 
that, or the conditions arc hardly fulfilled. V/hat the 
support line may be ]ikc I do hOt know, for during a 
recent bombardment I gallantly turncd my back on it ; 
since the front line, let me add, was only forty yards ri'oto 
the Bosches and theii artillery couldn't very well go for us 
there. But I confess to-day to experiencing once a very 
uncomfortabl¢ sensation, in reserve. * That '» I said to 
myself, « seems to me spinal» and therefore I must bave left

And indeed I had. The inconceivab]c prospcct of a 
wooden-lined dug-out» in reserve, with the yellow leaves and 
the October terre, and nothing but the shells, still bullying 
the battered remains of the city a couple of hundred )ards 
away, to remind one of realitiesthis was indeed a change. 
We weren't idle : six hours' digging per day kecps one fit all 
right. But this sort of digging is hot ]ikc making a new 
trench at fifty yards» and there is rime (when the thrce 
aeroplane whistles go, and work and staring upwards are for- 
bidden) to look over one's shoulder and watch the crumbled 
bouses and ruined towers. « Hate the business ?' Wh),»

what about the Blakeway poems» cspecially those in the

is no knowledge of any particular definitencss to betray. 
Thc rime here bas really been more like training in Eng-

that 1 would gct about thirty points really hammered into

in cases exactly of this kind the leave roster must be rigid

I came out, and generally filled me with such a sense of

something useful to sling back at him, by way of shewing

I can't pretend that I'm hOt comçortable, because one's

very annoyed and, to be quite candid, a bit ashamed at going 
down in this way. It would weigh less heavily on one» if 
it weren't that tEe people in the trenches mnst be having 
as beastly a rime at least as I had a week ago; for it's 
freezing, and perhaps worse, and meanwhile one lies in bed.

Christmas was a great day. We were serenaded, of

and we killed a pig for the Company and ordered up 
certain barrels and smokes which livened up things con- 
siderably, especially during a terrific concert we had later. 
There was, as far as I could hear, practically no firing

Oh, Phiz, but I do like your book' enormously. It came 
as the most comforting thing in the world to read this dear 
man's letters. As I dare say you've gathered fiom m t, fran- 
tic scrawl the other day, and from H. E. E. H., if you got 
a hint of a narrow shave I had which l dcscribd in a note 
to him I think I mat' really say we've had a taste of the 
big gaine this time. Tl'e trenches we were wiring don't 
really bear talking about. I doubt i_f anything quite like it 
exists» now ; Bosches all round and behind» at bombing 
range in places ; my escape was at fifteen yards one of hall 
a dozen shaves with their M.G.'s. Next night ton bombs 
(from craw]ers) within as many yards of me. Well well 
but H6j sat in such places for 66 days out of 76 I remember 
mperhaps her% for ail I know; and here are we having 
four days" rest alternately. 
Yes but it "s the book that rnatters and it is a glorious 
antidote. I like the bit about the Personality of Railway 
Stations; the Man of Sheerness would like that and 
if any one wanted to do me a favour he would relieve 
my Alpine 2 excitement by sending the Man a copy at once ; 
I should be l-appier.

DIARY 

Novemer OE, 1915. 
It was time I went. Thc rain sp:ashed gloriously in my 
face as I came out of our ]ittle farm at dusk, where a fea, 
minutes ago we had actually dared to be grumbling.  Now,' 
I said, clenching my fists and gesticulating with bitten lip, 
 aN'0va that is al] over, and things are going to happen." . . . 
« Orate pro anima mea," I said :  Orate pro anima mea . . . 
and particularly Hôj,' I added, for I suppose the meanest 
so!dier God ever ruade has some ideal leader of his own. 
So I we,t on in the pouring rain and the mud. It was 
quite obvious which tuming I should take at the corner of 
the lane that leads from our hom% and within a few minutes 
I was in the village and at its farther end. The white face 
of the church clock stared at me with a strange surprise as 
I stroe past. That', I answered, ' only shews again 
that you do hot quite understand. It will be all right, but 
there are things to be done first.' So I passed flore the 
village, and the slow, limping piquet was soon left far 
behind. It was now but a few hundred yards to the end of 
my pilgrimage, which as you may guess was obviously the 
fi-ontier. It seemed a pity to bave to strafe the sentry for 
being too easily content at a great distance with my mono-

Others? I wondered if each nudged his neighbour-- c See 
how one is angry because they receive so easily, on this 
Night of ail others, his Voice from the night, claiming 
that he is a friend!' But I left that business, for 1 had 
al"rived. He;-e was my goal, and here I halted on the litte 
bridge over the tiny border stream, and fingering the German 
lXTewTestament in my pocket I remembe1"ed many countries. 
clt is all right now,' I said - « all the co,'ners ofthe earth . . . 
Ah yes,'I added, disdaining ail mild faithless ubjunc- 
tives, « to-night, I most deeply believe, Omnis Spirltus Lal«dat 
Domlnum." Back, thon, from the frontier ; back to France 
and the little village church ; and this time with a haste, as 
though to make amends, I went in. [t was absolutely dark, 
except for one tiny candle by the altar at the far end ; and 
I was not sorry when the end of my stumbling came and I 
reached my goal, especial ly when the deor opened and closcd 
when I had gone half-way.  lXTever mind,' I thought : « it 
might be Hôj, corne in reply to my greeting.' So I arrived, 
having stepped on all the happier for that. And there at 
last [ came ; and there, while the door opened and shut 
again and again with the most encom-aging pe:sistence 
remembered Them and their Deeds and my own endless 
needs, in the language that for lmndreds lnd hundreds of 
years has fought to oblitcrate all the frontiers and all the 
doubt, the most holy language of Rome. 
It is very late now, beloved Men.' Since writing that, 
I bave gone to the window and looked into the night ; I 
have seen the distant star-shells and heard the distant guns. 
« Ruht in Frieen,' I murmured, c and forget te strafing : 
it is Ail Souls' Day.'

The l/l.ralk to Potye. It was pelting with rain when I 
started at about 3-° or so. As I got on I soon became quite 
happy, as is one's way in a &luge when moving and dressed 
for the part ; and I do not think the guide minded, as 
much as some would have, the fact of his being pulled out 
of his dug-out on such a day, We came across the fields 
half-right, as tl.e cross-road was marked not to be used, by 
the Artillery, I think, who as usual do not want any fiat- 
footed Infantry paddling ound theirwar-hives. At the edge 
of the wood I let my guide go home; and passing many 
dozen bottoms of shell-cases, I got an Artillery-man to take 
me to the ith Essex H.Q., where a couple ofofficers from 
their M.G. section offered to shew me were the E. Yoïks 
were. Itis curious, how 1 ara beginning tothink I enjoyed 
that aftemoon; the idea is obviously absurd--0¢ 8 roc

ridiculous in it to make it just worth remembering. 
The Plai»tive Gunuer. Were I ten rimes more than a mere 
subaltern I do not think I should have the impudence to 
strafe the gunners ; but here was an R.F.A. subaltern to- 
night getting quite heated on the subject of Infantry and 
Artillery. What he objects to most seems fo be the shyness 
with which certain Battalions in part of Hill 6o, where he 
is view an occasional short-bursting shell as judged by the 
language in which they protest against it. Probably the 
best thing to have done would have been to agree that the 
Infantry should welcome an occasional surprise of this kind, 
on the ground that itis all healthy experiment with a view to 
strafing the Hun. But unluckilysome of us tried argument-

announced to the gunners " l,ike the don confronted with

[ doubt if it really soothed him. The result in his battery 
is that they never tire at the Hun first line at all, as they 
reckon it is hot worth while risking thc inevitable accidents 
from wrong fuses and wet ammunition. 
Well, I ara glad to think l've never complained, not 
having had ashort shell down my neck; but I can sympathise

AIore oflffo. E C.C.S. It was rather intcresting, as there 
were always officers from ditkerent stations coming in. 
The authorities were very generous, I must say ; we were 
excel]ently fed, and night after night there would be red 
and white win% whisky and brandy, on the table. No 
great inroads however were ever ruade on these, as no one 
felt up to it. One night I played Auction (with tb.e usual 
fool's success) with two very nice R.A.M.C. men and 
a man from the Oxfords. I once redoubled three Royals 
and ruade them. 
I read The Fair Maid off Perth there. I also read Barrie's 
book which contained the original story of Peter Pan, t?om 
which the play grew. I suppose no one ever understood 
children like that : the guessed success of the bachelor with 
children without their parents standing by, the tt rrific 
solemnity of small boys in great coats--these are grandly 
done. 
Bells, always bells, from the big church over tle way. 
It was not very far £rom home being there. Bells of Lich- 
field, Eton, Newcastle, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Worcester ; 
the little bells of the Plain ; ail these could be heard clearly 
as I la}, listening to their raie.

But oh, the militaty mind! I had read through once, 
delighted, and half-way through again, when for no reason 
I murmured to Winkley,  You know thc way to inspect 
Tube Helmets is to bave them in here man by man» and 
avoid waiting and exposure in the air ! ' 
And this, although, so far from being tempted by in- 
difference to think of othcr things, I was definitely excitcd 
about the potin. We are a strange people.

Who that bas ever been through anything even the hours 
before an mximportant race, does hot know how he reads, 
not the pages before him, but something he dislikes the 
prospect of, across them all ? Of course this prospect 
business is played out fairly soon, I hope and believe, and 
ara beginning to find ; but knife-rests, due saine evening at 
 ç and z5 yds. from the Hun in biggish numbers (a dozen 
or so) do corne iato one's mind when they shouldn't; and 
this would hOt be an honest entry if it tried to drown the 
fact in any heroics ! 
Before dismising the subject of this idle contemplation 
of danger it would be rash hot to remember two things it 
I think, begets ; one is a quite physical emotion towards, 
and almost clinging to, inanimate objects; the other is the 
passionate acqiiescence in low countries. Whether this 
latter be due to the fact that the eye gulps greedil)' at large 
vistas of scenes it ma), possibl), be like to lose I do hot 
know; but I can understand quite well now from its 
complete absence when at rest among the lowlands how 
the contrary is true of mountains and how dread is said to 
lurk in high places. Yes! I suppose we bave had a taste 
of what Belloc calls 'the great emotions'. But I am at 
last quite conscious of what really happens ; one introduces 
an almost palpable lur. The great-hearted ones probably 
do hOt do this: they pull out their skeleton and defy him» 
and rather look forward than otherwise to explorations 
among his uncharted bones. For myself I ara perfectly 
clcar ; I do hot exactly reverse my chair, and I pray devoutly 
I may hot wart to Icave his company. But I think he is 
just left out, hot even waved aside--I ara a total stranger 
to any melodramatic ' steeling ' and ail the rest of the room 
grows more and more adorable in detail just because he too 
is there. It is a curious world.

from the wall of the dug-out a stick supporting a candle ; 
aeroplanes buzz overhead, and two or three silIy nations 
are squandering ammunition by the ton upon them; the 
Hun furiously strafes the French support lines, and out 
guns reply occasional]y. Every now and then a M.G.

He was very much himself and awfuly concerned as to 
the items of kit which he ought to take, and wishing there 
was an order to take no kit. We spent an hour in chemists" 
shops last evening, while Southwell examined the chemists 
about anti-vermin powders, believing all their ver/various 
suggestions and acting on most of them. 
Finally it required three taxis to get to Charing Cross, 
not due to the size of his luggage but to a general lack of 
organisation in the departure.

worried about his kit. How many Morphia tablets should 
he take? If they wcre so useful, why not hundrcds of 
them ? Whether sulphur was really any good against lice ? 
Wouldn't it fall off the clothes as soon as it was put on ? 
Ec. etc. Hc couldn't think of much else. 
I told him about those steel plate mirrors--you know the 
thingsmand we discussed their efficacy against glancing 
bullets, etc. ; and finally, when I asked him if ho wanted me 
to send anything out to him, he seemed to think these 
wcrc good things (though he'Id bc quite content, if some 
onc ordcrcd him hot to bave them). Anyhow, he said 1 
might as well send him out four.

FEBRUARY TO JULY 916 

SooN after returning /rom leave, and on the day after 
White reached France, Southwell was transferred from D 
Company to take command of C Company. This was on 
Febmary o, and on the .oth the Battalion moved south 
from Belgium into France, moving b t, train to Halloy (where 
Southwell speaks of a great ride to get a football for his 
men), and then, by Occoches and Grand Rullecourt» to 
Sombrin and Simencourt, where he was again in the 
trenches. During this journey south he met White near 
Canaples. 
On March z a senior officer, Capt. Barclay, took over 
the command of C Company, though not for long. On 
April   Southwell started for England, but on reaching 
Boulogne tbund that all leave was cancelled, and had to 
return. On April OEo he regained the command of his 
Company, as Capt. Barclay was transferred to the st 
Battalion ; and it was about this time that Southwell was 
gazetted Captain. 
On May ÷ he was home on leave, and spent a dag 
at Shrewsbury. This is taken from a letter written about 
him after his death : 
' He was (as if by intuition) a « discerner of spirits ". 
But (most impressive of ail) he was strictly impartial. He 
never allowed one love to interfere with the claires of 

L z

another. An instance of this occurred during his last 
leave. He left his parents during what might (and actually 
did) prove to be his last leave» in order that he might go 
to Shrewsbury and see young Blakeway who was ill. 
It was the saine during the months of his training on 
Salisburlt Plain. He was always going somewhere to see 
some one (often at a great distance) who he thought would 
wish to see him." 
After his leave he returned to the saine part of the line 
where he mentions little of military interest except a 
gas alarm» on May .o. From this rime onwards his letters 
and diaries are full ofthe coming of Summer. OnJune I I 
Capt. H. W. Garto% a fellow Etonian with whose 
brother he had rowed at Oxford rejoined the Battalion» and 
again Southwell lost the command of the Company to a 
senior officer. For a rime he was at the x4th Divisional 
School of Instruction at Hautevill% and then returned 
to the Battalion. 
On July  White was killed in an attack belote Mailly- 
Maillet. 
The story continues in Southwell's own words :

In the evening entered Lewis gunners on Company

After that we listened to our gramophone and records 
we borrow from Irving. The chier features 1 have alreadï 
mentioned ; but to my huge delight Polgreen (B), who 
messed with us, brought his album with 8chuert's Unflnished

things to look back upon. There was a lot of shuffling 
about of  1' and  C ' on the road» to the side of out real 
road» but the one on which we were drawn up waiting 
to join lhe colunan. We went down it sonae way» and 
helped» and turned about. Then ' B' came» of course 
through tlousands of lorres» all anyhow. So we had to 
shift down. Too far. lack. Not far enough. 8ack. 
About turn. Found old "t3 ' with its  second front section 
ofti3urs marking rime like good "uns» and nobody else giving

However» we did get going then, and had a pr«tty good 
match. Very cold» but fresh» and no one was very tired. 
It renainds nae that one does hOt ordinarily renaain as strong 
as one was belote conaing out--or soit seenas to nae. 
I naay be wrong» but I should say that I felt an eight nailes' 
naarch naore than I used to on the Plain. Of course» 
though» I have been ill since then, and also probably smoked 
too much; and I expect one is really no weaker in 
oneself. 
As I was saying» I ara afraid one becomes rather a 
beast of burden on these treks. I was absolutely happy» I 
think, on the whole of thena» or nearly so ; but just now 
the certain glory of the earth is hOt exacfly unremarked»

E. H. L.S. March I916 
and beneath that a lectern. Both places, and the gallery 
at what i will call the west end, had numerous service books, 
and books of other men's serinons, some of them old 
eighteenth-century tomes. There were also a great number 
of their ç Cantiques ', which were printed as though every 
one knew all about them and their origin, which I 
certainly do hot. They are a kind of potted Psalms in 
verse. 
Thus, appropriately, 
Ps. z. D'où vient ce bruit parmi les nations ? 
E. g. f./E. D. A quoi porte leur impuissante haine ? 
Peuples, pourquoi dans vos illusions 
g. b. a.g./F. Vous flattez-vous d'une espérance vaine ? 
Je vois hgues les princes de la terre 
 Dans leurs conseils ; les grands ont présumé 
D'être assez forts de déclarer la guerre 
A l'Eternel, à son Oint bien aimé. 
And Ps. i, with its so typical inversions :- 
Heureux celui qui fuit des vicieux 
Et le commerce et l'exemple odieux: 
Qi des pécheurs hait la triompheuse voie 
Et des moqueurs la criminelle joie, 
Qg_i, invoquant Dieu, ne se plaît qu'en sa loi 
Et nuit et jour la médite avec foi. 
(Fin.) 
It is full of 'Peuples, venez...', and the whole thing 
is obviously faithfully portrayed in Athalie. But I must 
ordy quote one more. After passing an ominous 
Mon Dieu, quelle guerre cruelle ! 
(hOt from a Psalm, I think), I came to-- 



Iy2 E, H. L.S. March 1916 
Luther's Hymn, to the usual tune s thus : 
C'est un rempart que notre Dieu, 
Si l'on nous fait injure ; 
Son bras puissant nous tiendra lieu 
Et de fort et d'armure. 
L'ennemi contre nous 
Redouble de courroux, 
Vaine colère [--Qe pourrait l'Adversaire ?w 
L'Eternel détonne sts coups. 
(Fin.) 
But 1 cannot let Haessler's tune go (hOt a Passion hymn 
this tune; it is called Cant: 49, but it is not ri-oto a 
Psalm) :- 
Jamais Dieu ne délaisse 
Q.9.i se confie en lui, 
Si le monde m'oppresse, 
Jésu est mon appui. 
Ce Dieu bon et fidèle 
Garde en sa paix les siens 
Pour la vie éternelle, 
Et les comble de biens. 
It is easily believed, as I write (on this gorgeous Spring 
morning) chez Briache, Arras, March I8. 
(The Book was published '63 and I must quote the end of 
the Avant-Propos. 
' Puisse... ce livre d'orgue contribuer puissamment... 
à relever le goût du chant sacré dans les assemblées de 
fidèles et dans les familles, et seconder fructueusement

their towers stiil stand to shew the way. Hcre it was not 
incongruous that the entry to the Cathedral was by the 
ruins of the Musée. I might have thought I had corne 
straight on the east end» for beforc roc lay a large altar 
with long rails. So true is it that men final thernselves in 
the Sanctuary unawales. But it was the south transept» so» 
as in duty bound, I rnade my way back to the left and round 
the west door. It is ail very Byzantine, of cours% and the 
resernblance to St. Paui's was increased by the ring of 
bouses below the high steps. But I have known good hours 
in St. Paul's, and anyhow the church is in ruins .... Yes» 
it has paid in full as no doubt bas many a penitent wlo 
bas stood wonderingly by the ruined confcssionals which 
line the aisle. Thit aisle is not so ruincd as the northern» 
and thus it carne that the inscriptions on the Stations of 
the Cross» though not the carving» still remained ; and 
selecting the one which bore tl:e number of rny Regirnent» 
I stood over against it by the pillar to look towards 
the chancel. I do not know whetler it was towcr or dome 
that lay in ruins a little farther east ; but though it was 
gone, the four central arches» with the deep blue of the 
spring sky for their only burden still stood to their post 
for the glory of God. Only one pigeon strutted past rne 
as 1 went ; but perhaps he felt his responsibilities for the 
lonely solemnity of his walk was liJie the mernory of a 
thousand vergers. It rnight indeed have becn his little 
protest when» later» a little piece of roof fell at my feet  
for he passed me flying on his way to the arches a moment 
before it came. But I was now at the Chancel steps» 
and before rne lay the altar with its image and inscription 
 Ave Regina Caeli ' 
in gold on Nue. No wonder if Our Lady of Lourdes 



 '4 E.H.L.S. March  9  6 
veiled her head beneath a huge canvas sheet» for it was too 
much of an irony that she should look for ever t'owards 
a deso!ate altar with the legend 
' Autel PriviIégié à Perpetuité' 
But it was hOt really to end sadly, my little visit; 
for something like a triumphant cry from the ruins awaited 
me at the door as I went out. For tbere, on the battered 
walI, stood out this rudeIy scratched memorial, which as I 
read, I remembered the glorious endurances ofthis adorable 
peopl% and I thought with envy of the heroes who had 
perhaps this for their only commemoratio% and for 
type the four unbroken arches ofthe nav% that reached up 
towards the Spring to bear lope ontbeir shoulders :-- 
' Honneur aux 
Braves Poilus du Nème qui ont £ait tout leur devoir.'

both of us trying to build the New Jerusalem: ¢and 
though neither your trenches" . . may be very showy bricks 
let's hope they'll be used in the basement.' I read that 
out at tea to C Company oNccrs, and they applauded it 
not a little» and I round myself to my amazemcnt nearly 
choking.

the Adjurant on the 'phone.  I want you to hand over the

That was a bit sudden but obviously tbr the enor- 
mous advtage of the Company ; and as I said in my 
lettcr bornes this war is hot being run entirely to gratify the 
ambitions of fourth-rate and unimportallt subalterns! . . .

window. I bought several post-cards and an Easter card or 
two. One, like my old Houtkerque, was entitled 
 Until to End', 
and lacked something in the way of Idiom. 

I4/'ednesday to Thursday» wtpril  - . 
The train i left at 12.3o ; therefore we boarded at IO,30 , 
and slept fairly well. Very uncomfo,oEable as there were 
too few Firsts, but we did hOt mind when eventually we did 
get to Boulogne. Dawn came cold, but by 9.o or so it was 
warm and fine, and things were looking very rosy indeed 
as we marched out of the train towards out big breakfast at 
the usual buffet at the station. 
At 2.3o in came an officer of the Cheshires :--« AI1 Leave 
cancelled: notice up at A.bl.C.O.'s of2fice." A joke, we 
thought ; but no. 
\Vell oit I went to the Qai and there it was:  Ail 
officers and men on leave v:ill reç»ire" (silly idiom that !)  to 
return to their units. Those proceeding on duty to England 
will continue journey. Further announcements later." 
* Oh so that's it is it ?" we thought. Explanation obvious ; 
Ypres, Verdun and Arras all taken London in flames 
fleet at the bottom of Channel» entire B.E.F. on verge 
of extermination. At least what 1 really thought was 
not quite that: I thought probably the Hun had made a 
bit of a success of some attack on Verdun and got near 
enough to make it advisable for everybody to  stand 
by'. That doesn't seem to be the case; at least l've 
not read of such a thing. One explanation is that it 
is a traffic marrer in England merely ; but in any case 
I needn't waste rime (and carbon) by more guesses, as

There was Mackworth of Magdalen now attached to 
Div. H.Q. (  Qa_. branch' f think he said, and Jackso% now 
Cptain and Adjurant ; also Pugh. We sat round talking 
Masonry with Mackworth for a long time and what he 
told us more than anything I had heard belote, was rather 
thrilli,g. The search for the Narne of God sounded a taairy

Breakfast next day at the Ocers' Club at Boulogne; very

where we got out. Here came the unique odour of France 
straight to me as I came out of the station with Meiiy 
and I was in a great state of delight. We wint to look at 
the Cathedral ad I found there everything, that my 
wildest dreams of Gothic had boped for. It was a Spring 
morning ; and there was tle Cathedral of Amiens» and I 
hoped that it marked the dawn to a xew age.

It is not for every one to stand on the summit ofa Cathe-

this morning ; I having gone there before breakfast. For 
the first rime this week I saw sunshine and blue sky» and it 
was worth seeing after this miserable week» how the white 
clouds came across the blue over the broken church like 
vengeance towards the Hun lines. Opening the Bre-

,ards and perfectly glorious. The route is on my xf+oooo

had a most glorious halt right on a hill overlooking village 
after village of this beautiful plain. Also it was on high 
ground nearly all the wab and the men thoroughly enjo),ed 
it I think» though it was quite hot (after my liking this) : 
I gave them twenty minutes" halt at that place» which

far better, and there was a suggestion of the Plain ; and the

On this day I had a very wonderful walk in the morning, 
starting soon after breakfast, alone. Throughout all this 
trip thre was a lot of excitement over Keats' Nigktingale, 
though I did not tZail to rcalise at the time that it would 
not do to soak too much in it, in vicw of the circumstanccs 
of the reader out here! I kncw with a quite physical 
realisation what he meant by : « Fade far away, dissolve, and 
quite forger' . . . that morning. It was at the corner 
between the cover and the wood ; and there the road cornes 
swooping round as though it knew the arms of all the lairics 
were opening in the wood below .... 
To get to the village I ruade across ½ R. and then turned 
sharp left down the road. Perhaps the village was more 
adorable than anything I have scen since Houtkerque, and 
it would be absurd to deny that in itself it is much more 
beauti_thl. The road through the village climbs slowly up 
the hill like a piIgrim to the church on the hill-top ; and 
it seemed in most English wise that it loitered by pools 
and official bouse corners as it rose. Finally the church 
reminded me tremendously of some little church on the 
Plain; with its avenue of chestnuts diagonally leading to 
the little door, and its little cemetery, and the big trecs 
and curé's house around. 
In the evening Hall and I went to Noyelle again, this 
time making fbr the next village beyond it. Hall, by 
the way, is one of the privilcged peoplc to whom I havc 
lent Tke Patb to Rome. The othcrs, I think I havc noted

We came out absolutely « fiat-out" into the f.rm last

days; so are the men. It was grand to see how they

whcn it's over ; the mere physical delight of a chair when 
ou are pretty well exhausted the walk in the air (fresh 
and hot foul) before a very Iate breakfast back here» the 
comparative silence ; the chance of writing a Ietter, of 
reading a book, of hearing the dear old sad songs of the

The O.C. C Company (Roberts, a great Cambridge 
cricketer I think)was killed in what would have bcen 
probably his very last tour of inspection of his trenches, the 
foulest, most unspeakable and battle-scarred, I suppose, in 
the world : it is there that--oh well, I mustn't put in horrors. 
This was two nights ago, and for thirty-six hours 1 bave been 
in his sb.oes with a feeling of something like remorse at the 
dreadful noiseless continuity, so typical of the Army, with 
which the place he leaves is (nominally) filled. Companies 
are so scattered here that we see little of each other, and 
I knew him only slightly; but he was much liked and is 
terribly hard to follow. 
It would be silly to pretend that I ara not pleased with 
this very unexpected lift up, however irreverent I may feel 
to my predecessor's memory. It is a big opportunity, in 
its way, after all, and I only wish I were more equal to it. 
This is rather a heavy letter, I ara afraid ; having got what 
I often wanted, but saw no likelihood of getting, I can't 
help feeling rather a worm ! In fact, I need a pastoral epistle 
rather badly for man), reasons, and wou!d be grateftfl il: I 
could have it, from you.

I write this right back out--we've trained and marctxed 
back to within a toile of out month's rest billets. That's 
the news as far as it goes, and I suppose it will allay anxiety 
for the present. I wrote a letter in the trenches to an old 
Salopian on his entering the sector to relieve us, in which 
I said quite truthful.ly that (though I was perhaps foolishly 
sentimental, and partly lying) I couldn't leave that sector 
çuite without a pang. After all there is nothing like it on 
earth nor I suppos% ever will be. It's not a bed of roses

I'm so sorry to hear you're har are carnat with a cold. 
l remember rather enjoying the gaine called lronchial 
Catarrh at Eton, where you had to stay in bed for fear it 
should become pneumonia, and yet fe!t quite wcll and read 
like anything, I read Lama Daane under those conditions 
and loved it. This matter of novel-reading was ære,ented 
to me as a duty (!) at Shrewsbury. 
I bave lately corne to believe, as A. C. Benson would say, 
that there's a lot in this, and that the busier I ara (and of 
course I ara far more so now as O.C. Coy.), the more 
necessar), it is that I should try and get this bit of reading; 
provided, of course, that I don't let it get to mare than a bit ! 
To HIS FATHER, B.E.F. 
Fel. 17, 1916. 
The arrival of Sir D. Haig down the road was rather 
picturesque. Unfortunately I had, like all O.'s C. Coys., 
to give out that rnen muxt look straight to their front and 
not follow him with their heads, and therefore I had to 
keep my own straight. So it came about that I saw literally 
nothing except the great man himself when on the ground. 
But coming down the road, as I said, it was picturesque ; 
the C.-in-C. and the Army Commander and their staff(or 
rather halfa dozen ofthem) and six Lancers and the Corporal 
carrying the Union Jack, behind ; it was this very mediaeval 
procession, trotting clown the road a quarter of a toile from 
the field, that we could ail bave a look at and which was 
very striking. When he came on we had the usual busi- 
ness; the bugle sounded and we gave the General Salute by

]3attalions. Then he rode down past each Battalion, when 
I could have had a good look at everybody if it would have 
done: and as t, ou ma t, guess, I swivelled m t, eyes round a 
bit, onllr taking care to keep m t, head straight. However 
the effect was that it was not until I round him bending 
down from lais horse and asking me how long I'd been out, 
and « had I been quite fit all the time ?' that I realised he 
was upon me. I don't know at how many Company 
Commande's l:e stopped ; quite likely at ail, though I don't 
think he did. It was unfortunate that of two remarks, 
with which I have favoured the C.-in-C., one was a lie! 
But the alternatives were :--(i)  Yes, Sir.' ()  Well, Sir 
now t,ou corne to mention it I did catch a slight chill in 
the lines, and had a short spdl in hospital at Hazebrouck ; 
you know the place, perhaps, Sir: very nice people they 
were indeed." So rather than hold up the great man and 
the Army Commander and other brass-hatted gentry 
and the whole Brigade with these truthful particulars, I 
chose (I)» and I hope the Recording Angel rea-lised that 
I was only doing what any but the very coolest of soldiers 
could very well presume to do.

You would all adore this place, but you couldn't have 
anything like the huge joy with which I regard every inch 
of it ; you want +½ months in the flats to get the best out 
ofthe Downs. That is what they are. I couldn't think, 
tbr a moment, to-day why I felt Bapton when the train went 
by, till I realised that it ruade precisely the same noise 
under the big Downs as the G.W. trains there. Then for 
Mure there would be a watertZall, with a big mill-wheel 
turning and pounding away by the side.

And to-day the Company couldn't get a football; so I 
rode off to a town (hOt the big one, but it had lots of shops, 
and I had hopesJ three mi]es off: no good : three more in 
a diflerent direction to a small village» where the town man 
said there was a  fabriquant de ballons' (glorious phrase !), 
and in doing so I got up about 6oo feet» I suppose, and beheld 
the earth and it was a good place : (I got the football» old 
but passable; his last). I write in bed (absurd luxury),

' it may be excellently well': but that can't prevent my

I can only hope everything will go as well with you as it 
did with me» and that you'll enjoy the convalescent period 
as much and as soon. Being a lazy individual, and very

glorious rime in bed reading books ; C. A. A. gave me 
Tante» I remember» to my great delight» and I waded 
through practically all Shaw's plays and prefaces again: 
and the Man sent me Syng% and I got excited again about 
Deirdre and Emain. And there was the great morrfing

when I felt practically ,well so long as I kept still, and after 
waking up turned over and lit a candle very early, and re- 
flected that I had the whole day to read, if I liked, and that 
it was all rather fun. All this unholy glee in complete 
idleness may hot corne your way so fully, but I hope some 
of it may. Meanwhile the Man is within one toile of me 
as 1 sit, and I ara just going over to tea there with him. 
It is strange. A cathedral town is within a dozen toiles

To-day was Sunday. And there was Celebration in 
the school here, and we knelt at the familiar desks in the 
familiar room all hung with maps» and I remembered that 
1 was a schoo!master too: and I saw the familiar black- 
board ; also I reflected that 1 could not write on it so 
beautifully as the (doubtless) dear old painstaking master 
of the little village. And I thought of you all» and 
wondered whether you knew I was doing so. Only last 
night one ofmy officers produced the Golden Treasury» and 
I turned up c The Blessed Damozel ' of Rossetti» and came 
at once across the passage where the two are praying, 
widdy separated, as we are :- 
Are not two prayers a perfect strength ? 
And shall I feel afraid? 
And I said ' Tl:ank you', and I dosed the book and 1

scoured fifteen mlles of them one glorious morning in 
search of a fobtball on my pony (and got it) for the 
Company; a funny thing it was too, but it did ail right. 
Two days there was all we got, but oh! the incredible 
old ladies of my billet. One was 93 ad the other 7% I 
suppose ; a mother and daughter. The latter was iii and 
rheumatic, and the mother fo!lowed her every motion with 
the eyes of one looking after a child. Yes and when one 
of my officers went in to find billets, she caught him 
affectionately by the arm and said « Remember "7 o " .... It is 
so far better than Alphonse Daudet! Since leaving there 
we have marched a couple of days, sideways with regard to 
the line, in ShOW ; bitterly cold weather and miserable 
billets--for the men, I fear: the officers managefl better ; 
we had a house of some kind and could keep out of the cold, 
which pierced the barris where the Company was. But it's 
hot easy tobe quite happy with the knowledge that one is 
probably one of perhaps four or rive who aren't pretty 
miserable--or a-t least so one would think: but they are 
ver), wonderful with it all. 
Many thanks for your letter, which I was delighted to get. 
l'm still awaiting the epistle for which I asked, and hope 
to get it soon (our letters crossed). Not that I'm unhappy 
at all ; but l'm just getting a touch of the ' fed-upness" 
which seems to come on some people wh&ve been out some

Wash out apologies and let me get on. They'le so badly

delightful. 1 agree about Rupert Brooke and Jian Grcn-

values fluctuate so strange]y out here. Some things are

' Pretending I like it,' you say. Ycs, and (though I had 
evidently a decided fit of the dumps when I last wrote) the 
pretence is quite convincing, to me. I reall), think that 
was the only period when I was definitdy a little fed up, 
ever since I joined: and that was probably because we'd 
been out of the trenches too long, and our « tre.k' period, 
with the constant fuss over billets night after night, was 
getting tiresomely long. Since then we've been in again, 
and had the most infernal time I remember from the weather, 
though the Hun was evidently so equally miserable that the 
firing was very small.

gone this rime. 
Vell, as I was saying, things are pretty wdl, really; 
I think I was depressed, when I wrote, to a considerable 
extent, but your letter cured me at the time. Curiously, 
when I first read it, I expected more ghostly admonition 
(and still do, for that matter) and said, ' Yes, but...' and 
put it in my pocket. 
Yet when I remarked to my oflïcers that evening, ¢ [sn't 
this rather fine reading?' and proceeded to read a bit of 
your letter, I found to my amazement (and theirs, if they 
noticed it ; but I doubt if they did, for it was listened to in 
spell-bound silence, and they were vastly impressed, I know) 
that I could not quite read the last page with a steady voice.

beautifully boarded in and supported by thick tree trunks, 
I got into the trench leading to the communication trench 
that goes to front lines, several score yards up. (The dug- 
out itself I will describe in another edition.) I had to take 
the signallers' dug-out on the way, and between here and 
there I passed various very typical odds and ends--plies of 
brushes, old haversacks, box of rockets for signalling in 
case of emergency, old water-bottle, a few jam tins (left 
by previous occupants--we are being rather good about keep- 
ing the place tidy, but I wouldn't swear we nez'er leave tins 
about !), old pack, and finally the signallers' dug-out itself-- 
a quite good concern, though rather crammed, as being 
a big one it bas to hold the C.S.M. (Company Sergeant- 
Major), officers' servants, and four orderlies, as xvell as the 
signallers. Getting rid ofmy message there for the benefit 
of an old Salopian, who has just corne out to at:other Com-

belonged tothe Dpute--an importantperson»of course» and 
also an ocer in the Fench army : he had several brother» in

and (in short) would we be so very good as hot to insist on our 
right to occupy his bouse ? The clergyman had been asked to 
plead with troops coming in,apparently, and as the French had 
agreed» I thought I could hOt (in the interest of the Entent% 
as well as from natural sympathy) very well do otherwise than 
clear out. 8o we took another hous% and now» after some

would have benefited by some more of him, and so should 
I. However» one must just try to carryon. The secret 
of the whole thing» as he tan it, was not merely being busy 
himself» but being able to act as a sort of centre of activity 
and make everything more round him. In fact, I believe 
many very fine commanders bave been successful by doing 
little themselves and, as it were» sitting in a kind of spider's 
web and controlling from inside. At present this is a very 
tempting picture, but I don't know nearly enough yet to 
be able to indulge in such methods ; but one does learn the 
unimportance ofone's own work and inspections and orders, 
etc., compared with the value of being able to make all the 
other subordinate officials run their own provinces for all 
they're worth.

there's nothing I need say. I tried to say what I felt when 
I first came out, and, thank God, I can just leave it at that

And the other bit ofphilosophy for us both is the marrer 
of seeing the thing in short stages. This, of course, is 
much easier for me, for I can see the stages more clearly. 
But I bave known what it means (like eerybody out here, it's

the strength of the prospect of a twenty-four hours' rest in

Also, Man, one discovers that England is hOt as other 
countries are. And» in fact, it difCs in so many small 
ways, that the real difference is hot easy to seize. But 
perhaps I thought more than anything of the manner in 
which they arrange their fields there. And I thought so 
much ofthis Jittle matter, as I traveIled across them» that I

trenches of the south, I am hot sure I ask anything better. 
Certainly I have had glorious days there ; and yet, perhaps 
nevcr till I came back a few days ago did I know what it 
really was to worship the secluded valleys and the quiet 
fences of home. But I am at home now,' I continued,  and 
my whole soul goes out to clustered counties where beneath 
the mother-grey ofa summer haze, shoulder to shoulder and 
safe from the remembered storm, the fields of England lie 
close." 
There are other differences also, but this will do to go on 
with. This is a ver), important marrer, and I will thank

that Endurance herselfis getting sick of the war.--But all

I and Garton (my new Captain) rode over together to this 
village» which is a very pretty one indeed, some rive toiles 
right back, and peaceful to a degree. The object was that 
we should be shewn some model trenches dug by the people 
undergoing training back there ; and I must say they were 
pretty good. Merewether was very amusing over them. 
He imagined a glorious interview with the R.E. Instructor» 
wherein he should say,  Yes, Sir ; very nice trenches, very 
nice indeed. Now ifI may venture to ask, they would be 
dug 6y night, of course, as ours have to be in the line ?" 
çVell, not exactly," the R.E. would say; in fact they 
would be dug by day, so that every one could see.'  Under 
tire, Sir, of course ?'  Well, I wouldn't quite say that.' 
 Great diNculties» no doubt, through lack of engineering 
materials and skill?" Well, no; we arrange all that." 
And so on and so on, but of course what really happened 
was that none ofthe catechisms were uttered and every one 
admiredin silence And, as I say, they certainly were 
good, and contained several very valuable hints, which I 
hoped we managed to carry away with us. 
And after it was over» we sent our horses away, and

These schools are excellent things ; and it ought to do 
you good 1 think to know that the Army is really using its 
brains far more than it used to do, in the instruction of its 
more ignorant members. I suppose I oughtn't to say too 
much about numbers of schools even if I have beyond the 
vaguest guess how many there are. But it is at least fait 
to say that it is most improbable that in a few more weeks 
(or say months at most) there will be any officers at all 
who haven't been sent away to s0me course or other out 
here under people with the very latest tips from the Front. 
Ifwe can be trusted to reproduce in our men (and this is 
the hard part really perhaps even harder for many people 
than for me ; for with ail my military stupidity, I think if 
any one succeeds in teaching me anything I can make some 
sort of show at teachiaag others)if» as I say we can teach

K. and Latin Prose.* Yes, it is very striking. Curiously 
enough, we had a terrific education argument the very night 
before your letter came. [I suppose I'd better explain that 
I'm here (see heading), having again handed over the Com- 
pany to H. W. Garton» who was in this Battalion a long 
time ago ; and being now free to go on  courses' again, 
they've selected me: hot too bad ; one learns a terrific 
amount, or I think one does» and gets a complete change 
from the trenches.] It started between a certain Captain 
of R.E. (D.S.O. and all that» a terribly efficient man who 
teaches us what you wouldn't believe a possible amount of 
t:acts about field works) and myself, following the discovery 
that the Colonel (one Swainson» D.S.O., of the Cornwalls) 
was an old Salopian. We all three got at it hard: the 
C.O. and I against the Captain and a Lieutenant ofthe 
Cyclists, late teacher in a London Polytechnic School. 
These were all for a turn-out of classics altogether» and it 
was very difficult going. Why is it that the only thing 
schoolmasters can't do is to defend themselves ? At least 
I always feel terribly open to attack on these occasions. I 
rested most of my claire for the average boy (does he exist, 
by the way ? Tke Times thought he did for months, one 
year» I remember) on what old Bradley calls exactness of 
thought  and while not stressing the value of classics for 
the better peopl% I thought it best to urge Latin Prose as 
the most urgent thing. \Vhat these people al'ways say 
« Why not do French and German in exactly the same

taught him more than anything else. See page i6z.

It is too miserable about Woodroffe. Z It was owing to 
him, as much as any one, that I joined the R.B. Every 
one of course says,  What a wondcrful family ', and this is 
perfectly true: but his death was not wonderful at all ; it 
was just the most miserable piece of bad luck for his Regi-

M. G. W. 

FEBRUARY to Jtr.Y 96 
WHrrE landcd at Le Havre on Fcbruary 9, and on thc 
 zth he was at a Base camp at Rouen, whcrc he had staycd 
in x9o 9. Hc joined thc st Battalion on the ,8th at 
Canaples, wherc for a month it was in reserv% to his 
disappointment. Three days latcr he visited Southwell, 
who was near by. 
At the beginning of March he had a chill, and on the 
+th hc hcard the news ofhis fathcr's dcath. He came back 
to England, though hot till after the funcral. While at 
Oxton he found that he could hot get rid of lais chill» and 
was forced to get extension ofleave, which lasted for nearly 
a month. He visited Shrewsbur, for the night of April 4, 
and then left once more for France. 
On the 8th he round his Battalion in the trenches at 
Hannescamps, and had his first introduction to trcnch lire. 
On May z his Company Commander went away for a time 
and he was left in charge. On the 3rd.the Battalion marched 
from Pommier through Halloy to 13eaumetz, for a period 
of training. A bad week fol/owed for White formwith 
characteristic self-criticism--he believcd that he was not 
being as competent as he might bave heen ; but he recovered 
confidence later. 
On Ma), I8 came the first news of thc coming attack, 



202 1V[. G. W. 

and on thc zznd thc Battalion movcdto Beaussart» fromwhich 
White went forward to reconnoitre the ground or direct 
working-parties. Captain Fraser returned on the 3 ist» and 
again took charge oi î the Company. The same work con- 
tinued ; Whitc was at Mail]y-Maillet onJune  . On the 
.znd they returncd to Beaussart for a test, and two days 
latcr the great bombardment began. On July I the Bat- 
talion went into action in front of Mailly-Maillet; WMte 
was hit in advance of his men; his servant, who had 
bllowed Mm in the attack, reached him, and asked if he 
was badly wounded. He said « I'm ail right; go on'. At 
that momcnt a shell burst near them. His servant remem- 
bers nothing more till the rime when he was in hospital. 
Though thcrc was doubt for a rime, it is now certain that 
White lost his lire in the explosion. 
These are letters written about him after his death :-- 

From an officer in his Battalion :-- 
 He is acutely missed throughout the Battalion» both as 
a friend and as an officer whose keenness and example 
make his loss a very grave one to the Regiment. 
' You will also be proud to hear that, two nights previous 
to the attack» he most gallantly conducted a party to 
search for a fcllow-officcr who had been caught in heavy 
machine-gun tire  the officer returned unhurt, but that does 
hOt render the act any less gallant." 
"From another fellow-officer, who, as a boy, had kaown him 
at Shrewsbury : 
I have never known such a real Christian. That was 
a fine letter  of his which West shewed me. Fancy Mal- 
cohn talking about being selfish. I doubt if he knew what 
selfishness meant. If he did, it was only the more fully to 
 His last letter fi'om France» page 357- 



M. G.W. o 

understand unselfishness. It was that and his utter sincerit¢ 
and genuineness which ruade him what he was. His ideal 
was always so high, and he was never faIling short of it. 
His ideas were just wonderful and in the six years that I 
have known him I have learnt more of what real religion 
means than anyhow else. He was never tired oftrying to 
put down all bitterness against the Germans and if he bas 
died he will bave done very much to justify in many people's 
eyes the idea_« which he started in lire." 

From a ffiend who was also an old Salopian :-- 
 One always felt that therc was about him some inde- 
finable quality» which he expressed perhaps most clearly in 
his music. \Vhen he was playing one of the more ethereal 
Bach fugues he seemed entirely in keeping with it and one 
realised that it was his natural mode of thought. And it 
was just this that seemed to give him an immense breadth 
of view for he lived in a region where small controversial 
things did hot seem to marrer. In everything that he talked 
or wrote about he expressed views which we instinctively 
knew were right and which were the conclusions we should 
have corne fo in our highest moments. Only he was always 
on a plane which we reached at too rare intervals. And yet 
he was hot in the least unsympatheti% for this height and 
breadth of view only mtde him the more able to compre- 
hend. 
 There sometimes appears to be a region» or state of 
thought» in which we are no longer troubled by questions 
of art and morality o ambition and honour» of personal 
adqictions and grievances. One felt that he never departed 
from this region but ruade one believe that fol" the rime one 
was his companion there. 
 I do hot think that any of lais fi'iends will ever forger

him, and one of them will always be entircly grateful that 
he was allowed to know such a Inan to whose inspiration 
he owes Inore than he can possibly say or realise.'

DIARY 

«llonday, Feb. 7- While on leave at Radlett, got a wire 
telling Inc to joill Expeditionary Force. This is very 
exciting. Rcturned to Sheerness in a hurry, packed, and 
got away again to London. 

Tuesda, Feb. 8. It was good to gct the departure over, 
though the excitement ofthe past forty-eight hours has been 
in a way good, and the goodness of fricnds is always such 
a proininent thing in crises of this kind ; thc wires from 
Graham and Arnold, and from Shrewsbury, and Edwards, 
and the coining of those people to see me off. l'In glad 
Father came, though I had often thought it would be better 
not to be seen oik[ It was great of him. 
Southainpton at 7.0. Innuinerable reportings and em- 
barkations, dark offices» jetties shining patches of water, 
railway lincs leading nowherc a great heartening dinner 
ait the S.W. Hotel.Everywhere kit and officers and a 
strange medlcy of the Iniraculous and the inevitable. Went 
on board the Havre boat at I.I, and gradually to sleep. 
The most wonderful day of In t, life. 

14"ednesday, Feb. 9" Boat started 7 a.m., and I went on 
deck at 8.o a.m. as we ran through Spithead with the sun 
rising behind a bank of sinoke and Inist which hid Ports- 
mouth and Hayling. Landed at Le Havre at  o'clock. 



M. G.W. February I916 2oç 
More reportings and eventual arrival at the Base Camp, 
where life has become more commonplace, and excitcment 
bas gone for a rime. Which Battalion will it be ? The 
znd seems probable from here, but hOt necessarily. 

Thursday, Feb. 10. Walkcd about ctmp ail morning. 
In the afternoen we all went down to Havre, and I shopped 
at the Ordnance Stores, dined at the Hôtel de Normandie, 
and got news by telephone there that I ara for the i st 
Battalion Depot at Rouen. Life has become dull herc, and 
l keep reminding myself that I ara on the way to the Front, 
that I ara in the saine countr), as the enemy, etc., etc. 

Fr]day, Fe/o I I. A rcpetition of yestcrday. More fat 
meals in Havre. Ordcrs to move to Rouen, +th Infantry 
Base Dcpot. 

Saturda, Feb. IZ. Rose at 4.30 and, standing upon my 
bed and wondering miserably how I should ever find and 
pack anything in the dark, I sang the Volga Boatman Song. 
The arrival of servants ver), late only made things more 
chaotic. After breakfast we set oit down to Harfleur 
Station, down long avenues of poplars which shuddered 
in the dark. Eventually got into a train and arrived at 
Rouen about , i o'clock, and went to report at the camp. 
Simpson left us to go straight up to the znd. It is good 
to see Rouen again. It fulfilled itself again according to 
my memory, more completely than I had expected. I went 
and looked again into the font at St. Ouen, and saw down 
in the water the reflection ofthe depths ofthe church ; and 
I smelt again the quais, and the street which leads up to, 
and frames at the other end, the lonely little church of 
St. Vincent. We lunched under the Grosse Horloge, and 
1 called at z 3 Avenue Mont Riboudet, but the Mords had 



206 M.G. 

removed. However, I went in and reminded myselfofthe 
dictées, and the dogs, and the discomforts which bind one 
more closely to a good rime past. 
In the evening we went to the Folies Bergères and saw 
a Revue and, what was better, had a fine picture of a 
French audience. For the lights suddenly went out, after 
the show had been going about twenty minutes, and for a 
rime the audience took possession of atMrs. It was either 
a Zeppelin alarm or the rchearsal of one. There was no 
sort ofpani% but a terrific hubbub ; shouts and suggestions 
came from the gallery, and the place was soon dimly lit by 
flickering candles, ticd to pillars or leaning dizzily over 
the edge of balconies. After about three-quarters of an 
bout, the band got candles, and played an overture to some 
light opera and 'God save the King'. Then the curtain 
went up, and the ' management" announced that they were 
going to continue the performance by candle-light. The 
leading lady appeared and stood over the footlights, arguing 
with the conductor and the audience as to the best positions 
for the candles ; and while she gesticulated and appeared 
to direct operations, various characters ofthe Revue appeared 
and dotted the front of the stage with candles, while the 
gallery shouted its approval and its advice---' Ça va tomber," 
etc., etc. Altogether an amazing scene. 

8unday, Feb. I. Discovered the Mords in a new and 
dclightful house terraced on the hill at the back of the town, 
with a wonderful look down on to the great churches. I was 
recognized by Isabellc, who opcned the door to me, and 
Madame gradually put the pieces of me together, like a 
kind of jig-saw in ber memory.. I stayed to tea. It was 
ail very good» this revisiting» and they were glad to see 
roc. I did hOt see Monsieur. But one rarcly did. The 



M. G.W. February 1916 2o7 
pcnsionnaires were an English Army Pay Officer, and 
three boys (French), one of them a diminutive violinist, 
very shy. I played on his diminutive violin the Allegro 
of the Leclair Sonata by request, Madame remembering it 
from 19o 9. 
A,londay, Feb. I+. On fatigue near the ship-yards down 
the Seine. Unhappy day, followed by a tempestuous night, 
when the men's tents blew down and the corrugated iron 
was blown about the huts, which rocked like ships. I 
wonder if I shall dislike the trenches much more than the 
base. 

l.Ved»esday, Fek. 16. Parade again. After being detailed 
by a smart Major on a horse, with rhin paper-manipulating 
fingers and a high voice, we are sent of to a lecture on 
sketching, in a shelter in the woods. Everything awfully 
efficient and terrifying till we get to the actual lecture, which 
I bave tried to write out as I remembered it. (The lecturer 
is a machine-gun officer and hOt a sketcher ; so the fault or 
the credit is the British Army's and hOt his.) 
Lecturer (voho dravols rather and i really a very amusing 
fellov:):«Have any of you got compasses? Only one 
compass among us ? That's serious. Well, l've got to 
make these few remarks about sketching, so I'd better get 
it offmy chest. Of course, myself, I think sketching's very 
important--relis you where you are, you know. You often 
have to relieve a trench and the other fllow's in such a 
deuce of a hurry to clear out, you don't really get a chance 
to find out anything from him, so a sketch is useful ifyou 
can get it.' 
(Interruption by smart Major, "who rides up and asks 
«what ,we're doing, and after having the very obvious defects 
of the shelter pointed out to him, rides off again.} Lecturer

continues:  Well, what was the train of thought ? Got a 
match ? Thanks--awful, these French matches, aren't they ? 
I say» we can't do much without compasses» but as I was 
saying, it's a data" good thing» a sketch, and every oflïcer 
ought to be able to do one. Of course we can't get much 
done this morning» as we haven't any compasses.' (Refer- 
ring to Major's recent vis#) ¢ I say, ought one to get up 
when he cornes round like that ? 1 never know. Oh ] have 
you seen these maps they use out here ? l'll pass "em 
round. I suppose you all know about this A 2 3 c i business 
they use for rctbrence ?" (Explai»s it rather reluctantl),.) 
' Of course we really ought to go and make a sketch, but 
it's hot much good without compasses. Now» there's a 
good sketch' (passing it round) ;  got all the things in it ; 
sort of lets you know where things are, you know. The 
great point is to keep it ncat ; hot slobbered over with 
mud and rain, and a lot of words written all over it. 
They like it» if you can make a good sketch .... I 
I think we'd better go out and do some sketching without 
the compasses. We must do something. It looks rather 
I say, it is raining. Well, I almost 
the meeting to general discussion, 
and borrow some compasses." (He 

' I say, wouldn't some one say a few words about some- 
thing for a few minutes ? I mean, the morning goes much 
quicker that way. We've got to be here till i OE.o. Well 
then, do you mind if I talk about Machine Guns for a bit ? 
I'm interested in them. Has anybody done a pukka course 
in the Lewis gun ?' (Hands go up. Lecturer talks to me

(Finally e all go home at I I 
Dined at Rouen at the Restaurant de la Cathédrale. 
I wonder if Stevenson meant ail he said about c great 
churches being my favourite kind of mountain scenery'. 
For it is astonishingly true. Rouen Cathedral has that 
saine breath-holding effect upon me as a big mountain has, 
when one cornes suddenly upon it round a corner, and 
looks up at the pinnacles which look so small and are really 
so big ; the saints in their niches Iike gendarmes, the grey 
towers by the lower Iights of the town at night like hinted 
snow-fields. The Cathedral, from the left bank of the 
river, looks over its foot-hills ofthe quais and other buildings 
just as Tryfaen peeps out over the Gogof, something 
farther away but bigger and more mysterious. 
Thursday Fe#. 17. Orders to go up to the 1st R.B. I called 
on Madame Morel before leaving Rouen at 5.3o, when 
Robertson and I (Kirkland and Billington are to corne later) 
boarded our train, a long string of wagons and trucks and 
carriages, which bumped slowly along in the dark and 
finally spent the night in a siding at Abbeville. 
Friday, Fe#. I$. We are there now and I suppose 
we shall hear the guns in a few hours. It is difficult to 
realise all this. We took a cart from the inn, and joined 
our Regiment. R was good to find oneself among Riflemen, 
and to find Russell-Smith. Best of all, to find letters 
from Father, Mary Arnold, and C. A.A. One feels here 
in the presence of something quietly efficient. 
,çaturday, Fe#. 19. R.-S. says the French are more 
patriotic than the English. I wonder if, Empire-building ' 



M. G.W. April 96 
nations are ever really patriotic. Pçrhaps we bave expended 
our patriotism oa imperialism. Puck af Paak's Hill and 
the Sussex enthusiasm of Kipling bave always been a surprise 
to me. Moved to A' Company, where people received 
one with the same silent and detached air of saying, ' This 
isn't much of a pienic. Take a chair and share our bore- 
dom. Carry on." I heard the guns for the first time. 
Rumours of the Man's Battalion coming here. That scems 
too incredible. Got many letters. 
.Monday, Fe. _. Parades. C.O. came over. It is true 
about the Man, and I went over to a viilage z Km. away 
and fbund him. I was awfully disappointed hOt to take 
him more by surprise. An officer gave me away by tellilg 
him there was an officer of st R.B., a Shrewsbury Master, 
waiting to see him. The whole incident is much more 
amazing than I can realise--that 's the worst of it. 
Friday, Fe. 2 5. Stayed in bed all day till tea-time. 
Fortunate enough to see a doctor. It is a desperate 
business being ill now. I ara lucky to be in Reserve ;

Tuesaray, .,Xlpril 4. Went to Shrewsbury to lunch. It was 
First Day ; otherwise I would not bave gone, for after my 
visit last November I have always felt that I mustn't 
go again till I have faced things at the Front. There are

Aprll 8. After a delightful slack day, in the evening I rode 
up with the Transport to Battalion H.O<_. I wonder if those 
bored Transport men and that bored Transport oflïcer knew 
how excited I was. Or the orderly who led me along a 
deep, star-roofed communication trench» did he know that 
that walk thrilled me as little else has done ?

always try to get in the last word and must all be talking

good man and makes me realise w',:at good men Christians

from him» ofwhich o,ze is conscious at his first appearance. 
Not many men could cry out ' A Happy Easter to you'» 
with meaning and without any impediment of self-con- 
sciousness or spinality. It makes one rather sad about the 
sliglt shyness with which we returncd his greetings» the shy- 
ness oflaymen towards the parson. At 6.30 this wonder-

a pipe and thinking of father and of many things.

room, in almost the onl)' two-storied house in Orville. 
A most courteous old lad), owned it, and she had at 
the back ofit a ver), neat kind ofgarden. The men bathed 
in the Authie. The people of out Mess billet were also 
ver), nice to us, and ruade us drink a large quantit), oftheir 
wooden cider when we arrived. 
Tuesday» .May z 3. At 6.o p.m. we started again» a further 
stage on the load towards the sound of the guns. It was 
dark most of the way, and as we got within ten toiles 
of the lines, the Ver), lights began to flicker a kind ofwel- 
corne at us. Arrived at an unlovable village, at about 
11.3o. The men's billets bad. When we came to find out 
Mess, we discovered a ver), angry high-screaming woma n, 
pushing out servants out of the door and depositing their 
rifles and tl;eir  sacs' after them. It appeared that the 
servants had come in and taken possession in rather a 
cavalier fashion. Indeed, the lad), brought in ber husband 
clad in pants and a shirt» and thus arra),ed he gave us 
a spirited imitation of the exact song and dance which the 
servants had done, his wit providing the music, l've 
never heard an), one so loud as that woman. I remarked 
that there were  des choses de plus mauvaises '.--Q.  QF_oi

We assured them that, as usual, there would be money for 
all this. At that the man ceased to dance, but thc woman 
is still shouting,

with a tennis-ball in the orchard at the back. 
In the afternoon Company Commanders went up to the 
trenches, to see the ground for work. 
Thursday, A4ay x. Went up to the ground for work again 
this morning, with Gracey and Fagan, a weary walk. At 
night the Company worked in those saine trenches from 
9.3o to t.3o in Fouring tain. Got back in an «uneasy 
dawn' at 3-o a.m., drenched and muddied. And whereas 
we officers could change and sleep in something like beds, 
the men had hot a dry stitch save their great-coats in which 
tolie on the floor of their barns, and I felt ashamed at this 
unavoidable injustice. With the amount of comfbrt that 
an oflïcer bas and must hav% itis easy to love the tiredness 
for sleep and the hunger for food that are so frequent in this 
kind of lire. 
Friday» May z6. Slept till late in the morning. In 
the afternoon rode up to the trenches again with Patterson, 
and reconnoitred the night's work. Had a fine night and 
worked fi-om 9.3o to 1.3o , and then watched tl-.e day- 
light come as we marched back along Watling Street 
(so says the map)--Watling Street which is here under- 
mined with trenches and sometimes swept by machine gu:s, 
which leads t?om the trenclaes to Radlett, and so to Church 
Stretton and \Venlock Edge. There was a bombardment 
of the trench in front (our riont line) from  I.O to I I. t % 
and we had to stop work. 
During this day there were many turns and much glorious

Thursday, )tune I. On an all-day working-party, digging 
cable trenches through the fiel&. 
After haversack lunch I lay in long cool grass and looked 
through tle dog-daisies and buttercups, and rernembered 
that it was June. 
We celebrated yesterday. Russell-Smith and Barnes

me round quite a decent fiddle, which I played for 
some time.

also Neale--they were encarnped in a place like Sidbury 
Hill, with a rolling chalk plain all about.

with forty men on Dog Trench a grass-grown ruin of a

Friday» )tune 9" Again wet, but a dry night for work» and 
we deepened Dog undisturbed, though at rimes I thought 
the enemy must see us on so clear a night. They did see 
a party of C Company» and shelled with about ten 
whizz-bangs rapid. But no casualties. We are told that 
the enemy have put up a notice in front of their trenches, 
saying,  We know you are going to attack here. Eut you

2londay» )tune  z, to Friday, )tune  6. Working every night 
on assembly trenches. The first three nights tain poured, 
and the trenches were in such a state as to make movement 
very slow. 
The number of troops on the SERRE ROAD (Watling 
Street) at night is very great, and the chaos at trench junc- 
tions, when parties are returning at .o a.m. and converge 
on each other, is almost/udicrous. 
Traction engines corne through in the night, dragging 
huge guns and howitzers. Everywhere we see men strug- 
gling with boards, hurdles, and all kinds of building 
materials. 
Thursday, )ttme ! 7- After tea we went down the road, and 
saw a battery of I z-in. howitzers, put in position during the 
short hours of darkness last nightmalso their shells ! 
At night we continued on assembly trenches, camou- 
flaging all the work as before, and grassing over all the earth. 
Friday, )tune  6. The weather has cleared again., which is 
good, though it ruade the night very clear for work, and 
the Bosche drove us to ground with ' that' machine gun 
several times. But I don't think he has seen our work yet.

I am rather liking this lire ; at ieast I hate some of it so 
much that the good parts are glorious, which is the true 
kind of enjoyment. I hate starting out at night, with the 
possibility of casualties and of parties going astray up wrong 
trenches. But itis grand getting back in the dawn, and 
sitting down noisily to a sort of meal and a pipe belote 
going to bed. Fraser bas gone on leave. 
2rlonday )Curie 19. After my working-party went home at 
z.o, I waited for daylight to shew the N.C.O.'s of the

trooped home in the sunrise at ç.o o'clock, and Fagan and 
I had a very wonderful sort of breakfast.

for a few days' test. Camp, instead of out old billets  and 
the lady, in wkose bouse we wcre to mess, drove us from 
the place with hard force oflogic and much shouting. \Ve 
failed to find a place till, at 8.0 in the evening, we borrowed 
a table and chairs from the Town Major's office, and put 
them in a disused house. 
In the evening the Colonel talked to the 13attalion. 
There was a wonderful sky in the north-west as I lay 
down in my valise, and I watched it under the flap of the 
tent, and I thought of many things that were under it. 
Country railway-stations, porters, and four-wheeled cabs 
came into the picture. A strange picture--but there is 
much of England in those things. And I thought of fields 
with hedges (the Man made me do that sorne weeks ago) 
and of blue hills, and of ail those dear people and things

under that sky. Fraser returned while I was looking at 
these things. 
Friday» yune.. We had a before-going-into-action parade 
Service» which Laurie conducted. It was very impressive ; 
so was his short sermonmall of it almost too impressive» 
and I was mo»t awfully moved by it all. 
The guns are getting more active. In the afternoon Fraser» 
Fagan» and I rode over to Bertrancourt to see a raised relief 
model of the Divisional attack area. 
While we were waiting to start» a most terrific thunder-

The Sucrerie and the tronches beyond are now a new 
world» no longer the scene of humdrum working-parties 
drawing tools and looking forward to breakfast on return» 
but a region transformed by the beginning of the Great 
Battle. It began this morning early» quite unobtrusively» 
but very steady and continuous. 
There is not much noise here» as none ofthe batteries are 
within half a toile» and the Bosche shells are bursting over

The bombardment k.as become more noisy. This after- 
noon three of the German observation balloons have been 
blown up. I should have seen one ofthem go but when a 
Rifleman told me about it all I saw was a straight column of 
smoke. Hell is really let loose to-night. I have been out 
to the east edge of the villag% and Iooked over the fields at 
the murky horizon where the bursts of shell go flicker 
flacker. It is clear that their gun power is nothing to ours 
now. And knots of foul-mouthed men stand about men 
who have sat cowering and incapable of retaliation in the 
early days of Ypres and now exult over the merciless 
hurricane that is raging over tke Bosche lines. Ocers 
stand about in their calm way and comment on the play 
and a little white terrier brushes its way among the cor% 
which ma), and ma), not be reaped. 
Amid this pandemonium it is surprising to see and hear 
the ordinary circumstance oftrench warfare. Occasionally 
a Very light goes up scornful and inquiring and that' 
machine gun gets in a word or two between the bursts. 
And I have also been out along the lane to the west side 
of the village past the wild roses and the dog-daisies and 
looked across the spiky fringe of a battalion of corn at a 
quiet sunset with violet clouds that looked Iike comfortable 
mountains and watched a hedgehog trying to heave its way 
through the undergrowth. 

_Monday, .ïeune z6. The Divisional General addressed 
the Battalion in the morning. In the afternoon I went up 
to the SraCRERt to reconnoitre a communication trench for 
carrying parties. I had a good view of the German lines 
round Bv, aUMOhrT-HaMEL» and the fountains of earth and 
smoke and ruin which spouted there.

Must stop. This is all very exciting. I wonder how I

Thank ),ou ever so nauch for your letter, which I found 
with delight on arrival here last evening» after twenty-four 
hours" journey from Rouen--not that I ana really so far frona 
Rouen as ail that, but that the train sat in a siding naost of 
the night. I have been nearly a fortnight in France now. 
I ana glad thit naost of the delay was at Rouen» which it 
was ver), good to revisit. I really think it is one of the 
cities ofthe world. Another Special Reservist and I arrived 
here in a farna cart, for all the world like two émigrés 
naaking their escape--the Transport oflïcers between them 
having arranged that we should get out one station too far 
up the line. 
It was really rather funny, our arrival yesterday. I kept 
leaning out ofthe carriage window as the traita crept along, 
very excited to hear the first gun, and wondering ifI should

be under shell tire in a few hours, etc. etc. ; and then, two 
hours later, I was hiring a cab to take me to my Regirnent, 
where on arrival I was shewn rny way to a real bed-room 
and then began a four-course dinner with oysters. There's 
a srnall chance of out being out ofthe line for three rnonths. 
That would be awful, to corne out to the Front and never 
see a trench for three months. 
I haven't heard fi'orn SouthweI1 since 1 got out. I'rn 
atraid I shall not run up against hirn here. I can't rernern-

It is brought home to me that my last communiqué was 
from Southampton. Now Southampton is a place, a very 
distinct place. Situated at the head of two gares to the 
English Channel, and having two rides a day (see the 
Venerable Bede on the history of the Englisb Church), it 
possesses a marine traflïc second only to that of London, 
Liverpool, Glasgow» and many others. But since then I 
have seen other cities, Havre, Rouen, , ,  
and . Do you know Rouen ? Very well, we will see 
it before we wa]k through Shropshire. Rouen possesses 
everythingmwonderfu] churches, a fine river, good and 
imaginative smells (not unconnected with the river), good 
restaurants,-but also a Base camp for which I was glad

ço leave Rouen. I once learnt French at Rouen» and it 
was good to revisit the people with whorn I stayed. 
l've been with the Battalion a week now. We are out 
of the line for a month's test» wlfich will be over before 
very long. Rather lucky for me that I did hot go up to 
the trenches straight away» as I got a chill which has 
developed into modified bronchitis ; a distinct bore» as it 
is awfttlly dicult to get rid of in damp billets and bad 
weather. I'm only hoping I shall be really fit to go into 
the trenches. I have a horror of getting into hospital 
before l've seen the Huns. 
The really notable fact is that I have met Southwell» 
which was an event. 
Rather jolly hill country this» and the villages have 
that French villages stould b.ave ; a Maire» a town crier» 
large hcaps of steaming straw» pigeons» and a grey church 
in a commanding po»ition. Te people of my billet are

heard yesterday2 It is so hard to realise it out here. 
shall hOt realise it indeed, I think» until and unless I return 
to Mere Cottage and find him gone. He has always been 
such a big living fact in out little lires. There never was 
a Father in the world before as good and as generous. His 
happiness consisted chiefly in the happiness of us, as it was

with Mother. And now it is good to tlink of tlaose two 
dear souls continuing a greater life in the saine path. I 
can't help thinking of Dr. Spicer's remark to ïou and me ; 
« We think he is a wonderful man.' That was just one of 
the little reminders of the wonderful attractiveness of his 
charact«r, which influenced people so very quicklï. And 
now, according to G.'s and A.'s letters we are hearing of 
that from the many, many hosts of pople who loved him 
and admired lais goodness. 

To H. E. E. Howsolg. 1st R.B.MB.E.F. 
larch 4, 1916. 
The chief thing about this crisis for me has been the 
impossibility of realising out here what has happened and 
a feeling of being cut off from the rest of my famiIy by this 
inaccessibilitï and the lack of any kind of lamiliar sur- 
roundings. I date say you won't quite understand me when 
I say this. I don't understand it myself. The last two 
days I seem to bave been living in a kind of coma. 
I am ver)' glad you got to know my father that jolly week 
last winter at Mere Cottage» and to like him. All did 
whoever came across him. He had quite a wonderful 
attractiveness for people who sometimes F.ad only known 
him for a few hours even. 
He had a very happy lire, really ; full of poetryMin the 
sense I mtan, that he loved and taugl-.t me to love, such 
a lot of those things which you and I agree to be good ; 
mountains and mountain streams clouds west winds good 
manners and gentleness to humble country people» and 
good books. In nearly all my Alpine'  moments, he was

I have been living quite a normal kind of existence with 
parades, and buttered eggs, and tooth-paste, and all the 
usual products of civilis.tion, including a real good 8ritish 
influenza cold ; the sort I used to have in IV. i aut this

my retaper was a little higher than the normal, and my 
arrivals in Ist Lesson a little later than the normal, and 
the dust off the blackboard very objectionablequite an 
unpleasant experience, which I should be very glad tobe 
going through now. 
We are bi]leted in a village in some hilly country, which 
is chiefly remarkable for the public way in which they kill 
their pigsat the cross-roads, ifyou plcase, for 1 the world

But, dearest Mary, your ]etter is full of hope, and quite 
rightly. Remember that he almost approached old age with- 
out ever being old, and was his lively and devoted self right 
up to the end. It is good that a good man's life should be 
]ikc that, even though it ends sooner than we could have 
expected. Since the War, I bave begun to feel more of 
death as being only a door into some greater lire, and 
familiarity with death makes one feel very close to those 
who have died. 
I had always thc regretful feding that I did nothing 
for him, and he did everything for me. 

To MRS. WHITFIELD. Oxto». 
dlarch I, 1916. 
I ara so very grateful for your very kind letter. It was 
very good of you to write. Yes, I feel with you and with 
Jack that all our losses in the last eighteen months bave 
given us a dit{erent view of death; and though I cannot 
regard it as anything less of a calamity, yet it is easier, 
through familiarity with it, to view it against a happier 
background and in a truer perspective. 
My father was only ill for a short rime, and death found 
him as we shall always be glad to remember him, lively 
and full oF good work and active generosity.

the sun and violets and cowslips are grand, l've just been 
watching two huge guns doing this in an orchard close by :-- 
 Whish ', a«dible for IO secs. 
I'm going up to the trenches to-night. It's a lovely 
day  altogether, liçe isn't too b.d. 
We've had a fine Band playing Carmen and TipFerary and 
Yeomen of the Guard, and  all t|ose bcautiful things', in 
front of the church. The guns, going off zoo yards away 
during the music, suggested a School Sports' Day. We 
are hOt very far from the place where we were when the 
Battalion was in test. I should like again to emphasise 
the scrumptiousness of the day.

I tried to find time to send you a line yesterday belote 
coming up» but no. I want to tell you about three things. 
(I) A walk» IZ to I a.m., on a dark night, when the +th 
Division lorry, having brought me up from the rail-head, set 
me down at a village and said,  There ; now find your 
Battalion'. WelI, my Battalion was in the trenches as a 
marrer of fact; but I was advised to find the ISt Line 



z34 M.G.W. April 9d 
Transport. So .[ walked several toiles over a high» wind- 
swept plateau» and while I walked I discovered the \Var. 
For the ground sloped away on the left» ad tae sky was 
being always lit up by star-shells» and the machine guns 
and rifles and guns went 'tat tat tat' and ' bang' and 
' boom' respectively» at two toiles away. l've told you 
about that walk because I think you will understand, There 
was also, with it ali» the uncertaizty of my finding any one 
o'- any bed that night ; but after rousing the watch-dogs 
and the sentries at the village oF , I woke the Trans- 
port officer, who put me to bed. 
(z) I then want to teIi you about the spring day we had 
yesterday, at the Transport place two mlles back ; and how 
at the saine tire% within a radius of zec yards, a Band and 
a 9.z battery played together to an audience of Tommies 
v«ith bow legs leading horses, fluttering pigeons and an 
austere grey churcla steeple» and me. Then, in the evening» 
t!-e Transport officer and I rode up to Battalion Head- 
quarters (dug-outs all along a rond, like low shops in a 
mediaeval town), and an orderly led me out along a lane 
and a communicxtion trench» under a wonderful sky of 
stars, to the dug-out where I now ara. 
(3) Just before lunch» the Huns shel!ed this trench with 
rive or six rounds, getting a direct hit with one of them and 
filling up a bit of trench temporarily. They sounded as if 
they were coming straight for my dug-out» and I was afraid 
where no fear was. What a wonderful way of putting it. 
Great man, the Psalms. 
It is very hard to believe in the seriousness of all this 
banging» especially on a gorgeous day like this. One is 
sort of mesmerised into accepting it as a kind of game.

After writing to you yesterday, I started out on a nice 
pony and a beautiful evening, and reached Battalion H.Q« 
dug-outs at 7.30, and then was guided on my first walk to 
the trenches--a very thrilling walk down a long and decp 
communication trench under a roof of brilliant stars. In 
ten minutes I reached the Company H.Qc. dug-out , where 
Ï had a cheerful reception from theother officers, who were 
conveniently at dinner. 
To-day has been another lovely day--larks singing and 
magpies lolloping about over the lines. 
The trenches are nothing like what 1 expected. Shells 
etc. fly about over us at all angles, on out own and the 
Germans'. 
A wonderful dawn and sunrise this morning. Could you 
send me some mustard and cress seeds, and any other 
seeds (flowers or a vegetable due to grow quickly) which 
you might think suitable ? Very little ; just enough to make 
a joke with in the communication trench.

ing experiences. I ara enjoying life very much (as I write 
now, one of our aeroplanes is right overhead, pursued by 
little white halls of shrapnela wonderful sight in a bluc 
sky like to-day's). Yesterday we were shelled with about 
six rounds by a howitzer, two of which fell near H.Q. dug- 
out and filled up the trench for a time. Ï was quite

frightened by them, as one could hear them commg for 
some time ahead. 
I do wish I could express my whole psi'chological attitude 
to all this--some day I shall tri,. At present I feel it's 
beyond the powers of psychology and literature--the 
apparent harmlessness of all this banging and whizzing in 
such fine weather, making the whole thing seem like a 
game which one has been prevailed upon to play out of 
mere compliance with the established order of things ; the 
growing familiarity with the various frequent noises, like 
the two German machine guns which join in like geese 
raising an alarm, when an aeroplane is flying low; the 
diffCent btteries, and all the sounds to which one assumes 
a kind ofpersonal attitude and well understands why the 
armies have given names to thcm like  Archibald ', etc.

It is such a strange sensation, waking after two hours' 
sleep, during which one has forgotten all about the snapping 
of rifles and flares and chattering of machine guns, to final 
that one is at the Front, and to stagger chill and sleepy 
out of one's dug-out into the middle of it again. Then it 
is so strange, also, that after Stand-to-arms an hour belote 
daylight, we breakfast at daylight (ç.]c or 6.), and go to 
bed afterwards. Waking up belote lunch is so odd. One 
has quite forgotten which meal one had last. I was called 
the other day with the words : « Lunch is ready, Sir.'

Our Chaplain is certainly a fine man. Afterwards with

I suppose you bave your copy of 'V.B'? I bave two

I bave given it quite a vulgar putT among booksellers, and 
I ara supposing that it occupies a large position in a 
Trinity Street 13ook Shop window at Cambridge. Have 
you got a Press-cutting agency to send you all notices and 
reviews of it ? (' The practical man'--yes ; but you ought 
to, really, oughtn't you?) Any one will find you a news-

of ' The weather bas thrown off its weeds "--it's ver),

I came up to the trenches ton days ago, alone. \Ve've 
had a few days in billets, and we go up again to-night. I 
expect I shall discover the real nature of War before long. 
Do you know, Man, I bave a kind of loyalty to the New 
House, through all this, which I believe could become 
positively offensive, if provoked. 
XVith regard to the Press-cutting agency, I intended to 
remark that ' London must be full of them by all accounts ; 
you bave only got to walk along the street till you see a red 
lamp ', or something like it.

I'm afraid this isn't really a ' Shell" letter, because so far 
I haven't had one nearer than 7 ° yards. However, betbre 
I give you any news, I will describe the various shells and 
my attitude to them :-- 
() The ' Whizz-bang'; which cornes from a field-gun, 
dose up to the enemy's front line, and is generally 
shrapnel. This bursts almost before you know it is 
coming, so that there is no rime to feel frightened, and one 
says, ' Hallo (hello, halloah, halo, etc. [there are various 
ways of spelling this]), that was a shell ' 
(z) Out own ; which one hears whistling through the air 
all the way, from the report of the gun to the explosion 
near the enemy's lines. One knows roughly wEere they 
are, and there is nothing to excite more than a mi!d 
interest. 
(7) The enemy's big-gun and howitzer shells. These, 
especially the latter, can be heard whistling for some rime, 
and one can tell if they are coming in one's direction or 
hot. These have afected me unpleasantly ; a series of 
them came over, and one hit out trench one da),. It was 
not very a!arming, because 1 was in bed in my dug-out at 
the rime. Still, I did just feel as I heard them coming 
that it rnigbt be serious, and felt like saying, ' For goodness" 
sake burst, and tell me where you are ' 
Now that, I imagine, is the real shell feeling, which is 
accentuated in the case of a real bombardment, which I 
bave not experienced.

To J. O. WHITFIELD. Ist R.B. 
wlpril zS, I96. 
The avcrage letter expressing sympathy is always kind, 
but often so conventional. I, who have written such, know 
that only too well. Yours was ont of those which I have 
read and re-read. Your views on death, I ara sure, are the 
right ones, whatcver the diculty in fitting tl:em in with 
the apparent irnportance oflife. An incidtnt in the lire 
ofthe soul'--that is very good, and really enabies one to 
combine the importance of life with the comparative un- 
importance of death. I date say you feel the importance 
oflife much less than I do. I often wish that I regaldcd it as 
nothing. It would make it so much easier to face death. 
Still your phrase, ' Incident in the life of the soul ', allows 
one to keep a philosophy which values life and laughs at 
death with equal sincerity. 
So far, the horrors of war for me bave been chiefly the 
wetness, coldness, and mud of tlae trenches. Tl;e/3osches 
are over r,ooo yards away from the 8oo yards of front held 
by out Company, and the shelling bas not been very 
serious» and amid much beastly weather there have been 
sunny days, when the singing of many larks, and the 
whistling of shells and cracking of rifles and chattering or 
machine guns, have seemed, ail of them, to be elements in 
a gaine which might become dangerous, if allowed to go 
too far. 
I do hot suppose things will always be as mild as that. 
And indeed, from  personal point of view» I hope they 
won't. I want to go through the worst of it, though I 
don't look forward to it, and ara still in great doubt as to 
what I shall be like. 
Meanwhile I ara enjoying this life much more than I 
expected.

I bave been very busy lately, in temporary cornmand or 
my Company, and always shadowed by the knowledge that, 
if I did a thing well, it would be taken for granted, and if 
I did anything wrong, or if anybody in my Company did 
anything wrong (which is the saine thing), I should most 
certainly be blamed. Ail this, at a rime when this country 
bas been almost as beautitïul as England, gave me much 
sympathy with the Scout in Punch» who was sent out to 
find the enemy, and returned breathless, saying ' The lilacs 
are out'. As indeed they are. 
I never know what to tlfink about democracy, except 
that it seems to me the most ideal kind of government, 
and the only really justifiable one. It is the only system 
which does ultimately and theoretically lead to freedom. 
I always feel that it is a system which bas never gone 
right yet, but which it is a duty to make to go right. 
It produces bad results, but it bas got to be ruade to 
produce good results, simply because in the world of 



lXl. G.W. l,lay 1916 247 
idea, and hOt in the world of iCact, it is the right systern. 
I do agree with you rnost heartily as to the hopelessness 
of dernocracy without education. It is terribly unfortu- 
nate that the hour-hand of Power should be so far ahead 
of the minute-hand of Education. But I don't think 
we can help that» except by putting forward the minute- 
hand of Education. And, by the way, it is comforting to 
rernernber tha% with rnost clocks, the minute-hand also 
works the hour-hand. At present we seern to be letting 
Education surfer by the War equally with other things. 
The saying that  We don't care about Education in England ' 
seerns to be quite true. 
But ail this does not prove the badness of democracy as 
an ideal ; it only proves its irnpracticability. And I think 
the answer to that is that we rnust rnake dernocracy  work ' 
because it is the right ideal. If democracy without educa- 
tion is hopeless, then we rnust educate, hot give up 
dernocracy. There is no ideal in the world that has 
 worked ' yet. Christianity is still only an ideal, because 
we don't believe in it enough to rnake it a fact. Justice 
and honesty don't really pay', because there are hot 
enough people who practise thern. There is very little 
idealisrn in the world so far. So far» the only thing which 
really produces idealisrn is, unfortunately» war, and the thing 
called patriotisrn. When a war breaks out» thousands of 
leisured young rnen, who have hitherto thought of little but 
of how to enjoy themselves, who have hitherto turned their 
backs on all that was unpleasant and all that provoked 
thought, suddenly discover that, though it was not  up to 
thern' to lire for their country in peace rime, yet it is 
absolutely their duty to die for it in war rime, and fling 
away their lives with heroisrn. It is» apparently, easier to 
fight for one's country than to devote one's leisure to 



248 M.G.W. May 1916 
social prob!ems. That is to me the most amazing 
thing. 
So far» with ail our civilisation we have not yet dis- 
covered an), other wa)' of expressing out idealism than 
war. Even the poets who ought to know better haven't 
got much farther. Wordsworth sa),s: «How ennobling 
thoughts depart When men change swords for Iedgers'; 
and Rupert Brooke, in his 19 I+ sonnets, seemed to welcome 
the \rar as a reIease from materialism. The arts are 
inspired b)' war, and in the pulpit it is able to be reconciled 
with Christianity» because of the great unselfish non- 
utilitarian virtues which it produces. But when the world 
is reall), democratic, perhaps peace will inspire us in the 
saine way. 
What a tt'rriL'le lecture this is that I am delivering. I 
hope you will forgive it. I always think that when a soldier 
talks politics, it is a ver)' terrible thing. And when the 
soldier is also a schoolmaster ! But this is my share in the 
very interesting conversation ),ou started ; and my interest 
in the subject mus.t be my apology. 
We are not actuall I, in the trenches at present, but we 
make frequent tedious visits to them to work b t, da), and 
night and return to a village and listen to the guns from 
a respectful distance. It is hot so lovel), a place as some 
that 1 have lately seen, and the inhabitants rather hate us. 
In fact» the lad), of this louse wanted to turn us awa), 
the first night we arrived, very late after a long march. 
The good woman still brings us absurd little complaints 
daily, and m), servant, generally the culprit, stands gravely 
to attention in the doorway» while she delivers them. AI1 
of which pleases me hugely» because it reminds me that 
the English are not the onl), selfish people.

I suppose that those wild roses will be apt to be coming

bave been blue-bells in Lyth Wood.

To C. A. AL1NGTON.  tuze OE7, 9 6" 
I have had a good deal of news ofthe best of places lately. 
Good news of that glorious Malvern Match, of the Corps 
Inspection, but also of Leslie Woodroft-e's x death. I could 
never bave thought that they would senti him out again. 
He was so very much a part ofthe place, and is still. Do 
you think that w¢ all continue to bave out part in the place 
after death, even when hot remembered ? I ara very jealous 
of mine ; and though I know such an article of faith is 
called animism or some such horrible naine, t, et I cling to 
the idea of becoming, after death, more completely a part of 
Shrewsbury than when I was an unworthy, active member 
ofthe community ; hot by what l've done there, but by how 
much I bave loved it. 
Itis inevitable, just at present, that we should tlfink such 
things, and impossible, at present, for me to express them 
legibly or intelligibly. I expect Leslie Woodroffe thought 
something of the saine sort, but I expect also that he met 
death easily ; for I think he trained himself to self-sacrifice. 
Oh! I meant to say that there are rive officers in this

CHAPTER VIII 

E. H. L. S. 

JtlLV TO SEPTEMBER 1916 

THOUGH he had bcen anxious about Whitc for ten days, it 
was hot till July t 3 that Southwell hcard thc ncws that he 
was missing. For anothcr çortnight he was in the saine 
part of the linc as beforc, and then, on the OETth, the 
Battalion leçt Sombrin, and was at test behind the line 
at the beginning of August. For thc last thrce weeks of 
thc month they cntered t the land oç the Push', and were 
engaged in holding on to captured trcnches, though they 
took no part in any organised attack. On Scptember t 
Southwell spcaks oç the Battalion as back at test hot £ar 
from Abbevillc ; and during this period he was ruade 
«O.C. Entertainments', and organised football £or the 
His Company Commander was -way on leave, but re- 
turned on Septembcr o. On the xth the Battalion 
returned to the line, and took part in a big attack. South- 
well was far in advance of lais men, when a sniper hit him, 
near Delville Wood. He was killed instantaneously. 
These are lettcrs written about him. 
From onc who kncw him intimatcly throughout his 
lire : 
« His « philosophy of lire" was very real, and profound 
in its depth. It was characteristically empirical, and hot 



26o E.H.L.S. 

traditional» iii its metkod. He worked it out for himself. 
Never would he move a step farther than he could se% in 
his search after truth. It was always, I believe, theistic. 
Long betbre the end it became definitely and deliberately 
Christian. 13oth the Chaplains at the Front wrote to say 
he never missed a Church Parade or Celebration of Holy 
Communion» unless his military duties made lais presence 
impossible. One of the Chaplains adds that he did this 
largely for the sake of others» and hot merely for his own 
sake. The same Chaplain states that it was by his influence 
that his servant was brought to Confirmation.  VVhatever 
were the fundamental principles of his philosophy of lif% 
one thing is certain i he had caught, as if by intuition 
visions which «we are striving all 6ur life to find". 
« His love of Nature was pathetic in its intensity. It 
was God's world to him. Xghenever he went to a new 
district, he used to explore the locality and « interpret" it 
in relation (by way of comparison or contrast) to familiar 
places at home. He drank it all i11 with his whole soul as 
a Revelation of life. 
 Akin to his love of Nature was lais devotion to 
two tbrms of art, music and architecture: with regard to 
the latter, lais description of any new billet was always by 
reference to « the most wonderful Cathedral in France'" 
or « tke picturesque little village Church "" This form of 
art» like that of music» seemed to be part of lais religious 
lift. 
 His unttinching devotion to dut), was another marked 
feature of his character. Wl:en once he had made up 
his mind what it was his duty to d% he did it at what- 
ever cost to himself as vell as to others. It was often 
obvious that» if any such decision hurt others, it hurt him 
much more. 



E. H. L. S. 

 His dcvotion to othcrs was possibiy thc most marked 
trait in his lire. He loved thcm (albcit with a disciminat- 
ing love) as lais own soul» and was delighted» in lais simple- 
minded way when hc saw their hearts' response to his 
appeal. 
« Finally» thcre was his exquisite simplicity. Ho 
rcmained « a child" in temper and spirit to the very end. 
Of him it could be truly said» " Behold an Israelite indeed 
in whom is no grille ".' 

From an oflicer of his Company :q 
'While lac was with us, ho was always chcerfifl, and a 
great factor in the happiness of the Battalion. As well, he 
was a very efficient office,', and shewed great kecnness. I 
really think that he liked soldicring ; at any rate, I know he 
was very happy while he was with us." 

From another fellow-oflïcer :-- 
' I have been in your son's Company since he took over 
the Company in thc beginning of the year, and of course 
I knew him well in thc earlier days after the -_th of 
Scptember. We all loved him, officcrs and men, and he 
was entirely tmselfish. The Company» under his command, 
ran srnoothly, and he took an immense amount of trouble 
over it. The first experience we had of this push, though 
hot so disastrous from the casualty point of view, was fiar 
more unpleasant, and all througl he was lnagnificent. If 
he knew what fear was, he never shewcd it. I have already 
said that everybody loved himthe mcn would bave gone 
anywhere with him. He was lcading them with his usual 
calmncss to the end. I cannot tell you how great the loss 
is to us the few of us who arc left. Those of us who have 
been through many things, pleasant and unpleasant, will 
ncvcr forget him." 



-_6z E.H.L.S. 

From a Tutor of Magdalen :-- 
 I can hardly bear to write ; yet, in a sense, I have bcen 
expecting the news. Do you remember the da),, long ago 
as it seems, when Magdalen lost the Headship, and the 
crew came back to the barge spiritless and cowed--all but 
lac ! Ever since I knew that he had gone out, l have felt that 
the gallant spirit which refused to accept defeat on the river 
would carry him fearlessly through this greatcr struggle, but 
only too likely to the death that I sometimes fancied he wouId 
almost bave desired--the death most worthy of him. 
' Nothing, I think, in all my life as a teacher, has given 
me greater pleasure tban to hear from A]ington, as I often 
did, of the great work he was doing at Shrewsbury. Only 
a few weeks ago he was telling me about it. But 1 know 
also, from what he said and part]y from a ]ctter he shewed 
me, that in the trenches be had tbund himself as perhaps 
le never had before. 
 I think w« must not grieve for him. It was a great life, 
full of force and vigour and enjoyment, nobly laid down ; 
and tl:e memory ofit will romain with some of us to the ]ast. 
« I should not be surprised to know that these last months 
were to him the happiest of all. But there will be many 
sore hearts to-day among Magdalen men, and for myself I 
feel that a light bas gone out of my lire.'

To R. F. BaILE. 

Thank you very much for what it is only truc to call your 
dear lctter. The little message flore the Man» as well as 
some hints of my own» will shew you I knew the possibility 
of such ncws was always t'.ere--but does that help ? Keep 
his letter Phiz» after you and the Man bave read and re-read 
the last lines. It bclongs to the New Housc surely and I 
might lose it from my luggagc. The allusions to a letter 
of mine I can explain later» if necessary ; they refkr to an 
expression of points of view about Summer and War (I 
think) whose only intcrest can bc that the Man seems to 
have agreed with them- but his approval seems» somehow, 
to make them bclong to you as wcll ; and ont day I shall 
fecl as though disloyal» if I don't repcat them.

one writes letters to peoplc who havc lost their sons shall

And (you will tbrgive me for talking so cntirely about my

me, thank God)surely never more than now I sl:ould feel 
that ; yet I an not man enough. Nor» I think ara I making

that, while I could write to other bereaved peopl% 1 was this

either: certainly it must be iXro! (And yet,...) Then, 
I think, I rebounded from that, and thought of many brave 
men, and said I must be stout-hearted :  The Man is dead :

at my loncly sdf for a fool : for that's ail out of a ook, and 
I don't truly feel it. I did think» howcvcr of just trying to

And that, surely, is ½ pages too much, all about my

think, either you or the Man, that I haven't had you in my 
mind every moment. That is a great saying of out Man's 
in the Ictter he sent me ; vcry typical, because he had such 
an enormous influence on the New House always, dating 
flore old Broadlands days, and, of ail that, he writes as onc 
quite unaware ! I doubt whcther any man was loved quite 
in the saine sort of way as ours, or had such a colossal eèct, 
with so entire an absence of claiming it, on the peoplc ho 
livcd with. That is why I find it so hard to send you and 
thc Man the sort of symp:thy I would give years of my lift 
to send: as well argue with the church over tl«e way that, 
whatever its foundation may now loo like (!), it is really 
doing very well. 
I will try and write again, and to the Man" tbrgive this 
lamest of letters (from ' trenches ' theoretically, but--for a 
bitreserve Company ; so wc have more chances ofwriting 
and more facilities in many ways), which I fear leads 
nowhere, but just stumbks aout. Tell the Man and your- 
self that I love you vcry dearly : it is quite true, Godnows : 
I cannot sec anything else worth saying : but that, 1 believe, 
is ; and I think our Man would bave wishd it : and I think 
he knows I ara hot lying!

Ronnie, it is vcry terrible ; more s% I think, than ycster-

it is a kind of effort» so it lives ; cst;ecially when onc is hOt

at least a general outline, without names, should hOt be 
given of what to me has been the most incredibly beautififl 
and thrilling thing I have ever seen on earth. 
We are hOt in the line as I write. I ara sitting on an 
inverted biscuit tin (my bath !), and what I see looks rather 
like the Great Orme's Head on a crowded day. Ah, it is 
wonderfifl, wonderful ; everything that one had dreamed of.

thing I ste and .hear (if you understand), and highly fit 
and happy. 

To MRs. RF.ID. B.E.F. 
../lltg. I Ji.  1916. 
This littlc linc I hae meant to write for a very long 
timc, and now that Capt. Wihner has your address to 
givc m% as I have just found I will write at once ; only 
saying that neither that nor any other cxcuse (such as our 
occupations fol instancc) is really any rcason, I fear, for 
my delay. 
Schoolmasters are nanow-minded crcatures, I ana told 
(be wasn't !) and this» perhaps» explains the kind of 
jcalousy which makes me sometirnes fecl that »0»e can 
miss Malcohn morc than I do- somctimes I am good 
enough to make a generous cxception in favour of his 
family and of the New Hous% but hot always even 
of them. It is absurd» of cours% for do I hot know 
perfectly well how enormously (morc than any man I ever 
knew; it is not, obviously true of everybody, however 
much it eught to be) he loved his aih folk" and his home, 
and was constantly talking of you all ? This and that he 
would mean to do when he got homc for the holidays» just 
as he used to wl.en he was a èoy : it was good to hear him. 
Ycs I do know rcally how sad a blow it must be to you ail. 
Ah but I have seen his lettcr written just before the 
advance» and it is wonderfifl is it hot ? I have good reason 
to know of one friend of his, who walked over some lately 
German trenches; with what thought, I leave you to imagine. 
I do not know, myself, whcre he fell ; but it is no idle say- 
ing as I may Ferhaps explain later, if I ttll you how surcly 
every tree, and village, and trench speak of him and his 



E. H. L.S. August 1916 279 
achievement to me» as I pass by .... A most wonderful 
letter» surely and so typical of him: it is, indeed» an 
inspiration to any soldier that reads it. But more im- 
portant than all is the great Fact that he was petfectly 
happy about it allmand "wl, oever could imagine he would be 
otherwise ?and that for him tl:ere is nothing bt, t a frenzy 
of congratulatio% even of envy» though for us therc's 
always the almost intolerable blank. I can say that» now : 
I could hot feel it a month ag% when it was too new. 
But now (in a tiny little degree) I seem to think I guess 
the way he went, and with what colossal triumph and 
shouting he really ought to be grccted ! 
Yes but that is casily produced her% that sense of 
immense success in his doings, and of a wildly inimitable 
and chall«nging example to us others; but for you it 
cannot be quite tl:e saine. A Ictter like this cannot, 
however light-leaded (a the moment) its writer really 
consist of nothing but a beating of the drums! And I do 
ask you to belicve that I most deep'.y sympathise with you  
most dceply and most easily in the loss of your dear 
brothcr and my fri«nd. No: in spire of those last two 
words, I am not going to be jcalous any longer! Only 
very sorry for you ail» and hoping most dcvoutly for your 
comfort.

leaving the salient months ago, a valley of any pronounced 
character still strikcs one as a glorious novelty. 
Well, we reached thc town. Throughout thc day I ruade 
the wineshop my depot (let me add hastily that it is a 
whoesale place !) for myparcels, and after making a fcw pur- 
chases I wcnt offto ste the cathedral. It stands wonder- 
fully well above the neighbouring bouses, and though it is 
hot like the Cathedral» it was quite cnough to make me 
catch my breath» on secing its two towers suddenly round 
the corner. Late Gothic» I suppos% but Gothic good and 
unmistakable: and the boast on the west door, ' Dilexi 
dccorcm Domus tuae' (dated J6z+» by the way), was worth 
making. 
There was a curious monument (I suppose to St.

mitrcd abbot, facing tl'.e congregation with so realistic an 
attitude that I could hot» for a moment, be sure that it was

commiseratingly by a girl with two little children. It was

imply a conscientious dread of the ccnsor (myself, rnainly) 
as a rather definite feeling that, for the time, it is rather 
good to have a change. And I bave had particularly good 
opportunities ofletting thc War alone for a week, for I bave 
been rnade to run a little cornmittee of three to look after 
garnes', i.e. a concert, football, cross-country running, 
and so forth ; and as this takes more rime than one might 
think we have been given a good dcal of tirne free from 
the hot very hurnorous parades which the Battalion bas 
while out at test. I don't as a mattcr of fact, excuse rny- 
self the early rnorning match (7.0-8.30, usually) because,

Itis truc that l've been asked occasionally, ' What is it 
that this lazy, mysterious Sports Committce docs ?" But 
tcll them that itis their jealousy and ignorance that makes 
them ask ! It's a bit like the Army, at first sight, to put 
»te into Association Football, but I suppose an Old Bluc is 
supposed to know something of how to start things of the 
kind : that is ont explanation. Anyway, let me claire that 
concert is being given to-night, and that out football 
ground is rather remarkably good. So is the team, btt 
we let thc Captain of thc side do all tlat, naturally, so the 
aforesaid ' L.M.S. Committee" claires no credit there. 
We beat the Trcnch Mortar Battery handsomely ycsterday. 
However, what I was saying was that a reaction bas 
rather set in, and for a week l've been rather cnjoying the 
different outlook. Of course the visit to the big town  
was a day to remember ; but there was an excursion to a 
smaller market-town, quite soon after we came here, which 
stood out at the rime as a day of wonder. Remember, I 
had not seen a shop for over thirty days ; and imagine 
what it was like to be confronted, aRcr a delightful ride 
with Heycocl, with two really standing strtets (no ruins), 
full of little shops where :Cou could buy civilised things 
like teacups, books (tbere were at least twenty, in ail, in 
the village ; twenty volumes I mean !), and even shirts, to 
say nothing of fruit and wine, etc. :but hot tobacco, 
except the French, which is rather hopelcss, though I once 
loved their cigarettes, 1 remember. 
They know how to make omelettes thcre, too, but that's 
by the way.... 
This is all very well, and of course the militarism must 
corne back, and corne quickly. If the whole Army said 
Now, Iet's be civilians', the Hun would bave a fine 
rime! But I tell myself that perhaps it doesn't do much

abandonment of my civilian lire with which I took the

been in for one dip in the Push»--you understand .... 
Well, this morning there was the real hungry» academic 
mist» that has marked the beginning of a new epoch every 
autumn these twenty odd years in my memory. Last time 
1 saw it begin would be somewhere near Ypres, 1 suppose. 
There were also some unusually good trees about (they 
look strang% somehow with their branches on); and there 
was a deal of dew» and I confess I ran a few hundred yards 
before I would consent to eat breakfast. Not much wind» 
nor your cattle, x here; but what Phiz will remember as 
«good birds' were eating placidly and rathcr enviably» in 
a way. And though we cannot exactly be said to be 
getting near a chance of fires--not the rires you mean any- 
way !--we can still remember that it is going to happen 
to you. Als% though I don't know how far this is due to 
the autumn air which came like an inspiration from heaven 
to-day we are beginning to think about books. The O.C. 
(Garton) and I hav% during the last week held a series of 
duets, wherein one says that the Army is a very stupefying 
concern and leads one's mind to an entirely vegetable stat% 
and the other says» « Yes» it's awful : we must do something 
about it'. Nothing very much has come of this yet» but 
we have ruade violent and curious resolutions; how we 
will read books during the winter» solid indigestible books 
into which one must get one's mental teeth, books with 
backs lettered» blue and important» books the very sight of 
which will restore our self-respect. Phi/osot, hy is all the 
talk in the proposais» and we mentioned Pragmatism the 
other day and I felt the Man's protest and warned myself»

DIARY 

uly zç, 96. 
If was July 13, noon» when 1 got Phiz's letter that the 
Man was missing ; July +» before I got a letter written in 
reply. It was hard» because I seemed incapable of what 
I called an attitude about ou,- Man ; it was a terribly 
egotistical efkbrt, that letter» but all 1 could do seemed to 
me tobe honest. Well» I could not feel the sort of mourn- 
t'ul triumph which is apt to associate itselfwith some losses 
--other people's especially (!); hot yet» anyhow. Nor 
was it any good, the other extreme--  A complete knock- 
out'. Nor when» as ] said»  I thought of many brave men» 
and told myself I must be very stout-hearted. The Man is 
dead: carry on.' For» at that» I me,'ely laughed at myself. 
Was it not all out of a book and quite insincere ? Or, I 
thought» with a great thrill of tears, as I paced that little 
garden near the , full ofevery summer scent that went 
so near the Man's heart» should I just write on a p. c. 
CCredo,? Rathcr good» had I dared ; yct I think» some- 
how, I would rather make that claire, the only one that 
really matters in this lire, after all» to myself than announce 
it as a fact (though I did suggest it to Phiz). 
I ara so tired now (it is July-..ç), that I cannot make 
out a recollectioa of »vhat else I said. But I rernember 
saying to Ronnie in a letter that the sort of physical etk0,-t 
of thrusting away unpleasant feelings (as over bad sights of 
war, for example) seemed to be making itself felt here, hall 
mechanically. One seems to treat ail feelings alike and 
push them, or rather try to .push them» aside ; and that, 
without regard to the true nature of the feelings in question. 



296 E.H.L.S. July 
And just because semi-physical, so this effort rires, 
doubtedly. I should add that both Phiz and Ronnie wrote 
wonderfil wondefful letters ; and that I think the answer to 
his promise in his closing sentence is not being withheld. 
Ah no: it is my last evening in this line (7.3o p.m. 
July zT): things may be going to happen. There cannot 
be any more faltcring over him. In God's great arithmeti G 
said I to my father in a recent lettcr, l ÷ I in sorrows do 
ot make .. Surely surely if all the world is not wrong, 
I mz/st think ç All's well with our Man', al:ter all. He 
knows too now I most deeply believ% he has round at last

my sorrows» of him reaching down to his faltering friend» 
»ot v:ithout many a prayer that I too, may somehow flud sight»

Wc led on quickly by the north gate and out at once, so 
as to avoid dawn on the Open Road. But it was daylight 
when we got up and out though the mist prevented any 
harm resulting from that. It was only about ç miles and 
as always always thank God I recovered completely and 
gloriously with the dawn. (Cf. the xS-mile route match 
at night on the Plain.*) So much so that I had to embark 
oa a needless and vehement row with K.P. over the 
breakfast question in the big billet. This was silly: but 
lcss so was the fact that I decided to get my own (and hOt 
make pcople cook) in the village. This I did in a little 
cottagc over the Scarpe but not belote I had a glorious 
little bathe in the river. I only took a short header and 
out-swim, owing to the long match ahead and the heat but

By now 1 had fairly reached 

"1o Grand Rullecourt. uly 
A day oftremendous heat. It was always hot, hot ; and 
strange thirst for most of the men, caused a good deal of 
discomfort and a few fall-outs. We had a long halt Ibr 
dinner somewhere near Hauteville in a field, and I dis- 
covered again the merits of the Army stew on a hot day. 
But we were all very distinctly tired when we reached 
G. R. ; I perhaps rather particularly after pulling by his 
rifle an actingcorporal, who had got rather done up by the 
heat. There, at last lay the old village of the snows, ail 
dusty in the sun ; and though we had hot time or energy 
to pilgrim to the old billet where Songer, Coulson lrving, 
Elliott and myself talked Browning and gramophone-music 
of an evening, yet we did hot forger to remember some 
good days when I had not yet, even once, lost the command 
of the Company. 

Candas : before going to Buire. 
By the Railvvay. lug. 7, 1916. 
There remains the high bank on which 1 lic behind the 
lines and a perfectly idle afternoon, on which to watch from 
it that kind of motion which is notoriously the most 
excitinghthe to and fio of heavy trains. One such has just 
gone by; sacred I think to the R.F.A., for most of the 
uncountable trucks lad one of those remarkable soldiers 
at least on board them, in various attitudes of repose. 
Repose, certainly ; though few but soldiers would find it so. 
In one there were men stretched gloriously asleep on the 
floor seen through the halopen door; while over them 
and nearly on them, stood their animais tethered and 



298 E.H.L.S. August 96 
patient, with the kind of silent wonder on their Faces which 
one is accustomcd to find in pictures of the Nativity. 
Repose, certainly, in the G.S. wagons, which, packed 
on the trucks, carried a gunner or two on tl:e front seat, 
exaltcd very high, and serene in air with cigarette and 
magazine. Repose, too, I devoutly hope, for the animals as 
well ; but eigbt borses to a wagon is a tight fit, I fear, and 
ruade no less so by the spurious label ' Moutons ', which 
ridiculously stands on their carriage wall. There: that 
train is gone, with its endlcss rows oftrucks, and its serene 
look of rest from the land of the ' Push'; and we are left 
witbout a train (a moving one, anyhow) to watcb. « We' 
are a goodly crowd for what is known as 'one tactical 
train ' 
We are hot at ail perturbed by the delay ; at least, I think 
hot: I know one officer who (after his manner) is loving 
it. Tbe rest of two Battalions are stretched belote me, 
about four deep among the rails, and I do hot think tley 
are in undue hurr)'. A R.F.C. car dashes up beyond the rails, 
and a D.R.L.S. (cyclist), or whatever he is, whizzes down 
the road behind my head. Aeroplanes, of course, corne (with 
their kind of coquettish curtsying, peculiar to tF, eir kind 
when infantry are about), to see the trains and their loads ; 
a Red Cross car flits in and out ofthe station ; Frenchmen 
wander down the line in shirt-sleeves and white trousers, or 
in a blue tunic and forage cap. 
But nowhere is there much of a burry, thank God. It is 
truc the guns are pelting away somewhere or other ; but 
nobody Cal-es. The sun shines over our shoulders, and it 
is the infantryman's da}, out. Every moment sees him, 
indeed, a thought more comfortable ; and as I write, he is 
aiready beginning to get his tea.

of Many Patient Men unsung. Small brooks and sluices 
amid the water-meadows, and their rceds like tongues 
of tire: and great rivers also, and big ships that ride 
them in the harbour. And Dust in carly spring, and 
the great white road swinging over the Dovns, and the 
lane that brings you to the fairies in thc loncly dinglc. 
13ach's Fugues also, and the sad songs of much infantry 
singing together. And bridges, whether over water or rail» 
especially if there is the sun dancing over ail. And grcen 
fields after London» but more» London after the wilderness. 
Old books and their fragrance and their cndlcss columns.

and Eon's fields under midsummer floods in boilingJune,
